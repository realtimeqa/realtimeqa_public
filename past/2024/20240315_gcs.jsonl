Tampons were replaced by sanitary towels because the latter are “attracting greater expenditure and are currently more representative of feminine hygiene products”, said the ONS.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Tampons and pads are the fifth most common product found in oceans, according to the European Commission.\n\nOn average a woman will dispose of 15,000 menstrual items during her lifetime that will end up in landfill, added The Times. Around 2.5 million tampons and 1.4 million pads are flushed down UK toilets every day – a figure that “doesn’t fit well with Gen Z’s priorities”, the paper said.\n\nAre there health concerns?\n\nYes. Researchers discovered “forever chemicals” in the lining of period underwear, the wrappers of tampons and in other menstrual products, The Washington Post reported. The chemicals can “accumulate in the body over time” and “have been implicated in a number of serious health effects, including some cancers”, it said.\n\n“The skin lining the vagina is one of the body’s most sensitive parts,” said The Times, “and chemicals can pass into the bloodstream without being metabolised.” Leaving a tampon in for too long be dangerous. It can lead to toxic shock syndrome, a bacterial infection that in severe cases can prove fatal.\n\nEarlier this month, a Californian model had both of her legs amputated after becoming gravely ill with toxic shock syndrome caused by a tampon, reported The Mirror. However, such cases are rare.\n\nWhat are the alternatives?\n\nThe Mooncup is a silicone device that is inserted into the vagina and can collect three times more blood than a tampon, said its British manufacturer. It should be rinsed with water after emptying it and put in boiled water between periods to sterilise it. “I would say that the biggest killer of the tampon is the menstrual cup,” Lisa Payne, head of beauty trends at the forecaster Stylus, told The Times.\n\nThere are also period pants, which are underwear with an absorbent lining that can go in the wash. Thanks to an absorbent black gusset “you don’t see red blood like you do on a pad”, a woman told The New York Times.\n\nHowever, noted the paper, period underwear is “not for everyone” because of the cost, which ranges from $12 to $38 in the US, depending on the brand. In the UK, a pack of three period pants at M&S costs £20. Prices could fall if campaigners convince the government to cut VAT on them.\n\nWhat about the price of tampons?\n\nQuestions were raised earlier this year over whether the removal of the so-called tampon tax – “trumpeted… by Rishi Sunak as one of the benefits of Brexit” – has “helped lower prices at all, amid concerns the saving is not being passed on by retailers to women”, said The Guardian.\n\nSupermarket own-brand period products increased in price by as much as 57% last year, according to research carried out by The Grocer. Asda put the price of its non-applicator tampons up from 70p to £1.10 in August 2022, the same price as Sainsbury’s own-label tampons (up from £1). As a comparison, a multi-use Mooncup costs about £24.\n\nAre there any innovations in tampons?\n\nThe tampon design, “a bullet-shaped cotton and rayon bundle”, has been “largely unchanged for almost 90 years”, said The Times. But now, the US has approved a new design that could “change the appearance of a product that’s looked the same for decades”, said The Guardian.\n\nThe design, patented by an independent company called Sequel, has “diagonal grooves that spiral down the product”. The makers say the product’s “helical shape better absorbs fluid”, which “leads to less leakage and a more reliable experience”.\n\nThe inventors believe that the new take on a familiar product could prove popular. “People don’t necessarily love their tampons”, they said. “They just have a system they’ve used since they first got their period.”\n\nBut ultimately “it all comes down to trust”, said The Times, “which, in the tampon’s case, could be hanging by a thread”.", "authors": ["Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Richard Windsor", "Harriet Marsden", "The Week Staff", "Grayson Quay", "Julia O'Driscoll"], "publish_date": "2023/08/18"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/uk-news/955313/soaring-inflation-cost-of-living-crunch", "title": "Soaring inflation: the cost of living crunch | The Week", "text": "Britain’s economic prospects were dire enough before “Putin’s murderous war”, said Will Hutton in The Observer – with rising infation, rocketing energy bills and new taxes to pay for Covid measures. “Now they are desperate.” Russia is the world’s largest exporter of gas and wheat, and one of the largest exporters of oil and sunfower oil. Ukraine is the world’s fifth largest exporter of wheat and the fourth largest of maize. Inevitably, the prices of all these commodities have “spiralled upwards”. Oil has already doubled over the year to $130 a barrel. Past oil hikes on this scale “have unfailingly triggered global recessions”. The cost of living will keep going up. Inflation is expected to top 9% by autumn. “Everything that might propel growth is being squeezed”: consumer spending, government spending, investment. “You have to go back 50 years” to the 1970s to see “every dial on the economic dashboard” flashing red in this way.\n\nThe effect on household costs will be drastic, said Rupert Harrison in the London Evening Standard. Two years ago, the average dual fuel energy bill was under £1,000 per year. The cheapest one-year x is now £4,000, and could easily go over £6,000. “These are incredible numbers”, on top of rising prices for “motoring, food and most other things you can think of”. Next week, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will give his spring statement mini-budget, said Robert Peston in The Spectator. It’s not clear that the Government “has quite yet grasped the scale of the economic challenge”. It has so far set aside £9bn to ease the pain of energy price rises; that represents a subsidy of just £350 per household. The current crisis is quite different from the impact of Covid, because that was temporary, whereas “the reconfiguration of the global economy forced by the invasion of Ukraine will be permanent”.\n\nThe danger is that Sunak will react with his usual brand of watered-down Thatcherism, said The Guardian. What he needs to do is protect household nances, particularly poorer families – with uprated benets, a raised minimum wage, and a windfall tax on oil companies to fund lower energy bills. The trouble is that increased government spending “is one of the main ways to fuel inflation”, said Robert Colvile in The Sunday Times. “That’s what happened in the 1970s.” He’d do far better to scrap next month’s planned national insurance rise, which will see taxpayers forking out an extra £12bn. Whatever he does, Sunak faces “an awful choice between compassion and prudence”. Short-term pain for households is better than “galloping inflation”.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber. Get the facts behind the news, plus analysis from multiple perspectives.

This year, doughnuts, men’s suits, coal and atlases are out, noted Lora Jones on BBC Business – replaced by sports bras, meat-free sausages, antibacterial wipes and pet collars. With inflation at its highest in 30 years, “the ONS’s methodology has come under extra scrutiny”. As analyst Myron Jobson of Interactive Investor points out, “climbing sessions”, another new addition, are “unlikely to rank highly on the list of spending priorities among those struggling to make ends meet”.\n\n“Forget number-crunching,” said Alistair Osborne in The Times. Fashion advice has long been “the key forte” of the ONS. “And once again, the wonks haven’t disappointed.” After 75 years, they’ve killed off men’s suits – reflecting a fall in sales from five million to two million a year over the past decade, according to Kantar, accelerated by “trackie-bottomed working from home”.\n\n“The death of the doughnut is no great loss,” said Nils Pratley in The Guardian – apparently these days we’re feasting on multi-packs of cakes. “But it’s hard to believe the men’s suit will go without a fight “once working-from-home effects fade”. Think of its return to the basket as an “unofficial marker of the economy’s recovery to post-Covid normality”. I give it 18 months.\n\nWheat production in Ukraine (Image credit: Alexander Reka/TASS via Getty Images)\n\nThe rising cost of everyday foods\n\nAs the war in Ukraine has intensified, its knock-on effects have become more apparent, said The Guardian. One of them is the disruption to the supply of wheat: Russia and Ukraine are responsible for around a quarter of the world’s wheat. This could spell catastrophe for countries in the Middle East and North Africa, where most of the grain from “Europe’s breadbasket” goes: Lebanon, for instance, imports half its wheat from Ukraine, and rationing is now being put in place there.\n\nThe UK grows 88% of its wheat; but disruption to trade (Ukraine has banned the export of wheat, maize, oats and other foods), added to spiralling energy costs, are having a serious impact on food prices here too. Shoppers can expect to pay more for everything from beef (fed on imported grain-based feeds) to tinned tomatoes (which will face higher transport costs). Then there is the rising cost of nitrogen fertiliser: not only is much of it imported from Russia, its price is being sent sky high owing to the escalating cost of gas. This could mean lower yields for UK farmers and higher prices for their crops. Food inflation is only set to get worse.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Adrienne Wyper", "The Week Uk", "Marc Shoffman", "William Falk", "Harold Maass", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/01/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/30/business/drug-stores-locked-products/index.html", "title": "Why Old Spice, Colgate and Dawn are locked up at drug stores ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThese days, it feels like many stores are fortresses.\n\nMost of the products on the drug store shelf are behind lock and key, even everyday items such as deodorant, toothpaste, candy, dish detergent, soap and aluminum foil. Manufacturers that supply lock cases and devices to chain stores have seen their businesses boom.\n\nWalgreens and Rite Aid have said that the problem of organized retail crime – rings of criminals that steal products from stores and then often resell them on online marketplaces – is causing them to lock more products up and close some stores.\n\nEven toothpaste is locked up these days. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nLocking up their shelves is a last resort for stores, but it has never been more widely practiced. It’s also become a growing irritation for shoppers and a source of frustration for some employees who must walk around the store with keys at the ready.\n\n“It’s extremely discouraging to customers,” said Paco Underhill, the founder of behavioral research and consulting firm Envirosell. “It is a brutal experience for the merchant, too.”\n\nThe reason why stores resort to locking up these products is simple: to prevent shoplifting. But these decisions are far more nuanced and fraught for stores than you may think. Companies must walk a delicate line between protecting their inventory and creating stores that customers don’t dread visiting.\n\nShoplifting in America\n\nUntil the early 20th century, locking up products was the norm. When customers visited a store, clerks would provide them with the items they wanted from behind a counter.\n\nThis changed as the first self-service stores like Piggly Wiggly in the early 20th century discovered they could sell more goods and reduce their costs by spreading out merchandise on an open sales floor.\n\nWhile having fewer workers in the store increased profits for chains in recent decades, it has left stores in some cases without as many visible personnel to deter shoplifting, crime prevention experts say.\n\nShoppers have become all too familiar with ringing a store worker to open a locked product. Lindsey Nicholson/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nShoplifting has been around for centuries, but it “came of age in America in 1965,” author Rachel Shteir writes in “The Steal: A Cultural History of Shoplifting.” The FBI in 1965 reported that it had jumped 93% in the prior five years and “was the nation’s fastest-growing form of larceny.”\n\nThree years later, officials around the country said there had been an additional surge in young teenagers shoplifting. The trend became part of the counterculture, as exemplified by Abbie Hoffman’s 1971 “Steal This Book.”\n\nIn response, an anti-shoplifting industry and corporate “loss prevention” (LP) and “asset protection” (AP) teams sprang up. Technologies also emerged such as closed-circuit TV cameras, electronic article surveillance and anti-theft tags.\n\n‘Hot products’\n\nStores look to protect “the vital few” products that are most profitable for them to sell, said Adrian Beck, who studies retail losses at the University of Leicester. And they’re willing to accept higher theft on the lower-margin “trivial many,” he added.\n\nShoplifters target smaller items with higher price tags, often called “hot products,” which typically are what retailers most frequently lock up. One criminologist created an apt acronym, CRAVED, to predict the stuff at highest risk: “concealable, removable, available, valuable, enjoyable, and disposable.”\n\nThe dreaded lock and key. Richard B. Levine/Levine Roberts/Newscom/ZUMA Press\n\nThe most commonly stolen items at US stores include cigarettes, health and beauty products, over-the-counter medications, contraceptives, liquor, teeth-whitening strips and other products.\n\nDrug stores have a higher proportion of the items that are “hot products,” so they have more stuff under lock and key than other retail formats, Beck said.\n\nOrganized retail crime\n\nThere is only so much that can be done to to stop shoplifting. Companies prohibit retail staff from physically trying to stop a shoplifter for their own safety and must find other ways to protect the merchandise.\n\nThese include measures such as security tags on items that set off alarms when someone walks out without paying. But this is less valuable than it used to be because alarms have become part of the general cacophony of store noise and often go ignored.\n\nStores also use strategies such as shelves that allow a customer to take only one item at a time. This helps prevent shoppers emptying an entire shelf of products.\n\nLocking up a product is the final step a retailer will take before removing it altogether, and stores say they are resorting to this measure more frequently as theft continues to increase.\n\nThere is no national database on shoplifting, which often goes under-reported, and stores and prosecutors rarely press charges.\n\nOver-the-counter medications like eye drops are a hot target for shoplifters. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nRetailers say organized retail crime has made their theft problems only worse. Crime gangs often look to steal products from stores that can easily and quickly be resold on online marketplaces such as Amazon and through illicit markets.\n\n“More products today are locked up because the problem has gotten so much bigger,” said Lisa LaBruno, the senior executive vice president of retail operations at the Retail Industry Leaders Association. “Criminal actors can steal high volumes of products and sell them with anonymity.”\n\nRetailers have supported a bipartisan bill that would require online marketplaces to verify state-issued IDs for millions of high-volume third-party sellers. President Joe Biden supports such a measure and this week also called on Congress to impose liability on online marketplaces that sell stolen goods on their platforms.\n\nAmazon said it does not allow third-party sellers to list stolen goods and works closely with law enforcement, retailers and other partners to stop bad actors.\n\n“We regularly request invoices, purchase orders, or other proofs of sourcing when we have concerns about how a seller may have obtained particular products,” a spokesperson said.\n\nIrritated customers and lost sales\n\nUnfortunately, many of these time-consuming anti-theft measures wind up irritating customers and cut into sales. One anti-theft device company’s CEO told Forbes that locked up stuff can result in sales reductions of 15% to 25%.\n\nShoppers today are more impatient. Some will walk out and buy the product on Amazon instead of hanging around for a worker.\n\n“You’re trying to be as frictionless for the customer but still prevent the loss,” said Mark Stinde, a former vice president of asset protection for Kroger and other large retailers. “You get a lot of pushback from operations and merchandising teams for locking stuff up.”\n\nStores are working on new ways to lock up products while reducing customer frustration, such as a new type of case that any employee can open with a smartphone. Other cases require shoppers to enter their phone number to open or scan a QR code.\n\n“Consumers understand why you have to lock up a fur coat or jewelry. But they say ‘why are we locking up deodorant?’” said Jack Trlica, co-founder of trade publication LP Magazine.\n\nTrlica expects companies will develop new technologies that protect products but don’t require flagging down an employee to unlock a shelf.\n\n“There’s going to be an evolution of security products,” he said.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this story incorrectly identified Paco Underhill as the current CEO of Envirosell.

Two-Buck Chuck. Simple Truth. Cat & Jack. Great Value. Amazon Basics. Store brands have never been more popular.\n\nThey have become forces in their own right and make up around 21% of sales in the $1.17 trillion US grocery industry, according to IRI.\n\nAs prices surge, store brands – also known as private labels, white labels or generic brands – have become an even more attractive option for inflation-fatigued shoppers who are looking to switch from pricier name brands. Store brands can be anywhere from 10% to 50% cheaper.\n\nBut the origins of store brands remain largely secretive.\n\nRetailers aren’t typically forthcoming about the companies that make their brands. And manufacturers, likewise, have little incentive to reveal that they’re creating similar products to their name brands under a different label sold on the cheap.\n\nMany leading national brand manufacturers create private labels for multiple retailers. In the late 1990s more than half of brand manufacturers were estimated to make private goods as well.\n\nTrader Joe's first private brand product in the 1970s was granola. As the grocer grew, it switched to mainly its own brands. Jeenah Moon/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nAlthough store brands ostensibly compete with manufacturers’ national brands, manufacturers often have excess capacity on their production lines. To generate additional profit, some will use that extra capacity to make private labels.\n\nOther brand manufacturers will produce private labels as an incentive for retailers, hoping they’ll be rewarded with better shelf space and placement for their own national labels.\n\n“Most manufacturers aren’t open about it,” said Jan-Benedict E.M. Steenkamp, a marketing professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private labels and branding. “Manufacturers don’t want it to be known because it undermines the power of their own brands.”\n\nBut there are some exceptions. Kimberly-Clark (KMB), the maker of Huggies diapers, produces Kirkland Signature diapers for Costco (COST)and Duracell produces Kirkland Signature batteries, Costco (COST)executives have said.\n\nGeorgia-Pacific, the maker of Brawny and Dixie, also produces store brands. So does Henkel (HENKY), the manufacturer of Purex and Dial.\n\nEight O’Clock Coffee and Kenmore\n\nStore labels have been around since the early days of retail and the emergence of consumer brands in the 19th century.\n\nMacy’s sold stoneware whiskey jugs under its own name. Customers could bring back the jugs for refills, according to Christopher Durham, the president of the Velocity Institute, a trade association for private brands.\n\nMontgomery Ward developed its own line of aspirin in wooden containers, while the Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. (aka A&P) sold branded spices with the slogan “Take the Grandmother’s Advice, Use A&P Spices.” A&P later developed Eight O’Clock Coffee, one of the most famous private labels of the period.\n\nEight O'Clock Coffee sold at The Great Atlantic And Pacific Tea Company (A&P) in 1949. Joe Scherschel/The LIFE Picture Collection/Shutterstock\n\nYet no US retailer was more successful developing its own brands than Sears, Roebuck.\n\nIn 1925, Sears created the Allstate brand for car tires. A few years later, Sears launched its first Craftsman wrench, according to Durham. Its Kenmore line, which started as a sewing machine brand in 1913 before branching into vacuums and other home appliances, became the leading home appliance brand in the United States.\n\nThese private labels were the exception, however.\n\nFor most of the 20th century, national brands such as Jell-O, H.J. Heinz, Campbell Soup (CPB) and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) had power over stores. These manufacturers flooded the airwaves and newspapers with advertisements extolling the advantages of their products.\n\nMost customers were fiercely loyal to specific brands, not retailers. A store that didn’t carry major labels would likely get crushed, which gave manufacturers immense leverage.\n\nAdditionally, many store brands were also considered dull, cheap knockoffs of national brands.\n\nThe low point of private label came during the 1970s, Durham said, when stores seeking to cut costs and rolled out generics with basic white backgrounds and black letters identifying the product – beer, soap, cola, beans and other staples.\n\nShopper loyalty\n\nRetailers make private label brands for a variety of reasons, including to boost profitability and sometimes as a negotiating tool against brands.\n\nPrivate brands often carry profit margins that are 20% to 40% higher than national brands because stores don’t have to pay the advertising, distribution or other markup costs that are embedded in major brands’ prices.\n\nGreat Value is Walmart's largest store brand. John Gress/Reuters\n\nIn the mid-20th century, many retailers started to develop their own labels to claw back bargaining power from dominant suppliers and keep their prices in check. As the US retail industry has consolidated in recent decades, the power dynamic between retailers and suppliers reversed. Now, stores have more leverage to introduce their own labels – whether name brands like it or not.\n\n“Forty years ago, Walmart pissing off P&G would be a risky situation. Now, Walmart is much bigger than P&G,” said Steenkamp, the marketing professor.\n\nToday, stores’ private brand operations are more sophisticated than ever and a much bigger focus for chains.\n\nStores are likelier these days to develop a distinctive private brand or product to stand out against competitors and create shopper loyalty, said Krishnakumar Davey, the president of client engagement at IRI.\n\nCostco (COST), for example, will decide to make a Kirkland Signature product because a leading brand won’t sell to the retailer. Or Costco (COST) believes the name brand’s prices have gotten too high and it can make its own similar-quality product and sell it for 20% less.\n\nCostco hasn’t lost any relationships with suppliers by launching its own Kirkland products, but those brands are not usually pleased when Costco introduces one, company CFO Richard Galanti said in an interview earlier this year.\n\nCostco generates nearly one-third of its sales from its Kirkland Signature label. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nRetailers have been sued for creating products that too closely resemble national brands. The owner of golf ball-brand Titleist sued Costco for patent infringement, while Williams-Sonoma (WSM) sued Amazon (AMZN) for selling “knockoffs” under its own brand. Both cases were settled.\n\nThe US House Judiciary Committee and other lawmakers and regulators around the world have investigated whether Amazon uses data from sellers to create its own brands and unlawfully favors its own brands on its website.\n\nAmazon has said it doesn’t use the data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brands and does not favor its own products on the site.\n\nMost stores start small with their own brands. Grocers, for example, will often first introduce a shelf-stable product like pasta, flour, sugar or rice that’s easier to make and where brand loyalty within the category isn’t strong.\n\n“You don’t start with the most difficult things,” Steenkamp said. “As stores build more experience and success, then they enter new categories.”\n\nHow to find out who makes store brands\n\nSo how do you tell who’s behind your favorite store brands?\n\nProduct recalls are often the most revealing way to find out which brand manufacturers are behind specific private labels.\n\nLast year, for example, Dole recalled fresh salads and vegetables, including private brands for Walmart, Kroger and H-E-B.\n\nJ.M. Smucker (SJM) recalled certain Jif peanut butter products this year, as well as store-branded items it made for Giant Eagle, Wawa and Safeway. Large companies such as Conagra and McCain Foods have recalled products from Trader Joe’s.\n\nThen there are the dedicated private label manufacturers, such as Treehouse Foods (THS), which makes snacks under the labels of supermarkets, big-box chains and other retailers. Nearly one-quarter of the company’s $4.3 billion in sales last year, for example, came from Walmart (WMT).\n\nTarget has dozens of its own brands, such as Cat & Jack, Universal Thread and up & up. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\nJames Walser, who led the launch of Target’s (TGT) up & up household basics and personal care brand in 2009, said that Target tried to move away from national brand manufacturers during up & up’s development to nimbler suppliers focused solely on making private labels.\n\nSome large retailers also make their own private labels. Kroger, for example, makes about 30% of its own private products.\n\nPerhaps the strangest store brand manufacturers are retailers that make private brands for their…competitors: Safeway-owned Lucerne Foods manufactures private labels for Safeway’s rivals.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the size of the US grocery industry. It is a $1.17 trillion industry, according to IRI.", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/18/business/dairy-farmers-food-inflation/index.html", "title": "Why you could be paying 50% more for a jug of milk this year | CNN ...", "text": "Prices are rising at the fastest pace in decades, creating a cost-of-living crisis that’s forcing people around the world to make tough choices about what to buy.\n\nThe United Kingdom is no exception: inflation hit a 40-year high of 9% in April and is forecast to peak above 10% toward the end of this year. The high cost of fuel and heating is just part of the problem. Food prices have also leaped, climbing nearly 7% compared with a year ago, according to data released Wednesday.\n\nA big part of the problem is the soaring price of dairy products. The cost of milk, cheese and eggs — supermarket staples — shot up 9.5% in the 12 months to April. The price of whole milk rose more than 12%.\n\nIn the United States, wholesale milk prices jumped 38% last month year-over-year, while the retail price of fresh whole milk was up 15%.\n\nThere could be more pain to come, according to a recent analysis by Kite Consulting, which specializes in the UK dairy industry. Between 2020 and 2021, a standard four-pint carton of milk cost between £1.10 ($1.36) and £1.20 ($1.49). This year, it could reach £1.70 ($2.11), the consultancy said. That would mark an increase of more than 50% from the bottom end of the range.\n\nWhy the dramatic spike? It partly comes down to supply and demand. Covid-19 drove up the price of many goods as lockdowns distorted global supply chains. This weighed on milk production, as farmers dealt with more expensive fertilizer and animal feed as well as new environmental rules. Meanwhile, the appetite for dairy products, especially in developing countries, grew during the recovery.\n\nThen came the invasion of Ukraine, which further scrambled access to products like wheat, fertilizer and fuel, hiking costs for dairy farmers once again.\n\n“The war is the thing that’s causing the major problem at present,” Kite Consulting managing partner John Allen said.\n\nA customer shops for food items inside a Tesco supermarket store in east London. Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe price of fertilizer\n\nOne of the biggest problems is the spiking price of nitrogen-based fertilizers, which are essential to dairy farming.\n\n“If you look at April 2022 compared to April 2021, you see fertilizer prices almost four times where they were before,” Robert Craig, who runs three dairy farms in northern England with about 1,500 cows.\n\nIf farmers cut back on how much fertilizer they use, they can’t grow enough grass to feed their cows while they graze. A recent lack of rain in England is making the problem even worse.\n\nJessica Langton, who helps run a family farm in Derbyshire with 100 cattle, is concerned.\n\n“We get the majority of our income from milk, so we need to be producing a large amount of grass to feed [cows] through the summer and the winter,” she said. Milk from her family’s farm is used to make cheddar cheese.\n\nLangton noted that a lot of other farms also rely on fertilizer to grow wheat, maize and barley to feed their cows. If they can’t produce enough, they could be forced to sell some of the herd, either to slaughter or to other dairy farmers.\n\nFertilizer prices were increasing before the invasion of Ukraine because of a spike in natural gas prices last year. Nitrogen-based fertilizers like urea and ammonium nitrate are produced from natural gas.\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine made matters worse. Russia and its ally Belarus are major exporters of fertilizer, but few buyers want to touch their supply now. An estimated 18% of the UK’s urea comes from Russia and 7% of its ammonium nitrate, according to Independent Commodity Intelligence Services.\n\n“Russia is such a big exporter of fertilizer, and they have so many sanctions,” said ICIS analyst Deepika Thapliyal. “That’s going to keep supply very tight.”\n\nThe price of fuel and animal feed\n\nEnergy prices aren’t just a factor in fertilizer production. Fuel is also essential to running a farm, where tractors and other machines can run for between 16 and 20 hours a day.\n\nLangton estimates that the cost of the diesel her family uses has more than doubled compared to last year.\n\nHeifers feed in a barn at a farm in Ashford, Kent. Dan Kitwood/Getty Images\n\nThe price of animal feed for cows, which supplements their diets, has surged, too. The UK’s National Farmers’ Union estimates that feed prices have climbed by 70% over the past two years.\n\nBefore the war, Russia and Ukraine accounted for more than a quarter of global wheat exports. But the disruption caused by Russia’s blockades at Ukrainian ports sent prices to an all-time high in March. They’ve since come down slightly but remain extremely elevated, rising again in recent days as India banned exports.\n\nWheat, along with maize and soy, serves as a benchmark for feed prices, Allen of Kite Consulting said.\n\nCraig, the farmer, said that Ukraine produces the “vast majority” of feed for organic dairy cows in the United Kingdom. Now, that product is practically inaccessible.\n\nHow it shakes out\n\nIt’s not a given that grocery stores will hike milk and other dairy prices in line with dramatic forecasts. Stores are wary of raising the price of essential items too much, lest they scare away customers.\n\n“Some retailers will be prepared to take a much lower margin, if not potentially small losses, [to] make [sure] people come through the door,” said Tom Holder, a spokesperson for the British Retail Consortium. “No one wants to go to the supermarket that has the high-priced milk.”\n\nBut farmers like Langton and Craig worry that the dynamics hurting their businesses aren’t going away. Many have to contend with rising labor and transportation costs, too.\n\n“There’s literally nobody to employ. You advertise jobs and there’s very little response,” said Craig. Two of his farms produce milk for cheese. Milk from the third farm is dried and used in a cappuccino mix made by Nestlé (NSRGY).\n\nKite Consulting estimates that total costs of production for dairy farmers will rise by 29% from 2021 to early 2023. Government subsidies, meanwhile, are dropping, making it even harder to break even.\n\n“If we don’t see the milk price increasing alongside hyperinflation, we could see a lot of dairy farms exiting the industry across the UK,” Langton said, referring to the price at which her family can sell its milk to processors.\n\nRising food costs will hit poorer households the hardest. About a quarter of Britons have already skipped meals in response to the cost-of-living crisis, according to a survey published by Ipsos this week. That number rises to one in three for people with lower incomes.\n\nDavid Beasley, head of the United Nations World Food Programme, has warned that rising food prices will cause social unrest in some parts of the world.\n\nAs prices are pushed higher to help farmers stay in business, demand is expected to begin to fall off, allowing the market to rebalance itself. But when that moment will arrive remains an anxiety-inducing unknown.\n\n“I don’t think it’s too expensive yet,” Kite Consulting’s Allen said.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/05/18"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/24/economy/biden-student-loan-debt-plan-economy/index.html", "title": "What Biden's student debt plan will do to the US economy | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s student loan plan is a potential game changer for Americans drowning in debt. And yet the impact on the economy at large is likely to be so tiny that it will be hard to measure.\n\nBiden announced Wednesday that his administration will forgive $10,000 for borrowers who make less than $125,000 per year. Low-income borrowers who went to college on Pell Grants will receive up to $20,000 in student loan forgiveness.\n\nThis debt relief will give tens of millions of borrowers some breathing room at a time when the cost of living has skyrocketed.\n\nCritically, the cancellation of student debt is being paired with a plan to lift the freeze on federal student debt payments, beginning in January 2023. That means many Americans who haven’t had to pay down student loans since March 2020 will have to begin doing so, eating into their cash flows.\n\nDespite fears that Biden’s student debt relief will fuel already-crippling inflation, economists say the combined impact will be minimal on the economy at large.\n\n“The end of the moratorium will weigh on growth and inflation, while the debt forgiveness will support growth and inflation,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi told CNN. “The net of these cross-currents is largely a wash.”\n\nMoody’s estimates that the combined impact will reduce real GDP in 2023 by 0.05 percentage points, drive down unemployment by 0.02 percentage points and cut inflation by 0.03 percentage points. In other words, a very tiny effect.\n\n“We’re not talking about raising or lowering inflation by a percentage point or even a half a percentage point. We’re talking about a really small impact,” Dean Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, told CNN in a phone interview. “But for individuals this makes a big difference. It wipes out more than half the debt for more than half the borrowers. That’s a big deal.”\n\nTens of millions of borrowers impacted\n\nThe typical undergraduate student with loans graduates with nearly $25,000 in debt, according to a Department of Education analysis cited by the White House.\n\nUp to 43 million borrowers will receive relief from Biden’s student debt plan, including eliminating the full remaining balance for about 20 million borrowers, according to the White House.\n\nThe inflationary impact would have been larger if Biden did not impose an income threshold on the debt relief or if he heeded calls from some progressives to wipe out $50,000 in student debt.\n\nBaker praised Biden’s plan as a “good compromise” that avoided going to extremes.\n\n“It’s helping people out, but not giving away the store,” he said.\n\nSome groups, including the NAACP, argue Biden’s debt relief doesn’t go far enough given the mountain of student debt in America.\n\n“Canceling just $10,000 of debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire,” NAACP leaders wrote in a CNN Business opinion piece.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Biden forgave $10K in student debt. People flooded TikTok with their reactions 02:08 - Source: CNN\n\nA $300 billion price tag\n\nOf course, there is a cost to canceling student debt. And that cost will be picked up by taxpayers just when deficit reduction had suddenly become a bipartisan trend in Washington.\n\nA one-time cancellation of $10,000 for each borrower earning less than $125,000 will cost the government approximately $300 billion, according to an estimate this week from the Penn Wharton Budget Model. (The Penn Wharton model did not include the cost of wiping out up to $20,000 in student debt for Pell Grant recipients).\n\nAlthough $300 billion isn’t massive for a $25 trillion economy, the cost of the student debt forgiveness would cancel out the projected federal budget deficit savings from the just-passed Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n“All the deficit reduction will be wiped out,” Marc Goldwein, senior vice president and senior policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told CNN’s Poppy Harlow.\n\nNote that the White House has hailed the deficit reduction aspect of the Inflation Reduction Act as an important inflation-fighting measure. And this marked a significant shift after years of both parties adding to America’s mountain of debt to fight the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nEven Jason Furman, head of the Council of Economic Advisers for former President Barack Obama, has doubts about Biden’s plan.\n\n“Pouring roughly half trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless,” Furman tweeted. “Doing it while going well beyond one campaign promise ($10K of student loan relief) and breaking another (all proposals paid for) is even worse.”\n\nStill, said Zandi of Moody’s, this is a “big positive deal for probably close to 40 million, mostly lower and middle income, Americans, but [a] small negative deal for all American taxpayers.”\n\n‘Sends the wrong message’\n\nBeyond the economic impact, Biden’s plan has sparked questions about fairness because it only helps people who were fortunate enough to go to college.\n\nRep. Tim Ryan, the Ohio Senate Democratic nominee, said Biden’s decision on student debt “sends the wrong message to the millions of Ohioans without a degree working just as hard to make ends meet.”\n\n“Instead of forgiving student loans for six-figure earners, we should be working to level the playing field for all Americans,” Ryan said.\n\nCiting a Department of Education analysis, the White House said nearly 90% of relief dollars will go to those earning less than $75,000.\n\nThe student debt forgiveness comes too late for borrowers who worked for years to pay off their loans, only to now see others have their debt wiped away.\n\n“I take that very seriously,” Baker said of the fairness concerns. “We’re relieving $10,000, not $50,000 or $100,000. That’s why $10,000 is a good number.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'Give me an f-ing break': Commentators debate Biden's student debt forgiveness plan 01:53 - Source: CNN\n\nThe real problem continues\n\nNo matter the amount, wiping out student loan debt doesn’t address the underlying problem: College tuition is way too expensive.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2021, the cost of college tuition increased at more than twice the pace of overall inflation, according to Moody’s Analytics. That’s despite a slowdown in tuition hikes during Covid.\n\nThe basket of goods measured in the Consumer Price Index cost 57% more in 2021 than it did in 2000, while the cost of college tuition soared by 167%, Moody’s said.\n\nIt’s hard to see how eliminating a chunk of student debt solves that issue. And some, including former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, have warned debt relief could also help raise tuitions.\n\n“Costs are out of control.

But countries thousands of miles away are reeling from its hardball campaign to strangle inflation, as their central banks are forced to hike interest rates faster and higher and a runaway dollar pushes down the value of their currencies.\n\n“We’re seeing the Fed being as aggressive as it has been since the early 1980s. They’re willing to tolerate higher unemployment and a recession,” said Chris Turner, global head of markets at ING. “That’s not good for international growth.”\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s decision to raise rates by three-quarters of a percentage point at three consecutive meetings, while signaling more large hikes are on the way, has pushed its counterparts around the world to get tougher, too. If they fall too far behind the Fed, investors could pull money from their financial markets, causing serious disruptions.\n\nCentral banks in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Norway, Indonesia, South Africa, Taiwan, Nigeria and the Philippines followed the Fed in boosting rates over the past week.\n\nThe Fed’s stance has also pushed the dollar to two-decade highs against a basket of major currencies. While that’s helpful for Americans who want to go shopping abroad, it’s very bad news for other countries, as the value of the yuan, the yen, the rupee, the euro and the pound tumble, making it more expensive to import essential items like food and fuel. This dynamic — in which the Fed essentially exports inflation — adds pressure on local central banks.\n\n“The dollar doesn’t strengthen in isolation. It has to strengthen against something,” said James Ashley, head of international market strategy at Goldman Sachs Asset Management.\n\nThe punishing consequences of the rapid appreciation of the dollar have become clearer in recent days. Japan intervened last Thursday for the first time in 24 years to shore up the yen, which has plunged 26% against the dollar year-to-date. (The Bank of Japan has remained an outlier among major central banks and has resisted hiking rates despite an uptick in inflation.)\n\nChina is watching currency markets after the yuan trading onshore slid to its lowest level against the dollar since the global financial crisis, while European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned Monday that the euro’s sharp depreciation has “added to the build-up of inflationary pressures.”\n\nThe United Kingdom shows just how quickly the situation can spiral out of control as global investors choked on a new government’s economic growth plan. The British pound fell to a record low against the dollar on Monday after the unorthodox experiment of implementing large tax cuts while boosting borrowing triggered alarm.\n\nThe ensuing chaos forced the Bank of England to announce an emergency bond-buying program to try to stabilize markets, and led to an admonishment from the International Monetary Fund, which said the UK government should reconsider its proposals.\n\nThe global financial system is “like a pressure cooker” right now, Turner said. “You need to have strong, credible policies, and any policy missteps are punished.”\n\nThe threat to emerging markets\n\nThe World Bank recently cautioned that the risk of a global recession in 2023 has risen as central banks across the world hike interest rates at the same time in response to inflation. It also said the trend could result in a series of financial crises among developing economies — many still reeling from the pandemic — “that would do them lasting harm.”\n\nThe biggest fallout may be felt in countries that have issued debt denominated in dollars. Paying back those obligations becomes more expensive as local currencies depreciate, forcing governments to cut back spending in other areas just as inflation savages living standards.\n\nWaning currency reserves is also cause for concern. A shortage of dollars in Sri Lanka has contributed to the worst economic crisis in the country’s history and forced its president out of office earlier this year.\n\nThe risks are laid bare by the size of interest rate hikes in many of these countries. Brazil, for example, kept interest rates steady this month, but only after 12 consecutive increases that left its benchmark rate at 13.75%.\n\nNigeria’s central bank hiked rates to 15.5% on Tuesday, much higher than economists had expected. In a statement, the central bank noted that “ongoing monetary policy tightening by the US Federal Reserve Bank is also putting upward pressure on local currencies across the world, with pass-through to domestic prices.”\n\nCan the pain be stopped?\n\nThe last time the dollar went on a similar tear, in the early 1980s, policymakers in the United States, Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom announced a coordinated intervention in currency markets that became known as the Plaza Accord.\n\nThe dollar’s recent rally, and the ensuing pain it’s caused for other countries, has sparked chatter that it may be time for another agreement. But the White House has thrown cold water on the idea, which makes it look unlikely for now.\n\n“I don’t anticipate that that’s where we’re headed,” Brian Deese, the director of the National Economic Council, said Tuesday.\n\nIn the meantime, the Federal Reserve is expected to stay the course. That means the dollar could yet climb further, and other central banks won’t be able to relax.\n\nAdditional dollar strength and higher US rates is “absolutely something that we should be anticipating, and the consequences of that are really quite profound,” Ashley of Goldman Sachs Asset Management said.", "authors": ["Julia Horowitz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/13/business/gap-history-old-navy-retail/index.html", "title": "What the heck happened to the Gap? | CNN Business", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIn 1969, real estate investor Don Fisher opened a store in San Francisco aimed at teens and college kids, offering Levi’s blue jeans alongside records and tapes.\n\nFisher planned to call the store Pants and Discs, but his wife Doris came up with the winning name: “The Gap,” shorthand for generation gap.\n\nThe Gap capitalized on the rise of denim as the go-to look for a generation of young Americans and then expanded into khakis, t-shirts, tops, hoodies and other basics. The brand won over everyone from moms to office workers to celebrities like Sharon Stone, who wore a black Valentino skirt and a $26 mock Gap turtleneck to the Academy Awards in 1996.\n\nAt the time it was a symbol of cool and casual style. “As ubiquitous as McDonald’s, as centrally managed as the former Soviet Union and as American as Mickey Mouse, the Gap Inc. has you covered, from the cradle to the grave,” the New York Times said in 1992.\n\nBut sales at the flagship Gap brand have slumped for years and it has become an afterthought for many American shoppers. The company’s other brands, including Old Navy and Banana Republic, have also struggled.\n\nOn Monday, the company announced CEO Sonia Syngal would step down after less than three years. She will be replaced by an interim CEO while the company searches for a permanent leader.\n\nHere’s what the next CEO will fall into at Gap (GPS).\n\nOver-expansion and competition\n\nThe Gap rode the expansion of suburban malls in the 1980s and 1990s, becoming one of the largest mall stores in the United States. So its fortunes have largely been tied to those of malls — great news in the ’90s, but awful news now. Malls have been rapidly losing customers to online shopping and big-box stores.\n\nGap said in 2020 that it would close 30% of its Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America by 2024 — mostly in malls.\n\nOver the decades since the mall-store heyday, Gap fell out of touch with Baby Boomers who grew up on the brand and failed to attract Gen Z and Millennials who drive fashion trends today, analysts say.\n\nAt the same time, brands and retailers such as Levi, Target (TGT) and fast-fashion sellers H&M and Zara lured away the Gap’s denim shoppers. Direct-to-consumer brands online have also chipped away at the Gap’s audience.\n\nThe Gap is a long way from its heyday. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images\n\n“When they were great, there just wasn’t the ecosystem of smaller, niche players,” said Ken Pilot, a former president of Gap and a longtime executive at the company. “Gap was competing against department stores and killing them.”\n\nGap also cannibalized its own brand with similar styles at Old Navy and Banana Republic, he added: “It was smart the way they built out their portfolio, but even those created its own form of competition to the Gap brand.”\n\nGap has tried several strategies to revitalize its flagship brand, including a partnership with Kanye West for a line of Yeezy-branded clothing. But the partnership hasn’t meaningfully lifted sales.\n\nIts initiatives “have been piecemeal rather than part of a coherent grand plan of reinvigoration,” Neil Saunders, an analyst at GlobalData Retail, said in a note to clients Monday.\n\nWhat’s more, the flagship brand is increasingly less significant to the company. Old Navy and Athleta are its future: Combined, they will represent about 70% of Gap’s total sales by 2023, the company says.\n\nLeadership missteps\n\nWhoever becomes Gap’s new leader won’t be the first of its CEOs to face challenges.\n\nMickey Drexler, known as the “merchant prince,” was the person who built Gap into a powerhouse during the 1990s. First the president of the Gap division and later CEO of the company beginning in 1995, Drexler pushed Gap to expand beyond jeans into khakis and oversaw the creation of budget-chain Old Navy in 1994.\n\nBut it was also during Drexler’s tenure Gap lost its connection to its core customers. It suffered 24 straight quarters of same-store sales declines toward the end of his reign, and he stepped down in 2002.\n\nThe company then rotated through several CEOs, including former Disney (DIS) executive Paul Pressler, drugstore executive Glenn Murphy and Gap veteran Art Peck. Sonia Syngal took over from Peck in 2020.\n\n“The Gap’s failure is all about its lack of leadership,” said Mark Cohen, the director of retail studies at Columbia University’s business school. “They had a brilliant period of growth and popularity, which they frittered away.”\n\nMore recently, Gap attempted to spin off Old Navy, which is now the company’s largest brand. But it reversed course in 2020 after sales dropped off.\n\nSince then, Old Navy has continued to struggle, including with a failed attempt to revamp sizing to make it more inclusive. The move initially won praise, but the brand ended up carrying too many extra-small and extra-large items and not enough of its more popular middle sizes. In May, Old Navy said it would dial back this strategy.\n\nOld Navy’s “challenges are taking much longer than expected to fix,” said Susan Anderson, an analyst at B.

But the worst may be over ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nTarget just demonstrated how quickly things can change in the world of retail, posting a terrible quarter after nearly two years of soaring profits and record revenue growth. But the big box retailer is promising things will change in the other direction just as fast.\n\nTarget was widely seen as one of the winners of the pandemic, gaining new customers as shoppers not wanting to go into brick-and-mortar stores were drawn to its growing curbside pickup and home delivery.\n\nBut after a disappointing fiscal first quarter when profits fell 40%, Target just had an even worse second quarter. Profits plunged 90% compared to a year earlier.\n\nInflation-weary shoppers shifted to buying essentials such as food and gas rather than “nonessential” general merchandise that is central to Target’s sales and profits. It was a stark contrast to larger rival Walmart (WMT), which posted only a narrow drop in profits for the quarter.\n\nBut many analysts believe Target is still in good position going forward, that it’s not at risk of joining some of the other pandemic winners who are now struggling, like online retailer Wayfair (W). Friday it announced it had to cut 5% of the staff due to expanding too fast during the good times.\n\nTarget’s profit plunge came from the deep discounts it had to offer on much of its general merchandise, such as clothing, electronics and home goods. The hit to earnings from such deep discounting was unavoidable. But company executives insist it was the right choice.\n\n“Consider the alternative: we could have held on to excess inventory and attempted to deal with it slowly, over multiple quarters or even years. While that might have reduced the near-term financial impact, it would have held back our business over time,” said CEO Brian Cornell to investors. “The vast majority of the financial impact of these inventory actions is now behind us.” He predicts a meaningful improvement in operating margin rates in the fall season.\n\nMany analysts agree that Target did the right thing taking the hit. Several say the sudden shift in consumer buying habits was not the fault of miscalculation by management.\n\n“All last year the supply chain was very, very tight. Stores were out of stock of many items. They were ordering for a level of demand that was very reasonable,” said Bobby Griffin, retail analyst at Raymond James. “Then there was a very fast change in consumer behavior.”\n\nDiscretionary purchases being made by consumers shifted away from goods to things like travel, Griffin said.\n\nOther experts say that Target management wasn’t quite blameless for being caught with too much of the wrong inventory.\n\n“My sense is that this [problem at Target] was 70% about consumer behavior and 30% miscalculation related to inventory,” said Eric Schiffer, chief investment officer of Los Angeles-based private equity firm, The Patriarch Organization.\n\nThere is some hope for all retailers that they could benefit from the large, steady decline in gas prices over the last two months.\n\nThe national average price of gasoline has dropped $1.11, or 22% to $3.91 since hitting a record of $5.02 on June 14. It has fallen every day since. That should save households $100 a month on average. And wholesale gasoline futures point to even lower gas prices ahead in the coming weeks and months.\n\nTarget was always going to have more problems with a sudden shift in consumer spending than Walmart. Walmart has more than half of its sales from grocery while Target is closer to 20% said Owen Chen, retail analyst at Cowen. Walmart also had to offer sales on its nonessential general merchandise in the quarter.\n\nAnd Walmart has always competed more on low prices, an advantage at a time that even middle and higher income shoppers are concerned about higher prices. Walmart executives reported it saw more business from those upper income households in the most recent quarter, a statement that cheered its investors.\n\nBut Chen said the numbers indicate that they did not get those higher income shoppers from Target’s traditional customers.\n\n“I think that Target’s [store] traffic numbers show it did a good job holding onto their customers,” he said. The number of customers making purchases at Target was up 2.7% compared to a year ago in the just-completed quarter. And that’s more than a 20% increase since the same period of 2019, ahead of the pandemic.\n\nTarget shares have underperformed some of its rivals, falling 28% so far this year, compared to only a 5% decline at Walmart. Schiffer said he wouldn’t be surprised to see the slide in Target shares continue, as he believes they are overvalued by as much as 30%. But he doesn’t think that means Target is badly positioned for the future.\n\n“I would stay the course,” he said. “The pace of growth during the pandemic was never going to be sustainable.

People can’t get enough of the in-between.\n\nBig companies report that snack sales are soaring. Net sales of Doritos, Cheetos, Ruffles, PopCorners, Smartfood and SunChips grew by double digits in the second quarter. Retail sales of Pirate’s Booty jumped about 32% and SkinnyPop sales increased about 17%.\n\nThat’s partially because snacks are getting more expensive, and because people are getting back to their lives outside the home and want food they can eat on the go.\n\nBut it’s not just that. Eating habits have changed, and people are increasingly snacking instead of eating traditional meals. About 64% of consumers across the world said that they prefer to eat several small meals throughout the day, rather than a few large ones, according to a 2021 snacking survey by Mondelez (MDLZ). That’s up from 59% in 2019. About 62% reported replacing at least one meal a day with snacks.\n\nAmerica’s eating habits have always changed with the times. The Industrial Revolution ushered in the three-meals-a-day template. Packaging innovations at the dawn of the 20th century introduced snacks to the mainstream. Massive supermarkets gave consumers a seemingly endless array of bright, shiny items to choose from.\n\nAnd during the pandemic, the major shift in how millions of Americans work opened up new snacking categories — that’s good news for snack sellers, but not for our health.\n\nThe US snack market has been growing over the past several years, and is expected to expand further. David Paul Morris/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nThe US snack market grew from about $116.6 billion in 2017 to an estimated $150.6 billion in 2022, and is forecasted to grow to $169.6 billion in 2027, according to Euromonitor International, which includes fruit snacks, ice cream, biscuits, snack bars, candy and savory snacks in the category.\n\n“Snacking today, it is pervasive,” said Sally Lyons Wyatt, executive vice president at the market research company IRI. “It’s a lifestyle.”\n\nNot until recently, though.\n\nFrom three square meals to snacks whenever\n\nIt may be the norm today, but historically, eating three meals a day was “certainly not standard,” said Ashley Rose Young, a food historian at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. The practice came into vogue in the United States thanks to the Industrial Revolution, when factory schedules dictated workers’ eating patterns.\n\n“You would want to have a meal prior to heading to work to fuel you through the day,” said Young. Then “there would be a midday break, to refuel your energy … and then a post-work meal.”\n\nAs meals grew standardized in the United States, new rules around eating emerged — and with them, new attitudes toward snacking.\n\nA peanut stand on West 42nd Street in New York City, circa 1905. Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty Images\n\nIn the 19th century, snacks like peanuts were sold by street vendors, and stigmatized for being associated with the working class and poor, Abigail Carroll explained in “Three Squares,” her 2013 book about American snacking and eating habits. “When meals — especially dinner — became more social, more mannerly, and more rigidly defined, snacking became transgressive,” she wrote.\n\nBut food sellers saw a business opportunity in snacks — if they could figure out a way to get them off the streets and into the home. To do that, they needed better packaging, something that would seal an item and keep it fresh.\n\nEventually, one set of entrepreneurs cracked the code, kicking the door open for the rest of the industry. Their product? Cracker Jack.\n\nSnacks hit the mainstream\n\nFrederick and Louis Rueckheim, German brothers who lived in Chicago, developed the sweet popcorn and peanut snack. In 1896, they traveled with it from city to city sharing samples and spreading the word about the product, Carroll recounted. To keep Cracker Jack fresh longer, they worked with a man named Henry Eckstein, who developed a special wax lining for the bags it was sold in. In following years, companies like Nabisco and Kellogg built on that technology or adapted it for their own items, kicking the door open for others.\n\nCracker Jack's innovative packaging helped usher in a new era for snacks. Gene J. Puskar/AP\n\nOver the years, other shifts in American culture and technology made snacking on-the-go even more attractive, noted Young, the food historian.\n\nMicrowaves, first introduced in 1955, allowed for a whole new type of packaged foods. And after World War II, more people started buying their groceries from mass retailers, rather than their neighborhood green grocer. “You have these huge supermarkets with shelves and shelves full of boxed snacks,” Young said, which contributed to the country’s snacking culture.\n\nAnd once millennials started shopping for themselves, the trend accelerated further.\n\nSnacking today\n\nBoomers and Gen Xers tend to indulge in a snack in the afternoon or evening, said IRI’s Wyatt, who has been tracking snacking trends for decades. Millennials, however, also snack in the morning.\n\n“Millennials really did start to change the way in which [people] eat,” said Wyatt. “You definitely started to see smaller meals and or snacks … being consumed throughout the day,” she said.\n\nThen the pandemic hit, and another shift occurred, Wyatt noted: People started eating more late-night snacks.\n\nThat was partly because of how people spent their days during the pandemic. With kids stuck at home during traditional working hours, some parents put in more work hours at night and reach for snacks to refuel. Others developed new routines that included staying up later.\n\nThe option of a late-night treat without having to leave your home became newly available thanks to the sudden proliferation of 15-minute delivery services, which encouraged people to order an item or two when they had a sudden craving.\n\nNow, as people return to the office and a more regular work schedule, they may be less interested in late-night snacking. But food sellers will likely keep trying to market food for that timeframe. “I don’t think they’re going to fall off and not be relevant,” said Wyatt.\n\nNot all snacks are the same\n\nSo what does all this snacking mean for our health? It depends on what you consider a snack.\n\n“Those who are picking whole fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, lean protein sources, or are conscious of the portion size of their snack — it can sometimes help them meet certain recommendations and guidelines,” said Jessica Bihuniak, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the NYU Steinhardt School of Culture, Education and Human Development.\n\nBut other items, like candy, soda or chips, with saturated fats, high sodium levels and added sugars, can create unhealthy habits. “Regular intake” of these types of items “can increase a preference for these types of foods, leading to a change in eating behaviors and diet quality,” according to the Harvard School of Public Health’s Nutrition Source, the school’s general guide to healthy eating.\n\nLooking at ingredients and nutirtional information can help consumers understand what, exactly, is in their snack. Lewis Geyer/Digital First Media/Boulder Daily Camera/Getty Images\n\nSnack sellers offer so-called “better for you” options, which may have less sugar or come in smaller packs for portion control. For some, such alternatives can be very helpful when it comes to weight management, said Bihuniak, noting that people should be mindful of serving sizes because smaller packages may still have more than one serving.\n\nWhen it comes to shelf-stable packaged goods — even those that claim that they’re better for you — consumers should read the nutritional information on the packages.\n\n“They did something to it to make it shelf stable,” Bihuniak said. “The important part there is looking at food labels,” she said, and watching out for sodium content, added content and saturated fat. Your healthiest option, she said, is probably something that doesn’t come in a package at all, like a piece of fruit or a crunchy veggie.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that recent studies have found that all ultra-processed foods are linked to cancer and early death.\n\nIt’s less clear whether when or how often you eat matters. For some, it’s just easier to snack rather than carve out time for sit-down meals, Bihuniak said. But as long as you’re making the right food choices, “I think that’s completely fine.”\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misspelled Sally Lyons Wyatt's last name.", "authors": ["Danielle Wiener-Bronner"], "publish_date": "2022/09/03"}]}

Regional watchers warn that the popularity of Bukele’s policy could see copycat measures in the region, with other countries in Latin America already enforcing similar extra-legal measures to tackle their own gang problems.\n\nAnd as Jonathan D. Rosen, an assistant professor at New Jersey City University, who has co-authored several books on organized crime, drug trafficking and security in the Americas, points out, history has shown that mano dura policies have a way of biting back.\n\n‘A perfect recipe for abuse’\n\nEl Salvador is home to some of the world’s most notorious gangs, including Barrio 18 and MS-13. The latter emerged in Los Angeles in the 1980s among Salvadoran immigrants who had fled their homeland amid a violent civil war funded in part by the United States. It grew to include other Central American migrants, and in the 1990s, many were deported to their home countries, causing an explosion of violence there, say experts.\n\nBefore Bukele’s crackdown, an estimated 70,000 active gang members across the country made it “virtually impossible for politicians and state officials to avoid engaging with them if they wish to, among other things, carry out an election campaign or provide services in poor neighborhoods,” according to a report by the Crisis Group.\n\nA police officer questions a young man during a security operation against gang violence in Soyapango, just east of the capital San Salvador, on August 16, 2022. Sthanly Estrada/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut rights groups fear the effort to root them out has taken a toll of its own, resulting in the arrest of 58,000 people between March and November 2022, overstuffed jails, and the militarization of Salvadorean society as forces patrol the streets.\n\nWidespread human rights violations have allegedly followed Bukele’s dragnet – torture and ill treatment in detention, and arbitrary arrests as the police and army target low-income neighborhoods, according to a HRW report released on December 7.\n\nMany of the arrests in the past year appear to be based on questionable evidence, such as the person’s appearance, background or anonymous tip-offs “and uncorroborated allegations on social media,” HRW writes.\n\nOn December 3, Bukele’s war on gangs escalated when security forces “completely fenced off” the country’s most populous municipality, Soyapango, as he described in a Twitter post. Bukele also shared a video showing gun-toting troops marching in the area.\n\nJuan Pappier, a senior Americas researcher at Human Rights Watch (HRW), told CNN that the authoritarian measures in Soyapango constituted “a perfect recipe for abuse,” impeding on people’s freedom of movement.\n\n“There’s a trend in Latin America, of believing that in order to address very serious security concerns you need to suspend rights,” Pappier told CNN.\n\nPappier points to the example of Chile, which has had an extended state of emergency in response to violence in the country’s south, which was extended for a month in late November, and Ecuador, where the government announced similar measures in response to gang violence in prisons in November.\n\nEcudaor announced a state of emergency in response to gang violence in prisons. Juan Carlos Perez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn recent weeks, Honduras’ leftist leader Xiomara Castro, who ran for government on a human rights platform, launched a month-long partial state of emergency amid outcry against extortion levels, suspending constitutional rights in certain regions as she cracks down on criminal groups.\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Jamaica – which has one of the highest murder rates in the Caribbean (per 100,000 people) – declared a widespread state of emergency on Tuesday, which allows security forces to arrest people and search buildings without warrants.\n\nWhen mano dura backfires\n\nPrevious Salvadoran governments have tried to tackle gangs with similar strategies only to worsen the outcome.\n\nFormer President Antonio Saca – who pleaded guilty in 2018 of embezzling $300 million in public funds – unveiled a plan known as “super mano dura,” where analysts say mass imprisonment led to gangs consolidating their power behind bars.\n\n“The deployment of the military and police to combat gangs resulted in the gangs fighting not only with each other but also with the government. In 2015, El Salvador surpassed Honduras as the most violent country in the world, with a murder rate of more than 100 per 100,000 inhabitants. The country has seen more violence in recent years than during the civil war,” according to a 2020 study by Rosen.\n\nEl Salvador's President Nayib Bukele speaks to around 14,000 soldiers in El Salvador. Marvin Recinos/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTackling crime remained the top of the agenda in 2019, when Bukele swept into power promising to end corruption and gang violence. The millennial styled himself as an iconoclast with his embrace of bitcoin and fondness of backward baseball caps, but fears quickly mounted about his authoritarian tendencies.\n\nCritical journalists and civil society members were allegedly targeted by his administration, and in 2020, he sent armed troops into Congress as he demanded that lawmakers approve his plan to secure a loan to tackle gang violence. Last September, a constitutional court stacked with his allies, according to non-profit Freedom House, cleared the way for Bukele to run for two consecutive terms.\n\nIn 2022, El Salvador’s government denied responsibility for hacking the cell phones of at least 35 journalists and other members of civil society by using the spying program known as Pegasus.\n\nAs the country’s murder rate began to fall in 2020, reports emerged of Bukele’s government allegedly cutting a deal with gangs.\n\nAccording to a US Treasury Department statement, Bukele’s administration was accused of providing financial incentives to MS -13 and Barrio 18 in 2020 to “ensure that incidents of gang violence and the number of confirmed homicides remained low.”\n\nBukele’s government has denied the allegations, with Bukele describing it on Twitter as an “obvious lie.”\n\nThere is some consensus among security watchers that Bukele’s truce with the gangs fell apart “in late March (2022) which prompted the MS-16 to do the killing spree to pressure the government to give concessions,” said Breda.\n\nThe alleged move backfired, and Bukele announced a state of emergency and the suspension of several constitutional rights.\n\nWidespread human rights violations have allegedly followed Bukele's dragnet, according to a Human Rights Watch report. MARVIN RECINOS/AFP/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAccurate statistics have been hard to get hold of as authorities kept the data private, according to HRW. But citing a National Civil Police document they obtained, there was a 50% decrease in homicides between January and the end of October compared to the same period the last year, the rights group said in its report.\n\nOther analysts agree. “From what we hear from communities living close to gangs, they confirm that most of the gangs are on their knees, (many) have fled or hiding in rural areas, of course this is affecting more the rank-and-file members rather than the leadership (of the gangs),” Breda said.\n\nA new crisis\n\nRights experts have noted the US’ recent silence on the prolonged crackdown.\n\nAfter initially being tough on Bukele’s attacks on the rule of law, “most recently we have seen ambiguous positions, which seems to be part of the Biden administration obsession in preventing migration,” Pappier said.\n\nAlleged gang members at a maximum security prison in Izalco, El Salvador, on September 4, 2020. Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess crime will compel fewer people to leave the country and seek asylum in the US in the short term, he said. Though Pappier doubts it will last, as many families have lost their sole breadwinner in the crime sweep. “Some of them are scared of police…so the deprivations of rights also have a cost and can also generate its own migration,” he said.\n\nA State Department spokesperson told CNN that “gang violence is a serious problem, and El Salvador and the United States have a vested interest in ensuring that these violent criminals are off the streets. At the same time, we have urged President Nayib Bukele and his administration to address the gang threat in a way that respects and protects the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the people of El Salvador.”\n\nThe spokesperson reiterated the US’ belief that the state of emergency “is an unsustainable policy that has raised serious concerns about human rights violations, arbitrary detentions, and deaths.”\n\nEl Salvador now has the perfect conditions for recruiting new gang members, Pappier adds. “People with no connection to gangs are getting arrested, are in prisons, and are completely deprived of their livelihoods – that is the perfect kind of person to recruit,” Pappier said.\n\nSo will Bukele listen? “Have you noticed how the mainstream media and NGOs have intensified their attacks in recent days?” El Salvador’s President wrote on Twitter a day after HRW’s report was published.\n\n“It is not that they are interested in El Salvador (they never were), their fear is that we will succeed, because other governments will want to imitate it.

The government said it would set out to find the killers, kidnappers and other violent criminals it reported escaped from the prison.\n\n“The police were ordered to use all legal means at their disposal to enforce the curfew and apprehend all offenders,” said a statement from Finance Minister Patrick Boivert, acting prime minister.\n\nHaiti spinning out of control:on every metric from gangs to kidnappings, migration to murder\n\nPrime Minister Ariel Henry traveled abroad last week to try to salvage support for bringing in a United Nations-backed security force to stabilize the country in its conflict with increasingly powerful crime groups.\n\nThousands of inmates fled during jailbreak\n\nThe decree capped a deadly weekend that marked a new low in Haiti’s spiral of violence. At least nine people had been killed since Thursday − four of them police officers − as gangs stepped up coordinated attacks on state institutions in Port-au-Prince. Targets included police stations, the country’s international airport, and even the national soccer stadium.\n\nBut the siege Saturday night of the National Penitentiary came as a shock even to Haitians accustomed to living under the constant threat of violence. Almost all of the estimated 4,000 inmates fled in the jailbreak, leaving the usually overcrowded facility eerily empty Sunday with no guards in sight and plastic sandals, clothing and furniture strewn across the concrete patio. Three bodies with gunshot wounds lay at the prison entrance.\n\nIn another neighborhood, the bloodied bodies of two men with their hands tied behind their backs lay face down as residents walked past roadblocks set up with burning tires.\n\n'Glimmer of hope':U.N. approves foreign force to combat Haiti's gangs\n\nColombian soldiers remain in Haiti prison\n\nAmong the few dozen who chose to stay in the prison are 18 former Colombian soldiers accused of working as mercenaries in the July 2021 assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse. Amid the clashes Saturday night, several of the Colombians shared a video pleading for their lives.\n\n“Please, please help us,” one of the men, Francisco Uribe, said in the message widely shared on social media. “They are massacring people indiscriminately inside the cells.”\n\nUribe told journalists Sunday who walked breezily into the usually highly guarded facility, “I didn’t flee because I’m innocent.”\n\nColombia’s foreign ministry called on Haiti to provide “special protection” for the men.\n\nIn the absence of official information, inmates’ family members rushed to the prison to check on loved ones.\n\n“I don’t know whether my son is alive or not,” Alexandre Jean said as she roamed around the cells looking for any sign of him. “I don’t know what to do.”\n\nThe violence Saturday night appeared to be widespread, with several neighborhoods reporting gunfire.\n\nSecond Port-au-Prince prison overtaken by gangs\n\nA second Port-au-Prince prison containing about 1,400 inmates was also overrun. Gang gunmen also occupied and vandalized the nation’s top soccer stadium, taking one employee hostage for hours, Haiti’s soccer federation said in a statement. Internet service for many residents was down as Haiti’s top mobile network said a fiber-optic cable connection was slashed during the rampage.\n\nIn the space of less than two weeks, several state institutions have been attacked by the gangs, which are increasingly coordinating their actions and choosing once unthinkable targets like the Central Bank. As part of coordinated attacks by gangs, four police officers were killed Thursday.\n\nUS Embassy in Haiti halts travel to country\n\nAfter gangs opened fire at Haiti’s international airport last week, the U.S. Embassy said it was halting all official travel to the country and urged Sunday night that all American citizens leave as soon as possible. The embassy also said it would cancel all consular appointments until Thursday.\n\nThe Biden administration, which has steadfastly refused to commit troops to any multinational force while offering instead money and logistical support, said it was monitoring the rapidly deteriorating security situation.\n\nA National Security Council official said violence serves only to delay a democratic transition while destroying the lives of thousands. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, reiterated U.S. support for elections, inclusive governance and the restoration of democracy.\n\nThe epicenter of the violence Saturday night was Haiti’s National Penitentiary, which was holding several gang leaders. Amid the exchange of gunfire, police appealed for aid.\n\n“They need help,” a union representing police said in a message on social media bearing an “SOS” emoji repeated eight times. “Let’s mobilize the army and the police to prevent the bandits from breaking into the prison.”\n\nThe clashes follow violent protests that turned deadlier in recent days as the prime minister went to Kenya seeking to move ahead on a proposed U.N.-backed security mission in Haiti to be led by that East African country.\n\nHenry took over as prime minister after Moise’s assassination and has repeatedly postponed plans to hold parliamentary and presidential elections, which haven’t happened in almost a decade.\n\nHaiti’s National Police has roughly 9,000 officers to provide security for more than 11 million people, according to the U.N.

The World Customs Organization identifies the code group as one of several different medical supply categories needed for handling COVID-19.\n\nChina is the world’s biggest exporter of medical face masks. It produced about half of the world’s $11.7 billion supply in 2018 alone, the United Nations’ latest trade data shows. And the U.S. has long been its biggest customer.\n\nThe import drop happened as COVID-19 raged through China, and the country implemented export restrictions on its masks and other medical equipment to treat tens of thousands of infected residents. It also shut down much of its economy, including mask manufacturing plants, to stop the spread of the virus.\n\n“Suppliers may not have been able to supply as much as was demanded because they needed to provide it to the local economy, and the Chinese factories were simply not operating,” said Mary Lovely, an economics professor at Syracuse University. “Workers were not at work. They were at home. They were quarantined.”\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. was still imposing 15% tariffs on imports of personal protective equipment from China through March 17 as part of the trade war.\n\n“Not surprisingly, we got less of those things. Imports fell,” said Chad Bown, a senior researcher with the Peterson Institute for International Economics.\n\nDownplaying the risks\n\nEven though U.S. intelligence agencies and people within his own administration warned the coronavirus would soon wreak havoc on American soil, President Donald Trump was still downplaying its risk to the public.\n\n“We think we have it very well under control,” Trump said on Jan. 30. “We have very little problem in this country at this moment – five. And those people are all recuperating successfully.”\n\nThe flawed assurances – along with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recommendation that healthy people not wear masks – lessened the demand for masks when the country should have been trying to obtain them, experts said.\n\nEven U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams weighed in.\n\n“Seriously people- STOP BUYING MASKS!” Adams tweeted from the office’s official Twitter account in February. “They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can’t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk!”\n\nAs a result, Lovely said, the U.S. demand for masks was “not really coming on strong until the beginning of March.” She predicted that when the March trade data is released, it will show an increase.\n\nThe CDC revised its position in April and now recommends all people wear face masks when in public. Adams even posted a video showing how to make a face mask with common household items.\n\nBut many frightened Americans didn’t listen to the government in January and February and stocked up on masks anyway.\n\nU.S. retailers began selling out in late January. Two of the nation’s largest drugstore chains – Walgreens and CVS – saw depletions of their stock in stores across the country within days of the first reported U.S. coronavirus case. People reported shortages in New York, Los Angeles and Phoenix, among other cities.\n\nOnline retailers like Amazon also reported a rush of sales and delivery delays.\n\nEven the makers of face masks for pet dogs struggled to keep up with demand. Kirby Holmes, the owner of the Austin,Texas-based company K9 Mask, said sales skyrocketed as much as 400% by early February.\n\nThe CDC reported its first case in the United States on Jan. 20. Within the next two weeks, the World Health Organization and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had declared the disease a public health emergency.\n\nBy March, hospitals across the county were struggling to purchase surgical and N95 masks, encountering ordering delays of up to six months, according to a survey released Monday by the watchdog of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nOne hospital administrator said masks that once cost 50 cents each now exceed $6, according to the report.\n\nMore than 430,000 Americans have tested positive for coronavirus and more than 14,800 have died, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\n“My guess is that the CDC’s initial guidance on face masks did help reduce domestic demand,” said Michelle P. Connolly, a Duke University economist. “With their recent change, they are now recommending cloth face coverings, but they are also being very clear that those aren’t surgical masks or N95 respirators.”\n\n3M sales\n\nWhile drugstores, states and hospitals were scrambling to stock up, officials at Health and Human Services, which oversees the Strategic National Stockpile, didn’t place the first order for N95 respirators until mid-March, according to The Associated Press, citing federal contracting records.\n\nIt had about 13 million such face masks at the start of the pandemic, but demand from states hard hit by the pandemic quickly drained the stock.\n\n“We had a stockpile of medical equipment,” Lovely, the Syracuse University economist, said. “It just wasn't adequately maintained.”\n\nThe agency placed its initial order for $4.8 million in N95 masks with 3M on March 12, according to AP. It placed a larger order for $173 million on March 21, but the company wasn’t expected to start delivering the supplies until the end of April.\n\nThe White House began sparring with 3M late last week over the company’s production of N95s here and abroad. Trump asked the company to increase its import of the masks from its overseas factories and decrease exports and signed an order authorizing FEMA to use its authority to acquire the masks from 3M if necessary.\n\nThe company had resisted reducing its exports to Canada and Latin America, saying it would have “significant humanitarian implications,” and could reduce the net number of respirators available to the U.S.\n\nExperts disagree over whether the U.S. should use its authority to interfere in free trade. Many support reducing restrictions, such as lowering tariffs and making sure that countries can share what they produce.\n\nBut Cameron Kerry, a visiting fellow with the Brookings Institution, said the acute shortage of personal protective equipment creates a strong argument for temporary government intervention.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency this week unveiled regulations restricting the export of five types of personal protective equipment, saying the items could no longer be exported without explicit FEMA approval. The list includes N95 respirators; other filtering facepiece respirators; reusable elastomeric air-purifying respirators and cartridges; surgical masks and surgical gloves.\n\nScheduled to take effect April 10, the rule would last four months. Trump signaled he would ban the export of the medical gear earlier this week, but the regulations offer new detail about specifically how the prohibition will work.\n\n‘Ray of hope’\n\nThe actual value of imports from China is likely more than what’s reported in the trade data, said Gary Hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the Peterson Institute. That’s because small personal shipments usually aren’t included.\n\nFor example, Hufbauer said, one of his colleagues in China sent him protective masks via FedEx in recent weeks, much like how many Chinese Americans sent masks back to their families in the mainland during the early parts of the pandemic.\n\nWhile Chinese exports of personal protective equipment decreased by 19% in January and February compared to the same months last year, it was a smaller decline than that of Chinese exports overall, which fell by 28% during the same period, according to an analysis by Bown, the Peterson Institute researcher.\n\nAnd U.S. imports of nose and face coverings from China declined less than for the European Union compared to previous years – 19% for the U.S.vs. 21% for the EU However, when taken as a whole, the U.S. saw a greater decrease in personal protective equipment from China than the EU – 19% vs. 17%.\n\nBown called the findings a “ray of hope.”\n\n“The U.S. fared only a little worse than Europe,” Bown said. “That’s what we would have expected.The EU is not doing a trade war with China. They didn’t put extra special tariffs on China like we did.”\n\nDian Zhang is a data journalist for USA TODAY. Contact her at dzhang@gatehousemedia.com or @dian_zhang_.

Biden may travel to Saudi Arabia as the US works to convince the kingdom to increase its production. And a looming nuclear deal could bring significant volumes of Iranian oil back to the market.\n\nCaracas, Riyadh and Tehran would have been unlikely sources of relief for a Biden-led Western alliance before the start of the war in Ukraine. But Russia’s invasion has upended international relations, forcing the US and other nations to seek out solutions in places they’d previously shunned.\n\nIn deciding the next steps, Biden administration officials are weighing a host of factors. Russia’s invasion of its neighbor, which has left scores of civilians dead, has generated immense pressure on Western nations to cut their energy ties to Moscow, including from both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. In a videoconference call with American lawmakers Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky pleaded for a ban on Russian energy.\n\nUS imports from Russia make up a small slice of the energy universe – roughly 8% in 2021, of which only about 3% was crude oil. White House economic officials have been engaged for more than a week in how to manage any decision to cut off those imports, officials say. The Department of Energy reported that in the last two weeks of February, Russian oil imports dropped to zero as US companies cut ties with Russia, effectively implementing their own ban.\n\nThose efforts have grown more intense in recent days and Biden announced a ban on Russian energy imports on Tuesday morning.\n\n“Today I am announcing the United States is targeting the main artery of Russia’s economy. We’re banning all imports of Russian oil and gas and energy,” Biden said in remarks from the White House. “That means Russian oil will no longer be acceptable at US ports and the American people will deal another powerful blow to Putin’s war machine.”\n\nIn both public and private conversations, top American allies have said the US would likely be acting on its own should it target Russian energy imports. That has raised its own concerns, as US officials remain wary of pursuing any action that would fragment the carefully coordinated alliance that has served as the focal point of the response up to this point.\n\nRussia has typically exported roughly 5 million barrels of crude per day, half of which goes to Europe. Venezuela, which has the world’s largest proven oil reserves, could help make up the gap, but the country has suffered persistent output issues. Before sanctions were applied on Iran, it produced about 4 million barrels per day. Saudi Arabia has spare capacity to ramp up production, though it has so far been unwilling.\n\nFor Biden, the effort to identify oil supplies – even in autocratic regimes – demonstrates the lengths he is willing to go to inflict serious pain on Moscow. He has long framed his presidency around defending democracy from creeping authoritarianism and accused his predecessor of cozying up to the world’s strongmen. But reducing the world’s dependance on one autocrat’s energy supplies could mean turning to another’s instead.\n\nIt’s far from clear that the administration’s efforts will yield results. Venezuela’s socialist leader, Nicolás Maduro, is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s top ally in Latin America. So far, Saudi Arabia has refused to increase production, though officials remain hopeful of a breakthrough. And a revived Iran nuclear deal remains elusive – in part because of new demands by Russia, a partner in the international negotiations.\n\nStill, Biden administration officials remain intent on identifying potential supplies of energy that could replace Russia’s exports. While US officials have assessed it would not be in Russia’s interest to weaponize its energy exports, the risk that it may come to pass and the need to protect European allies – particularly when it comes to natural gas – has factored into the efforts, officials said.\n\nGasoline prices skyrocketing over supply fears\n\nIntensifying discussion of bans on Russian energy has already caused the price of oil to surge.\n\nIt soared to its highest level since 2008 on Monday. Brent crude, the global benchmark, briefly spiked as high as $139 a barrel – a leap of more than 35% in just one month. The ramifications of significant price spikes have been a significant concern inside the White House, with Biden bringing up the need to mitigate the issue in private meetings.\n\nRon Klain, Biden’s chief of staff, has also been a regular voice in meetings underscoring the need to limit the domestic pain to the extent possible as the administration seeks to maintain domestic support for its wide-ranging efforts, according to two people familiar with the matter. It’s a reality Biden has publicly and repeatedly emphasized when he outlines the stakes and necessity of the US role in responding to Russia’s aggression.\n\nThe President and some of his most senior advisers in the West Wing view high fuel prices as one of the most tangible economic pains for average Americans, according to multiple sources, and there is concern that the situation may get worse just as travel picks up heading into the summer.\n\nWith midterm elections around the corner, the White House is keenly aware of the political problems that sticker shock at the gas pump can pose for their party and has been strategizing for weeks on ways to try to contain the rise in gas prices while turning voters’ attention to bright spots in the economy.\n\nSome Biden officials also view attempts by Republican lawmakers to pressure the administration into banning Russian oil as cynical, given they are likely to pin higher gas prices on the White House should they inch up even more.\n\nIntentionally quiet diplomacy with oil-supplying nations\n\nTop US officials have engaged in a wide-ranging but intentionally quiet effort to rally major suppliers and states to meet any demand issues that came from a Russian invasion or the bite of the sanctions that followed, according to multiple senior administration officials.\n\nAmos Hochstein, senior adviser for energy security at the State Department, has led the effort and has worked closely with Brett McGurk, the National Security Council’s Middle East and North Africa coordinator. The efforts have included meetings with major energy producers in northern Africa, including Algeria, as well as the Middle East and Asia, and with key players in domestic production. Countries including Japan and Qatar have signaled they are willing to contribute to a broad-based effort to fill gaps in supply.\n\nHochstein and McGurk met with Saudi officials last month “to discuss a collaborative approach to managing potential market pressures stemming from a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine.”\n\nBiden had once sought to “recalibrate” the US relationship with Saudi Arabia, effectively refusing to speak to the Kingdom’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who the US accused of authorizing journalist Jamal Khashoggi’s murder. Biden’s direct conversations have been limited to King Salman, the crown prince’s father, and included a call last month that reiterated a commitment from both countries to “ensuring the stability of global energy supplies.”\n\nThe frosty reception Saudis have received from the US since Biden came into office has deeply irritated the Persian Gulf country, leading to a lack of willingness on its part to be helpful by pumping more oil into the market, US officials have said. While some US officials believe that the Biden administration should make an even more concerted effort to engage Saudi Arabia, Biden – who called the crown prince a killer last year – has been resistant, the officials said.\n\nSome US officials are deeply wary of the prospects of Biden engaging the crown prince on energy production.\n\n“Who’s he going to call – (someone) who he hasn’t spoken to because he’s a loathsome toad, because he dismembered a journalist?” said one senior Democratic official who asked to remain anonymous in order to speak freely. “I’m not expecting that to happen. I’m not recommending it.”\n\nBut the war in Ukraine has caused its own global recalibration, and now Biden officials are weighing a possible presidential trip to Saudi Arabia in the coming months, three people familiar with the talks confirmed. Axios was first to report on the discussions around the trip.\n\n“There’s no current plans for the President to travel to Saudi Arabia,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday.\n\nStill, she acknowledged that discussions with the Saudis had ramped up, both on oil and on regional security issues.\n\n“It’s in everyone’s interest to reduce the impact on the global oil marketplace, and that was part of that discussion,” she said.\n\nSo far, Saudi officials have remained steadfast in their commitment to the OPEC+ production schedule agreed to with Russia. But one official familiar with the conversations said the Saudis expressed an openness to addressing major market disruptions. What that would entail – or what kind of disruption would lead to a shift in posture – remains unclear.\n\n“There are actions that energy producers can take in terms of their spare capacity and there are actions that energy producers can undertake to increase their production of energy in the current circumstance,” a senior administration official said in describing the overall US effort in recent months.\n\nWhile the official declined to give a specific timeline, “the collective power of those actions and all the other tools and authorities that are at our disposal, plus diplomatic maneuvers … that are at our disposal, collectively, we think, will be effective in bringing down the price of gas and the price of oil.”\n\nMaintaining a tight-knit alliance\n\nWhile minimizing price spikes has been central to the overall approach, so has the effort to maintain an alliance with countries that have far more acute concerns about the effects of energy sanctions on their respective economies.\n\nIn a call with European leaders on Monday, Biden discussed potential ways to limit Russian oil purchases. One of the leaders on the call, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, said Europe cannot secure its energy supplies without imports from Russia. In a news release, Scholz said energy had been deliberately left out of previous rounds of sanctions, adding that Russian energy is of “essential importance” to the daily lives of its citizens.\n\nMeanwhile, Hungary’s finance minister, Varga Mihaly, said in a Facebook video posted Monday that his government would not support any sanctions on Russian energy.\n\nEurope relies on Russia for 40% of its natural gas supply and a quarter of the crude oil it imports. Efforts to secure options to backfill natural gas supply have been seen as particularly crucial, officials said.\n\nEngaging with the Venezuelans\n\nThe administration has made plain it won’t leave options untapped, including in places where the US may have other concerns.\n\nWhen senior Biden administration officials – including the National Security Council’s director for the Western Hemisphere, Juan Gonzalez, and the US special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, Roger Carstens – were dispatched to Caracas over the weekend for talks on the issue, they were the highest-ranking Americans to have visited the country in years.\n\nAside from sanctions relief and oil, they also discussed American citizens currently detained in Venezuela who the US wants to see freed. They include two Green Berets accused of plotting to remove Maduro and a group of energy executives arrested in 2017.\n\nWashington imposed sanctions on Venezuelan oil in 2019 and closed its embassy in Caracas after deeming Maduro’s election victory in 2018 to be a sham. A US official said Venezuela would need to take several steps before sanctions were lifted, though didn’t specify the conditions.\n\nEngaging Venezuela now could also isolate Russia from its top ally in South America, officials said.\n\nOne day before the trip, the US made a strange move: The Treasury Department quietly announced a general license – allowing transactions that would otherwise would be prohibited – for a Russian oligarch who is a big investor in Venezuela’s energy market and has close relations with the Maduro regime, according to the announcement posted on the Office of Foreign Assets Control website. The oligarch – Alisher Burhanovich Usmanov – is also an ally of Putin.\n\nNot sanctioning all of Usmanov’s entities created the appearance, to some, of trying to grease the wheels before the trip to Caracas. But the Treasury Department said that all of his personal assets had been blocked and there would likely be more sanctions to come.\n\n“We are going to work with our allies and partners to design a set of mitigations that allow us to target companies under Usmanov’s control without driving up the price of commodities like nickel, which could inadvertently enrich him,” said a Treasury Department spokesperson.\n\nAlready, however, the political costs of engaging Venezuela have been plain.\n\nRepublican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida – a state that’s home to a large population of Venezuelan Americans who oppose the Maduro regime – has already criticized the discussions. He said over the weekend that “rather than produce more American oil,” Biden “wants to replace the oil we buy from one murderous dictator with oil from another murderous dictator.”\n\nAnd Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, who is the head of the Senate GOP campaign committee, said: “We should stop importing Russian oil, period. And we shouldn’t be going to Venezuela. … When are we going to learn that we can’t be relying on these thugs?”\n\nRank-and-file Republicans had equally harsh words for Biden: Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, called it “kind of nuts” and warned it would “empower Venezuela” and “enrich Iran.” And Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida said he was “speechless” and hoped the reports weren’t true.\n\n“I don’t think anybody could be this much of an imbecile. And I say that painfully because it’s too reckless, too stupid, too idiotic, too dangerous for it to be true,” Diaz-Balart said. “This will do nothing, by the way. Venezuelan oil? They’re barely producing right now.”\n\nIt’s not only Republicans who are criticizing the idea. Sen. Robert Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who’s the powerful chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he would “strongly oppose” any action that enriched Maduro.\n\n“In the last month, the international community has come together in an unprecedented way to reject military aggression by Russia and stand up for democracy. But the Biden administration’s efforts to unify the entire world against a murderous tyrant in Moscow should not be undercut by propping up a dictator under investigation for crimes against humanity in Caracas,” Menendez said.", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Phil Mattingly Natasha Bertrand Mj Lee Kylie Atwood", "Kevin Liptak", "Phil Mattingly", "Natasha Bertrand", "Mj Lee", "Kylie Atwood"], "publish_date": "2022/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2020/06/26/blaxit-black-americans-leave-us-escape-racism-build-lives-abroad/3234129001/", "title": "Black Americans leave USA to escape racism, build lives abroad", "text": "Anthony Baggette knew the precise moment he had to get out: He was driving by a convenience store in Cincinnati when a police officer pulled him over.

There are probably more.\n\nAbout 120,000 Americans live in Germany, home to about 1 million people of African descent. For historical reasons, Germany's census does not use race as a category, so it is not possible to calculate how many hail from the USA.\n\n\"There's a lot of institutional racism in Germany,\" said Baggette, 68, who has lived in Berlin for more than 30 years and said he still feels conflicted about his move.\n\nHe described the fall of the Berlin Wall, in 1989, as a time when neo-Nazis and skinheads would \"throw Black people off of the S-Bahn,\" the city's subway system.\n\n\"But I still felt, and feel, better off here – safer,\" he said.\n\n'I don't have to think of myself as a Black woman'\n\nIn interviews with more than a dozen expatriate Black Americans spread out across the globe from the Caribbean to West Africa, it became clear that for some, the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis provided fresh evidence that living outside the USA can be an exercise in self-preservation.\n\nA study in 2019 by the National Academy of Sciences found Black men were about 2.5 times more likely than white men to be killed by police. An analysis this year by Nature Human Behavior of 100 million traffic stops conducted across the country determined that Black people were far more likely to be pulled over by police than whites, but that difference narrowed significantly at night, when it is harder to see dark skin. Black Americans face a far higher risk of being arrested for petty crimes. They account for a third of the prison population but just 13% of the overall population, according to Pew Research, a nonpartisan \"fact tank.\"\n\n12 charts, 1 big problem:How racial disparities persist across wealth, health, education and beyond\n\nDrayton, 28, is writing a book about fleeing from racism in America. She said one of the starkest illustrations of how her life has changed since moving to Trinidad and Tobago in 2013 is how she feels comfortable driving her kids around the block to get them to sleep each night without being worried about what happens if she is pulled over by police.\n\n\"In America, your hands are shaking. You're worried about what to say. You're worried about whether you have the right ID. You're just so worried all the time,\" she said of the interactions her friends experience regularly with American police officers.\n\nFor other Black Americans who chose what amounts to a form of foreign exile, Floyd's death and the ensuing protests confirmed that leaving may not mean a life free from racism and police brutality, but it at least feels somewhat more within reach.\n\n\"It wasn't until I had left the USA to experience Spain that I really got a sense of what freedom looks like. I was able to be 100% myself without having to worry about safety and without needing to have too much of a complex identity,\" said Brooklyn, New York, native Sienna Brown, 28, who lives near Valencia on the Mediterranean Sea. Brown founded a company that helps Black American women emigrate to Spain.\n\nShe said Spain isn't racism-free and isn't that diverse, but she has experienced it as a welcoming place where people are willing to be educated about their prejudices.\n\nLakeshia Ford moved to Ghana full-time after visiting in 2008 as part of a study-abroad year in college.\n\n\"Here I don't have to think of myself as a Black woman and everything that comes with that,\" said Ford, 32, who grew up in New Jersey and runs her own communication firm in Accra, Ghana's capital. \"Here I am just a woman.\"\n\nShe said that although racism in the USA contributed to the decision, her move to Ghana was not a direct reaction to prejudice. She was equally intrigued by Ghanaian culture and what she saw as a growing economic success story rarely portrayed in the West, where Africa for many is synonymous with disease, poverty and conflict.\n\n\"When I got here, I remember thinking: There's wealthy Black people here. No one tells you that. I was really pissed off about it. I was also really intrigued,\" she said.\n\nFord said that since Floyd's death in May, she has received several emails a day from Black Americans asking how they, too, can make a new life outside the USA.\n\n\"Come home, build a life in Ghana. You do not have to stay where you are not wanted forever. You have a choice, and Africa is waiting for you,\" Barbara Oteng Gyasi, Ghana's tourism minister, said during a ceremony last month marking Floyd's death.\n\n'In Russia, I felt for the first time like a full human being'\n\nBlack Americans, like expatriates of all races and ethnicities, leave the USA temporarily or permanently for different reasons: in search of a better quality of life, for work opportunities, to marry or retire abroad, for tax reasons, for adventure.\n\nThis year, Essence, a Black fashion, entertainment and lifestyle magazine, published a list of Black travel influencers who \"trek to faraway and sexy places,\" from \"the pyramids of Giza\" to \"the souks of Dubai\" while \"we sit at our desks watching.\"\n\nKimberly Springer, a New York-based writer and researcher who spent almost a decade in the United Kingdom, where she taught American studies at King's College London, said that although \"Black people have always traveled,\" and \"we've gone places willingly or unwillingly,\" often this travel is connected in some way to a search for an experience that is not tainted by the myriad ways Black Americans encounter discrimination in the USA.\n\n\"In America, I feel hyper-visible in ways I didn't when I lived in the U.K.,\" said Springer, 50, noting that although racial inequalities in the U.K., like in the USA, are deep and pervasive, they are connected to a history and tradition – in the U.K.'s case, its former empire – that she doesn't share. As a foreigner, despite being a Black American foreigner, Springer said, she was afforded a certain amount of insulation from British racism, even though studies show the British justice system disproportionately penalizes Black people.\n\nFact check:Ghana is not offering money, land to lure Black Americans\n\n\"Our racism isn't as lethal as yours,\" said Gary Younge, a professor of sociology at Manchester University in England. Younge, 51, who is Black, spent more than a decade as The Guardian newspaper's U.S. correspondent.\n\n\"In Britain, I don't generally walk around thinking I might get killed, whereas in America, in some places, that's not always the case,\" he said.\n\nYounge attributed this disparity to the availability in the USA of guns.\n\nAsked whether Black people should confront racism at home, rather than leave, he said, \"Why shouldn't they just live? If a white person leaves America and goes somewhere for work or better opportunities, no one would say to them they need to stay and fight for racial equality. Black people have a double burden of being discriminated against and having to stick around.\"\n\nBlack Americans have been trying to escape American racism – from segregation to heinous organized violence, such as lynchings – for generations.\n\nThere are examples among America's Black intellectuals, artists and prominent civil rights activists.\n\nWriters James Baldwin and Richard Wright and entertainer Josephine Baker relocated to Paris. Wright and Baker died in France's capital. Poet Langston Hughes was part of an expatriate community in London. Jazz and blues singer Nina Simone decided to see out her days in France, and after she stopped performing, she never returned to what she called the \"United Snakes of America.\" Simone also lived in Liberia, Barbados, Belgium, the U.K., the Netherlands and Switzerland. When she died in 2003, her ashes, at her request, were scattered across several African countries.\n\n\"I left this country for one reason only. One reason. I didn’t care where I’d go. I might’ve gone to Hong Kong, I might’ve gone to Timbuktu, I ended up in Paris with $40 in my pocket with the theory that nothing worse would happen to me there than had already happened to me here,\" Baldwin said in 1968 on \"The Dick Cavett Show.\"\n\nA decade prior, actor and singer Paul Robeson, famed for his deep baritone voice, said before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, \"In Russia, I felt for the first time like a full human being. No color prejudice like in Mississippi, no color prejudice like in Washington. It was the first time I felt like a human being.\"\n\nMore recently, Yasiin Bey, an American rapper-actor better known by his stage name Mos Def, moved to South Africa because he was fed up with inequality and racism.\n\n\"For a guy like me, with five or six generations from the same town in America, to leave America, things gotta be not so good with America,\" Bey said in 2013 as he prepared to leave the USA for Cape Town. He was thrown out of South Africa in 2016 for violating its immigration laws. He was detained after trying to leave the country on a \"World Passport,\" which has no legal status. According to his lawyer, Bey did not want to use his American passport for political reasons.\n\nThat same year, as the U.K. voted to leave the European Union and President Donald Trump was elected, there was an uptick in people searching the internet for the term \"Blaxit,\" according to Springer. If the U.K. could withdraw from the EU – \"Brexit\" – could Black people, disheartened by racial violence, leave the USA?\n\n\"I try not to use the phrase 'I can't breathe' too lightly,\" Springer said, referring to the words that became a rallying cry for police brutality protesters and were the last words of Floyd and Eric Garner, a Black man killed in police custody in 2014.\n\n\"But I think there is a way in which this country is, in its history and its failure to recognize it and reckon with it honestly, is suffocating,\" she said. \"I really don't blame anyone thinks I can't take this country anymore, I'm leaving, and I'm just not coming back.\"\n\n'It's like having a few more stepping stones to achieve that'\n\nKambon, 41, an academic in Ghana, said he is never going back to the USA.\n\nHe is in the process of renouncing his American citizenship.\n\nHe said that after the police in Chicago falsely accused him of concealing a loaded gun in his car, the charges were thrown out by a judge because there was no probable cause for his arrest, and the evidence – obtained illegally – would be not be admissible in court.\n\n\"I told myself on the witness stand: I will never allow myself to again be in the jurisdiction of these white people who, on a whim, can decide you're not going to see your family for the next 10 years, who can decide to throw a felony charge on you on a whim,\" he said.\n\nDrayton, in Trinidad and Tobago, said she tells her friends to leave if they can. Many desperately want to, she said, but either don't have the financial means or face other obstacles.\n\n\"I've been wanting to leave for a long time,\" said Drayton's friend Karla Garcia, 29, who was born in Ecuador. She lives in Orlando, Florida. \"But it's difficult as a young divorced mother of a child with special needs to just get up and leave.\"\n\nBrown, in Spain, said she is determined to make a life in southern Europe, not least because she wants to own a house and build and pass on wealth. She has a 16-year-old sister in the USA, and she said accumulating \"generational wealth\" is something that has proved elusive for Black Americans, unlike for many whites.\n\nHer experience is that it will be easier to do this in Spain than in New York, where there are more barriers to financial success, from discrimination in mortgage lending – \"red lining\" – to access to social welfare services, such as affordable day care.\n\n\"It's like having a few more stepping stones to achieve that,\" she said.\n\nPew Research estimated that the overall average wealth of white American families is at least 10 times larger than that of Black American families.\n\nIn an opinion piece for Al-Jazeera, a Doha, Qatar-based news network, Amali Tower, executive director of Climate Refugees, a migration advocacy organization, wrote that if Black Americans sought asylum abroad they would probably qualify.\n\n\"The social and political unrest that has rocked the country just these past few weeks alone would add to a trove of evidence to support any claims of 'well-founded fear' for this person's safety and well-being at home,\" Tower argued in the piece.\n\nA Washington Post-Ipsos poll of Black Americans conducted in mid-June found that although they are outraged and frustrated by Floyd's death, they are optimistic about rising concern from whites and the prospect of improved police treatment.\n\nIn Berlin, Baggette has learned to live with his mixed feelings about his adopted homeland. He values the free education and health care his kids receive in Germany. He does not routinely fear for their lives.\n\nBaggette is retired but coaches youth basketball.\n\nWhen a team from Chicago's South Side visited a few years ago as part of an exchange program, he was shocked to hear from some of the youngsters that one of the things that most impressed them about Germany's capital was the easy access to fresh fruit, especially strawberries. It was available on most streets in small kiosks.\n\nThese kids weren't used to that on the South Side, he thought.\n\nBaggette said he feels a little cut off from the American movement that sprung up in the aftermath of Black American deaths at the hands of police: Floyd, Garner, Breonna Taylor, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Terence Crutcher, Freddie Gray, Rayshard Brooks and many more.\n\n‘You don’t get over nothing like this’: Mother of Tamir Rice says moving on has been painful\n\nMost weeks, Baggette sends out lengthy emails to parents, players and coaches, pointing out racist language used by referees. He is heavily involved in various initiatives that raise awareness of racism and xenophobia. He acts as a mentor for disadvantaged kids. He avoids certain working-class areas of Berlin where there is strong support for right-wing, anti-immigration political policies.\n\n\"Being Black in Berlin is a challenge,\" he said. \"One thing I can say is that when those young kids from Chicago visited us here, well, they felt a certain amount of freedom that I can tell you they don't feel over there.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/asia/seoul-itaewon-halloween-mourning-memorial-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "South Korean authorities say they had no guidelines for Halloween ...", "text": "Seoul, South Korea CNN —\n\nSouth Korean authorities said Monday they had no guidelines to handle the huge crowds that gathered for Halloween festivities in Seoul, as families in the country and around the world mourn the 156 victims of Saturday night’s crowd crush.\n\nThe crush took place in the narrow neon-lit alleyways of the popular nightlife district Itaewon, where witnesses described being unable to move or breathe as thousands of revelers stood shoulder-to-shoulder in a street no more than 4 meters (13 feet) wide.\n\nFrantic families spent much of Sunday gathering at information centers where authorities compiled details of the dead and wounded, and contacting morgues and hospitals in a desperate attempt to locate missing relatives.\n\nWith all of the victims now identified, the panic has transformed to national grief as the country grapples with one of its worst-ever disasters – while parents overseas make arrangements for their deceased children in a foreign land.\n\nA woman pays tribute at a memorial altar on October 31 in Seoul, South Korea. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nOfficial memorial altars were set up in central Seoul Monday, with photos showing crowds visiting to pay their respects. Many were in tears and holding white flowers; others knelt and bowed deeply to the altar.\n\nSouth Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, his wife, Kim Keon-hee, and top officials including the prime minister and Seoul mayor joined the mourners.\n\nMany shops and businesses were closed to observe a week-long national period of mourning. Parts of central Seoul were nearly deserted – a highly unusual sight in the usually bustling capital that’s home to about 10 million people.\n\nPeople also paid respects at a makeshift memorial in Itaewon, outside a subway station near the alley where the crush occurred. The station entrance is adorned with rows of flowers, and offerings such as handwritten notes, bottles of the Korean liquor soju and paper cups filled with drinks.\n\nAmong the mourners was a civic group of the bereaved families of the Sewol Ferry disaster, which killed 304 people – mostly teens on a school trip – when the vessel sank in 2014.\n\n“As one who had suffered the same pain, my heart is torn and I’m rendered speechless,” one of the group’s members told reporters at the memorial, saying the families were saddened to see “a major disaster like this repeated.”\n\nQuestions about police numbers\n\nJust down the street, the entrance to the alley had been cordoned off, with security personnel standing guard as forensic teams clad in white protective suits scoured the area, still littered with trash and debris.\n\nAmid the grief, questions have emerged about the government’s handling of the incident and an apparent lack of crowd control before the tragedy.\n\nOne survivor, 22-year-old French exchange student Anne-Lou Chevalier, told CNN she passed out in the crowd after being “crushed” by fellow revelers. “At some point I had no air, and we were so crushed to other people that I couldn’t breathe at all. So, I just passed out,” Chevalier said.\n\nSeveral eyewitnesses and survivors said they had seen few or no police officers in the area before the situation deteriorated.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, the minister of the interior and safety said only a “normal” level of security personnel had been deployed to Itaewon because the crowd there did not seem unusually large – whereas a “considerable number” of police had been sent to another part of Seoul in response to expected protests.\n\nMourners pay tribute for victims of the deadly Halloween crowd surge in Seoul on October 31, 2022. Rebecca Wright/CNN\n\nBut – facing a backlash from Korean politicians and on social media – authorities seemed to change tack on Monday, saying they had deployed about 137 personnel to Itaewon that night, compared to about 30 to 70 personnel in previous years before the pandemic.\n\n“For this time’s Halloween festival, because it was expected that many people would gather in Itaewon, I understand that it was prepared by putting in more police force than other years,” said Oh Seung-jin, director of the violent crime investigation division at the National Police Agency.\n\nHowever, he admitted, “currently there is no separate preparation manual for such a situation where there is no organizer and a gathering of a crowd is expected.” Moreover, the police had been deployed not for crowd control – but for crime prevention and to prevent “various illegal activities.”\n\nKim Seong-ho, director of the disaster and safety management division at the Ministry of the Interior and Safety, echoed these comments, saying they did not have “guidelines or a manual” for such an “unprecedented situation.”\n\nVictims emerge\n\nThe victims were mostly young people who had gone to Itaewon Saturday night, eager for South Korea’s first Halloween celebrations in years without Covid restrictions.\n\nThe death toll rose to 156 on Tuesday following the death of a critically injured woman in her 20s, Seoul police said. In total, 101 women and 55 men were killed.\n\nTwelve of the victims were teenagers and more than 100 were in their 20s, according to authorities.\n\nAmong their number were 26 foreign nationals from countries including the United States, China, Iran, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Japan, Australia, Norway, France, Russia, Austria, Vietnam, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.\n\nA further 149 people were injured, 33 seriously, including 15 foreign nationals.\n\nSix students who attended schools in Seoul – one middle schooler and five high schoolers – were among the dead, as well as three teachers, said the Korean Ministry of Education.\n\nThree South Korean military personnel were also among those killed, said a Korean Defense Ministry official.\n\nShin Ae-jin was a 24-year-old graduate killed in the crowd surge on Saturday, her father told CNN.\n\nShe had started working at McKinsey & Company in September. Ahead of this new phase of her life the family took a trip to Europe in July, he said.\n\n“I traveled much with her from when she was young. We took many family trips together. We are a very happy family,” her father, Shin Jung-seob, a retired venture capitalist, told CNN.\n\n“It’s sad that I won’t see her again but I feel I had a fulfilled life with her … She lived in happiness,” he said while receiving mourners at the Samsung Seoul Hospital’s funeral home in the capital.\n\n“My daughter was always bright, had many dreams, and didn’t shy away from challenges. She lived as a high achiever.”\n\nThe father said that he plans to bury his daughter next to a tree, a practice called Sumokjang where the ashes of the deceased are put in a degradable container and buried, often in a cemetery plot. The family can then visit the tree and commemorate their loved one.\n\nWhen asked why he’s choosing this type of burial, Shin said: “We wanted to remember her. A tree has life, so it grows on.”\n\nSteven Blesi, 20, a college student from Marietta, Georgia. Courtesy family of Steven Blesi\n\nTwo American college students were identified – Steven Blesi from Georgia, and Anne Gieske from Kentucky – both in their junior year.\n\nBlesi’s father, Steve Blesi, said his son had “always been an adventurer.” He was an Eagle Scout, liked basketball and wanted to learn multiple languages, he said.\n\n“Maybe in a half hour before this tragedy event took place, I texted him in WhatsApp … ‘I know you’re out and about.

Overdose deaths from fentanyl climbed to 71,238 last year from 57,834 in 2020, according to the CDC.\n\nIllicit versions of fentanyl have increasingly been manufactured in clandestine labs overseas, sold on the black market and mixed with other street drugs. The street version is different from legal fentanyl, a powerful pain medicine vetted by the Food and Drug Administration and prescribed in medical settings to treat intense pain in cancer patients.\n\nIllicit fentanyl has been the driving cause of the latest wave of overdose deaths, said Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse.\n\n\"The synthetic opioid fentanyl has injected itself throughout our whole country,\" Volkow said. \"It's everywhere.\"\n\nStimulants such as methamphetamine were detected in 32,856 overdose deaths and cocaine in 24,538 deaths. In many cases, more than one drug is found in a fatal mixture of substances,\n\nExperts say illicitly manufactured fentanyl is often mixed with cocaine, methamphetamine or even counterfeit prescription opioids sold on the street.\n\nPeople who intend to buy non-opioid street drugs might have no idea they are getting a toxic combination cut with with fentanyl. And for a person who has built no tolerance for opioids, whether prescription pain pills, heroin or street fentanyl, taking street drugs cut with fentanyl can be fatal.\n\n\"We're finding that people are overdosing because they've had no exposure to opioids that powerful,\" said Chris Delcher, a University of Kentucky professor and director of the Institute for Pharmaceutical Outcomes & Policy. \"We like to categorize our deaths to a single drug or a single cause of death. What's happening right now on the street is this incredible experiment in combinations of drugs.\"\n\nMore:Amid backlash from chronic pain sufferers, CDC drops hard thresholds from opioid guidance\n\nThe Biden administration's drug control strategy includes expanding access to the overdose reversal drug naloxone, fentanyl test strips and sterile needles. These techniques, known as harm reduction, aim to both prevent overdoses and reduce disease transmission.\n\nThe Biden plan cited the importance of \"syringe services\" programs that provide access to and disposal of clean needles and injection equipment and links to substance use disorder treatment. The plan calls for increasing the number of syringe services programs in counties with high overdose rates and expanding the use of fentanyl test strips. Studies have shown drug users who used test strips that detected fentanyl were more likely to switch to safer methods such as taking a smaller amount or avoiding the drug.\n\nThe Biden plan also aims to increase access to medications such as buprenorphine for people seeking treatment for opioid addiction.\n\nIt's the first time an administration has named harm reduction techniques as part of a national drug control policy, said Daliah Heller, vice president of drug use initiatives for Vital Strategies, a global public health nonprofit organization.\n\n\"The federal government can really play a leading role in pushing states to expand access to programs on the ground,\" Heller said.\n\nBiden's plan cited research that shows drug users who have access to needle exchange programs are more likely to seek drug treatment, and such programs help reduce transmission of HIV and hepatitis C among drug users.\n\nStill, 11 states prohibit the operation of needle exchange programs. Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida, and Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, have introduced legislation that would prohibit spending federal dollars for needles or \"other paraphernalia\" for use at syringe services centers.\n\nDelcher of the University of Kentucky said operating a syringe services center is challenging even when states allow such programs. Some health care providers might be reluctant or unavailable to serve people at such centers. And the centers need to build trust and rapport among drug users they intend to help.\n\n\"Even when you manage to establish a program like that, it still doesn't mean it will effectively be used,\" Delcher said. \"There's still that stigma. There are still those health care providers who wouldn't want to be part of that.

Sign up here.\n\nHong Kong CNN —\n\nWhen Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, he inherited a country at a crossroads.\n\nOutwardly, China seemed an unstoppable rising power. It had recently overtaken Japan as the world’s second-largest economy, the country still basking in the afterglow of the dazzling 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics.\n\nBut deep within the high walls of Zhongnanhai, the leadership compound where Xi spent time as a child visiting his late father Xi Zhongxun, a liberal-minded vice premier, China’s new leader saw a country in crisis.\n\nRampant corruption plagued the Communist Party and stoked popular discontent, chipping away at the legitimacy of a regime Xi’s father helped bring to power. The quest to get rich over decades of economic reform created a gaping wealth gap and hollowed out the official socialist ideology, fueling a crisis of faith. And as the Arab Spring toppled dictators in the Middle East, the rise of social media in China offered a rare space for public dissent, amplifying calls for social justice and political change.\n\nXi took these perceived challenges head on. Born a “princeling” – the offspring of revolutionary heroes who founded Communist China – the Chinese leader saw himself as savior, entrusted by the party to steer it away from threats to its survival.\n\nBut instead of following in the reformist footsteps of his father, Xi opted for a path of total control. Combining the old authoritarian playbook and new surveillance technology, he has eliminated his rivals, tightened his grip on the economy and made the party omnipresent in China – embedding his own cult of personality in daily life.\n\nThe Communist Party logo is seen on a skyscraper in Shanghai at dusk. Greg Baker/AFP/Getty Images\n\nXi also touted the “Chinese dream” of national rejuvenation, offering a tempting vision to restore China to its past glory and reclaim its rightful place in the world.\n\n“Xi Jinping sits on top of the party, the party sits on top of China, and China sits on top of the world. That’s basically the program,” said Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute in Australia.\n\n“Xi Jinping sits on top of the party, the party sits on top of China, and China sits on top of the world. That’s basically the program.” Richard McGregor, China expert\n\nTen years on, Xi’s China is richer, stronger and more confident than ever, yet it is also more authoritarian, inward-looking and paranoid than it has been in decades. It has bolstered its international clout, at the expense of its relations with the West and many of its neighbors.\n\nAt a key party congress beginning on Sunday, Xi is poised to be appointed to a norm-breaking third term. It will be his coronation as China’s most powerful leader since Chairman Mao Zedong, paving the way for potential lifelong rule.\n\nBut as Xi grapples with a sharp economic downturn, growing frustration with his uncompromising zero-Covid policy and surging tensions with the United States and its allies, the sense of crisis that beset his rise to power has continued to haunt him, and is set to shape his rule in the years – if not decades – to come.\n\nQuest for control\n\nXi saw the party’s crisis up close during his ascent to the top in 2012, when a sensational scandal brought down a prominent political rival and threatened to derail the leadership handover.\n\nBo Xilai, a fellow “princeling” and charismatic leader of the mega city of Chongqing, was vying for promotion into the top leadership when his police chief attempted to defect to a US consulate, accusing Bo of trying to cover up his wife’s murder of a British businessman. Party leaders feuded over how to deal with the fallout. Eventually, Bo was investigated and expelled from the party weeks before the five-yearly power reshuffle. Bo and his wife are today both serving life in prison.\n\nPerformers surround a large Communist Party flag during a mass gala marking the party's centenary in Beijing. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nHaving risen through the ranks in the bustling coastal provinces during China’s reform and opening up, Xi would have seen no shortage of local corruption. But the blatant abuse of power and deep rifts at the very top of the leadership exposed in Bo’s scandal likely aggravated Xi’s sense of peril for the party’s survival.\n\n“Our party faces many grave challenges and there are many pressing problems within the party that need to be solved, in particular corruption,” Xi said in his first speech hours after being appointed the top leader.\n\nWithin weeks, he launched the most brutal and long-lasting “war on graft” the party had ever seen. The sweeping purges targeted not only the corrupt, but also Xi’s political enemies, including powerful leaders who were accused of plotting a coup with Bo to seize power.\n\n“Government, the army, society and schools, east, west, south, north and center – the party leads them all.” Xi Jinping, China's leader\n\nThe crackdown instilled discipline, loyalty and a culture of fear, stifling opposition as Xi moved to amass power into his own hands. He styled himself as a strongman, eschewing the collective rule that was alleged to have exacerbated factionalism under his comparably weak predecessor Hu Jintao. In just four years, Xi asserted himself as the “core” of the party leadership, demanding its 96 million members to “unify their thinking, willpower and action” around him.\n\n“(Xi) thinks the only instrument with which he can rule China at home and make gains abroad is a unified, strong, and powerful Communist Party. So he has made it his mission to strengthen the party under his rule,” said McGregor at the Lowy Institute. “He’s both strengthened himself, and he’s strengthened the party as a vehicle for himself.”\n\nConsolidating the party from within was only part of his plan. Xi also set out to fortify the party’s grasp over the country. “Government, the army, society and schools, east, west, south, north and center – the party leads them all,” he said at the party congress in 2017.\n\nCovid workers in hazmat suits outside a sealed-off neighborhood during Shanghai's months-long lockdown this year. Hector Retamal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUnder Xi, the party reasserted itself in all aspects of life. It revitalized once-dormant grassroots party cells and set up new branches in private and foreign companies. It tightened its grip on the media, education, religion and culture, strangled civil society, and unleashed harsh crackdowns on Xinjiang and Hong Kong.\n\nXi also ramped up the party’s control of the economy, especially its once-vibrant private sector. His sweeping regulatory crackdown brought tycoons to heel and wiped out trillions of dollars of market value from Chinese firms.\n\nIn the online sphere, extensive censorship and real-life retaliation tamed social media. Instead of serving as a catalyst for social and political reforms, it became an amplifier for party propaganda and a breeding ground for nationalism.\n\nThe pervasive social control reached new heights during the pandemic. In the name of fighting Covid, 1.4 billion Chinese citizens lost their freedom of movement to the whims of the party and the prowess of the surveillance state. Cities across China are trapped in rolling, draconian lockdowns, sometimes for months on end, with millions of people confined to their homes or massive quarantine camps.\n\nPainful lessons\n\nFor Xi, safeguarding the party’s primacy is a painful lesson drawn from the Cultural Revolution, when the Communist establishment was attacked by Mao’s “red guards” and lost control over society.\n\nHundreds of thousands died in the turmoil, including Xi’s half-sister who was persecuted to death. Xi’s father was purged and tortured. Xi himself was incarcerated, publicly humiliated and sent to hard labor in an impoverished village at age 15.\n\n“Arguably, his emphasis on party authority, and stopping individuals who disagree with the party from criticizing (it), is a result of his phobia of chaos because of what he saw happened to himself, his mother, his father and siblings,” said Joseph Torigian, an expert on Chinese politics at American University and author of an upcoming biography on the elder Xi.\n\nRed Guards waving copies of Chairman Mao Zedong's \"Little Red Book\" parade in Beijing's streets at the start of the Cultural Revolution in 1966. JEAN VINCENT/AFP/Getty Images\n\nMany Chinese who survived the Cultural Revolution – including some party elites – came away with a conviction to prevent a similar catastrophe from happening again, China needed the rule of law, constitutionalism and protection of individual rights. But Xi arrived at a very different conclusion.\n\n“(He) believed that to achieve political order you needed to have a powerful leader, a powerful party, not creating a system in which people had rights that went too far, because they would only abuse them and hurt other individuals,” Torigian said.\n\nSo instead of turning against the party, Xi devoted himself to it. In interviews with state media, Xi spoke of how his seven years as a “sent-down youth” toughened him up and strengthened his resolve to serve the party and the people. “I was distilled and purified, and felt like a completely different man,” he told the People’s Daily in 2004.\n\nXi’s obsession for control was also shaped by the trauma of the collapse of the Soviet Union, which he has repeatedly cited as a cautionary tale for the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n“Why did the Soviet Union disintegrate? Why did the Soviet Communist Party collapse? An important reason was that their ideals and beliefs had been shaken,” Xi told senior officials in a speech months after taking the helm of the party.\n\nTo address China’s own crisis of faith, Xi cracked down on religion, reinvigorated the party’s official Marxist ideology and promoted his own eponymous philosophy. “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” is enshrined in the party charter and dominates party speeches and meetings. It also permeates billboards, newspaper front pages and cinema screens, and is taught in classrooms across the country – to children as young as 7.\n\n‘Chinese dream’\n\nAt the center of “Xi Jinping Thought” is the notion of the Chinese dream: the “great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation” – a vision Xi unveiled just weeks after coming to power.\n\nIt has since become a hallmark of his rule, shaping many of his policies at home and abroad.\n\n“Xi Jinping is a man with a mission. He believes that he knows the ways to take China to the promised land of national rejuvenation,” said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London.\n\n“He is going back to his mythical visions of Chinese history, when China was the greatest civilization and country in the world. And the rest of the world (should) just respect, admire and follow the leadership of China.”\n\nChinese students wave party and national flags at a ceremony marking the party's centenary on July 1, 2021. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nTo be sure, many Chinese are proud of their country’s achievements. Under Xi, China declared an end to extreme poverty, modernized its military, emerged as a leader in next-generation technology and greatly expanded its global influence. It is striving to become the dominant power in space, commands the world’s largest navy, and makes its weight felt as an emerging superpower.\n\nFor others, Xi’s Chinese dream has turned into their living nightmare. In the country’s far west, Muslim minorities are arbitrarily incarcerated, forcibly assimilated and closely surveilled. In Hong Kong, pro-democracy supporters saw their freedom and hope crushed in a city changed beyond recognition. Across the country, numerous rights lawyers, activists, journalists, professors and businessmen are languishing in jail, or silenced by fear. In Xi’s eyes, they are all perceived threats to his quest for a strong and unified nation, and thus must be remolded or eliminated.\n\nBut increasingly, the sheen of the Chinese dream is coming off for ordinary people, too – young professionals who chose to “lie flat” in the face of intense pressure, depositors who lost their life savings in rural banks, homebuyers who refused to pay mortgages on unfinished homes, as well as business owners, laid-off workers and residents pushed to the brink by Xi’s relentless zero-Covid lockdowns. Some of them might have previously rooted for Xi and his vision, but are now paying the price for his policies.\n\nThe most disillusioned are seeking a way out. “Run philosophy” has become a Chinese buzzword, advocating emigration to escape what some see as a doomed future under Xi’s rule. Xi has repeatedly touted that China is rising and the West is in decline – a conviction strengthened by America’s political polarization, and his belief that China’s superior political model has enabled it to fight Covid better than Western democracies. But the growing number of disciples of “run philosophy” is an outright rejection of that narrative, showing many Chinese have no faith in his promise to make China great again.\n\nConfronting the West, partnering with Russia\n\nUnderpinning Xi’s Chinese dream is a bitter sense of resentment toward the West, rooted in the nationalistic narrative that before the party took power, China suffered a “century of humiliation” at the hands of foreign powers and was invaded, carved up, occupied and weakened.\n\nIn recent years, American measures to counter China’s rising influence has only reinforced its sense of being under siege from Western powers, McGregor said.\n\n“It has a visceral, emotional appeal in China. It’s very powerful. I think Xi understands that and he intends to harness that to his own ends,” he said.\n\nAs a leader-in-waiting, Xi had already shown a strong disdain for foreign criticism of China. “There are some foreigners with full bellies who have nothing better to do than point fingers at us,” Xi told members of the Chinese community in Mexico on a visit as vice-president in 2009. “China does not export revolution, hunger or poverty. Nor does China cause you headaches. Just what else do you want?”\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping delivers a speech marking the 100th anniversary of the Communist Party in Beijing. Ju Peng/Xinhua/Getty Images\n\nBut Xi’s starkest warning to the West came last summer, when he presided over a grand celebration marking the party’s centenary. Standing on top of Tiananmen, or the Gate of Heavenly Peace, the towering entrance to the Forbidden City palace of imperial China, Xi declared the Chinese nation will no longer be “bullied, oppressed or subjugated” by foreign powers. “Anyone who dares to try, will find their heads bashed bloody against a great wall of steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people,” he said to thundering applause from the crowd.\n\n“Anyone who dares to try, will find their heads bashed bloody against a great wall of steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people.” Xi Jinping, China's leader\n\nSince coming to power, Xi has repeatedly warned against the “infiltration” of Western values such as democracy, press freedom and judicial independence. He has clamped down on foreign NGOs, churches, Western movies and textbooks – all seen as vehicles for undue foreign influence.\n\nAbroad, Xi embarked on an aggressive foreign policy. “Xi thinks this is China’s moment. And to seize that moment, he has to be assertive and take risks,” McGregor said.\n\nUnder Xi, China has openly competed for global clout with the United States, leveraging its economic heft to gain geopolitical influence. Its ties with the West are at their most fraught since the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre – and they were further soured by Beijing’s tacit support for Moscow following the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nXi and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin share a deep suspicion and hostility toward the US, which they believe is bent on holding China and Russia down. They also share a vision for a new world order – one that better accommodates their nations’ interests and is no longer dominated by the West.\n\nRussia's President Vladimir Putin reviews a military honour guard with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in Beijing in 2018. Greg Baker/Pool/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut it remains to be seen how many countries are willing to join that alternative perspective. Views of China have grown more negative during Xi’s decade in power across many advanced economies, and in some, unfavorable views reached record highs in recent years.\n\nBeijing’s sweeping claims of sovereignty have also antagonized many of its neighbors in the region. China built and militarized islands in the South China Sea, raised military tensions over a disputed island chain with Japan, and engaged in bloody border conflicts with India. It has also ramped up military intimidation of Taiwan, a self-governing democracy Xi has vowed to “reunify” with the mainland.\n\nFor its part, the US has awakened to the competition with China, and is working with allies and like-minded partners to take a raft of measures against Beijing on geopolitics, trade and technology.\n\nThat difficult international environment, along with the toll of zero-Covid and the economic headwinds, poses a big challenge for Xi in the years ahead.\n\nBut for the coming week, the party congress will be all about celebrating Xi’s victory. According to the party’s most updated official history, Xi has brought China “closer to the center of the world stage than it has ever been.”\n\nMao may have founded Communist China.

Busy, noisy affairs held in cavernous conference halls where hundreds of vendors try to sell expectant parents everything they could possibly desire for their new bundle of joy – and plenty of other things they never knew they needed.\n\nBut this is a shrinking business, and the customer base is dwindling.\n\nSouth Korea recently broke its own record for the world’s lowest fertility rate. Figures released in November showed the average number of children a South Korean woman will have in her lifetime is down to just 0.79.\n\nThat is far below the 2.1 needed to maintain a stable population and low even compared to other developed countries where the rate is falling, such as the United States (1.6) and Japan – which at 1.3 reported its own lowest rate on record.\n\nAnd it spells trouble for a country with an aging population that faces a looming shortage of workers to support its pension system.\n\nNurses at a nearly empty infant unit of a hospital in Seoul, South Korea, in February 2017. Yonhap/EPA/Shutterstock\n\nThe problem is commonly blamed on economic factors that have put off the young from having families – high real estate prices, the cost of education and greater economic anxiety – yet it has proved beyond the ability of successive governments to fix, however much money is thrown at it.\n\nCritics say that is a sign the problems go deeper than economics and that a change in approach is needed. Whether the government is listening is another matter.\n\nThrowing money at the problem\n\nDuring a visit to a nursery in September, South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol admitted that more than $200 billion has been spent trying to boost the population over the past 16 years.\n\nYet since assuming office in May, his administration has come up with few ideas for solving the problem other than continuing in a similar vein – setting up a committee to discuss the issue and promising yet more financial support for newborns. A monthly allowance for parents with babies up to 1-year-old will increase from the current 300,000 won to 700,000 won ($230 to $540) in 2023 and to 1 million Korean won ($770) by 2024, according to the Yoon administration.\n\nAccording to President Yoon Suk Yeol, South Korea has spent more than $200 billion in the past 16 years trying to solve its population problem. Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images\n\nThe public’s skepticism that Yoon has any better grip on the problem than his predecessors has only been reinforced by the president’s at times clumsy messaging.\n\nDuring his visit to the nursery, Yoon expressed surprise that babies and toddlers were not being looked after at home and appeared to suggest that it was common for 6-month-old babies to be able to walk, leading to criticism that he was out of touch (the average age for babies to walk is more like 12 months).\n\nMany experts believe the current throw-money-at-it approach is too one-dimensional and that what is needed instead is continuing support throughout the child’s life.\n\nPrams at a baby fair in Seoul, South Korea, on Sept. 15. Yonhap/EPA-EFE/Shutterstock\n\nBrowsing the stalls at a recent baby fair was Kim Min-jeong, whose second child is due this month. She brushed aside the government’s pledge of more funds, saying: “They’ve changed the names and merged allowances but for parents like us, there are no more benefits.”\n\nThe problem she faces, she said, is that she hasn’t been able to work since her first child was born as she and her husband cannot afford private child care.\n\nGovernment-funded nurseries are free but a handful of scandals in recent years involving caregivers striking infants has put many parents off. While the cases were minimal, they were well publicized and the CCTV footage emotive.\n\n‘A puritanical approach’\n\nAlso standing in the way of would-be parents are a host of problems that are more social than economic in nature and likely to endure however much money is splashed around.\n\nAmong them are what might be called the unwritten rules for parenthood.\n\nWhile having a baby is very much expected of married couples in South Korea, society still frowns on single parents. IVF treatment is not offered to single women, official hospital figures show.\n\n“We still have a very puritanical approach to single mothers,” said law professor Cho Hee-kyoung, who writes a newspaper column on social issues.\n\n“It’s as if they have done something wrong by becoming pregnant out of wedlock… why does it necessarily have to be within a marriage that you can raise a child?”\n\nMeanwhile, couples in non-traditional partnerships also face discrimination; South Korea does not recognize same-sex marriage and regulations make it difficult for unwed couples to adopt.\n\nAuthor Lee Jin-song at Spain Bookshop in Seoul where her books are sold. Charles Miller/CNN\n\nLee Jin-song, who has written books about the trend of young people choosing not to get married or have a baby, said policies to boost the birth rate need to embrace more than just the traditional idea of marriage as being between a man and a woman.\n\n“I’ve thought about how heterocentric and normality-centric discussion is in the traditional sense of marriage… (it) excludes people with disabilities, diseases or poor reproductive health,” Lee said.\n\nChoosing to stay single\n\nLee pointed to a common joke that in South Korea, “if you are not dating by the time you are 25, you’ll turn into a crane, meaning if you’re single you become non-human.”\n\nShe said society considers her, and others like her, selfish for not conforming to the traditional expectations of marriage and children, “neglecting their duties for society only for the sake of their happiness.”\n\nLee highlighted the pressures of having children on women in a patriarchal society that is slow to evolve. “Marriage, childbirth and child care require too much sacrifice for women in a patriarchal society especially over the past decade. So, they are beginning to explore the possibility of being able to live well without getting married.”\n\nProfessor Cho agreed, saying there is a lingering social expectation that the father sacrifices for the company and the mother supports the family, even if she also works.\n\n“I know so many couples where the women are actually earning more money than the men, but when they come home, it’s the women who have to do the housework and look after the children and provide emotional support to the husband.”\n\nThe job doesn’t end when the office shuts\n\nMeanwhile, husbands who would like to be more involved in child-rearing find the business culture in South Korea does not always allow for that.\n\nWhile on paper, parental leave has been increased, few feel comfortable to take it in full.\n\nBack at the baby fair, Kim’s husband Park Kyung-su said he is hoping to help with his second child, but “there is no special understanding or treatment from work for having a young child. I can use my time off, but I feel uncomfortable using it because I want good feedback at work.”\n\nThere is a widespread fear that the workers who are promoted are rarely the ones who put family first.\n\nLee Se-eun, a mother of two boys, hasn't worked in seven years.

Rather, there is a culture of “team-building” after hours, which it is frowned upon to miss.\n\nLee used to work in a brokerage firm before launching her own start-up, but she has not worked in seven years and feels there was no option to continue her career as she did not want to put her boys in child care.\n\n“Raising a child is a very valuable, meaningful and very good thing from a personal point of view, but sometimes it feels like it doesn’t get valued in society,” Lee said.", "authors": ["Paula Hancocks"], "publish_date": "2022/12/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/26/china/china-protests-xinjiang-fire-shanghai-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Protests erupt across China in unprecedented challenge to Xi ...", "text": "Beijing CNN —\n\nChinese leader Xi Jinping on Monday faced unprecedented dissent after thousands of demonstrators protested in cities across China over the weekend against his zero-Covid strategy – with some daring to openly call for his removal in the streets.\n\n“Step down, Xi Jinping!

In many parts of the country, residents in locked-down neighborhoods tore down barriers and took to the streets, following mass anti-lockdown protests that swept Urumqi on Friday night.\n\nSuch widespread scenes of anger and defiance – some of which stretched into the early hours of Monday morning – are exceptionally rare in China, where the ruling Communist Party ruthlessly cracks down on all expressions of dissent. But three years into the pandemic, many people have been pushed to the brink by the government’s incessant use of lockdowns, Covid tests and quarantines – as well as ever-tightening censorship and continued onslaught on personal freedoms.\n\nThe ratcheting-up of restrictions in recent months, coupled with a series of heartbreaking deaths blamed on an over-zealous policing of the controls, has brought matters to a head.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback He fully supported China's zero-Covid policy.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe wreck of the Titanic sits in two parts at the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean, slowly decaying nearly 4,000 meters (13,000 feet) below the surface, but it’s not alone. A sonar blip detected around 26 years ago has now revealed there’s much more to this underwater area than previously thought.\n\nP.H. Nargeolet, a veteran Nautile submersible pilot and Titanic diver, originally picked up the blip on echo sounding equipment in 1996, but its origins have remained unknown.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch footage from first Titanic dive in 14 years (2019) 01:02 - Source: CNN\n\nIn an expedition to the Titanic shipwreck earlier this year, Nargeolet and four other researchers went to the blip’s previously recorded location to search for the mysterious object it represented. Due to the blip’s magnitude, Nargeolet had believed he was looking for another shipwreck — he instead found a rocky reef, made up of various volcanic formations, and thriving with lobsters, deep-sea fish, sponges and several species of coral that could be thousands of years old.\n\n“It is biologically fascinating. The animals that live there are very different to the animals that are found otherwise living in the abyssal ocean,” said Murray Roberts, a professor of applied marine biology and ecology at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland and one of the researchers on the expedition. “(Nargeolet) did a really important piece of scientific work. He thought it was a shipwreck, and it turned out, in my mind, even more amazing than a shipwreck.”\n\nThe abyssal plain is a term used to describe the ocean floor at a water depth of 3,000 to 4,000 meters (around 12,000 feet), which makes up 60% of Earth’s surface, according to Roberts. It is thought to be a featureless, muddy seabed without much structure. On a few occasions, divers have observed rocky formations on the plain. Since the recent discovery near the Titanic, Roberts now believes such features might be more common than previously thought.\n\nRocky areas may also help explain the distances that sponges and corals travel across the ocean floor, which has always been a mystery to scientists. Within the muddy environment where they are typically observed, there are few hard surfaces for these species to latch onto in order to grow and reproduce.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback He found the Titanic. Here's his next mission 11:53 - Source: CNN\n\n“Sometimes they turn up in places where we think, ‘Well, how did they get there? They don’t live long enough to get there,” Roberts said. “But if there are more of these rocky places, these stepping stones, than we ever thought, I think it could help us understand the distribution of these species across the ocean.”\n\nThe researchers are currently working on analyzing images and videos taken of the reef during their dive, and they intend to share their findings to improve the scientific community’s collective knowledge of deep-sea life. Roberts also hopes to link this discovery to a wider Atlantic Ocean ecosystem project he leads, called iAtlantic, that will allow for further study and protection of the fragile ecosystem within the reef.\n\nThere is another sonar blip near the Titanic that Nargeolet is hoping to identify on a future expedition. It was recorded in the same survey he performed years ago, in between the wreck of the Titanic and the newly uncovered reef — now named the Nargeolet-Fanning Ridge after him and the 2022 expedition’s mission specialist Oisín Fanning. Nargeolet expects whatever it is to be even bigger than this reef.\n\nOceanGate Expeditions and their foundation — which, along with Fanning, provided the financial support for Nargeolet’s dive this year — will continue its longitudinal research work of the Titanic and surrounding areas in 2023.\n\n“The marine life … was so beautiful. It was really unbelievable, because I was never expecting to see that in my life,” Nargeolet said. “I’ll be very happy to continue to look at the Titanic.”", "authors": ["Taylor Nicioli"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/03/17/atlantic-oceans-hidden-canyons-revealed-last/81930894/", "title": "Exploring the Atlantic's hidden ocean canyons", "text": "Jennifer Brannock Cox\n\nThe (Salisbury, Md.) Daily Times\n\nNearly 100 miles from the bustling beaches along the Eastern Shore lies uncharted U.S. territory that is teeming with life and largely unexplored. Until now.\n\nScientists have spent the past five years attempting to understand the deep sea Baltimore and Norfolk canyons — so named for the larger Western Shore cities with which they share latitudinal lines. Now, the team is getting ready to release its final findings and maps next month, opening our eyes to a world and its inhabitants previously unknown.\n\nMore than 70 scientists from 20 different agencies and four countries collaborated on the estimated $10 million project to create undersea maps and develop an understanding of the habitats that exist within the mysterious canyons. The study included four expeditions over three years, mapping 6,406 square kilometers with instruments that spent more than 400 hours on the ocean floor.\n\nWhat they found could — and will — fill a 1,000-plus-page book that researchers believed helped prevent oil, gas and other companies from being able to lease land near the bio-diverse habitats for the purposes of energy exploration during the next five years.\n\nProposals to begin energy exploration off the eastern U.S. coastline were in the works for several years, and studies like this are required before any sales can take place. President Barack Obama announced Tuesday he will veto any plans to drill in the Mid-Atlantic region, largely due to environmental concerns raised in this and other studies.\n\n“Humans are moving deeper and deeper into the ocean as we exploit — or over-exploit — natural resources that people need,” said Florida State University professor Sandra Brooke, one of the two lead researchers on the project. “If we don’t understand what’s there, how it’s distributed, how the ecology works, then we run the risk of destroying ecosystems that we don’t understand.\n\n“We could be damaging something that could ultimately help us. We’d basically be shooting ourselves in the foot.”\n\nThe study outlining the canyon areas served as a preliminary guide for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management and its partnering agencies, which released a large-scale draft proposal targeting areas that could be leased to energy companies in January 2015, said Marjorie Weisskohl, public affairs specialist for BOEM. Responding to concerns from coastal residents and citing environmental, fishing and recreational conflicts, the region was removed from the table for the 2017-2022 plan, according to a statement from Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell.\n\nThanks in large part to this study, most of the areas surrounding the canyons were already off the table.\n\nUniversity of North Carolina-Wilmington professor Steve Ross, who co-lead the project with Brooke, said their findings in the canyons has helped protect much of the surveyed lands from energy exploration. The team took thousands of samples and photographs and was able to finally go beyond speculation and show the diverse species that live below where the light can reach.\n\n“This study has a huge impact on how we use and manage off-shore resources,” Ross said. “A picture is worth a thousand words. We’ve put into view the unique habitats that nobody has seen before.”\n\nBrooke believes adding the visual elements may help energy explorers and conservationists better understand the fragile ecosystems that could be damaged by drilling.\n\n“People won’t go out of their way to protect what they don’t know about or can’t see, so this outreach will be important to let people know what’s out there,” she said. “It’s not just a grainy picture anymore; it’s beautiful high-definition pictures that we can show in real time.”\n\nMapping the area for energy exploration was not the only goal of the expeditions. Brooke and Ross noted several key findings that could be particularly relevant to the Eastern Shore.\n\nScientists were shocked to learn the two canyons — which exist in similar regions and are roughly the same size and shape — are distinctly different from one another. Each canyon acts as its own planet, housing unique coral formations and sea life that can only exist in those areas.\n\nIn the sometimes over-fished waters off the coast of the Eastern Shore, the canyons often act as habitats for species in need of shelter to replenish their numbers and gain strength.\n\nRoss said one of the canyons contained a large population of cusk — a heavily fished species that was nearly added to endangered lists. The canyon reefs allow the fish to repopulate without abundant threats from predators and fishermen.\n\n“This study was not so much about the canyons themselves but what kind of habitats they provide,” Ross said. “The deep sea is very poorly studied, and what we’re finding is these deeper areas are highly productive, and those communities support a huge ecosystem that is underappreciated.\n\n“The canyons are different, and this indicates we have a long way to go.”\n\nResearchers also discovered methane emissions bubbling from sediment on the ocean floor, known as cold seeps, which certain species that don’t rely on the sun’s light need to survive.\n\nThe discovery of these seeps — previously only known to exist in the Atlantic farther north and south of the canyons — could aid protection efforts, as well. Energy companies are forbidden from drilling within close proximity of the seeps for fear of harming species that are only able to exist there, Weisskohl said.\n\nWhile their findings may seem like bad news for energy companies, Brooke insists knowing what ecosystems are in place will help those agencies more easily avoid damaging sensitive areas that could harm both the environment and their reputations.\n\n“If you want to take a cynical perspective, it actually behooves the energy industry to know where these sensitive ecosystems are and prevent that damage rather than dealing with bad public relations and having to repair them,” she said. “These companies have been doing this for a long time, and they are mandated to do these kinds of studies to understand how these ecosystems may conflict with their energy activities.”\n\nAlthough the final project won’t come out until the end of September, the research findings have already attracted attention, winning the team the coveted Excellence in Partnering Award from the National Oceanographic Partnership Program last month. The multi-agency collaboration included BOEM, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. Geological Survey, along with 12 universities and research institutions and two private companies.\n\nRoss said the recognition underscores the importance of the work they were able to accomplish only by acting as partners.\n\n“Instead of funding one project on fish or corals, we were able to get a lot more bang for the buck when we put together multiple disciplines,” he said.\n\nOf all the findings from the research, Brooke said the true satisfaction comes from creating awareness of the canyon ecosystems in hopes of getting others on board to protect the ocean’s vast resources.\n\n“Even though most people may never see them up close, it’s nice to know that the wilderness is there beyond our concrete jungle,” Brooke said. “It’s been there millions of years, and I don’t think we have the right to just come in and destroy it.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/asia/new-zealand-sea-sponge-bleaching-climate-change-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "New Zealand sea sponge populations 'dying by the millions' due to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nShocking images have emerged from New Zealand showing millions of once-velvety brown sea sponges bleached bone white, the worst mass bleaching event of its type ever recorded, marine scientists say.\n\nThe alarming discovery comes amid a continued rise in ocean temperatures, a trend that scientists say is overwhelmingly due to planet-warming fossil fuel emissions.\n\nNew Zealand scientists discovered thousands of bleached sea sponges in May of this year, in cold waters off the country’s southwestern coast. Further findings showed the damage was far worse, with millions – possibly tens of millions – of sea sponges affected throughout the Fiordland region.\n\n“This is one of the most abundant sponges in Fiordland, and so it’s a really wide-scale event,” said James Bell, a marine biology professor from New Zealand’s Victoria University.\n\nBell, who led the team responsible for spotting the initial bleaching event last month, told CNN that despite the extensive mass bleaching, some sponges were still alive and consuming oxygen.\n\n“This region was so abundant and rich in marine life and it was almost like a white graveyard when we discovered it, it was really devastating and traumatic,” he said. “We are able to conduct experiments on board our boat to try and understand how affected the sponges were by warmer temperatures. Unfortunately a lot of them were already very unhealthy and stressed.”\n\nNew Zealand is seeing its worst-ever mass bleaching of important sea sponges. Courtesy Dr Valerio Micaroni and Francesca Strano\n\nSea sponges come in a variety of sizes, colors and textures and play a crucial role in marine ecosystems, providing food and refuge for other marine animals like crabs, algae and fish.\n\n“They pump out large volumes of water and capture tiny particles, bacteria, plankton and algae and also recycle carbon on the sea floor,” Bell said. “They also provide shelter for marine creatures and increase habitat areas of the sea floor. They are very underappreciated creatures.”\n\nOceans heating up at record speed\n\nLast year was the hottest on record for the world’s oceans for the third year in a row, placing massive additional stress on marine ecosystems.\n\nThis year, Australia’s Great Barrier Reef suffered its sixth mass-bleaching event. Studies also confirmed coral bleaching at multiple reef sites.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is now believed to have lost more than half of its coral population to climate change in the past three decades, according to studies.\n\nSea sponges, like coral, are also heavily affected by extreme ocean temperatures and turn white as a stress response to temperatures that are too warm.\n\nThe sea creatures play an important role in marine ecosystems and scientists say their loss could affect millions of other marine animals.\n\nWarming ocean temperatures are affecting sea sponge populations in other parts of New Zealand too, Bell noted. Swathes of dead sea sponges were discovered in the country’s northern coastal areas. Some were found to be “melting” amid a lengthy marine heatwave.\n\n“The mass bleaching event highlights again how dramatically oceans are changing due to global warming and climate change,” he said. “It should serve as a wake-up call. We need climate action now, not in 10 or 15 years because by then it would be too late and we’d have lost all ecosystems and species.”", "authors": ["Heather Chen"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/07/australia/australia-plesiosaur-fossil-discovery-intl-hnk-scn/index.html", "title": "100 million-year-old plesiosaur skeleton discovery 'could hold the ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe discovery of a giant 100 million-year-old marine reptile’s skeleton in Australia has been hailed by researchers as a breakthrough that may provide vital clues about prehistoric life.\n\nThe remains of the 6-meter (19 feet) tall juvenile long-necked plesiosaur, also known as an elasmosaur, were found by a trio of amateur fossil hunters on a cattle station in the western Queensland outback in August.\n\nEspen Knutsen, senior curator of palaeontology at the Queensland Museum, likened the discovery to that of the Rosetta Stone – the Ancient Egyptian block of granite rediscovered in 1799 that helped experts to decode hieroglyphics.\n\n“We have never found a body and a head together and this could hold the key to future research in this field,” Knutsen said in a statement Wednesday that confirmed the discovery, adding it could give paleontologists greater insight into the origins, evolution and ecology of the cretaceous period in the region.\n\n“Because these plesiosaurs were two-thirds neck, often the head would be separated from the body after death, which makes it very hard to find a fossil preserving both together,” he said.\n\nThe discovery was made by amateur paleontologists known as the “Rock Chicks” – Cassandra Prince, her sister Cynthia, and fellow fossil sleuth Sally, who goes only by her first name.\n\nThe skull of the 100 million-year-old plesiosaur found in Queensland, Australia.

Unable to hear the low frequencies that travel furthest underwater, explorers and scientists believed the ocean was a “silent world,” according to French bioacoustics expert Michel André.\n\n“We (humans) ignored this acoustic dimension,” he says. “We contaminated the ocean with sound, without even having the first idea that this could have damaged it.”\n\nIn recent decades, the ocean’s depths have become noisier, with the rumble of ship engines, the intense pings of military sonar and seismic blasts used to locate oil and gas deposits. This cacophony of human-made sound is drowning out marine life’s natural chatter, and the impact is life-threatening.\n\nMammals such as whales have become isolated from their mates, their migration routes have been disrupted, and in some cases noise pollution has caused permanent hearing loss, which can be fatal.\n\nThe tail of a blue whale flicks above the water in the Gulf of Corcovado, Chile. Alex Machuca / MERI Foundation\n\n“Sound is life in the ocean,” says André. “If we pollute this channel of communication … we are condemning the ocean to irreversible change.”\n\nAndré and other scientists believe that increased noise pollution has led to more collisions between ships and whales, as the ocean giants – which use echolocation or biological sonar to “see” objects – can struggle to locate a vessel over the constant din, while some individuals have become so deaf they cannot hear the approaching danger. Since 2007, the International Whaling Commission has logged at least 1,200 collisions between ships and whales globally, but many more are likely to have gone unnoticed.\n\nSafe and quiet\n\nTechnology that uses acoustics to detect the presence of whales in shipping lanes could help to avert these collisions. André and his team at the Laboratory of Applied Bioacoustics in Barcelona have developed software called Listen to the Deep Ocean Environment (LIDO), which monitors acoustic sources in real time and uses artificial intelligence to identify them.\n\nIn October, a two-meter-long buoy equipped with this technology and other sensors will be dropped into the Gulf of Corcovado, off the coast of Chile, an area busy with both whales and ships. Using LIDO, it will be able to detect whales within at least a 10-kilometer radius and automatically send an alert to Chile’s navy, which will in turn send a message to nearby vessels, encouraging them to change course or reduce their speed. Ship engines make less noise at lower speeds, which makes it easier for whales to home in on their location.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback This man has made it his mission to listen to the Earth 04:20 - Source: CNN\n\nThe buoy will be the first of a wider network deployed as part of the Blue Boat Initiative, a program founded in 2020 by MERI Foundation, a scientific research organization based in Chile. The long-term goal is to have these kinds of buoys running along the coast of South America and beyond, providing a safe passage for migrating whales and other marine species, says Sonia Español-Jiménez, MERI’s executive director.\n\nThe Gulf of Corcovado was an obvious place to start. The body of water, which stretches more than 50 kilometers between Chiloé Island and the mainland of southern Chile, is a hotspot for whales – home to nine species – and the largest feeding ground in the southern hemisphere for the endangered blue whale.\n\nBut the area is also subject to intense marine traffic, with many vessels belonging to the salmon farming industry. However, research in the US has shown that reducing ship speed is a simple and cost-effective method for avoiding collisions with whales.\n\nThe noise from ship engines can disorientate whales, which rely on sound to navigate. Daniel Casado / MERI Foundation\n\nIn May 2021, after a run of deadly collisions on Chile’s coastline, more than 60 Chilean scientists made a plea to the government to reroute ships from sensitive regions, set speed limits in certain shipping lanes and establish an alert system to warn vessel pilots.\n\nSusannah Buchan, an associate researcher at the University of Concepción in Chile, was one of the signatories and is currently working with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) on adapting a similar acoustic alert system for Chilean waters. WHOI technology has already deployed in the Santa Barbara Channel, off the coast of California, and off the coast of Savannah, Georgia.\n\nWhile she sees “great potential in acoustic alert systems,” Buchan says it is important that they are fully validated in scientific literature and by a peer-review process. She also warns that acoustic alert systems are not a “silver bullet” that will end all ship strikes and must be complemented with other solutions such as slow-down zones.\n\nRelated: In the ocean’s twilight zone, this diver is discovering vibrant new species\n\nUnderstanding the ocean\n\nThe acoustic buoys deployed as part of the Blue Boat Initiative will not only work as an early warning system for vessels but will also use sensors to gather data such as water temperature, pH, and oxygen levels, which can be used to study ocean health and the impact of climate change.\n\nThey could also be used to help monitor local whale populations. “Every whale has a unique sound,” explains Español-Jiménez, and the buoy’s LIDO technology can identify and classify four of the whale species found in the Corcovado Gulf from their song – humpbacks, blue whales, right whales and sei whales. She adds that as the buoys gather more data, LIDO can be trained to identify other marine species.\n\nTogether all this data can be used to inform government policy and action on marine conservation and climate change, she says.\n\nTechnology is transforming our understanding of the ocean, says André. “It has brought back this capacity to hear underwater and to listen to creatures underwater and understand the need for them to survive in this environment.”\n\nA pioneer in bioacoustics, André’s work began in the 1990s, when he started investigating the cause of ship and whale collisions on a busy ferry route in the Canary Islands. His research found that whales’ exposure to noise was leading to “acoustic trauma,” with their inner ear receptors becoming severely damaged over time.\n\nIt was then that he had the idea to create an acoustic anti-collision system for whales, but the Blue Boat Initiative is the first time his technology will be implemented in the real world.\n\nRelated: Smart tech is helping to save China’s giant pandas\n\nAndré would like to see it become more widespread, crossing countries and continents. “My hope is that we can replicate this effort along the Pacific coast so we can cover the tracks of these whales up to Alaska,” he says.\n\nBy providing tools to identify sources of sound and to monitor biodiversity, André believes that humans can reconnect with nature and help it recover: “If we find a way to monitor, to listen, and to understand the message from sound, then we have a way to understand the health status of the Earth.”", "authors": ["Written Nell Lewis", "Video John Lewis"], "publish_date": "2022/09/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/02/19/scientists-seek-out-secret-salmon-during-ocean-voyage/2921493002/", "title": "Scientists seek out the secret of salmon during ocean voyage", "text": "Christopher Dunagan\n\nPuget Sound Institute\n\nAn international team of 21 scientists left Sunday on a wintry expedition that could help untangle some of the greatest mysteries surrounding Pacific salmon: Where do these migrating fish go when they leave their local waters, and why are they dying in such large numbers?\n\nBiologists, oceanographers and other specialists from five countries will travel into the rough waters of the Pacific Ocean during the winter in search of six species of salmon, as well as the prey they eat and the predators that would eat them.\n\nThe Russian research vessel, named Professor Kaganovsky, will traverse about 6,000 miles in a back-and-forth pattern, catching and studying marine creatures over an estimated 345,000 square miles of the ocean, including the Gulf of Alaska and areas off the coasts of British Columbia and Washington.\n\n“Nothing like this has ever been done before, considering the breadth of work we will be doing in the Gulf of Alaska in the winter,” said Dick Beamish, a longtime salmon researcher in Canada who conceived of the expedition and raised about $1 million to fund the voyage. The long-anticipated expedition is part of this year’s International Year of the Salmon.\n\n“After 100 years of research, we know a lot about Pacific salmon,” Beamish noted, “but most of what we need to know, we don’t know. We want to understand the mechanism of what regulates abundance.”\n\nNumbers alone don’t tell the story. Fifty years ago, about 5 percent of the chinook salmon that left the streams returned as adults, and that meant plenty of salmon for harvest and spawning. Today, if 1 percent comes back it’s a pretty good year. But so far nobody really knows what happens to the salmon that disappear into the ocean — often called the “black box” of salmon mortality — nor do they know why more chinook are dying today than ever before.\n\n“I think all of us accept the idea that we are changing our ocean ecosystems,” Beamish said.\n\nIn a 2001 research paper, Beamish and Conrad Mahnken of NOAA Fisheries hypothesized that most of the young fish entering the ocean died during their first year. Those that grow the fastest survive the best, they suggested. Smaller fish are more likely to fall prey to larger fish, they said, and those that fail to build up enough energy reserves for winter will become less fit and more vulnerable when food becomes scarce.\n\nThe expedition, intentionally scheduled for this time of year, will be able to take a close look at the young fish that have survived so far, said Laurie Weitkamp, a salmon biologist with NOAA’s Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Newport, Oregon.\n\n“We expect to see a lot of skinny fish with empty stomachs,” said Weitkamp, one of three chief scientists on board the research ship. “It might be a time when they start feeding again.”\n\nExperts hope to sample the entire food web — from the variety of plankton that feed the smaller fish to the salmon sharks (Lamna ditropis) that can make a meal of the adult salmon. By estimating the total number of each species in the ocean, the researchers hope to describe why some species do better than others, and possibly estimate the “carrying capacity” of the Gulf of Alaska.\n\nThe research ship will tow a variety of plankton nets to sample the tiny creatures as well as a midwater trawl net that can catch fish and other marine animals down to about 160 feet.\n\nLooking at the survivors near the end of winter and analyzing their genetic makeup may help researchers draw conclusions about the traits that give them an advantage, Weitkamp said. “Were they just in the right place at the right time, or are they the Michael Jordans of the salmon world?”\n\nThe nets will also catch adult salmon, including those getting ready to return to inland waters and their home streams. That information should help to more accurately forecast the size of the various salmon runs returning this summer and fall.\n\nBy checking the scales of the fish and their ear bones, called otoliths, the researchers will be able to tell the ages of each fish. Otoliths can also reveal the rate of growth through each stage of a salmon’s life.\n\nThrough DNA sampling, researchers will have a good idea about the origins of all the salmon caught during the expedition. Based on the time and location, they expect to find more pink and chum salmon than any other salmon species.\n\nThe expedition could directly confirm previous findings that chinook salmon from Alaska tend to stay in the Gulf of Alaska, while Puget Sound stocks move slightly north and west into deep water west of Vancouver Island. Measurements of temperature, salinity, prey type and abundance, along with other factors could reveal why some areas are preferred over others.\n\n“The different stocks all use the ocean differently,” Weitkamp said. “If you are only catching southern stocks to the south and northern stocks to the north, is it a temperature preference or is it possibly where there is a lot of prey?”\n\nThe expedition might tell something about competition between hatchery and wild fish as well as other effects that hatchery fish may have on the food web.\n\nBesides examining the DNA of salmon caught during the cruise, advanced “environmental DNA” techniques will be used to check water samples for a full list of other species that may be present in a given area.\n\nSome of the fish caught during the expedition will be released after being implanted with tiny instruments to measure water conditions while tracking their route of travel. Those fish will be tagged with an external disc, in hopes that someone will find and return the fish for data recovery.\n\nThe concept of building an international team of scientists to study salmon was promoted in a 2009 paper written by Beamish, Brian Riddell of the Pacific Salmon Foundation and 35 others. The paper argued that important discoveries are more likely to be accomplished by unifying the expertise of the five major salmon-producing countries in the North Pacific.\n\nBeamish learned that he could charter the best Russian research ship and crew, which are experienced in winter fishing and taking scientific measurements under grueling high-seas conditions. By stressing the importance of the voyage and international cooperation, Beamish has been able to raise more than $1 million, including contributions from the Canadian federal government, British Columbia government, Pacific Salmon Commission, Pacific Salmon Foundation, British Columbia Salmon Farmers Association, Sitka Foundation, Harmac Pacific paper company and others.\n\nHe has also enlisted an experienced team of researchers — including 10 Russians, six Canadians, three Americans, one Japanese and one Korean, who will live together in close quarters for the next month, sharing their lifelong findings and ideas. The expedition left from Vancouver, B.C.\n\n“Everybody knows that this is not going to be a luxury cruise,” Beamish noted. “These people have agreed to go out into the Gulf of Alaska in the winter, and they know they are going to get seasick.”\n\nA powerful attraction is the chance to make first-time observations with implications for short- and long-term salmon survival, Beamish said, adding, “It is likely that we will make discoveries that will change how we do salmon research in the future.”\n\nThis article was written for the Puget Sound Institute.

Wind energy supporters and whale advocates say these groups and politicians appear to be using whales as pawns.\n\nA Jan. 30 letter signed by 12 New Jersey mayors and a congressman, Chris Smith, R-N.J., called for a moratorium on all offshore wind activity. Conservation advocates say the letter spreads speculation when scientists aren't convinced whale deaths and offshore wind development are connected – and there's good reason to believe they are not.\n\nWhales and wind emerged in the headlines in January after a news conference Jan. 9 by two groups, Clean Ocean Action and Protect Our Coast New Jersey. They blamed the \"unprecedented\" discovery of six dead whales along New Jersey and New York coasts on early-stage geotechnical surveys mapping the sea floor for wind farms.\n\nThey advanced a festering concern that sound beams used in such surveys could harm whales. Conservation groups and the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management generally believe that's nonsense, in part because the type of sound used for wind turbine placement is much weaker than the stronger signals regularly used for other purposes such as oil and gas exploration.\n\nWHAT WE KNOW:Feds research whale mystery after more than a dozen dead whales wash up along East Coast\n\nThen the mayors' letter made national news with its call for a moratorium on all offshore wind activity until federal and state agencies determine there's no connection to a series of whale deaths.\n\nThe cause has also been taken up by Fox News personality Tucker Carlson, who has aired a series of segments in which he called wind turbines DDT for whales.\n\nLongtime whale advocacy groups aren't buying it.\n\n“It’s just a cynical disinformation campaign,” said Greenpeace oceans director John Hocevar. “It doesn’t seem to worry them that it’s not based in any kind of evidence.”\n\nScientists who study whale strandings say there’s no known link between wind turbines and whale deaths, although they continue to investigate what role, if any, wind development has in whale deaths.\n\nSo far, evidence for a link is little more than speculation. Experts point to the United Kingdom, which has 2,652 offshore wind turbines and where experts say autopsies have not found a connection between dead whales on their shores and the turbines off them.\n\nGib Brogan, a campaign director with Oceana, an international ocean advocacy group, said those opposed to wind power are using a spate of whale deaths in the area as an opportunity.\n\n\"It seems that the connection between the whale strandings and wind activities is a convenient line of opposition to development of offshore wind in the mid-Atlantic,\" he said.\n\nSome New Jersey politicians opposed offshore wind power before whale death concerns\n\nOf the 12 mayors who signed the letter, nine are Republican and one is a Democrat. In two towns, elections by law are nonpartisan. All represent small Jersey Shore beach towns.\n\nA USA TODAY review of public statements found at least two of the mayors had spoken critically of offshore wind, a key part of the nation's renewable energy plan with a goal of producing enough electricity to power 10 million homes by decade's end.\n\n“We’ve been 100% against this project from Day One,” Joe Mancini, mayor of Long Beach Township, said of the several wind farms in the proposal and research stage off the New Jersey shore.\n\nHow does climate change affect you?: Subscribe to the weekly Climate Point newsletter\n\nREAD MORE: Latest climate change news from USA TODAY\n\nMancini's concerns are numerous: He says the proposed wind farms will destroy fishing and hurt tourism. The turbines are unsightly and the energy they produce is too expensive, he claims. \"I don’t care how far out they put them,\" he said.\n\nInstead, he supports nuclear power as the solution to creating carbon-neutral energy.\n\nIn the borough of Deal, Mayor Sam Cohen signed the letter, but when contacted by USA TODAY, he expressed concern over possible dangers to birds. \"I have no idea how these wind turbines affect whales, but I would be interested to see a study on how these turbines affect fish and wildlife,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nDon Cabrera, a signer and mayor of the borough of Wildwood Crest, said he’s opposed to “tampering with our ecosystem and ocean floor and possibly harming marine and other life.” He believes sustainable energy should come from land-based wind turbines and solar farms.\n\nHe’s also not convinced the turbines, which he says would harm his town, won’t be visible from land.\n\nNew Jersey mayors have history of silence on whale deaths\n\nRep. Smith, who has supported wind power, introduced a bill in 2019 to ban the use of seismic air guns, primarily by oil and gas companies. The measure aims to protect the endangered North Atlantic right whale and other marine life. He has also supported a ban on offshore oil drilling.\n\nBut a USA TODAY review of news coverage of the mayors found no history of public concern for whale deaths, despite high rates of strandings dating back to 2017.\n\nThat year, 78 whales died along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. and Canada and 59 in 2018, 2019 and 2020, NOAA data shows.\n\n“I don’t know what to make of it that these people and these organizations that have not had a long-standing interest in whale conservation are becoming vocal opponents of offshore wind using whales as their vehicle,” Brogan said.\n\n\"Groups opposed to clean energy projects spread baseless misinformation that has been debunked by scientists and experts,\" said JC Sandberg, chief advocacy officer with the American Clean Power Association, a renewable energy trade group.\n\n“We have always worked alongside the environmental community to protect marine life and follow rigorous standards when developing projects. The recent whale strandings are tragic, but there is no evidence that these incidents have anything to do with offshore wind activity.\"\n\nThe dispute has made for strange bedfellows.\n\nThe Jan. 9 news conference featured Clean Action Ocean, a 39-year-old group founded to fight beach dumping, as well as Protect Our Coast New Jersey.

How they disrupt our daily life, fuel disasters.\n\nConservative organizations or oil and gas interests appear to be using whales as pawns in efforts to undermine offshore wind projects, said Leah Stokes, a professor of political science at the University of Santa Barbara.\n\nThe tactic has been used to fight the land-based wind installations, the Inflation Reduction Act and now offshore wind power, said Stokes, whose book “Short Circuiting Policy: Interest Groups and the Battle Over Clean Energy and Climate Policy in the American States” researched anti-wind-power networks.\n\n“They’re taking those legitimate environmental concerns and trying to manipulate the conversation by using topics that matter to the environmental movement,” she said.\n\nThe same tactic is used when those opposed to wind energy focused on bird deaths, which isn’t their actual concern, she said.\n\n“Folks may have other reasons they don’t like turbines, such as home prices or their own financial interests, but they’ll mask it in arguing it’s about protecting bird species,” she said.\n\nWhale deaths a problem, but no evidence connects them to wind, experts say\n\nThe East Coast is in the midst of a seven-year whale die-off that caused the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to declare an Unusual Mortality Event – an in-depth scientific investigation – for humpbacks in 2016. Two other unusual mortality investigations for whales began in 2017, one for minke whales and one for North Atlantic right whales.\n\nSince Dec. 1, seven dead humpback whales and one sperm whale have been seen along the New Jersey shore, and eight other humpbacks and two North Atlantic right whales washed up along the coast between New York and North Carolina.\n\nBoth a humpback that washed ashore in Manasquan, New Jersey on Monday and a right whale found dead on Virginia Beach on Sunday showed internal evidence of vessel strikes, NOAA said. At least three of the January whale deaths have been attributed to vessel strikes.\n\nIt's not clear this is an outsized number compared with past years.\n\n“It is too soon to speculate about this year being higher than any others,” said NOAA spokeswoman Allison Ferreira.\n\nGreenpeace's Hocevar isn't concerned.\n\n“There’s no evidence that we’ve seen implicating wind turbines and the deaths of whales on the East Coast,\" he said.\n\nSo far, the United States has only two in operation, with a total of just seven turbines. Another two are in the construction stage, one off New York and one off Massachusetts.\n\nLonger-term, 10 projects are in the environmental review process, meaning it will be years before construction can begin.\n\n“While the climate deniers and the right-wing pundits are tilting at windmills,\" Hocevar said, \"most of us are focused on the real threats to whales ­– climate change, entanglement with fishing gear, ship strikes and plastic pollution.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/11"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/28/world/top-climate-weather-stories-2022/index.html", "title": "Devastating disasters and flickers of hope: These are the top climate ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFrom a small island in Polynesia to the white-sand beaches of Florida, the planet experienced a dizzying number of climate and extreme weather disasters in 2022.\n\nBlistering summer heat broke records in drought-stricken China, threatening lives and food production. In the United States, drought and sea level rise clashed at the mouth of the historically low Mississippi River. And in South Africa, climate change made rainfall that triggered deadly floods heavier and twice as likely to occur.\n\nYet against the backdrop of these catastrophic events, this year also sparked some glimmers of hope:\n\nScientists in the US successfully produced a nuclear fusion reaction that generated more energy than it used – a huge step in the decades-long quest to replace fossil fuels with an infinite source of clean energy.\n\nAnd at the United Nations’ COP27 climate summit in Egypt, nearly 200 countries agreed to set up a fund to help poor, vulnerable countries cope with climate disasters they had little hand in causing.\n\n“There was some encouraging climate action in 2022, but we remain far off track to meet our goals of reducing global heat-trapping emissions and limiting future planetary warming,” Kristina Dahl, principal climate scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN. “There must be a stronger collective commitment and progress toward slashing emissions in 2023 if we are to keep climate extremes from becoming even more devastating.”\n\nHere are the top 10 climate and extreme weather stories of 2022.\n\n10. Tonga volcano eruption and global tsunami\n\nA zoomed-in view of the Tonga eruption, taken by Japan's Himawari-8 satellite, about 100 minutes after the eruption started. Simon Proud/Uni Oxford, RALSpace NCEO/Japan Meteorological Agency\n\nWhen the Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha’apai volcano erupted in January, it sent tsunami waves around the world. The blast itself was so loud it was heard in Alaska – roughly 6,000 miles away. The afternoon sky turned pitch black as heavy ash clouded Tonga’s capital and caused “significant damage” along the western coast of the main island of Tongatapu.\n\nThe underwater volcanic eruption also injected a huge cloud of ash and sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere, more than 30 kilometers (around 19 miles) above sea level, according to data from NASA satellites.\n\nAt the time, experts said the event was likely not large enough to impact global climate.\n\nBut months later, scientists found that the eruption actually belched an enormous amount of water vapor into the Earth’s stratosphere – enough to fill more than 58,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. The massive plume of water vapor will likely contribute to more global warming at ground-level for the next several years, NASA scientists reported.\n\n9. Rivers hit record lows\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Severe drought reveals incredible discovery at bottom of Mississippi river 00:45 - Source: CNN\n\nSearing temperatures, lack of rainfall and low snowpack pushed some of the world’s most vital rivers to new lows this year.\n\nNorthern Italy saw its worst drought in more than 70 years. The 400-mile River Po hit a record low due to an unusually dry winter and limited snowpack in the Alps, which feeds the river. The drought impacted millions of people who rely on the Po for their livelihood, and roughly 30% of the country’s food, which is produced along the river.\n\nAlso fed by winter snowpack in the Alps along with spring rains, Germany’s Rhine River dropped to “exceptionally low” levels in some areas, disrupting shipping in the country’s most important inland water way. Months of little rainfall meant cargo ships began carrying lighter loads and transport costs soared.\n\nMeanwhile in the US, extreme drought spread into the central states and gauges along the Mississippi River and its tributaries plummeted. Barge traffic moved in fits and starts as officials dredged the river. The Mississippi River dropped so low that the Army Corps of Engineers was forced to build a 1,500-foot-wide levee to prevent Gulf-of-Mexico saltwater from pushing upstream.\n\n8.

Leah Millis/Reuters\n\nAfter more than a year of negotiations, Democrats in late July reached an agreement on President Joe Biden’s long-stalled climate, energy and tax agenda – capping a year of agonizing negotiations that failed multiple times.\n\nBiden signed the bill into law in August and signaled to the world that the US is delivering on its climate promises.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Joe Manchin was influential in delaying the bill’s passage. Multiple White House and Biden administration officials for months had tried to convince the senator to support the bill over dinners in Paris and ziplining in West Virginia.\n\nAn analysis suggests the measures in the bill will reduce US carbon emissions by roughly 40% by 2030 and would put Biden well on his way to achieving his goal of slashing emissions in half by 2030.\n\n7.

The rare, late-season storm also marked the first time that a hurricane made landfall on Florida’s east coast in November.\n\nAlthough Nicole was only a category 1, it had a massive wind field that stretched more than 500 miles, coupled with astronomically high tides that led to catastrophic storm surge. Homes and buildings collapsed into the ocean in Volusia County, with authorities scrambling to issue evacuation warnings.\n\nHurricane Nicole flooded streets, destroyed power lines and killed at least five people.

It was the first time wealthy, industrialized countries and groups, including longtime holdouts like the US and the EU, agreed to establish such a fund.\n\n“We can’t solve the climate crisis unless we rapidly and equitably transition to clean energy and away from fossil fuels, as well as hold wealthy nations and the fossil fuel industry accountable for the damage they have done,” Rachel Cleetus, policy director and lead economist for the climate and energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, told CNN.\n\n5.

The month was Jackson's wettest July on record. Michael Swensen/Getty Images\n\nThe summer’s series of floods started off in Yellowstone National Park in June, when extreme rainfall and rapidly melting snow washed out roads and bridges in the park, causing significant damage to the nearby town of Gardiner, Montana, at the park’s entrance. Authorities had to rescue more than 100 people from the floods.\n\nThe year also brought several 1,000-year rainfall events. A 1,000-year rainfall event is one that is so intense it’s only seen on average once every 1,000 years – under normal circumstances. But extreme rainfall is becoming more common as the climate crisis pushes temperatures higher. Warmer air can hold more moisture, which loads the dice in favor of historic rainfall.\n\nDeadly flooding swept through Eastern Kentucky and around St. Louis in July after damaging, record-breaking rainfall in a short period of time.\n\nCalifornia’s Death Valley, after a yearslong dry spell, saw its rainiest day in recorded history.\n\nMeanwhile, down south, parts of Dallas, Texas, got an entire summer’s worth of rain in just 24 hours in August, prompting more than 350 high-water rescues.\n\n4.

Stephen Belcher, the UK Met Office’s chief scientist, said this would have been “virtually impossible” in an “undisrupted climate.”\n\nThroughout western Europe, the heatwaves gravely increased wildfire risk, with one London fire official noting that the 40-degree day led to an “unprecedented day in the history of the London Fire Brigade.”\n\n3.

Plagued by decades of overuse and a climate change-fueled drought, the river that serves 40 million people in seven western states and Mexico is draining at an alarming rate.\n\nThe water levels in its two main reservoirs – Lake Mead and Lake Powell – have plunged rapidly, threatening drinking water supply and power generation. In late July, Lake Mead – the country’s largest reservoir – bottomed out and has only rebounded a few feet off record lows. Its rapidly plunging levels revealed human remains from the 1970s and a sunken vessel from World War II.\n\nThe federal government implemented its first-ever mandatory water cuts this year for states that draw from the Colorado River, and those cuts will be even deeper starting in January 2023.\n\n2. Catastrophic flooding in Pakistan\n\nFlood-affected people carry belongings out from their flooded home in Shikarpur, Sindh province, in Pakistan in August. Asif Hassan/AFP/Getty Images\n\nFloods caused by record monsoon rain and melting glaciers in Pakistan’s northern mountain regions claimed the lives of more than 1,400 people this summer, with millions more affected by clean water and food shortages. More than a third of Pakistan was underwater, satellite images showed, and authorities warned it would take months for the flood waters to recede in the country’s hardest-hit areas.\n\nUN Secretary General António Guterres said the Pakistani people are facing “a monsoon on steroids,” referring to the role that the climate crisis had in supercharging the extreme rainfall. The hard-hit provinces Sindh and Balochistan saw rainfall more than 500% of average during the monsoon season.\n\nPakistan is responsible for less than 1% of the world’s planet-warming emissions, yet it is the eighth most vulnerable nation to the climate crisis, according to the Global Climate Risk Index.\n\n1. Hurricane Ian\n\nDestruction in the wake of Hurricane Ian on October 4 in Fort Myers Beach, Florida. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nHurricane Ian was a Category 4 storm when it made landfall in southwest Florida in late September and left a trail of destruction from the Caribbean to the Carolinas. Insured losses from Ian are expected to reach up to $65 billion, according to recent data from reinsurance company Swiss Re.\n\nThe storm first struck Cuba before undergoing rapid intensification from a tropical storm to a category 3 hurricane in just 24 hours – something scientists told CNN is part of a trend for the most dangerous storms. That same week, Super Typhoon Noru in the Philippines grew from the equivalent of a category 1 hurricane to a category 5 overnight as residents around Manila slept, catching officials and residents unaware and unable to prepare.\n\nHurricane Ian’s size and intensity allowed it to build up a storm surge higher than any ever observed in Southwest Florida, devastating Fort Myers and Cape Coral. Ian killed more than 100 people, most by drowning. It will likely be one of the costliest hurricanes on record not only in Florida, but in the US.", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/05/28/biolabs-pathogens-location-incidents/26587505/", "title": "Inside America's Secretive Biolabs | USA Today", "text": "Alison Young and Nick Penzenstadler, USA TODAY\n\nVials of bioterror bacteria have gone missing. Lab mice infected with deadly viruses have escaped, and wild rodents have been found making nests with research waste. Cattle infected in a university's vaccine experiments were repeatedly sent to slaughter and their meat sold for human consumption. Gear meant to protect lab workers from lethal viruses such as Ebola and bird flu has failed, repeatedly.\n\nA USA TODAY Network investigation reveals that hundreds of lab mistakes, safety violations and near-miss incidents have occurred in biological laboratories coast to coast in recent years, putting scientists, their colleagues and sometimes even the public at risk.\n\nOversight of biological research labs is fragmented, often secretive and largely self-policing, the investigation found. And even when research facilities commit the most egregious safety or security breaches — as more than 100 labs have — federal regulators keep their names secret.\n\nOf particular concern are mishaps occurring at institutions working with the world's most dangerous pathogens in biosafety level 3 and 4 labs — the two highest levels of containment that have proliferated since the 9/11 terror attacks in 2001. Yet there is no publicly available list of these labs, and the scope of their research and safety records are largely unknown to most state health departments charged with responding to disease outbreaks. Even the federal government doesn't know where they all are, the Government Accountability Office has warned for years.\n\nA team of reporters who work for the USA TODAY Network of Gannett newspapers and TV stations identified more than 200 of these high-containment lab facilities in all 50 states and the District of Columbia operated by government agencies, universities and private companies. They're scattered across the country from the heart of New York City to a valley in Montana; from an area near Seattle's Space Needle to just a few blocks from Kansas City's Country Club Plaza restaurant and shopping district.\n\nHigh-profile lab accidents last year with anthrax, Ebola and bird flu at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the discovery of forgotten vials of deadly smallpox virus at the National Institutes of Health raised widespread concerns about lab safety and security nationwide and whether current oversight is adequate to protect workers and the public. Wednesday the Department of Defense disclosed one of its labs in Utah mistakenly sent samples of live anthrax -- instead of killed specimens – to labs across the USA plus a military base in South Korea where 22 people are now being treated with antibiotics because of their potential exposure to the bioterror pathogen. As many as 18 labs in nine states received the samples, the CDC said Thursday.\n\n\"What the CDC incidents showed us ... is that the very best labs are not perfectly safe,\" says Marc Lipsitch, a Harvard University professor of epidemiology. \"If it can happen there, it certainly can happen anywhere.\"\n\nSome people find little reassurance that nobody was sickened in the CDC accidents or in the historically low numbers of serious infections among lab workers generally, or that infections spreading into communities surrounding labs have been rarer still.\n\n\"Many of us think that's really a matter of good fortune,\" said Beth Willis, who chairs a citizen lab advisory panel in Frederick, Md., home to one of the nation's largest high-containment research campuses at the Army's Fort Detrick.\n\nThe country's best labs have robust safety programs, said Kenneth Berns, co-chair of a panel of outside lab safety advisers currently examining biosafety at CDC and other federal labs. Yet the systemic safety problems identified at the CDC's prestigious labs have raised questions about what's happening elsewhere. \"It's a matter of some concern,\" said Berns, a distinguished professor emeritus of molecular genetics and microbiology at the University of Florida.\n\nThe consequences could be devastating if accidents were to occur with lab-created strains of deadly influenza viruses that are purposely engineered to be easier to spread than what's found in nature, said David Relman, a microbiology professor at Stanford University who is a federal adviser on lab safety and a past president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\n\"You're talking about something that has the ability to take off, and we could not be confident of being able to contain it,\" he said.\n\nRelman said that not enough is known about the state of safety at labs that perform infectious disease research but emphasized that the kinds of labs drawing concern are the same ones the public needs to discover important new treatments and vaccines. \"We have to find some happy blend of minimized risk and enhanced benefit,\" he said.\n\nAt the high-containment labs identified by USA TODAY, experiments are underway involving drug-resistant tuberculosis, exotic strains of flu, the SARS and MERS viruses, plague, anthrax, botulism, ricin and the Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fever viruses, according to interviews and more than 20,000 pages of internal lab safety records and incident reports obtained from labs across the country.\n\nStudies are also being done on a wide range of bioterrorism pathogens that are less known to the public, such as the agents that cause exotic diseases like tularemia, Q fever and melioidosis. Still others are focused on pathogens that pose serious economic risks to agriculture, such as foot-and-mouth disease, brucellosis and \"mad cow\" disease.\n\nAt a few labs, experiments have been done with strains of flu and other viruses purposely made to be more dangerous in studies that seek to understand how they might mutate naturally. White House science advisers called for a temporary halt of that kind of \"gain of function\" research last fall while expert scientific panels spend the next year studying its risks and benefits.\n\nThe research at BSL-3 and BSL-4 labs — which use special equipment, negative air pressure and numerous safety and security procedures — seeks to better understand how organisms cause disease and ways to protect against them. It's the kind of work that the public doesn't give much thought to until people with Ebola arrive on planes in the United States from an outbreak in Africa, or the current avian flu outbreak forces farmers to kill millions of chickens raising the specter of higher egg prices.\n\nIt's impossible to obtain a full accounting of lab accidents or lab-acquired infections because there is no universal, mandatory requirement for reporting them and no system to analyze trends to assess emerging biosafety risks and disseminate lessons learned on a regular basis.\n\nThe Federal Select Agent Program, which inspects and regulates the subset of research labs that experiment with about four dozen types of pathogens deemed to pose bioterror threats, requires labs to report potential exposure or release incidents, as well as thefts or losses of specimens.\n\nFrom 2006 through 2013, labs notified federal regulators of about 1,500 incidents with select agent pathogens and, in more than 800 cases, workers received medical treatment or evaluation, limited public data in program annual reports show. Fifteen people contracted laboratory-acquired infections and there were three unintended infections of animals, according to the reports, which do not identify labs and mostly provide aggregated counts of incidents by type. Reported incidents involve events ranging from spills to failures of personal protective equipment or mechanical systems to needle sticks and animal bites.\n\nThe program, jointly run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, refuses to release copies of detailed incident reports, citing a 2002 bioterrorism law.\n\nIncident records the USA TODAY Network obtained directly from individual labs provide a window on the kinds of mistakes that happen. An animal caretaker in Georgia was potentially exposed to a bird flu virus that kills 60% of the people it infects when a defective respirator hose supplying purified air detached from its coupling in September. A researcher in Wisconsin was quarantined for seven days in 2013 after a needle stick with a version of the same H5N1 influenza virus. A lab worker in Colorado failed to ensure specimens of the deadly bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei had been killed before shipping them in May 2014 to a co-worker in a lower-level lab who handled them without critical protective gear. None of the workers was infected.\n\nThe public and the lab community tend to learn only about the rare instances of serious or fatal lab infections, which sometimes are published as case reports in scientific journals or make national news.\n\nIn 2009, Malcolm Casadaban, a University of Chicago scientist with an underlying medical condition, died from an infection with a weakened strain of plague bacteria. In 2012, 25-year-old researcher Richard Din died after being infected during vaccine research involving Neisseria meningitides bacteria at a lab inside San Francisco's VA medical center. Both of their deaths involved research in biosafety level 2 labs, where pathogens are considered to be less dangerous than those worked with in high-containment labs.\n\nDin, who became a researcher to cure diseases like the cancer that killed his mother, developed a fever and started feeling dizzy while out to dinner with friends. He had no idea how serious his symptoms were, his friends and family told USA TODAY. By morning, Din was covered in a splotchy rash and could barely talk, recalled Lawrence Tsai, who raced to Din's apartment to help.\n\nTsai carried his friend down two flights of stairs and drove him to the hospital. \"His body was very hard, very straight,\" Tsai said. \"Only his eyes were open. He could not say anything.\"\n\nA few hours later, Din was dead. And Tsai said he and his friends were told they, too, were at risk and needed to take antibiotics because of their close contact with him. The bacteria that killed Din can spread from person to person by direct contact with respiratory secretions. About two dozen emergency room workers also were treated with antibiotics as a precaution, according to a presentation about the case at a scientific conference. Nobody else was sickened.\n\nFederal workplace safety investigators, who investigated because the case involved a death, said Din died because the VA failed to adequately supervise and protect workers in the research lab. Among the \"serious\" issues they cited: Din and other workers in the lab were manipulating specimens of the dangerous bacteria out on tabletops — not inside protective biosafety cabinets that would have reduced potential exposures to droplets or splashes. The lab also failed to train workers about warning signs of infection, violation records show.\n\nAlthough lab-created outbreaks that spread to people or animals in the surrounding community are rare, they have happened.\n\n\"That's what you would worry about,\" said Gigi Kwik Gronvall, of the UPMC Center for Health Security, an independent think tank that studies biosecurity and epidemics. \"But even then the consequences up to now have been limited to the very close contacts of the person who was infected.\"\n\nA small, deadly outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in China in 2004 was traced to lab workers at the National Institute of Virology in Beijing. In 2007, an outbreak of foot and mouth disease among cattle in England that required herds to be slaughtered was blamed on leaking drainage pipes at a nearby research complex.\n\nIn Louisiana, tests are underway to make sure a deadly bioterror bacterium hasn't colonized the soil and water around the Tulane National Primate Research Center near New Orleans. Late last year, the bacteria got out of one of the center's BSL-3 labs, likely hitching a ride on workers' clothing, sickening two monkeys that lived in outdoor cages and later infecting others. Tulane will spend the next five years testing its outdoor monkey colony as well as wildlife and feral cats around the 500-acre facility to ensure the bacteria haven't contaminated the environment. The CDC and Tulane say they think the bacteria spread only inside the center's buildings, and so far tests outdoors have not detected the bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, which can cause severe and difficult-to-treat illness in people and animals infected by coming into contact with contaminated soil or water.\n\nOn a global scale, a lab accident is considered by many scientists to be the likely explanation for how an H1N1 flu strain re-emerged in 1977 that was so genetically similar to one that had disappeared before 1957 it looked as if it had been \"preserved\" over the decades. The re-emergence \"was probably an accidental release from a laboratory source,\" according to a 2009 article in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nHowever, most pathogens studied in labs, unlike the flu, don't spread easily from person to person. Often, to become infected a person needs to have direct contact with a pathogen, which is why lab workers are most at risk, experts said. For example, people can become infected with anthrax by inhaling the bacterium's spores, but once sickened they are not contagious, according to the CDC.\n\n\"I don't think the public needs to be too concerned,\" said Marian Downing, president of the American Biological Safety Association. \"There are multiple levels of checks and balances in place.\"\n\nBeyond accidental lab-associated outbreaks, federal auditors consider the deliberate theft and misuse of a deadly pathogen to be one of the most significant risks of biolab research. That's what the FBI says happened in the 2001 anthrax letter attacks that killed five and sickened 17. Bruce Ivins, a biologist and anthrax researcher at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) at Fort Detrick, Md., was the perpetrator, the FBI concluded.\n\nThe GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, has issued repeated warnings since 2007 that the proliferation of BSL-3 and BSL-4 laboratories has increased the aggregate risk of accidental or intentional releases of viruses, bacteria or toxins.\n\nNo single agency tracks the overall number or location of these labs, the GAO has said. Little is known about high-containment labs working with dangerous pathogens such as tuberculosis, the MERS virus and others that aren't on the select agent list and tracked by the Federal Select Agent Program.\n\nNational standards for constructing and operating these kinds of labs are lacking, which means labs vary by local building requirements. While voluntary guidance exists for safe lab design and operations, the GAO has found it is not universally followed.\n\nThe documents obtained by USA TODAY show power failures at BSL-3 labs at Texas A&M University repeatedly resulted in the labs losing their negative air pressure during 2013, a key safety feature that is among several used to keep pathogens contained inside the lab. The CDC's labs in Atlanta also have had airflow problems over the years, the newspaper previously reported.\n\n\"The public is concerned about these laboratories because exposing workers and the public to dangerous pathogens, whether deliberate or accidental, can have disastrous consequences,\" the GAO's Nancy Kingsbury told Congress at a hearing on the CDC lab incidents last summer.\n\nLab regulators at the Federal Select Agent Program — whose departments often fund the research they oversee — would not grant interviews despite repeated requests since last year. The program oversees about 262 organizations that operate BSL-3 and eight organizations that operate BSL-4 labs.\n\nThe two federal agencies that jointly run the program — the CDC and USDA — operate their own labs, which have been involved in recent high-profile incidents.\n\n\"We believe the current system of inspecting/overseeing laboratories is adequate, but we are always open to continued improvements,\" the CDC said in an emailed statement. USDA officials also declined to be interviewed.\n\nLab safety officials at the National Institutes of Health, a major research funding agency that operates its own labs and helps set national biosafety guidelines, also declined interview requests.\n\n\"There is no 'zero-risk' proposition in the conduct of research,\" the agency said in a statement. \"NIH works extremely hard to minimize all research-related risks.\"\n\nMore than 100 labs experimenting with potential bioterror agents have been cited by regulators at the CDC and USDA for serious safety and security failings since 2003, USA TODAY has learned.\n\nYet so much of select agent oversight is cloaked in secrecy, making it difficult to assess regulators' effectiveness in ensuring safety. In several instances, troubled labs and even federal regulators appeared to misrepresent the significance of the government's enforcement efforts.\n\nSince 2003, the CDC has referred 79 labs for potential enforcement actions by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Inspector General. It has levied fines against 19 of them totaling more than $2.4 million, the CDC said in response to questions.\n\nSome are repeat offenders. Five labs have had \"multiple referrals\" for enforcement actions, the CDC said. Two labs have been kicked out of the program, and five labs have been suspended from doing any select agent research, the agency said.\n\nWhich labs repeatedly failed to address safety problems? The CDC won't name names — not even for the two labs kicked out of the select agent program. The CDC and its regulatory partners at the USDA say the 2002 bioterrorism law requires keeping this information secret.\n\nYet earlier this year, the CDC publicly announced its suspension of the Tulane National Primate Research Center — after the center's accidental release of a bioterror bacterium became publicly known and was the subject of news reports. The CDC said it balances the public's right to transparency with the risk posed by information being made available to those who might use it to threaten public health or security.\n\nCurrently seven labs are under the extra scrutiny of a federal select agent lab performance improvement program, the CDC said. The program is offered as a voluntary alternative to suspension or other regulatory action, the agency said, for labs with a \"repeated failure to correct past observation, biosafety and security concerns\" or failures to comply with extra security requirements for work with \"Tier 1\" select agents. Tier 1 agents are those deemed to pose the greatest risk of deliberate misuse with the most significant potential for mass casualties or devastating economic effects.\n\nWhile under scrutiny of the program, an individual researcher or project must halt the research that has been found in violation, but other select agent research at the institution generally is allowed to continue, the CDC said.\n\nThirty-three labs have been put on performance improvement programs since 2008, CDC said. Their names are secret too.\n\nDozens more labs have faced regulatory actions from the USDA, which takes the lead overseeing select agent labs primarily working with animal or agricultural pathogens. The USDA says it has conducted 48 investigations that have resulted in $116,750 in fines.\n\nThe USDA said all of its enforcement records about these fines are required to be kept secret because of the 2002 bioterrorism law. The USDA did release a spreadsheet it says documents its actions, but the agency redacted almost all the information on it: lab names, violation types and even dates. Only a few references to warning letters and fines were spared the agency's black marker.\n\nThe Federal Select Agent Program says no law or regulation bars the labs themselves from discussing their select agent research. And universities and other research institutions routinely publish their research on select agent pathogens in scientific journals.\n\nRegistered labs just aren't supposed to share details of specific security measures, such as locations of keys and codes, that would give access to pathogens. The CDC and USDA said there is nothing that prohibits labs from releasing information or answering questions about any regulatory problems they've had. Yet few were willing to readilydiscuss violations or failed inspections.\n\nLabs at the University of Hawaii-Manoa are among those in the federal performance improvement program, at least as of January, records obtained by USA TODAY show. Although the secrecy provisions of the 2002 bioterrorism law apply only to certain federal agencies, officials at the state-run university cited that law among its reasons for denying requests for records about safety violations and the performance improvement program.\n\nThe university inadvertently confirmed that its Honolulu labs had been put in the performance improvement program in records it filed in January with Hawaii's Office of Information Practices, which is deciding USA TODAY's public records appeal. The university wrote that being put on a PIP is something it is \"proud\" of.\n\n\"We do not believe entering into the program is an embarrassment, we think it should be showcased, but that would be improper because as participants in the Federal Select Agent Program, we are obligated to keep this information private,\" the university wrote to the appeals agency, adding that it \"has been an exemplary participant in the Federal Select Agent Program.\"\n\nUniversity of Hawaii officials declined to be interviewed.\n\nLast year, two labs agreed to pay fines handed down by the HHS Office of Inspector General for select agent violations, records show.\n\nA lab that federal officials would describe only as an \"Arizona research university\" agreed in 2014 to pay a $165,000 fine for failing to keep accurate inventory records for select agents and not having biosafety procedures adequate for the risks associated with the pathogens they worked with. The lab, the USA TODAY Network's reporting found, was Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. Lab director Paul Keim said the issues date back to 2010 when the university had difficulty keeping up with changing federal regulations. Since then the university's labs have passed several inspections, he said.\n\nAn unnamed Florida laboratory agreed to pay $50,000 to resolve violations that included failing to ensure accurate inventories of select agents and failing to notify the CDC and appropriate law enforcement agencies after discovering a missing select agent.\n\nThe inspector general's office, citing regulations stemming from the 2002 bioterrorism law, redacted the names of these labs, as well as all other labs receiving fines, in documents it provided to USA TODAY under the Freedom of Information Act. Other labs that have been fined over the years for select agent violations are located in Alabama, California, Missouri, South Dakota, Texas, Virginia and Wisconsin, records show.\n\nAs a way of providing some oversight, Congress requires a report each year on the number of thefts, losses and releases of bioterror pathogens at labs regulated by the Federal Select Agent Program.\n\nYet regulators provide scant details of their activities and the problems identified at labs. Usually just three pages long plus a cover page, the reports contain only aggregated counts of lab incidents by type, plus vague information on a few serious incidents.\n\nThe select agent program told Congress it had \"imposed a $425,000 civil money penalty\" on an unnamed lab where a serious biosafety lapse in 2008 had resulted in a cow in a nearby disease-free herd becoming infected with Brucella bacteria, which cause brucellosis.\n\nBrucellosis is a contagious and economically significant agricultural disease — which causes cattle and other livestock to abort their fetuses, produce less milk, suffer weight loss, infertility and lameness. It has been the subject of eradication efforts for decades.\n\nThe $425,000 fine would have been one of the largest in the overall select agent program's history — if it had actually been imposed.\n\nBut it wasn't imposed, USA TODAY's investigation found, and the USDA never corrected the record with Congress.\n\nUSA TODAY was able to identify the Brucella research program at Louisiana State University's AgCenter in Baton Rouge as the likely recipient of the $425,000 fine by examining USDA animal health reports that tallied what states reported brucellosis cases in 2008. Louisiana, which had a case that year, had been declared brucellosis-free in 2000.\n\nLSU officials spent months denying USA TODAY access to its records about the incident, citing among other things select agent regulations unrelated to the requested information. In statements and interviews, LSU downplayed its violations and provided information that was later contradicted by federal records.\n\n\"The incident was not found to be caused by a violation of federal regulations; no fines were imposed upon LSU, and the regulatory agencies had uncertainty as to whether the strain of bacteria in the affected cow was the same strain that was being used in the LSU research,\" LSU officials said in a November 2014 email to USA TODAY.\n\nYet, in December 2014, when USA TODAY received copies of the incident investigation reports from the USDA and Louisiana's state agriculture department, the documents showed no uncertainty.\n\nUSDA records show that investigators documented serious violations. In levying the $425,000 fine, regulators cited LSU for failing to have adequate biosafety measures, resulting in the release of the bacteria that caused the cow's infection. The USDA also cited LSU for violating regulations by sending Brucella-infected cattle that had been part of select agent vaccine experiments to an unregistered slaughter facility where their meat was sold for human consumption.\n\nLSU's Phil Elzer, who at the time ran the Brucella studies and now is a university administrator, said in an interview the practice of sending research cattle to slaughter was declared in the lab's operating procedures that were reviewed and signed off on at each inspection by Federal Select Agent Program regulators. \"To all of a sudden say we were doing it wrong was very surprising,\" Elzer said. LSU appealed, and the USDA eventually dropped the fine, he said.\n\nIn January 2010, records show, the USDA sent a letter to LSU saying the case was being closed but reiterating the issues with the infected cow and the use of the unauthorized slaughter plant.\n\nUSDA officials acknowledge that they never imposed the $425,000 fine and made a mistake touting it in their report to Congress.\n\n\"It should have stated that we were proposing a fine, instead of stating we issued a fine,\" said Freeda Isaac, USDA's director of Agriculture Select Agent Services, in an emailed statement. Isaac added that the USDA suspended a portion of LSU's select agent registration because of the Brucella incident and \"that portion of the registration is still suspended,\" Isaac said last fall.\n\nFor those labs not in the select agent program — and even those that are — self-policing is the front line of biosafety. Biosafety committees at research institutions, often staffed by scientists' colleagues, assess the risks of proposed research and grant or deny approval for studies. Labs also have other safety staff who may do internal inspections and lab audits, plus additional committees overseeing the use of animals in research.\n\nYet some researchers appear ignorant of their institutions' biosafety rules. Others brazenly ignore repeated requests by biosafety staff to stop experiments and address issues.\n\nDocuments obtained by the USA TODAY Network include at least 50 incidents since 2012 in which researchers were conducting experiments with genetically manipulated organisms without proper approval from internal safety committees. In some cases, records show researchers flaunting their institutional rules.\n\n• At the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in, biosafety staff concluded in a 2013 report that the root causes of a researcher failing to get her experiments approved included \"general indifference of the investigator to institutional rules governing the need for biosafety compliance\" as well as a \"lack of oversight of research activities.\" The scientist, the investigation revealed, knowingly launched unapproved experiments — exposing mice to a genetically manipulated strain of Burkholderia thailandensis — in a quest to get a vaccine study manuscript published that reviewers said needed additional data. The research was halted after veterinarians found several cages containing dead and dying mice, yet none of the cages was labeled with the infectious agent and they were in an area not approved for experiments with a BSL-2 pathogen. The incident was \"an extremely unusual event,\" said Sheila Champlin, an assistant vice chancellor at the center, noting corrective actions were taken before the scientist was allowed to resume research.\n\n• At the University of Iowa, a biosafety officer in February 2014 discovered that a scientist had been conducting experiments with a genetically manipulated strain of the MERS virus since September 2013 without biosafety committee approval. The biosafety officer ordered the investigator to stop all experiments, and the scientist was put on probation and received increased safety monitoring. The work was being done in a BSL-3 lab at the time it was discovered, but started in a BSL-2 lab, the safety officer's investigation found. The university concluded that the scientist did not \"effectively communicate\" to his staff the importance of getting safety committee approval before starting the experiments with the virus, which can cause a deadly, contagious respiratory disease in people.\n\n• At the University of California-Irvine, a researcher ignored repeated notices from biosafety staff during 2012 and 2013 that a research project's approval had expired, that it needed further revisions and that all work must cease — yet the scientist continued the experiments with a lentivirus, anyway, in the BSL-2 lab. As a result of the incident, the university now sends researchers four notices starting 90 days before approvals expire, said James Hicks, the university's associate vice chancellor of research. As the deadline nears, Hicks is copied on the notices so he can intervene if necessary. \"We take a very strong view and a very correct view of the importance of following the regulations and the guidelines,\" he said in an interview.\n\n• At the University of Nebraska, a biosafety officer in 2013 found that a researcher had continued growing plants as part of an experiment using a transgenic tobacco rattle virus vector — despite being told repeatedly over two months that additional approval was needed from the biosafety committee before research could begin. As a result of the incident, the university said it revised its biosafety guidelines to describe consequences of unapproved research and sent a letter to faculty. \"This was an isolated instance that was fully and successfully resolved,\" the university said.\n\n• At the University of Hawaii-Manoa, biosafety staff discovered a scientist was doing a type of cancer research in 2012 despite being denied biosafety committee approval and being repeatedly told not to do the experiments. Separately, at a March 2013 biosafety committee meeting at the university, members discussed the need for penalties when researchers fail to comply with biosafety rules, stating \"there must be some consequence and corrective action other than an email\" to the scientist, the minutes say.\n\nLabs that receive funding from the National Institutes of Health and some other federal agencies are required to report incidents to the NIH involving certain types of genetically engineered organisms and recombinant DNA technology. From 2010 through 2014, the NIH received 644 reports of lab incidents during this kind of research.\n\nMost of the reports the NIH receives are for what it says are non-serious incidents, such as small spills, splashes, cuts and equipment failures. Failure to obtain required biosafety committee approvals to do this type of research are among the more common types of non-compliance.\n\nAlthough it is not a regulatory agency, the NIH said in a statement that agency staff have made site visits to 100 institutions in recent years in an effort to help improve biosafety committee resources and adherence to the NIH Guidelines for operating their labs.\n\n\"Most instances of non-compliance result from a lack of full understanding of the requirements of the NIH Guidelines, rather than willful disregard, and our emphasis has been on corrective actions through education, which institutions seem uniformly responsive to,\" the NIH said.\n\nIn September 2014, the NIH contacted the University of Louisville after a whistle-blower alleged the university had knowingly failed to report lab incidents as required, according to records obtained under the federal Freedom of Information Act. In response, the university told the NIH that it discovered three incidents that were not reported to the NIH but should have been, the records show.\n\nThe records indicate that University of Louisville biosafety officials were aware of some of the unreported incidents as much as six months before the NIH opened its inquiry. William Pierce Jr., the university's executive vice president for research and innovation, in a statement to USA TODAY, said \"there was apparent confusion regarding the authority and responsibility for reporting violations to the NIH.\" Pierce said the university has hired an outside firm to oversee its biosafety committee and created training courses for scientists. \"We feel confident the current system is working,\" he said.\n\nThe NIH closed its inquiry after the university answered the agency's questions, filed reports on the previously unreported incidents and agreed to take actions to ensure better reporting in the future.\n\n\"In investigating the incident, we did not find any evidence of willful non-compliance,\" the NIH said in response to USA TODAY's questions.\n\nFor some residents living near labs, the lack of transparency is frustrating — and worrisome. It's not enough to tell the public the labs have robust safety procedures. \"What people are really interested in is how well it's working,\" said Beth Willis, the citizen lab safety representative near Fort Detrick. \"The more people in the community feel that there's secrecy, the more they're distrustful, whether their distrust is warranted or not.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/28"}]}

Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, voting present and an additional 14 representatives abstaining.\n\nThe bill has not yet gone to vote in the Senate.\n\nWhy is TikTok getting banned?\n\nFor years, U.S. lawmakers have attempted to ban the Chinese-owned platform for allegedly harvesting data from those who have installed the app onto their electronic devices.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew has repeatedly denied these allegations in front of U.S. Congress, stating the app now uses as separate entity, based in the U.S., to store its American user data.\n\nWhat is H.R. 1721, dubbed the TikTok ban bill?\n\nA bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill on March 5 that would require the app's parent company, ByteDance, to sell TikTok within six months. Otherwise, the U.S. will remove the app from all web-hosting services and app stores on all electronic devices.\n\nThe bill, dubbed the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act, has more than a dozen co-sponsors.\n\n\"This is my message to TikTok: break up with the Chinese Communist Party or lose access to your American users,\" Rep. Mike Gallagher, the Republican chair of the House of Representatives' select China committee, said in a statement. “America’s foremost adversary has no business controlling a dominant media platform in the United States.”\n\nIs TikTok getting banned?\n\nTikTok officials claim the bill would give ByteDance a narrow timeline of six months to sell the social media app, which more than 170 million U.S. residents use.\n\n\"This bill is an outright ban of TikTok, no matter how much the authors try to disguise it,\" TikTok said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY. \"This legislation will trample the First Amendment rights of 170 million Americans and deprive 5 million small businesses of a platform they rely on to grow and create jobs.\"\n\nThe bill would also give President Joe Biden the power to designate other apps as controlled by a “foreign adversary.\" Once an app is deemed a risk, the U.S. can ban the platform from online app stores and web-hosting services unless it severs ties with entities under control of the foreign adversary within 180 days of the designation.\n\nDespite the significant passage in the House, the legislation still needs to be passed by the Senate in order for it to become law.

TikTok's parent company ByteDance, is based in Beijing and may expose American user data to Chinese government surveillance.\n\nThe FBI and the Federal Communications Commission have warned that the company could share sweeping user data, including browsing history, location and other identifiers, with Chinese authorities.\n\nFor its part, TikTok says it stores all American user data in a U.S.-based entity, and the storage is solely managed by the company’s U.S.-based security.

Congress, the White House and the U.S. armed forces had already banned TikTok from the devices.\n\nTikTok launched an intense lobbying campaign ahead of the House vote, urging its users to call their representatives and urge them to vote against the bill. The company’s CEO Shou Chew also visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday to persuade lawmakers – mainly senators – to oppose it.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump waded into the debate as well, coming out against the bill and posting on Truth Social, his social media app, “If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business,” referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThe bill was fast-tracked to the House floor after it was approved by the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee last week by a unanimous vote of 50-0, a stunning, unusual sight for the lower chamber.\n\nAs bipartisan as the bill’s support was, the effort still received pushback from lawmakers who say an effective ban on the app would limit freedom of expression. Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif., along with a handful of other progressive lawmakers, held a press conference Tuesday with TikTok content creators warning against an effective ban.\n\n“Any ban on TikTok is not just banning the freedom of expression. You are literally causing huge harm to our national economy,” Garcia said, noting TikTok’s use as a platform for small businesses.\n\nLegislation on TikTok faces uphill climb in the Senate\n\nThe upper chamber has also been less bullish about the legislation. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has not said whether he would bring the House’s bill up for a vote, explaining he would have to confer with committee chairs.\n\nWhile most senators agree that TikTok’s Chinese parent company poses a security threat to the U.S., many have concerns about the legality of singling out one company.\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., the chair of the Senate Commerce Committee, said Tuesday she’s “not sure” what her committee would do once the House passed the bill.\n\nThe committee has been “working on this (issue) diligently for a while” with the goal of finding a tool that could stand up to legal scrutiny.\n\n“The whole point here is you have a dilemma: You want free speech, but you also want the United States to have some ability to protect U.S. citizens or U.S. military from foreign actors who might be deleterious in what they would be using as a tool of communication,” she said.\n\nTrump attempted to ban TikTok when he was president, but it was blocked by courts for failing “to adequately consider an obvious and reasonable alternative,” a federal judge wrote at the time.\n\nSen.

Did they ban TikTok?\n\nNo. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday in support of a TikTok ban, 352-65. However, the bill has not yet reached the Senate.\n\nWill TikTok get banned? Is TikTok going to get banned?\n\nPossibly. On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of a national TikTok ban. Biden also said he would sign the legislation if it reached his desk. However, the Senate has not yet voted on the ban, and could end up blocking the bill.\n\nWhy is TikTok getting banned?\n\nThe controversial bipartisan ban follows concerns about the parent company, Beijing-based ByteDance, giving American users' data to the Chinese government. The company says it protects users by storing their personal data outside China, which was done to appease bipartisan criticism from U.S. officials.\n\nWhen is TikTok getting banned in the U.S.?\n\nWhile the U.S. House of Representatives voted in favor of the ban, the legislation has not yet been implemented. It still requires approval from the Senate and it's uncertain whether those lawmakers will vote in favor of the legislation — or if the bill will even be brought to the floor for a vote.\n\nWhat is the proposed TikTok ban?\n\nThe proposed bill would make TikTok unavailable in app stores or web hosting services, making it unavailable to U.S. users, unless it severs ties with parent company ByteDance within 180 days.\n\nSen. Rand Paul's take on TikTok\n\nWhile many Kentucky House representatives supported the bill and voted in its favor, Paul views it as a First Amendment violation.\n\nAccording to previous Courier Journal reporting, Paul blocked the \"No TikTok on United States Devices Act\" in March 2023 as an effort to protect First Amendment rights. The act was implemented by Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, another Republican, to fast-track a proposed national ban on the social media platform.\n\n“This legislation not only violates the First Amendment of those who own TikTok, many of whom are actually Americans, not Chinese, but it also violates the First Amendment rights of the millions of young Americans who use this social media app,\" he said at the time.\n\nHe also added it wouldn't necessarily protect the users' information because U.S.-based tech companies have failed to secure data before.\n\n“Every accusation of data gathering that’s been attributed to TikTok could also be attributed to domestic big tech companies,” Paul said.\n\nIn an opinion piece Paul wrote for The Courier Journal, he referenced a quote from Georgia Tech, \"If nationalistic fears about Chinese influence operations lead to a departure from American constitutional principles supporting free and open political discourse, we will have succeeded in undermining our system of government more effectively than any Chinese propaganda could do.”\n\nTikTok ban: How Kentucky legislators voted", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2024/03/14/tiktok-banned-house-representatives-vote-senate-florida-content-creators-where-watch-instagram-reels/72954185007/", "title": "Is TikTok getting banned?

Republicans Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Chris Jacobs of New York voted for the bill.\n\nWhile the legislation is not expected to amass the 60 votes needed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate, many Democrats in the House cited a string of recent mass shootings involving such firearms as a pressing reason to outlaw them.\n\n“Today, our Democratic Majority will take up and pass the Assault Weapons Ban legislation: a crucial step in our ongoing fight against the deadly epidemic of gun violence in our nation,” Pelosi said in a letter to members of her caucus ahead of the vote.\n\nFriday’s vote came as progressives, moderates and members of the Congressional Black Caucus are divided on how to handle the policing funding component of a broader public safety package, which was not included in Friday’s series of votes. While negotiations on that proposal are continuing, according to sources, the key negotiators were hoping to settle both issues in hopes of having a vote on both packages as soon as Friday.\n\nModerate and vulnerable Democrats had been pushing for a vote on the policing legislation before they leave town in an effort to rebut GOP attacks over defunding the police, but members of the CBC had concerns and have been pushing for accountability language.\n\nThe deal to try to combine both pieces of legislation came together late Thursday night, and was negotiated between Pelosi, Congressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty of Ohio, and moderate Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey. But other members of the Congressional Black and Progressive caucuses were frustrated that they were kept out of the loop, which is ultimately why Democratic leadership decided to separate the bills.\n\nMembers of the Congressional Black Caucus held a meeting Friday morning and sources say many were frustrated to not be given equal negotiating power.\n\n“This was supposed to happen in several weeks to give time for us to negotiate stronger police accountability measures,” a staffer of a CBC member told CNN. “Then they sprung this deal on us in the dead of night without any hearings, committee or time for members to read the text much less debate.”\n\nWhen asked about the disagreement by CNN, Beatty denied there was problems within her caucus.\n\n“There is no disappointment with the Congressional Black Caucus,” she said. “We have a big tent. And what I am most proud of, is that we were able to go today and take a leadership role. Look at where we were 48 hours ago.”\n\nShe added: “There was no failure here.”\n\nThe House is slated to depart Washington for a month-long recess starting Friday evening. Pelosi could call lawmakers back into town before September for specific circumstances, something she would likely do if Senate Democrats pass a separate bill on climate change and prescription drug pricing in the coming weeks.\n\nHouse Democrats held a procedural vote open for more than an hour on Friday while Pelosi, Congressional Black Caucus members, Gottheimer and others huddled on the House floor to negotiate.

Pro: more choice for patients\n\nThe NHS is often seen as a one-size-fits-all system by its detractors, while a privatised service might allow patients to better choose where to be treated and what treatment to have.\n\nWriting for the BBC, Thomas Cawston of the think tank Reform said that “poll after poll shows patients value their right to choose which hospital to go to and what treatment they receive”. He said that as competition within the NHS maximises choice for patients, more privatisation would therefore be a good thing.\n\nBut, in The Guardian, Kim Thomas said that provider choice is already “well established” within the NHS, but only has “limited value”. In rural parts of the country, for example, most patients will only want to visit their nearest hospital and it may even be impossible for them to travel anywhere else.\n\nAnd evidence from the US suggests that a fully private system gives choice only to well-off people. In Time magazine, Steven Brill said that the 28 million Americans with no health insurance have “little choice of hospitals [and] no choice of the drugs that they have to buy or the lab tests or CT scans that they have to get”.\n\nHe added: “They are powerless buyers in a seller’s market where the only sure thing is the profit of the sellers.”\n\n2. Con: less transparency\n\nWe Own It, a group that campaigns against the privatisation of public services from the NHS to schools, believes that increasing privatisation within the health service “will open the door to more cronyism with no due process”.\n\nPrivate companies aren’t held to the same standards as public ones and do not need to publish accounts to show how they have spent funds. “Without basic financial transparency from public service contractors we can say goodbye to democratic accountability,” said The Guardian’s Zoe Williams.\n\nCritics of NHS privatisation have used the Covid-19 pandemic as an example of how outsourcing contracts to private firms can lead to a lack of transparency. In a piece for the British Medical Association’s website, the BMA’s deputy chair, David Wrigley, said that the government had chosen to outsource to “scores of private firms” with “minimal oversight, governance or transparency”.\n\nHe added: “There is no ability to scrutinise these deals and taxpayer money is haemorrhaging from the Treasury while a health and care system in desperate need of investment and resource is ignored.”\n\nEvidence from across the pond has suggested that the cost of treatment in US hospitals can often be hard to assess because of a lack of transparency. And American patients – especially the poorest – are kept in the dark, with “no idea what their bills mean”, said Brill.\n\n3. Pro: could reduce waiting times\n\nCurrent NHS waiting lists are “out of control”, said The Guardian in January, with around 7.5 million people waiting for treatment – the highest number since records began in 2007.\n\nThe government is developing various plans to reduce the backlog and increase surgical capacity, with more privatisation thought to be an inevitability. One solution suggested by Matthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute, a neoliberal think tank, would be to “enable every patient to ‘Go Private’ if the NHS fails to provide service within a reasonable time, paid for out of local health budgets”.\n\nWriting for the business publication City AM, Lesh said that this form of privatisation would “result in greater patient choice, more equitable and better outcomes, and stronger incentives for speedy care in the NHS”.\n\nBut, said Labour MP Stella Creasy in The Guardian, long waiting lists should not be a pretext for privatising the health service. “Lists have been creeping up for years,” she wrote. “Rather than invest in NHS capacity, recent years have seen a conscious decision to divert funding to profit-making private healthcare companies.\n\n“Without more scrutiny, this could see healthcare outcomes shaped not by need but whether you have the money to jump the queue.”\n\n4. Con: the moral argument\n\nBefore his death in March 2018, Professor Stephen Hawking warned that the government was taking the NHS “towards a US-style insurance system, run by… private companies”, and insisted: “We must prevent the establishment of a two-tier service.”\n\nA long-term user of the NHS, having lived with motor neurone disease for more than 50 years, Hawking wrote in The Guardian that the NHS is “the fairest way to deliver healthcare”.\n\nThe moral argument for a public system which delivers free care to everybody, regardless of wealth or status, was once unassailable – and even advocates for increased privatisation still do not question the principle, at least in public.\n\nYet the service was set up “in the face of political opposition”, said Hawking. Public opinion may shift again – particularly when the argument is made that the service is simply too expensive to run now, given an ageing population unforeseen by its founders.\n\n5. Con: public healthcare is more efficient\n\nThis may seem a surprising claim, given that the prevailing wisdom since the Thatcher years has been that state control is inherently inefficient and internal markets bring savings. But in 2017, Hawking told the Royal Society of Medicine that “international comparisons indicate that the most efficient way to provide good healthcare is for services to be publicly funded and publicly run”.\n\nOne of those comparisons is a 2012 study by a US-Bosnian team looking at healthcare systems in several countries, which concluded that systems that “ration their care by government provision or government insurance incur lower per-capita costs”.\n\nThe US, with its privately run insurance-based system, spends more on healthcare per person than any other nation, OECD figures show. However, patients in countries with a government-controlled system such as Germany and Canada have greater trust in its healthcare systems than do Americans, an Ipsos Mori survey of more than 20,000 people globally revealed in 2020.\n\n6. Pro: more seats at the table\n\nOne of the most contentious components of the government’s proposed Health and Care Bill, which is a sweeping legislative overhaul of how the NHS operates in England, is the introduction of Integrated Care Boards (ICBs).\n\nThese ICBs will be “accountable for NHS spend and performance within the system” and will have the power to decide on the type of healthcare that groups in their local area will receive, according to the government.\n\nAlongside NHS bosses, GPs and council public health leaders, private providers of services may qualify to sit on some of these boards – a plan that has concerned some anti-privatisation campaigners. However, said the Nuffield Trust, these meetings “will be held in public and decisions must be transparent”. In addition: “Any conflicts of interest will have to be declared and managed.”\n\n7. Con: continuity of care\n\nPrivate firms will not carry on providing an unprofitable service any longer than they have to. This could lead to a lack of continuity, with some patients finding their health providers change during an illness.\n\nFor this reason, wrote The Guardian’s elderly patient columnist Dick Vinegar (not his real name), “any service, like GPs, where continuity is essential to the patient, should not go to private companies on short contracts”.\n\nContinuity is particularly crucial for elderly patients, said Lara Sonola from the health think tank The King’s Fund. “Good continuity of care inspires trust and confidence,” she wrote. Continuity can be as simple as staff knowing a patient’s name. The NHS is not a paragon of continuity – but few argue increased privatisation would improve it.\n\n8. Pro: a fresh start\n\nIn 2017, a doctor with 20 years’ experience writing in The Spectator said that the NHS had become “a confused hotchpotch of short-term solutions imposed in a haphazard and uncoordinated way on an anachronistic model”. While he stopped short of recommending privatisation, he said that the current system was unsustainable.\n\n“We need to think creatively about how we could fund the NHS,” he wrote. “For example: if people are willing to pay for their healthcare, should they be allowed to do so? Should prescriptions be subsidised for those who can afford them, and should we charge for GP appointments like the Scandinavians do? Might the NHS offer a basic service, with health insurance required for the extras?”\n\nIn Lord Darzi’s independent report examining health and care services on the NHS’s 70th birthday in 2018, he suggested privatisation is neither the problem nor the solution. The vast majority of healthcare provision remains in the public sector, he said, adding that the issue “[paled] in comparison” to other crises.\n\nFour years on, The Spectator’s Isabel Hardman concurred: “Privatisation seems to work as a psychological trick in the British love of the NHS: it is ever-present as a threat to the existence of the health service, to the extent that more pressing problems get ignored.” More urgent, she wrote, are the “gaping vacancies in many disciplines” within the NHS and the lack of workforce planning.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Rafi Schwartz", "The Week Us", "Justin Klawans", "Peter Weber", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Richard Windsor", "Sorcha Bradley", "Harriet Marsden"], "publish_date": "2022/03/10"}]}

The letter also requested that the Pentagon take over funding for Ukraine’s government and military use of Starlink, which SpaceX claims would cost more than $120 million for the rest of the year and could cost close to $400 million for the next 12 months.\n\n“We are not in a position to further donate terminals to Ukraine, or fund the existing terminals for an indefinite period of time,” SpaceX’s director of government sales wrote to the Pentagon in the September letter.\n\nAmong the SpaceX documents sent to the Pentagon and seen by CNN is a previously unreported direct request made to Musk in July by the Ukrainian military’s commanding general, General Valerii Zaluzhniy, for almost 8,000 more Starlink terminals.\n\nIn a separate cover letter to the Pentagon, an outside consultant working for SpaceX wrote, “SpaceX faces terribly difficult decisions here. I do not think they have the financial ability to provide any additional terminals or service as requested by General Zaluzhniy.”\n\nThe documents, which have not been previously reported, provide a rare breakdown of SpaceX’s own internal numbers on Starlink, detailing the costs and payments associated with the thousands of terminals in Ukraine. They also shed new light on behind-the-scenes negotiations that have provided millions of dollars in communications hardware and services to Ukraine at little cost to Kyiv.\n\nThe Pentagon confirmed they received correspondence from SpaceX about the funding of the Starlink satellite communications product in Ukraine, a statement from Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Friday.\n\nEarlier in the day, Singh confirmed the Pentagon had been in communication with SpaceX but did not say whether it was over the funding of the Starlink satellite communication product.\n\nMusk on Friday said that in asking the Pentagon to pick up the bill for Starlink in Ukraine, he was following the advice of a Ukrainian diplomat who responded to Musk’s Ukraine peace plan earlier this month, before the letter was sent to the Pentagon, with: “F*** off.”\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to Germany, Andrij Melnyk, responded earlier this month to Musk’s claimed peace plan for Russia’s Ukraine war by saying: “F*** off is my very diplomatic reply to you @elonmusk.”\n\n“We’re just following his recommendation,” Musk said on Friday, responding to a tweet that referenced CNN’s reporting and Melnyk’s comments, even though the letter SpaceX sent to the Pentagon was sent before the Twitter exchange.\n\nReports of outages\n\nThe letters come amid recent reports of wide-ranging Starlink outages as Ukrainian troops attempt to retake ground occupied by Russia in the eastern and southern parts of the country.\n\nSources familiar with the outages said they suddenly affected the entire frontline as it stood on September 30. “That has affected every effort of the Ukrainians to push past that front,” said one person familiar with the outages who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive conversations. “Starlink is the main way units on the battlefield have to communicate.”\n\nThis photograph taken on September 25 shows an antenna of the Starlink satellite-based broadband system donated by US tech billionaire Elon Musk in Izyum, Kharkiv region, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Yasuyoshi Chiba/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThere was no warning to Ukrainian forces, a second person said, adding that now when Ukraine liberates an area a request has to be made for Starlink services to be turned on.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the outages which resulted in a “catastrophic” loss of communication, a senior Ukrainian official said. In a tweet responding to the article, Musk didn’t dispute the outage, saying that what is happening on the battlefield is classified.\n\nSpaceX’s suggestion it will stop funding Starlink also comes amid rising concern in Ukraine over Musk’s allegiance. Musk recently tweeted a controversial peace plan that would have Ukraine give up Crimea and control over the eastern Luhansk and Donetsk regions.\n\nAfter Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky raised the question of who Musk sides with, he responded that he “still very much support[s] Ukraine” but fears “massive escalation.”\n\nMusk also argued privately last month that Ukraine doesn’t want peace negotiations right now and that if they went along with his plan, “Russia would accept those terms,” according to a person who heard them.\n\n“Ukraine knows that its current government and wartime efforts are totally dependent on Starlink,” the person familiar with the discussions said. “The decision to keep Starlink running or not rests entirely in the hands of one man. That’s Elon Musk. He hasn’t been elected, no one decided to give him that power. He has it because of the technology and the company he built.”\n\nOn Tuesday Musk denied a report he has spoken to Putin directly about Ukraine. On Thursday, when a Ukrainian minister tweeted that Starlink is essential to Ukraine’s infrastructure, Musk replied: “You’re most welcome. Glad to support Ukraine.”\n\n“The gall to look like heroes”\n\nMore than seven months into the war, it’s hard to overstate the impact Starlink has had in Ukraine. The government in Kyiv, Ukrainian troops as well and NGOs and civilians have relied on the nimble, compact and easy-to-use units created by SpaceX. It’s not only used for voice and electronic communication but to help fly drones and send back video to correct artillery fire.\n\nCNN has seen it used at numerous Ukrainian bases.\n\nElon Musk pauses and looks down as he speaks during a press conference at SpaceX's Starbase facility near Boca Chica Village in South Texas on February 10, 2022. Jim Watson/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Starlink has been absolutely essential because the Russians have targeted the Ukrainian communications infrastructure,” said Dimitri Alperovitch, co-founder of the Silverado Policy Accelerator, a think tank. “Without that they’d be really operating in the blind in many cases.”\n\nThough Musk has received widespread acclaim and thanks for responding to requests for Starlink service to Ukraine right as the war was starting, in reality, the vast majority of the 20,000 terminals have received full or partial funding from outside sources, including the US government, the UK and Poland, according to the SpaceX letter to the Pentagon.\n\nSpaceX’s request that the US military foot the bill has rankled top brass at the Pentagon, with one senior defense official telling CNN that SpaceX has “the gall to look like heroes” while having others pay so much and now presenting them with a bill for tens of millions per month.\n\nAccording to the SpaceX figures shared with the Pentagon, about 85% of the 20,000 terminals in Ukraine were paid – or partially paid – for by countries like the US and Poland or other entities. Those entities also paid for about 30% of the internet connectivity, which SpaceX says costs $4,500 each month per unit for the most advanced service. (Over the weekend, Musk tweeted there are around 25,000 terminals in Ukraine.)\n\nIn his July letter to Musk, Ukraine’s commander-in-chief, Gen. Zaluzhniy, praised the Starlink units’ “exceptional utility” and said some 4,000 terminals had been deployed by the military. However, around 500 terminals per month are destroyed in the fighting, Zaluzhniy said, before asking for 6,200 more terminals for the Ukrainian military and intelligence services and 500 per month going forward to offset the losses.\n\nSpaceX said they responded by asking Zaluzhniy to instead take up his request to the Department of Defense.\n\nOn September 8, the senior director of government sales for SpaceX wrote the Pentagon saying the costs have gotten too high, approaching $100 million. The official asked the Department of Defense to pick up Ukraine’s new request as well as ongoing service costs, totaling $124 million for the remainder of 2022.\n\nThose costs, according to the senior defense official, would reach almost $380 million for a full year.\n\nSpaceX declined repeated requests for comment on both the outages and their recent request to the Pentagon. A lawyer for Musk did not reply to a request for comment. Defense Department spokesman Bob Ditchey told CNN, “The Department continues to work with industry to explore solutions for Ukraine’s armed forces as they repel Russia’s brutal and unprovoked aggression. We do not have anything else to add at this time.”\n\nBreaking down the costs\n\nEarly US support for Starlink came via the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) which according to the Washington Post spent roughly $3 million on hardware and services in Ukraine. The largest single contributor of terminals, according to the newly obtained documents, is Poland with payment for almost 9,000 individual terminals.\n\nUS Pentagon in Washington DC building looking down aerial view from above Ivan Cholakov/iStockphoto/Getty Images\n\nThe US has provided almost 1,700 terminals. Other contributors include the UK, NGOs and crowdfunding.\n\nThe far more expensive part, however, is the ongoing connectivity. SpaceX says it has paid for about 70% of the service provided to Ukraine and claims to have offered that highest level – $4,500 a month – to all terminals in Ukraine despite the majority only having signed on for the cheaper $500 per month service.\n\nThe terminals themselves cost $1500 and $2500 for the two models sent to Ukraine, the documents say, while consumer models on Starlink’s website are far cheaper and service in Ukraine is just $60 per month.\n\nThat’s just 1.3% of the service rate SpaceX says it needs the Pentagon to start paying.\n\n“You could say he’s trying to get money from the government or just trying to say ‘I don’t want to be part of this anymore,’” said the person familiar with Ukraine’s requests for Starlink. Given the recent outages and Musk’s reputation for being unpredictable, “Feelings are running really high on the Ukrainian side,” this person said.\n\nMusk is the biggest shareholder of the privately-held SpaceX. In May, SpaceX disclosed that its valuation had risen to $127 billion and it has raised $2 billion this year, CNBC reported.\n\nLast week, Musk faced a barrage of criticism on Twitter – including from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky – after presenting in a series of tweets his peace plan to end the war. It would include giving Crimea to Russia and re-do referenda, supervised by the United Nations this time, in the four regions Russia recently illegally annexed.\n\nIt echoed comments he’d made last month at an exclusive closed-door conference in Aspen, Colorado called “The Weekend,” at which Musk told a room full of attendees that Ukraine should seek peace now because they’ve had recent victories.\n\n“This is the time to do it. They don’t want to do it, that’s for sure. But this is the time to do it,” he said, according to a person in the room. “Everyone wants to seek peace when they’re losing but they don’t want to seek peace when they’re winning. For now.”", "authors": ["Alex Marquardt"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/15/politics/biden-congress-soviet-made-weapons-ukraine/index.html", "title": "White House under pressure from Congress and Zelensky to find ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nNearly three weeks into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the Biden administration is still assessing the most effective way to get military aid into the country without triggering a wider war.\n\nWhile administration officials say the effort to provide Ukrainian forces with American-made weapons such as Javelin anti-tank and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles has been largely successful, the White House is under intense pressure to do more.\n\nSpecifically, both Congress and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky have pressured Biden officials to help broker the transfer of heavier Soviet-made weaponry to Ukraine, including MiG fighter jets and S-300 surface-to-air missile systems. It’s a message that Zelensky could echo on Wednesday when he addresses Congress.\n\nBut so far the Biden administration has not helped provide those heavier, Soviet-made weapons systems. US officials continue to grapple with concerns about how Russia might respond if certain weapons transfers are approved. Officials have also raised questions about how useful MiG fighters would be, and whether they are worth the risk.\n\nThe State Department has been working to identify which countries currently have the Soviet-made S-300 air defense systems and is examining how they could be transferred to Ukraine, sources said. But it remains unclear how the US would backfill those countries’ supplies of surface-to-air missiles, according to multiple sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nA similar problem arose last week, when Poland indicated it would be willing to send MiG-29 fighter jets to Ukraine, with the US telling Poland it would be unable to backfill the jets quickly.\n\nBut a Republican Senate aide told CNN on Monday that Congress had solved that problem for the White House when it passed a long-delayed $1.5 trillion spending bill last week. That package included more than $13 billion in money to respond to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, including funding to directly backfill allies and partners who have delivered weapons to Ukraine from their own stocks.\n\n“That’s where we should urge the administration to work with allies and partners, not just in Europe but potentially around the globe, who are in a position to deliver more munitions for things like the S-300 or other advanced air defense systems that we can work with to backfill their own capabilities,” the aide added.\n\nTop House and Senate Republicans sent a letter to the State and Defense departments on Tuesday calling on the Biden administration to provide Ukraine with Soviet-made air defense systems and fighter jets.\n\nThe lawmakers said that the new funding Congress approved in an emergency supplemental should be used to deliver the military aid to the Ukrainians and help reimburse US allies who have also provided equipment and depleted their own stocks.\n\nLack of visibility\n\nAlmost all of the $350 million in weapons the Biden administration approved for Ukraine in late February have been delivered, according to multiple sources familiar with the status of the arms shipments. Over the weekend, President Joe Biden approved an additional $200 million military aid package for Ukraine, which includes more Javelin and Stinger missiles, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN.\n\nSmoke rises from a Russian tank destroyed by the Ukrainian forces on the side of a road in Lugansk region on February 26, 2022. Anatolii Stepanov/AFP/Getty Images/FILE\n\nUS officials have told Congress that the weapons they are sending to Ukraine are getting where they are supposed to go, according to sources familiar with the matter. But two sources tell CNN that the NATO alliance has very little idea what percentage of the military assistance is actually getting into the hands of Ukrainian forces after it crosses NATO and European territory.\n\nNATO doesn’t know because, deliberately, these shipments are being arranged by countries bilaterally – directly with Ukraine – and not through the alliance, the sources said. Nations have been told not to discuss with one another what they are sending and how.\n\nThis is partly for security reasons, because Western officials don’t want Russians to target the convoys, and informing the 30-country bloc of the transit points would increase the risk of such information leaking. But it also allows NATO to credibly say that as a bloc, it is not providing lethal assistance to Ukraine.\n\nWeekend strike\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Striking video from above shows devastation in Ukraine city where 2,500 are dead 01:01 - Source: CNN\n\nFunneling weapons into Ukraine may also prove to be more complicated going forward as the Kremlin made clear over the weekend that Russian forces will now target US shipments flowing into the country.\n\nThat warning, coupled with Russia’s recent strike on a military base in western Ukraine, is raising concerns about Moscow’s willingness to target aid shipments crossing the border from neighboring countries. NATO still does not believe, however, that Russia would target shipments still inside NATO or European Union member countries.\n\nTargeting arms shipments would be difficult for Russia, a source familiar with the intelligence added. It would need exact information on when and where the shipments are entering the country – and have to cope with the added challenge that many are likely being transported under cover of darkness.\n\nStill, the strike appeared to be part of a messaging campaign by Russia, the source said, warning the West against continuing its military assistance to Ukraine.\n\nPentagon spokesman John Kirby said Monday that the base was not being used as a transit point for shipments of weapons and US efforts to provide security assistance were not disrupted. But a second NATO source told CNN that the strike was concerning to the bloc, due to its proximity to Western countries that are sending materials into Ukraine.\n\nWith the latest strike “it certainly appears as if the Russians are broadening their target set,” Kirby added, noting the weekend attack is just the latest sign that Russian President Vladimir Putin is not only sending a message about shipments of weapons into the country but also that he “clearly has the occupation of Ukraine in mind.”\n\nAs a result, the Biden administration now faces a delicate balancing act as it considers ways to expedite weapons shipments to Ukraine and address another concerted push by lawmakers to provide additional defense capabilities, including the S-300.\n\nPressure from the Hill\n\nIn the meantime, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are urging the Biden administration to step up its efforts to deliver more weapons to Ukraine.\n\nOn Monday, the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois, told CNN he got an earful from Ukrainian American constituents this past weekend over the Biden administration’s decision to oppose providing Polish MiG-29 jets to Ukraine.\n\n“I went to a rally yesterday where that was the number one issue with the Ukrainian Americans, to give back the skies to the people of Ukraine and stop it,” Durbin said. “And I had to think in the context, as President Biden said in Philadelphia and said to us here in Washington, he doesn’t want to risk world war III. It’s a terrible, terrible decision that he faces, but I’m going to stand by him and work with him to do the right thing.”\n\nOne lawmaker said the public attention in Congress pushing for the Polish MiG-29 jets has been misplaced, arguing that Ukraine already has planes it isn’t flying, it doesn’t have enough pilots to fly more planes and the country’s runways have been damaged by Russian attacks.\n\n“The controversy over the MiGs is a classic case of Congress focusing on the shiny object instead of what will actually matter,” the lawmaker said. “The things that will really matter are the S-300s, SAMs (surface-to-air missiles) and drones. DoD is looking at ways to get them from allies, since we don’t have any we can give directly.”\n\nSenators have been publicly pushing for the Biden administration to change course on the Polish fighter jets since the opposition was announced last week. GOP Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who was in Poland on Sunday on a congressional trip just miles from the Ukrainian border, pushed back on the notion that the MiG-29 fighters would cause an escalation with Russia during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\n“I don’t know why that would be true,” Portman said. “You know, the Russians have complained about everything. Vladimir Putin has said that the sanctions are an act of war. They certainly complained when we provided Stingers directly from the US government, which can knock down an airplane and have been successful in doing that at lower altitudes.”\n\nPressure is mounting for the Biden administraion to find a way to provide Ukraine with S-300 air defense systems Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nBut Senate Armed Services Chairman Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat, said the plan to provide Ukraine with MiG-29 fighter jets “would not be effective.”\n\n“They already have approximately 30 aircraft. They have problems with maintaining and flying those aircraft,” Reed said. “The real advantage would be to move in air defense missiles, which I hope they will do, because particularly some of the older ones, Soviet-era, they understand how to use them, since they’ve trained on them.”\n\nOperational security concerns\n\nThe source familiar with the intelligence also told CNN that providing MiG fighter jets does not make a lot of operational sense. The aircraft present a big target and they are hard to move, which creates a myriad of logistical, operational and security problems.\n\nThere are also operational security concerns around disclosing details about shipments of weapons to Ukraine, according to a senior defense official, who told reporters on Monday that the Pentagon is being very “careful and cautious about talking about this.”\n\n“We haven’t put out specifics on the inventory. There are certain systems we still have not acknowledged … that they’re getting. We don’t give out numbers, we don’t give out timing of the shipments, we don’t provide context on the locations or the ground routes on which it’s arriving, because we want to keep that security assistance flowing as much and as fast as it can to assist them in the fight,” the official said.\n\nThis story has been updated.", "authors": ["Zachary Cohen Natasha Bertrand Jeremy Herb Katie Bo Williams", "Zachary Cohen", "Natasha Bertrand", "Jeremy Herb", "Katie Bo Williams"], "publish_date": "2022/03/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/05/17/ukraine-aid-bill-break-down/9674471002/", "title": "US aid to Ukraine could top $53 billion.

Afterward, President Joe Biden detailed the latest aid package, which includes both defensive equipment and lethal weapons.\n\nThe last time Russia invaded Ukraine, then-President Petro Poroshenko also addressed a joint session of Congress and famously said in 2014 that “one cannot win the war with blankets,” as part of an emotional plea for help arming his troops. In response, the Obama administration announced $46 million in security assistance to Ukraine, which included body armor and night vision goggles but no lethal aid.\n\nOver the weekend, former President Donald Trump criticized the Obama-Biden aid efforts to Ukraine by saying, “They sent blankets. I sent Javelins.”\n\nFacts First: Trump’s complicated history with aid to Ukraine aside, it’s a misleading oversimplification for him to suggest his predecessor did not provide any military aid to Ukraine. While the Trump administration was the first willing to provide lethal weapons to Ukraine, the Obama administration did provide defense and military equipment. By March 2015, the US had pledged $75 million worth of equipment including UAVs, counter-mortar radars, night vision devices, medical supplies and 230 armored Humvee vehicles, according to the Pentagon’s Defense Security Cooperation Agency.\n\nAs Biden contemplates what additional assistance to provide Ukraine in its latest fight with Russia, here’s a look at the aid the US has previously provided Ukraine.\n\nSince Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, the US has committed more than $3 billion in security assistance to Ukraine. These aid packages have included military equipment to “enhance Ukraine’s defensive capabilities,” according to a March 14 report from the Congressional Research Service.\n\nThrough the Presidential Drawdown Authority and the Department of Defense’s Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, the US has provided sniper rifles, grenade launchers, Javelins and small arms in addition to essential nonlethal equipment. The Biden administration in particular sent Stinger anti-aircraft weapons as part of the first PDA package of 2022 and has committed to redirect Mi-17 helicopters originally intended for Afghanistan through the Excess Defense Articles program.\n\nOver the past year, the US has given more than $1 billion in total security assistance to Ukraine, according to a February 26 statement from Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\nIn 2021, Blinken authorized $260 million in military assistance to Ukraine and after the invasion began, he authorized an additional aid package of $350 million for “immediate support” for Ukraine.\n\nBiden administration officials have said they are continuing to send security assistance to Ukraine, even as the Russian invasion continues. Just last week, Congress approved a $13.6 billion emergency aid package for Ukraine and lawmakers have indicated bipartisan support for more aid.\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden announced $800 million in new security assistance to Ukraine, which comes from the emergency aid Congress approved last week. According to the White House, the $800 million will provide Ukraine with 800 Stinger anti-aircraft systems, 100 drones, “over 20 million rounds of small arms ammunition and grenade launcher and mortar rounds,” 25,000 sets of body armor, 25,000 helmets, 100 grenade launchers, 5,000 rifles, 1,000 pistols, 400 machine guns and 400 shotguns, in addition to “2,000 Javelin, 1,000 light anti-armor weapons, and 6,000 AT-4 anti-armor systems.”", "authors": ["Tara Subramaniam"], "publish_date": "2022/03/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/01/18/ukraine-helicopter-crash-kills-top-officials/11073708002/", "title": "Ukraine war updates: Deadly helicopter crash kills kids, top official", "text": "The Pentagon has designated stockpiles of its artillery shells in Israel to supply Ukrainian forces engaged in heavy combat with Russia in the Donbas region, a U.S. official confirmed Wednesday to USA TODAY.\n\nThe two sides have been firing thousands of shells a day at each other, a pace that has forced the U.S and its allies to scour the world for ammunition to feed Ukrainian guns. News of the transfer from Israel was first reported by The New York Times.\n\nThe official was not publicly authorized to speak about the transfer of U.S. stockpiles from Israel. Israel has been reluctant to provide aid to Ukraine over concern about its relationship with Russia. Russian military forces are operating in neighboring Syria, and Israel conducts missions there as well. The Pentagon has positioned stocks of materiel in strategic locations around the world.\n\nThis month, a senior military official characterized the artillery duel in eastern Ukrainian as savage.

Other victims were on the ground.\n\n\"Unspeakable pain,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Bright memory to everyone whose life was taken by this black morning.\"\n\nZelenskyy said the national police and security services were working to determine the cause of the crash. There was no initial information indicating the helicopter, which was flying in foggy conditions, was shot down. Images posted on social media from near the scene appear to suggest it crashed close to a residential building after striking the kindergarten.\n\nPresident Joe Biden issued a statement Wednesday saying, \"We grieve with all those who are mourning this heartbreaking tragedy.'' He added that Monastyrskyi and his aides \"were deeply involved in the preservation of Ukraine’s democracy.''\n\nAt the World Economic Forum session in Davos, Switzerland, Ukraine first lady Olena Zelenska fought back tears, and forum President Borge Brende of Norway requested 15 seconds of silence after opening the session to honor the victims.\n\nRussian capture of Soledar puts pressure on defense of Bakhmut\n\nUkrainian troops have most likely pulled out of the town of Soledar in the Donetsk province after a pitched battle with Russian forces and mercenaries from the Kremlin-aligned Wagner Group, the British Defense Ministry said in its latest war assessment.\n\nThe Russians have their sights on the strategically important city of Bakhmut, 11 miles to the southwest, which has been the subject of intense fighting for weeks.

Putin has for years accused Ukraine of mistreating ethnic Russians in the region.\n\n“Large-scale combat operations involving heavy weapons, artillery, tanks and aircraft haven’t stopped in Donbas since 2014,” Putin said. “All that we are doing today as part of the special military operation is an attempt to stop this war.

That package includes Javelin anti-armor missiles, ammunition and body armor, according to the official. Prior to the invasion, military materiel had been arriving in Ukraine by cargo aircraft. U.S. military aid has continued to flow into Ukraine in the last few days but the official declined to say how it has arrived there.\n\nMeanwhile, Britain’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that “the speed of the Russian advance has temporarily slowed likely as a result of acute logistical difficulties and strong Ukrainian resistance.”\n\n“Russian forces are bypassing major Ukrainian population centres while leaving forces to encircle and isolate them,” the ministry said.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook and Associated Press\n\nSnake Island defiance:Ukrainian soldier on Snake Island tells Russian officer 'go (expletive) yourself' before being killed\n\nFleeing to the border: Over 150,000 Ukrainians seek refuge\n\nMEDYKA, Poland – At least 150,000 people have fled Ukraine into Poland and other neighboring countries in the wake of the Russian invasion, the U.N. refugee agency said Saturday.\n\nSome walked many miles through the night while others fled by train, car or bus, forming lines miles long at border crossings.

A U.S. official told reporters Friday the Pentagon had information suggesting that Moscow had expected a faster advance on Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy refused an American offer to evacuate, insisting he would stay. “The fight is here,” he said.\n\nSkirmishes reported on the edge of Kyiv suggested that small Russian units were trying to clear a path for the main forces.

Eight years later, experts say Russia is mounting a far more sophisticated propaganda effort as it invades Ukraine.\n\nArmies of trolls and bots stir up anti-Ukrainian sentiment. State-controlled media outlets look to divide Western audiences. Clever TikTok videos serve up Russian nationalism with a side of humor.\n\nThe effort amounts to an emerging part of Russia’s war arsenal with the shaping of opinion through orchestrated disinformation fighting alongside actual troops and weapons.\n\nAnalysts at several different research organizations contacted by The Associated Press said they are seeing a sharp increase in online activity by groups affiliated with the Russian state. That’s in keeping with Russia’s strategy of using social media and state-run outlets to galvanize domestic support while seeking to destabilize the Western alliance.\n\nResearchers saw a sudden and dramatic increase in anti-Ukrainian content in the days immediately before the invasion. On Valentine’s Day, for instance, the number of anti-Ukrainian posts created by the sample of Twitter accounts jumped by 11,000% when compared with just days earlier. Analysts believe a significant portion of the accounts are inauthentic and controlled by groups linked to the Russian government.\n\n– David Klepper, The Associated Press\n\nRussian propaganda:TikTok is Russia's newest weapon in arsenal for anti-Ukraine propaganda\n\nTroops from NATO member nations could be deployed to defend Slovakia\n\nSlovakia’s defense minister says up to 1,200 foreign troops from other NATO members could be deployed in his country in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe plan is part of the NATO initiative to reassure member countries on the alliance’s eastern flank by sending forces to help protect them. Slovakia borders Ukraine.\n\nDefense Minister Jaroslav Nad said forces from the Netherlands and Germany are among those expected to come. Germany will also provide the Patriot system to boost Slovakia’s air defense.\n\nThe country’s government and Parliament have not yet approved the plan.\n\nNad also said his country’s government has approved sending arms and fuel worth 11 million euros ($12.4 million) requested by Ukraine. The aid will include 10 million liters (2.6 million gallons) of fuel, 2.4 million liters (630,000 gallons) of aviation fuel and 12,000 pieces of ammunition.\n\n– The Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy mobilizes Ukrainian reservists and those eligible for service\n\nAfter Russia launched a military invasion into Ukraine early Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called up reservists and those liable for service for a full military mobilization.\n\nAs many Ukrainians fled to neighboring countries, the Ukraine State Border Guard Service announced that men ages 18 to 60 were prohibited from leaving the country, ahead of a possible draft to increase the country's military service.\n\nTalk of conscription led to questions in the U.S. about whether the government could ever reinstate the draft. That is highly unlikely in a country where antiwar sentiment has grown in the aftermath of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Congress would have to reinstate the draft since induction authority expired in 1973. If approved, the president would then be authorized to induct civilians through the Selective Service Administration into the armed forces under an amendment to the Military Selective Service Act.\n\nEven though there is no draft currently, almost all men and male immigrants aged 18 to 25 are required to register with the Selective Service. Women make up close to 17% of the U.S. armed forces, but Congress would have to pass legislation amending the act to require women register.\n\n– Chelsey Cox\n\nRussian protesters risk arrest to decry Putin's war\n\nMOSCOW – Risking arrest and intimidation, Russian citizens have taken to the streets in Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities to protest President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRussians with prominent platforms – celebrity actors, television presenters, comedians and pop stars – risked their state contracts and jobs to make anti-war statements.\n\nMany Russians have seen horrifying images from the Ukraine conflict, broadcast by independent media.

Will it blunt Putin's Ukraine invasion?\n\nRussia's wealthy oligarchs and political elites flaunt a level of in-your-face affluence across the world. This week, their wealth and connections to Russian President Vladimir Putin made some of them targets of President Joe Biden's sanctions in response to the Kremlin’s ongoing military invasion of Ukraine.\n\nBut if the Biden administration really wants to hurt Russian oligarchs enough to rein in Putin's actions in Ukraine, it needs to hit them much harder – and hit a lot more of them, some U.S. officials and kleptocracy experts told USA TODAY.\n\nBy any measure, the new rounds of U.S. financial blockages issued this week go far beyond what has been done in the past to pressure Putin into curbing his rogue behavior, White House officials said.

It will give all U.N. members an opportunity to speak about the war Monday and vote on a resolution later in the week that U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said would “hold Russia to account for its indefensible actions and for its violations of the U.N. Charter.”\n\nFrench Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere announced that the Security Council will hold a meeting Monday afternoon on the humanitarian impact of Russia’s invasion, a session sought by French President Emmanuel Macron to ensure the delivery of aid to growing numbers of those in need in Ukraine.\n\nBoth meetings follow Russia’s veto Friday of a Security Council resolution demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. The vote was 11-1, with China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nMore:Ukraine athletes defend country, demand sanctions for Russia\n\nU.S. Embassy in Ukraine: departing the country may take up to 30 hours\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Ukraine is now urging U.S citizens in Ukraine to try leaving using private transportation options as leaving could in some cases take more than 30 hours.\n\nThe embassy said Sunday “conditions may deteriorate” in various parts of the country without any warning due to the escalating Russian invasion.\n\n“Careful consideration should be made to routes and the risks of travel because Ukraine’s roads are in many cases crowded, exposed to combat operations, and infrastructure such as bridges in some locations have been destroyed. Sheltering in place may remain the best option for some,” the embassy said on its website.\n\nFurthermore, embassy officials say that border crossings into neighboring Poland and all main crossing points into Moldova are overwhelmed.\n\n“Some are experiencing extremely long wait times (well over 30 hours in some cases),” the embassy said. “We recommend that, if possible, U.S. citizens consider redirecting to border crossings with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, which are currently experiencing lower wait times to cross.”\n\nEmbassy officials also offered a series of tips including bringing enough food, water and warm clothing. They also urge citizens to carry hard copies of important documents as the U.S. government will not be able to evacuate its citizens from Ukraine.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nMore:Satellite images show damaged airport in Hostomel following strikes\n\nRussian ruble sinks in early trading\n\nThe ruble sank nearly 26% against the U.S. dollar early Monday after Western nations moved to block Russian banks from the SWIFT global payment system.\n\nThe ruble was trading at a record low 105.27 per dollar, down from about 84 per dollar late Friday.\n\nOver the weekend, Japan joined the moves by the U.S. and other western nations to impose more sanctions against Russia.\n\nRestrictions on the Russian central bank target its access to more than $600 billion in reserves the Kremlin has at its disposal. They hinder Russia’s ability to support the ruble as it plunges in value.\n\nSanctions announced earlier had taken the Russian currency to its lowest level against the dollar in history.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:What sanctions does Russia face? Here's a list by country\n\nUS official: Belarus may join Ukraine invasion\n\nA senior U.S. intelligence official says Belarus is expected to send troops into Ukraine as soon as Monday to fight alongside Russian forces that invaded Ukraine last week.\n\nBelarus has been providing support for Russia’s war effort but so far has not taken a direct part in the conflict.\n\nThe American official has direct knowledge of current U.S. intelligence assessments and says the decision by Belarus’ leader on whether to bring Belarus further into the war depends on talks between Russia and Ukraine happening in the coming days. The official spoke anonymously to discuss the sensitive information.\n\nRussian forces have encountered strong resistance from Ukraine defenders, and U.S. officials say they believe the invasion has been more difficult, and slower, than the Kremlin envisioned, though that could change as Moscow adapts.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nMore:There may be risk, but the U.S. will likely keep arming Ukraine even if Russia takes Kyiv\n\nRussia rendering Facebook unusable in some places\n\nRussia has apparently rendered Facebook largely unusable across leading Russian telecommunications providers amid rising friction between Moscow and the social media platform.\n\nThe London-based internet monitor NetBlocks reports that Facebook’s network of content-distribution servers in Russia was so badly restricted Sunday that “content no longer loads, or loads extremely slowly making the platforms unusable.”\n\nRussian telecoms regulator Roskomnadzor on Friday announced plans to “partially restrict” access to Facebook. That same day, Facebook’s head of security policy had said the company was barring Russian state media from running ads or otherwise profiting on its platform anywhere in the world.\n\nFacebook says it has also refused a request by the Kremlin not to run fact checks related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on the platform for users inside Russia.\n\nNetBlocks reported earlier that access to Twitter was similarly restricted Saturday. That was a day after Twitter said it was temporarily halting ads in both Ukraine and Russia.\n\nThe Twitter and Facebook restrictions can be circumvented inside Russia using VPN software, just as users do in mainland China.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nCanada will investigate Russian flight violating airspace ban\n\nCanada said it will launch an investigation into a Russian-based Aeroflot flight that entered Canadian airspace on Sunday and violated a ban on all Russian flights due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"We are aware that Aeroflot flight 111 violated the prohibition put in place earlier today on Russian flights using Canadian airspace,\" Transport Canada said in a series of tweets. \"We are launching a review of the conduct of Aeroflot and the independent air navigation service provider, NAVCAN, leading up to this violation.\n\n\"We will not hesitate to take appropriate enforcement action and other measures to prevent future violations,\" the agency added.\n\nEarlier Sunday, Omar Alghabra, Canada's transport minister, that the country's airspace was closed to all Russian aircraft operators.\n\n\"We will hold Russia accountable for its unprovoked attacks against Ukraine,” Alghabra tweeted.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nBiden to hold a call with U.S. allies to discuss Ukraine, Russia\n\nPresident Joe Biden is scheduled to hold a call with U.S. allies on Monday morning to discuss the latest situation in Ukraine and their coordinated response, the White House said late Sunday.\n\nThe call is scheduled for 11:15 a.m. ET. The call comes after Biden ordered the U.S. State Department to release up to an additional $350 million worth of weapons from its stockpile to Ukraine on Friday.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement Saturday that this third authorization for weapons shipments to Ukraine in less than a year was \"unprecedented.\"\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nUkraine radioactive site in Kyiv struck by missiles, UN nuclear watchdog\n\nThe United Nations’ nuclear watchdog says missiles have struck a radioactive waste disposal site in the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv. So far there are no reports of damage to the buildings or indications of a release of radioactive material.\n\nIn a statement late Sunday, International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi said Ukrainian authorities informed his office about the overnight strike. Grossi said his agency expects to get the results of on-site radioactive monitoring soon.\n\nThe report comes a day after an electrical transformer at a similar disposal facility in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv was damaged.\n\nSuch facilities typically hold low-level radioactive materials such as waste from hospitals and industry, but Grossi says the two incidents highlight a “very real risk.” Grossi said if the sites are damaged there could be “potentially severe consequences for human health and the environment.”\n\n– Associated Press\n\nJapanese billionaire to donate over $8 million to Ukraine\n\nJapanese billionaire Hiroshi “Mickey” Mikitani said he will donate over $8 million to the government of Ukraine, calling Russia’s invasion “a challenge to democracy.”\n\nMikitani, founder of e-commerce giant Rakuten Group Inc., said Sunday in a letter to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that the donation of ¥1 billion (roughly $8.7 million) will go toward “humanitarian activities to help people in Ukraine who are victims of the violence,” the Japan Times reported.\n\nMikitani said he met with Zelenskyy during a visit to the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv in 2019.\n\n“My thoughts are with you and Ukraine people,” Mikitani wrote in his letter. “I believe that the trampling of a peaceful and democratic Ukraine by unjustified force is a challenge to democracy.\n\n“I sincerely hope that Russia and Ukraine can resolve this issue peacefully and that Ukraine people can have peace again as soon as possible,” Mikitani added.\n\n– Terry Collins\n\nRussia-Ukraine talks set for Monday\n\nThe office of Ukraine’s president confirmed that a delegation is set to meet with Russian officials as Moscow’s troops continue to target Kyiv.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office said on the Telegram messaging app that the two sides would meet at an unspecified location on the Belarusian border.\n\nABC and CNN, each citing Ukrainian officials, reported the talks would take place Monday, which matches a report from Russian state-owned news agency TASS that said the discussions would take place in the morning.\n\nThe announcement on Sunday came hours after Russia announced that its delegation had flown to Belarus to await talks. Ukrainian officials initially rejected the move, saying any talks should take place elsewhere than Belarus, where Russia has placed a large contingent of troops.\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, expressed hope for prospective peace talks.\n\n\"We'll look forward to what comes out of those discussions,\" Thomas-Greenfield said Sunday on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\n– Associated Press, Jay Cannon and David Jackson\n\nBorrell: EU countries will soon send fighter jets to Ukraine\n\nEuropean Union countries will soon send fighter jets to Ukraine at the Kyiv government’s request to help it counter the Russian air and land assault, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said Sunday, according to the AFP news service.\n\n\"We're going to provide even fighting jets. We're not talking about just ammunition. We are providing more important arms to go to a war,\" Borrell said at a news conference.\n\nThe military transfer appeared imminent, according to Alexandre Krauss, a senior advisor to the EU Parliament.\n\n“Flying in #Ukraine skies within the hour,” Krauss tweeted at 3:38 p.m. ET, citing Borrell’s announcement.\n\nAccording to Borrell, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba had asked the EU for the planes.\n\nCiting a person familiar with the talks, the Wall Street Journal reported that “discussions are still ongoing” and that any planes would be supplied directly by EU member states and not funded through an arrangement announced earlier for the EU to finance weapons deliveries to Ukraine.\n\nUrsula von der Leyen, president of the EU Commission, announced earlier in the day, that EU members were “stepping up our support for Ukraine. For the first time, the EU will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and equipment to a country under attack. We are also strengthening our sanctions against the Kremlin.”\n\nThe announcement came as satellite imagery showed a massive convoy of Russian military vehicles – with some estimates of 3.25 miles long – moving toward Kyiv and about 40 miles away.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nUS Embassy in Kyiv: $54 million in humanitarian assistance on the way\n\nThe U.S. is giving nearly $54 million in humanitarian assistance for those affected by the Russian invasion, the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv announced Sunday.\n\nThe funding, which comes as thousands of Ukrainians flee Russian invaders, was announced with \"the welfare of ordinary Ukrainians in mind,\" the embassy said in a statement. It includes nearly $26 million from the Department of State and $28 million from the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nMore than 200,000 people have fled Ukraine to neighboring countries and U.N. officials believe up to 4 million people could leave if fighting continues.\n\n– Jay Cannon\n\nUS to send anti-aircraft Stinger missiles to Ukraine, AP reports\n\nThe U.S. for the first time has approved the direct delivery of Stinger missiles to Ukraine as part of a package approved by the White House on Friday, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe exact timing of delivery is not known, but officials say the U.S. is currently working on the logistics of the shipment. The officials agreed to discuss the development only if not quoted by name.\n\nFOR SUBSCRIBERS:There may be risk, but the US will likely keep arming Ukraine even if Russia takes Kyiv\n\nThe decision comes on the heels of Germany’s announcement that it will send 500 Stinger missiles and other weapons and supplies to Ukraine.\n\nThe high-speed Stingers are very accurate and are used to shoot down helicopters and other aircraft. Ukrainian officials have been asking for more of the powerful weapons.\n\nEstonia has also been providing Ukraine with Stingers since January, and had to get U.S. permission in order to do that.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nNeutral Switzerland 'probable' to hit Russia with financial sanctions, president says\n\nAfter days of fence-sitting, Swiss President Ignazio Cassis said on Sunday it was \"very probable\" that neutral Switzerland would follow the European Union’s lead and sanction Russia and freeze Russian assets in the country.\n\nReuters reported that Cassis, who was interviewed on French-language Swiss public television, said the nation's seven-member Federal Council would meet Monday and review recommendations by finance and economy officials.\n\n\"It is very probable that the government will decide to do so tomorrow, but I cannot anticipate decisions not yet taken,\" Cassis said, via Reuters.\n\nSwitzerland, a global financial hub and commodities trading center – has so far resisted calls for it to levy sanctions and possibly freeze Russian assets, especially after the EU and U.S. announced sanctions.\n\n“The civilized, democratic world has to stand up to the biggest threat to European security and stability since the Second World War,” Peter Stano, lead spokesperson for EU external affairs, said on Friday. “It affects not only Ukraine. It affects Europe. Switzerland is part of Europe. So we expect our partner, our neighbor, our ally to follow suit in standing up for defending the principles on which our communities and countries are based.”\n\nThe oft-neutral country's potential move comes as a surprise to some.\n\n\"Switzerland to sanction Russia! Holy crap. A country that was neutral against the literal Nazis. Neutral no more!\" tweeted Paul Massaro, a counter-corruption advisor to the U.S. Congress.\n\nIt was not known immediately how many wealthy Russian elites, especially oligarchs close to Putin, have stashed money in Swiss banks, known for their strong privacy firewalls. But various leaks of banking documents over the years suggest they have a sizable amount invested in Switzerland.\n\nIn 2018, Swiss banks reportedly frozen $1 billion in the accounts of one oligarch alone – Russian metals tycoon Viktor Vekselberg – over fears that they could be fined for doing business with him after Washington levied sanctions against the businessman, the Moscow Times reported at the time.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nUS Embassy urges Americans in Russia to consider leaving 'immediately'\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Moscow said Sunday that American citizens “should consider departing Russia immediately” because of the dramatic drop-off in airline service in and out of the country.\n\n“An increasing number of airlines are cancelling flights into and out of Russia, and numerous countries have closed their airspace to Russian airlines,” a security alert posted to the embassy’s website states. “U.S. citizens should consider departing Russia immediately via commercial options still available.”\n\nThe guidance comes after the EU's move to close its airspace to Russian airlines. Russian airline Aeroflot says it cancelled all flights to Europe.\n\nThe State Department had already advised Americans not to travel to Russia because of its aggression against Ukraine, as well as the potential harassment of U.S. citizens in the country and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUN emergency session scheduled for Monday\n\nThe U.N. Security Council has voted for the 193-member General Assembly to hold an emergency session on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Monday.\n\nThe vote on Sunday to authorize an emergency meeting was 11 in favor, Russia opposed, and China, India and the United Arab Emirates abstaining. That was the exact same vote on a resolution Friday demanding that Moscow immediately stop its attack on Ukraine and withdraw all troops. But in that case, Russia used its veto and the resolution was defeated.\n\nUkrainian U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya asked for the General Assembly meeting to be held under the so-called “Uniting for Peace” resolution, initiated by the U.S. and adopted in November 1950 to circumvent vetoes by the Soviet Union during the Korean War.\n\nThat resolution gives the General Assembly the power to call emergency meetings when the Security Council is unable to act because of the lack of unanimity among its five veto-wielding permanent members – the U.S., Russia, China, Britain and France.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nUkraine civilian death toll hits 352, officials say\n\nThe civilian death toll from Russia's invasion of Ukraine has risen to 352, including 14 children, the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal affairs said Sunday. The ministry said 1,684 people had been injured.\n\nThe United Nations had announced the civilian death toll had reached 240 by Saturday, but stressed that the actual figure was potentially \"considerably higher.”\n\n– Jay Cannon\n\nUS urges Americans in Ukraine to find best exit routes\n\nOfficials with the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine issued a new advisory Sunday, telling Americans to choose departure routes very carefully if they are trying to flee.\n\n“Ukraine’s roads are in many cases crowded, exposed to combat operations, and infrastructure such as bridges in some locations has been destroyed,” the embassy said in a notice. “Sheltering in place may remain the best option for some.”\n\nMost border crossings into Poland and all main crossing points into Moldova “are severely backed up,” with extremely long wait times – in some cases, more than 30 hours, the embassy said.\n\n“We recommend that, if possible, U.S. citizens consider redirecting to border crossings with Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia, which are currently experiencing lower wait times to cross,” the note says. “Note that conditions at each border can change very quickly and wait times can increase at any time without warning.”\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nUPS, FedEx halt services in Russia\n\nShipping giants FedEx and UPS have suspended services to Russia amid the country’s military assault on Ukraine.\n\nUPS said it had halted all international shipments to addresses in Russia as of Feb. 25. FedEx said it was “closely monitoring the situation” and had suspended inbound service to Russia “until further notice.”\n\nBoth companies had already stopped service to Ukraine, after Russian troops invaded the neighboring country. Russian troops have now advanced well into Ukrainian territory, reaching its second largest city and encircling the capital, Kyiv.\n\n– Deirdre Shesgreen\n\nMcMaster: Putin got ‘more than he bargained for’\n\nFormer national security adviser H.R. McMaster said Sunday that Ukrainians are doing a “tremendous job” defending the country against Russian military attacks.\n\n“I think Putin got a lot more than he bargained for. He's in a very difficult position. And I think anything we can do, obviously, financially, going after his international criminal enterprise with sanctions and so forth is important. But the support for Ukraine's ability to defend themselves is also important,” McMaster told Margaret Brennan on CBS’ “Face the Nation.”\n\nThe retired lieutenant general also said the seizure of Ukraine’s capital Kyiv is “not in the cards for the immediate future,” but acknowledged the next 72 hours are going to be “really critical.”\n\n– Chelsey Cox\n\nKyiv mayor: 'We are encircled'\n\nKYIV, Ukraine – As Russian troops draw closer to the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv's mayor is both filled with pride over his citizens' spirit and anxious about how long they can hold out.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press on Sunday, after a grueling night of Russian attacks on the outskirts of the city, Mayor Vitali Klitschko was silent for several seconds when asked if there were plans to evacuate civilians if Russian troops managed to take Kyiv.\n\n“We can't do that, because all ways are blocked,” he finally said. “Right now we are encircled.\"\n\nWhen Russian troops invaded Ukraine on Thursday, the city of 2.8 million people initially reacted with concern but also a measure of self-possession. However, nerves started fraying when grocery stores began closing and the city's famously deep subway system turned its stations into bomb shelters.\n\nThe mayor confirmed to the AP that nine civilians in Kyiv had been killed so far, including one child.\n\nA Klitschko-ordered curfew began about sundown on Saturday and is to extend until at least 8 a.m. Monday. His order pointedly stated that any unauthorized person outside could be considered a saboteur.\n\n“We are hunting these people, and it will be much easier if nobody is on the street,\" Klitschko explained, saying that six Russian “saboteurs” were killed Saturday night.\n\nIn the last few days, long queues of people — both men and women — were spotted waiting to pick up weapons throughout the capital, after authorities decided to distribute weapons freely to anybody ready to defend the city. There are concerns, however, about arming nervous civilians with little military experience amid warnings of Russian saboteurs disguised as Ukrainian police or journalists.\n\n“To be honest, we don't have 100% control,” said Klitschko. “We built this territorial defense in a short amount of time — but these are patriotic people.\"\n\n“Right now, the most important question is to defend our country,” he added.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nEU closing airspace to Russia\n\nThe top official in the European Union said the bloc will take unprecedented new steps after Russian President Vladimir Putin raised tensions with talk of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe EU will close its airspace to Russian airlines, including \"the private jets of oligarchs,\" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.\n\n“We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU,” she said.\n\n\"For the first time ever, the European Union will finance the purchase and delivery of weapons and other equipment to a country that is under attack,” she added.\n\nThe EU will also ban pro-Kremlin media outlets Russia Today and Sputnik, she said.\n\nThe European Commission's plans followed the announcement earlier in the day that Germany was committing 100 billion euros ($113 billion) to a special armed forces fund and would keep its defense spending above 2% of GDP from now on. The shift underscored how Russia’s war on Ukraine was rewriting Europe’s post-World War II security and defense policy in ways that were unthinkable only a few weeks ago.\n\nThe EU’s plan to fund weapons purchases was unprecedented and would use millions of euros to help buy air defense systems, anti-tank weapons, ammunition and other military equipment to Ukraine’s armed forces. It would also supply things like fuel, protective gear, helmets and first aid kits.\n\n– Katie Wadington and AP\n\nOn nuclear deterrence:What is DEFCON? What's nuclear deterrence?

Mark Warner: Putin’s invasion a major ‘miscalculation'\n\nSen. Mark Warner, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Putin “totally underestimated” the resolve of the Ukrainians and the support building worldwide for the Ukrainian people, describing the Russian invasion so far as a major “miscalculation.”\n\n“Remarkably what he's also been able to do his unify the vast majority of us in the Senate, Democrats, Republicans alike,” Warner said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “And he’s going to pay a high price.”\n\nWarner said Putin over the past few years became “more and more isolated.”\n\n“When you are an authoritarian leader, and you’re only hearing from people that want to say to the boss, hey, you're right. I think that leads to miscalculation. I think that is what has happened in the case of this invasion in Ukraine.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nUS ambassador: No US 'boots on the ground' in Ukraine\n\nAs she made the rounds of the Sunday talk shows, United Nations Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield made clear that the U.S. response to the invasion of Ukraine will not include American troops or air personnel.\n\n\"The president has made clear that we're not going to put boots on the ground,\" Thomas-Greenfield said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\nThomas-Greenfield said that mandate includes no patrols of any \"no-fly zone\" in the region.\n\nThe U.S. will provide whatever assistance it can to Ukraine, working with NATO partners, she said, but: \"We're not going to put American troops in danger. So that means we're not going to put American troops in the air as well. But we will work with the Ukrainians to give them the ability to defend themselves.”\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRussian troops stalled outside Kyiv\n\nThe main force of Russian assault aimed at Kyiv remained stalled Sunday about 18 miles from the city’s center, hindered by stiff Ukrainian resistance and Russia’s own problems providing fuel and supplies for its troops, according to a senior Defense Department official.\n\nThere are indications of some fighting inside Kyiv and that Russian troops in Ukrainian military uniforms have appeared there, said the official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.\n\nThe officials described Ukrainian resistance as stiff and creative around Kyiv and Kharkiv. Meantime, fuel shortages and logistics problems for Russian troops are most acute near Kharkiv.\n\nThe war is a major operation for Russia’s military, a complex mission that it does not have recent experience mounting, the official said. It’s unclear if the shortages in materials represent a failure in planning or execution. However, the official said Russian officers are expected to learn and adapt to its logistical problems.\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, there are troubling indications that Russia is encircling the city of Chernihiv, northeast of Kyiv, and could be planning to besiege it, the official said. There are increasing rocket attacks there, imprecise weapons that can kill civilians and damage infrastructure.\n\nOverall, Russian President Vladimir Putin has committed two-thirds of the combat forces he deployed against Ukraine is now inside the country, the official said.\n\nRussia has launched more 320 ballistic missiles into Ukraine during the four-day war. There are some indications that several ballistic missiles have failed to launch.\n\n– Tom Vanden Brook\n\nU.S.: Putin ‘can be assured’ of tougher sanctions\n\nLinda Thomas-Greenfield, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., said Sunday the U.S. will continue to apply stiffer economic sanctions against Russia as Putin escalates fighting in Ukraine.\n\n\"We are continuing to assess what we can do moving forward,\" Thomas-Greenfield said on NBC’s \"Meet the Press.\" \"And the Russians can be assured that we will continue to put more and more sanctions as they continue to press more on the Ukrainian government.”\n\nU.S. and Western allies have cut some Russian banks out of the SWIFT financial system but stopped short of a complete removal.\n\n“They will feel the pain,” she said, adding there are also actions the U.N. can take.\n\n“We can isolate them. We can isolate them in the United Nations. We can isolate them in U.N. specialized agencies. They are feeling that isolation.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nNATO leader: Russia must make 'serious compromises' in peace talks\n\nNATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said if peace talks are to succeed, Russia must be willing to make \"serious compromises\" and \"respect the sovereignty of Ukraine.\"\n\nStoltenberg told CNN's \"State of the Union\" that Putin's decision to put his nuclear forces on high alert is not a good sign.\n\nIt \"just adds to the very aggressive rhetoric\" of Russia, the NATO leader said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nUkraine ambassador: Russia committing ‘war crimes’\n\nUkraine’s ambassador to the United States accused Russia of committing war crimes in its attack on her country.\n\nAmbassador Oksana Markarova said Sunday that Russian troops are using heavy missiles and heavy artillery to attack Ukraine’s infrastructure, as well as hospitals and kindergartens. Many children have been killed, and one entire family was shot in their car, she said.\n\n“Nothing is off limits to them,” Markarova said on ABC’s \"This Week.\" “What we see is a full-fledged war, with war crimes on the ground.”’\n\nAsked whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is safe, Markarova offered no information on his whereabouts but added, “He is as safe as our country.”\n\nShe spoke shortly after Zelenskyy’s office confirmed that a delegation will meet with Russian officials.

Only an occasional car appeared on a deserted main boulevard as a strict 39-hour curfew kept people off the streets. Terrified residents instead hunkered down in homes, underground garages and subway stations in anticipation of a full-scale Russian assault.\n\n“The past night was tough – more shelling, more bombing of residential areas and civilian infrastructure,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said. “There is not a single facility in the country that the occupiers wouldn’t consider as admissible targets.”\n\nVideos posted on Ukrainian media and social networks showed Russian vehicles moving across Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The images showed Russian troops roaming the city in small groups. In one image, Ukrainian troops were seen firing at the Russians and damaged Russian light utility vehicles abandoned nearby.\n\nThe images underscored the determined resistance Russian troops face while attempting to enter Ukraine’s bigger cities. Ukrainians have volunteered en masse to help defend the capital, Kyiv, and other cities, taking guns distributed by authorities and preparing firebombs to fight Russian forces.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy asks UN top court to halt Russian invasion, says Moscow 'manipulating the notion of genocide'\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of manipulating the notion of genocide to justify invading its neighbor and urged the International Court of Justice to hold trials.\n\nLocated in The Hague, the Netherlands, the ICJ is the main judicial arm of the United Nations.\n\n\"Russia must be held accountable for manipulating the notion of genocide to justify aggression. We request an urgent decision ordering Russia to cease military activity now and expect trials to start next week,\" Zelenskyy wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe ICJ rules on disputes between states, including responsibility for breaches of international law. It is not linked to the International Criminal Court, also based in The Hague, which holds individuals accountable for atrocities.\n\n– Caren Bohan and Associated Press\n\nZelenskyy is a lion of a leader | Opinion\n\n“I need ammunition, not a ride.” Those are the words proclaimed by Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.

He said other locations are also possible but made clear that Ukraine doesn’t accept Russia’s selection of Belarus, which Russia has used as a staging ground for its invasion.\n\nThe Kremlin said Sunday a Russian delegation had arrived in Homel, Belarus, for talks with Ukrainian officials. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the delegation includes military officials and diplomats.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nRussia's cutting off port access\n\nRussia was working Sunday to limit strategic strategic ports along the Ukraine’s coastline stretching from the border with Romania in the west to the border with Russia in the east. A Russian Defense Ministry spokesman, Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov, said Russian forces had blocked the cities of Kherson on the Black Sea and the port of Berdyansk on the Azov Sea.\n\nRussia’s military also put increasing pressure on strategic ports in the south of Ukraine, blocking the cities of Kherson on the Black Sea and the port of Berdyansk on the Azov Sea.\n\nCutting Ukraine’s access to its sea ports would deal a major blow to the country’s economy.\n\n-- Associated Press\n\nRussia targets Ukraine airfields in next phase\n\nRussia unleashed a wave of attacks on Ukraine targeting airfields and fuel facilities in what appeared to be the next phase of an invasion that has been slowed by fierce resistance.

In 2015, he was an intelligence volunteer in the war in Eastern Ukraine. And yet, this is what Ukraine has become – a country where internationally acclaimed artists are forced to kiss their children goodnight before they go off to defend their homeland from the occupying force. \"We will never give up and we are going to win this war.

And Ukrainians are absolutely united as a nation now.\"\n\nHis words are haunting and powerful, with his children in the background.\n\n\"What can I tell you about this war?

With so many clashes taking place, the U.S. says the world's two biggest military powers can't afford to be giving each other the silent treatment.\n\nBoth countries need to \"get back on a normal course of corresponding, being able to pick up a phone and talk to one another through a crisis, being able to make sure our militaries still have contact with one another,\" Biden told reporters on Tuesday.\n\nThe Biden administration has been pressing for the reestablishment of a hotline between the countries that would allow their militaries to immediately communicate with another as a way keep conflicts from escalating. Beijing formally suspended the military communication channel more than a year ago and declined the Pentagon's calls when a Chinese spy balloon was found floating over the U.S. earlier this year.\n\nThe incident derailed Biden's plan to improve U.S. relations with China after a series of calls and a choreographed summit amid a gathering of global leaders in Indonesia. The two leaders have not spoken to one another since.\n\nThat will change this week when, nearly a year to the day since they last sat down with one another, Biden and Xi will meet on U.S. soil in the San Francisco Bay Area during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation leaders' meeting. The U.S. is hosting the summit for the first time since 2011.\n\nHere's what to expect:\n\n'Shining city on a hill':In Joe Biden's world, the US is a beacon of democracy. Has his vision fallen out of step with voters?\n\nBiden's 'intense diplomacy' takes center stage\n\nBiden's administration has taken the approach that \"intense diplomacy\" with China can prevent misunderstandings and keep competition between the two nations from mushrooming into a military conflict. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said Monday that the administration hopes the Biden-Xi meeting can open the door to cooperation on shared concerns such as fentanyl trafficking, too.\n\n\"The U.S. and China have to be able to speak directly to one another on all of the critical issues that face our two countries,\" Sullivan said. \"Including issues in moments of crisis.\"\n\nBiden's administration has stressed that it wants to have a pragmatic and stable relationship with China, which has the world's second largest economy behind the United States. In an effort to open direct lines of communication with Xi and his deputies, U. S. officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, have visited Beijing this year. High-ranking Chinese officials have also come to Washington.\n\n'Common-sense guard rails':Biden and China's Xi met in a virtual summit. Here's where the relationship stands.\n\nRepublicans put Biden under microscope over China − again\n\nThe administration's approach has come under scrutiny from Republicans, who say the White House is relying too heavily on diplomacy and economic engagement and should focus more on deterrence measures such as military support for Taiwan and sanctions.\n\nThe U.S. has assessed that China wants to be \"ready\" to invade the democratically governed island that it considers part of its territory by 2027. Taiwan plans to hold elections next year, and Biden is expected to push Xi not to interfere or try to change the status quo in any way.\n\nRep. Mike Gallagher, a Wisconsin Republican who chairs the House's select committee on competition with China, said the spying incident \"popped the balloon of Biden's engagement strategy\" and criticized trips to Beijing by Cabinet members.\n\n\"Certainly, we don't want to have a misunderstanding or miscommunication lead to a kinetic confrontation in the region,\" Gallagher said. \"But the best form of communication we can take is to surge hard power to the Indo-Pacific and make it, by turning Taiwan to do a porcupine, make it impossible for Xi to achieve his military objective. That's actually more important than any diplomatic channel or any working group or any sternly worded statement from the State Department.\"\n\n'The U.S. is ready to play;:President Biden presses China's Xi to find 'ways to work together'\n\nMilitary communications with China key to Taiwan, Ukraine and Israel-Hamas conflicts\n\nChinese fighter jets have increasingly crossed into the Taiwan Strait, and U.S. officials indicated this this week that Biden would bring up the behavior that the U.S. has characterized as dangerous and provocative in his meeting with Xi. He approved a $345 million weapons package for Taiwan in July and has requested money for deterrence efforts as part of a $106 billion national security request to Congress.\n\nThe U.S. maintains a policy of strategic ambiguity on Taiwan, although Biden has suggested several times that he would step in to help the country if China were to launch an attack.\n\nRep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, the ranking member of the House's select committee on competition with China, said that tension between the U.S. and China has decreased somewhat since February.\n\n\"Certainly there's not a spy balloon − a Chinese spy balloon traversing across the United States today − and I think that helps a lot in people's perceptions about the relationship but there's still a lot of tensions,\" Krishnamoorthi, D-Ill., said.\n\nHe said that a restart of a military-to-military communications with China would help to reduce the risk of a \"catastrophic incident\" in the region between forces, help lower tensions over Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine and lower the possibility of a wider Middle Eastern war, given that the Chinese also have ties to Iran.\n\nChina has called for a cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war, and the conflict is expected to be a topic of conversation during the summit. So is the war in Ukraine. The U.S. has sought to discourage China from getting providing lethal aid to Russia.\n\nHowever, Xi's government said it views \"Taiwan independence\" as the biggest challenge in the relationship with America. The Biden administration stressed again this week that it does not support Taiwan independence.\n\nBiden administration officials have been careful to keep expectations for the meeting low. The goal of the meeting is to reduce the risk of conflict, a U.S official who briefed reporters said, and keep the channel of communication open.\n\n\"I don't think we're going to like see any big breakthroughs or announcements,\" said Alan Yu, senior vice president of national security and international policy and the liberal Center for American Progress.\n\nYu said the White House is \"trying to put a floor under the relationship\" between Biden and Xi.\n\n\"Some people may kind of pooh-pooh that,\" said Yu, a former Biden administration official at the State Department. \"But I think that is the environment that we're in. That's actually a pretty important achievement to strive for.\n\nSpy balloon fallout:President Biden calls China's Xi a dictator, drawing a backlash from Beijing\n\nChina's economic woes and AI\n\nChina has been facing an economic slowdown and property slump coming out of the coronavirus pandemic, and Xi has been removing high-level officials from their positions over the last several months.\n\nU.S. restrictions on the the shipment of advanced chips and chipmaking making equipment to China comes at a very bad time for Beijing, says Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.\n\n\"I think that they would like to slow that down. Hopefully, they're realistic enough to know that they probably can't stop it or reverse it, because if their expectations are that high, then we're not going to see a fairly successful effort to stabilize the relationship,\" Glaser said. \"Because I'm convinced that the administration is committed to continuing down that path.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has been seeking to make it more difficult for China to make breakthroughs on artificial intelligence and restrict Beijing's access to technology that can be used by its military.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said last month that it \"opposes US politicizing, instrumentalizing and weaponizing trade and tech issues.\"\n\n\"Arbitrarily placing curbs or forcibly seeking decoupling to serve political agenda violates the principles of market economy and fair competition, undermines the international economic and trading order, disrupts and destabilizes global industrial and supply chains and will eventually hurt the interests of the whole world,\" Wenbin said.\n\nChina's economy is being damaged because of its provocative actions toward Taiwan, said Krishnamoorthi, who visited Taiwan earlier this year as part of a congressional delegation.\n\n\"Most experts believe that instability caused by their military aggression only aggravates their economic problems. And so, I think that's worth reiterating to them, and showing them, look, if you want to fix your economic problems, then stop the saber rattling and take this off the table,\" he said.\n\n\"At the least, if they start to talk about more about the status quo and maintaining the status quo, I think that that would be a step in the right direction. If they keep talking about changing the status quo, if they keep...the level of provocative actions in the Taiwan Strait to a high level as they are right now, then that will do the opposite,\" he said.\n\nGallagher, a Republican, rejected that notion.\n\n\"It's just as likely that Xi Jinping could move up his timeline for invading Taiwan because those domestic economic headwinds are going to get worse the longer he waits, and he may never get a better chance. So to me that betrays a bit of wishful thinking or naïve thinking in the White House that I worry is going to impact our deterrent posture across the Taiwan Strait and increase the risk of war,\" Gallagher said. \"A collapse of deterrence in the Indo-Pacific will make the current conflicts in Ukraine and in Israel and Gaza seem like child's play in comparison.\"\n\n'A deep commitment to bounce back':San Francisco, hoping to resuscitate its 'doom loop' post-pandemic image, hosts APEC (and Biden)\n\nAnd then, there's fentanyl\n\nBeyond the military conflicts, lawmakers said they want Biden to bring up cyber hacking, intellectual property theft, human rights, wrongfully detained Americans and fentanyl.\n\n\"The CCP has the ability to police much better the export of fentanyl precursors,\" Krishnamoorthi said of chemicals used to make the drug.\n\nSullivan said the White House is hoping to see \"some progress\" on the issue coming out of the meeting.\n\nThe U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission released its annual report to Congress Tuesday placing much of the blame for terse relations on China – both for the emergency communications breakdown as well as the lapsed effort to jointly fight the scourge of fentanyl.\n\n“China continued to blame the United States for the worsening bilateral relationship and refused to cooperate on key issues, such as reestablishing crisis communications channels and stemming the flow of fentanyl into the United States,” it said.\n\nThe commission touched on both issues in its 753-page report, the latest of the periodic annual reports required by Congress in order to help it monitor and investigate the national security implications of the U.S.-China trade and economic relationship.\n\n\"China’s leadership has selectively responded to U.S. efforts to reduce tensions for the purposes of preserving Chinese access to U.S. markets, technology, and FDI,” or foreign direct investment, the commission said in the report’s executive summary.\n\n“China has also selectively engaged with U.S. allies and partners to try to drive a wedge between them and the United States,\" it stated.\n\nContributing: Josh Meyer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/15"}]}

The President has worked to make the place his own, installing his family’s furniture, ordering up chocolate ice cream bars branded with the presidential seal and returning to traditions his predecessor abandoned.\n\nThe 12 months Biden has been in office did come with major victories. He successfully guided passage of trillions in new funding to combat the coronavirus pandemic and rebuild American’s crumbling infrastructure through Congress. He has appointed more federal judges than his recent predecessors, overseen a boom in hiring, a drop in poverty and orchestrated a nationwide vaccination campaign.\n\nYet for all that, the country remains fractured and irritable. A “malaise” has sunk in as the pandemic persists, his vice president conceded in an interview this month. Americans are misbehaving on airplanes, in school board meetings and at grocery stores. So entrenched is the anger that one father felt comfortable blurting out a coded derogatory phrase about Biden when he was speaking to the President on the phone last Christmas Eve – while his own son watched on.\n\n“There are successes that he’s had, but people do not feel it and you can’t persuade people to feel better. You can’t jawbone that,” said David Axelrod, a senior adviser in former President Barack Obama’s White House and a CNN senior political commentator.\n\nUnlike Trump, Biden is not actively stoking the anger. But his inaugural speech pledge to “end this uncivil war” remains unfulfilled.\n\nBiden’s trademark personal style – wielded over breakfasts in Delaware, inside caucus rooms on Capitol Hill and across the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office – hasn’t brought around holdout Democrats to some of his boldest ideas, let alone many Republicans.\n\nRELATED: Battered White House searches for a Biden comeback scenario\n\nOverseas, a full-blown conflict now looms with Moscow just six months after coming face-to-face with the Russian leader in an old villa in Geneva. And after declaring “independence from the virus” on the South Lawn in July, Biden is contemplating Covid’s permanent presence going forward.\n\nOn a personal level, just adjusting to life in the White House has been a struggle. By his own admission, Biden finds the place stifling and regularly spends three nights a week elsewhere.\n\nBlame game\n\nEven as top advisers and longtime friends of Biden try to help reset a floundering presidency, recriminations have quietly surfaced inside the West Wing about the fundamental causes of the challenges.\n\nA considerable share of finger-pointing is aimed at deep divisions among Democrats and how some top officials have sought to accommodate progressives in hopes of keeping peace inside the party.\n\n“Over the last year, the White House has allowed the left to hijack and misinterpret the rationale for Biden’s election,” said one former Democratic official in regular touch with the President, speaking to CNN on condition of anonymity to talk candidly about the West Wing. “He was not elected to transform the country.”\n\nWhite House chief of staff Ron Klain, a longtime Biden adviser, is at the middle of those internal tensions. He is seen by some observers as pushing his own agenda or being too quick to side with demands from liberals, which raises expectations that ultimately lead to disappointment.\n\nWhen Democrats clinched their razor-thin majority in the Senate, following the Georgia runoff victories for Sens. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, those expectations skyrocketed far beyond what the narrowly divided Senate has been able to deliver. The expected failure of voting rights legislation is only the latest example.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks to members of the media as he leaves a meeting with the Senate Democratic Caucus to discuss voting rights and election integrity on Capitol Hill on January 13. Andrew Harnik/AP\n\n“They pushed for everything you would have thought they would have done if they had 58 or 60 Democrats,” one lawmaker told CNN, who lamented how Biden’s first year is ending with a focus on what he didn’t accomplish rather than what he did.\n\n“Either your message is wrong, or your approach is wrong. Something is wrong.”\n\nAt the center of the White House challenges, though, is Biden himself and what even many longtime admirers describe as unremarkable and uneven performances. Several members of Congress who speak with Biden frequently told CNN that his grasp of details is impressive, but how he communicates that publicly is often anything but.\n\nHeading into a tumultuous midterm election year, where Democrats are already bracing for the prospect of losing control of the House and possibly the Senate, the White House said Biden will spend more of his time communicating directly with the American people, rather than trying to negotiate deals in Congress.\n\nThat promise, however, rings familiar. The administration has repeatedly promised that Biden would spend more time on the road selling his plans, yet he has traveled less than most recent predecessors.\n\n“There should be some really significant issues that we should be able to come around and coalesce around and get done. And I think we can. I think we can get it done. And we need the President, we need the administration to lead the way. They’re in charge. The buck stops there. There is no doubt about, and we need to get things done. We’re not doing good enough,” said Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who is running for Senate in the state.\n\n“The President is the President, and there is no question that he bears some responsibility for it. But there is also Congress and the Senate, and the Republicans are MIA. They’re worthless,” Ryan said on CNN.\n\nWhite House press secretary Jen Psaki on Tuesday hailed the legislative successes and the economic strides, despite coming into office under what she described as “an incredibly difficult circumstance.”\n\n“You don’t get everything done in the first year,” Psaki said. “The work is not done. The job is not done, and we are certainly not conveying that it is.”\n\nConfronting Covid\n\nAs his second year begins, advisers tell CNN that Covid-19 and its messy fallout is the biggest weight on Biden – the one challenge he believes could reverse his fortunes or forever damage his presidency.\n\nBiden has made significant strides, particularly in getting hundreds of millions of Americans vaccinated. But millions still refuse to get shots, a persistent source of frustration for the President.\n\n“This virus has fooled us multiple times,” one senior health official told CNN. “Nobody expected Delta to just blow us away. And then to have Omicron come out of nowhere, it’s a big, big surprise.”\n\nRELATED: Biden vowed to fix testing. But he didn’t plan for Omicron.\n\nStill, the President has maintained the same mentality throughout. He has repeatedly advised his team that while outsiders will quickly point out any of their missteps, “you should keep your head down and keep working.”\n\n“He’s not panicking. He’s not blaming anyone,” the official said.\n\nTrillions of dollars in Covid relief funds helped alleviate some of the economic stresses of the pandemic, but even Biden has admitted the influx of cash into the economy may have driven up consumer prices. Inflation triggered by a Covid-related mismatch between supply and demand remains a drag on the President’s approval ratings.\n\nPresident Joe Biden removes his mask before speaking about updated CDC mask guidance on the North Lawn of the White House on April 27, 2021 in Washington, DC. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nBiden’s poll numbers began taking a southward turn over the summer, when it became clear his celebrations of a waning virus were premature. Mask recommendations returned, shutdowns persisted and the once-hopeful feeling disappeared. Confusing messaging from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been a source of constant irritation in the West Wing.\n\nIn other ways, the pandemic has altered the normal rhythms of executive branch life. Unable to travel as extensively as he’d once hoped, Biden has taken to conducting events from an elaborate stage-set built in a White House auditorium where participants can beam in on video-chat. He has traveled abroad only twice, a slower pace than his predecessors.\n\nOrdinarily the West Wing and its adjacent offices are a hive of activity, where at any single moment meetings could be unfolding on dozens of pressing topics. But even a year into his presidency, Covid has left some staffers still working at home. Those who are selected for a meeting with the President himself must arrive well beforehand to undergo testing by the White House Medical Unit. What once could have been a 30-minute block of a Cabinet secretary or lawmaker’s day becomes more of an ordeal.\n\n“You know what it takes to go meet with the President?” said Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra last month. “It’s just a pain. And you knock out so much of your day. You’ve got to get tested, what is it, an hour and a half before you can see the President, you got to hang around there. So, the actual physical one-on-one, not as often.”\n\nCalls for a reset\n\nGrowing anxious ahead of this year’s midterm elections, many Democrats have issued various calls for a strategy reset – on Covid, the economy and communications. Some have privately questioned whether Biden – whose public schedule sometimes contains only a few events per week – is doing enough to promote his accomplishments and break through to voters.\n\nBiden’s speeches often rely on the same lengthy passages, recited verbatim from a teleprompter. When he does leave Washington, his events have tended to adopt a familiar look: a tour of a factory or plant, a speech to a group of unionized workers and up to an hour of shaking hands afterward. His top-visited state, aside from Delaware where he travels home on weekends, was Pennsylvania.\n\nAt moments, the nation’s oldest President shows his age. After he reminisced about working with noted segregationist Strom Thurmond in a speech about voting rights last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi seemed perplexed: “None of us have a lot of happy memories about Strom Thurmond,” she said afterward.\n\nQuestions persist about whether he plans to run again in 2024. And missteps by his vice president, Kamala Harris – whose allies believe she is both underutilized as a political asset and overexposed to difficult issues – have led to deeper introspection about the future of the Democratic Party.\n\nAfter urging from party strategists, Biden has lately begun drawing sharper contrasts with Republicans and speaking out louder about the corrosive lies peddled by Trump. The President has begun staging more events meant to highlight the benefits of what he has been able to accomplish, like passing the largest public works bill in decades.\n\nPresident Joe Biden disembarks from Air Force One upon arrival at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, July 28, 2021, after traveling to Pennsylvania to speak on the economy. SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHeading into the new year, the White House has drawn up executive actions on issues like police reform for Biden to act where Congress won’t.\n\nAnd White House officials and Democratic lawmakers are beginning to quietly plot a way forward on Biden’s sweeping spending agenda, including potentially splitting it into pieces.\n\nBiden has stood accused by some progressives, including his onetime rival for the Democratic presidential nomination Sen. Bernie Sanders, of failing to pursue an agenda focused on real-world economic issues. It’s a charge that stings for the President who still makes a point in meetings of asking how policy proposals will affect pipefitters and construction workers in his Pennsylvania hometown, and angrily scolds advisers for using jargon those people wouldn’t understand.\n\nHis top aides insist Biden’s achievements have been squarely focused on improving conditions for the working class.\n\n“I would not say that the Democratic Party has turned its back on the working class. We have had historic successes in the first year of the Biden presidency, the passage of the American Rescue Plan, to give one example, has cut child poverty in this country almost in half,” said Susan Rice, Biden’s domestic policy adviser, last week on CNN. “We have put very important supports in the pockets of the American people at a time when the pandemic has made their economic prospects perilous.”\n\nManaging expectations\n\nIn many ways, Biden’s first year was defined by expectations getting away from him: about the trajectory of the pandemic, the durability of Trump and the ability of a governing veteran to find solutions to any of it. At junctures throughout the year, Biden appeared caught by surprise when challenges arose that, at least in retrospect, were not surprising.\n\nWhen the Taliban swiftly took control of Afghanistan in August, Biden said it happened quicker than anyone expected – despite intelligence warnings painting a grim picture following a complete American withdrawal.\n\nPresident Joe Biden pauses as he listens to a question about the bombings at the Kabul airport that killed at least 12 U.S. service members, from the East Room of the White House in August 2021. Evan Vucci/AP\n\nWhen France erupted in anger following his deal to provide Australia with nuclear-powered submarines, Biden said he thought someone had given Paris a heads up that their own agreement to provide conventional subs was off – even though no one had.\n\nWhen Biden said in June that inflation would “pop up a little bit and then go back down,” he was discounting warnings from veterans of Democratic administrations of a more serious trend – one that continues six months later.\n\nAnd when testing shortages at the start of the latest Covid surge caused mile-long lines, Biden said he wished he’d thought of ordering millions more tests earlier – even though health experts have been warning for months of a looming shortage.\n\nRepeatedly appearing caught off-guard by events undercut Biden’s promise of restoring competence to government and predictability on the world stage and led to accusations he was being poorly served by his team. It belied a President who, behind the scenes, solicits a wide range of opinions on critical issues and engages a panel of advisers inside and outside government. The process has sometimes delayed critical decisions, giving the impression of indecisiveness.\n\nAfter the harrowing Afghanistan ordeal, there were calls to fire his national security adviser Jake Sullivan. Others have urged Biden to replace his Covid response coordinator Jeff Zients. After publicly sinking prospects for quick passage of the Build Back Better plan, Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia vented frustration at White House staff he said drove him to his “wit’s end.”\n\nWhether Biden plans to replace anyone in the new year remains to be seen; he is a known deliberator and hasn’t executed any major personnel changes since taking office. The advisers he continues to rely upon most – chief of staff Ron Klain and senior advisers Mike Donilon, Bruce Reed and Steve Ricchetti – have worked for him for decades.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean there aren’t voices advocating for changes in the West Wing.\n\n“If I was down [this much] in my ratings, I’d have a new chief of staff,” one prominent Democrat who speaks regularly with Biden said.\n\nA struggle to adjust\n\nThe pandemic has not been the only factor contributing to an uneasy transition to White House life. After spending eight years haunting the West Wing, Biden had only been upstairs to the private presidential residence once during his time as vice president.\n\nWhen he moved into the executive mansion last year, staff crowded him at awkward hours, including in the early mornings. Someone was always just outside the door or walking quietly through the hallways. It was a way of life Biden wasn’t accustomed to – and did not enjoy.\n\nAttempts to make the place feel more like home had mixed results. Some of the furniture from his home in Delaware made its way to the White House. Books and family photographs adorn shelves and tables that previously held antiques from the White House collection. But the family German Shepherd Major was dispatched permanently to a friend’s house after a series of nipping incidents (a new puppy, Commander, arrived late last year).\n\nPresident Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, look at their new dog Commander, after speaking virtually with military service members to thank them for their service and wish them a Merry Christmas, from the South Court Auditorium of the White House in Washington, DC. SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOver the course of the year, Biden and the first lady requested some changes. No longer are chefs or Secret Service agents posted in the private kitchen on his third-floor residence during breakfast hours; instead, he can wander in wearing a bathrobe and pour himself a bowl of Special K cereal before lifting weights in the residence gym.\n\nWaiting for him in the morning is a notecard with his schedule for the day, which Biden marks with checks as each meeting is completed, and a stapled-together compilation of daily news clips called “The Bulletin.” He packs it all in a worn leather briefcase to carry with him downstairs to the office.\n\nA focus on the familiar has extended beyond the White House. When Biden met Putin in Geneva last summer, an aide made sure to bring along a bottle of orange Gatorade, the President’s preferred drink. And even when he is traveling, Biden places daily phone calls to his grandchildren, who remain at the center of his personal life.\n\nThe third time was a charm in Biden’s quest for the presidency, with a triumph in 2020 after falling well short in the campaigns of 1988 and 2008. The question that many of his longtime admirers raise in quiet conversations is whether Biden still approaches the job and, in fact, Washington in the same way he might have decades ago.\n\nThere’s little question that the outcome of his second year – and his ability to spark a turnaround, as many presidents before him have – will help shape how Biden answers the biggest question of all, likely by this time next year: whether he will run again in 2024.", "authors": ["Jeff Zeleny Kevin Liptak Kaitlan Collins", "Jeff Zeleny", "Kevin Liptak", "Kaitlan Collins"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}]}

Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, backed a plan empowering Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., as speaker until January to get the House moving again. McHenry has already been serving as an interim speaker with limited powers, and Jordan has lost two speaker elections on the House floor.\n\nBut after an hours-long, closed-door meeting, House Republicans appeared to reject the plan, putting the lower chamber − and the nation − back at square one. But Jordan vowed not to give up his bid for the speakership.\n\nAs long as the House doesn't have a speaker, lawmakers can't approve crucial legislation, such as funding to avoid a government shutdown or aid to Israel as the country's war rages on with Hamas.\n\nCatch up with USA TODAY's updates on the speaker fight.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHouse to hold third speaker election tomorrow\n\nThe House will convene for a third speaker election at 10:00 a.m. Friday morning, Jim Jordan's office confirmed Thursday evening.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nRepublican holdouts urge Jim Jordan to drop out\n\nRep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., told reporters that he and the other Republican holdouts who have refused to support Jim Jordan told the Ohio lawmaker on Thursday to withdraw his candidacy.\n\n\"He needed to know there's no way forward for a speakership,\" Rutherford said. \"He missed his moment in leadership when he failed Steve Scalise. That was pretty much everybody's opinion.\"\n\nLouisiana Rep. Steve Scalise previously sought the speakership but withdrew his bid earlier this month.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nFormer lawmaker Lee Zeldin heads to Jim Jordan's office\n\nFormer Rep. Lee Zeldin, R-N.Y., entered Jordan's office Thursday evening.\n\nPart of the New York GOP delegation, a faction against Jordan, voted for Zeldin as a protest candidate in the last two speaker elections the Ohio Republican lost.– Ken Tran\n\nWhy is there no speaker of the House? Jordan seemingly no closer to winning over holdouts\n\nJordan left a meeting with a handful of the GOP holdouts against him and said they had a \"good discussion.\"\n\nBut some of those Republican lawmakers who left the meeting room, including Reps Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. and Mike Kelly, R-Pa., said their minds have not changed. The meeting seems to have done little for Jordan's pursuit of the speakership.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMcCarthy says Jordan should 'fight through it'\n\nLeaving the speaker's office, Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the former speaker of the House, told reporters Jim Jordan should stay in the race and \"fight through it.\"\n\n\"Don't give up right away,\" McCarthy said.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWho is voting against Jim Jordan? Here are the Republican holdouts\n\nThe major problem facing Jordan is that his opponents come from various corners of the House Republican conference, each with their own grievances against the Ohio Republican.\n\nA portion of the New York GOP delegation for instance, are pressing Jordan for commitments to increase what's known as the SALT tax cap, a state and local tax deduction popular with their constituents back home.\n\nOther lawmakers, such as Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a vulnerable and moderate GOP lawmaker, are refusing to vote for Jordan out of frustration with how conservative hardliners seemingly have a stranglehold on the rest of the House Republicans.\n\nBacon has argued voting for Jordan would effectively be rewarding “bad behavior” from conservative hardliners, the people who fueled the ouster of former Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nJordan is also facing opposition over his proposed government funding plan that could include a 1% cut across the board to government spending, which would include defense spending. Among those lawmakers is Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fla., chair of the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nA large portion of the GOP holdouts against Jordan are currently meeting with the Ohio Republican, McCarthy and McHenry.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJordan publicly vows to stay in speaker’s race\n\nJordan, leaving the an hours-long meeting with his fellow Republicans that resulted in no progress towards electing a new speaker, portrayed confidence in his bid, even as the holdouts against him show no interest in budging.\n\n“We made the pitch to members on the resolution (to empower McHenry) as a way to lower the temperature and get back to work. We decided that wasn’t where we’re gonna go,” Jordan told reporters. “I’m still running for speaker and I plan to go to the floor and get the votes and win this race.”\n\nBefore heading to a possible third speaker election however, Jordan said he will consult his allies and meet with the holdouts and attempt to assuage their concerns “so that we can move forward and begin to work for the American people.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhy didn't Republicans support empowering an interim speaker?\n\nA group of Republicans on Thursday afternoon appeared to balk at the idea of granting McHenry additional powers.\n\nFor example, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., chair of the House Republican conference, came out against the now-dead resolution to empower McHenry as an interim speaker.\n\n\"I strongly oppose any attempt to create a Democrat backed coalition government,\" Stefanik said in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. Empowering McHenry almost certainly would have required Democratic support.\n\nStefanik is the No. 4 ranking House Republican and her opposition against the resolution is a likely indicator any further attempts to empower McHenry have a steep uphill climb.– Ken Tran\n\nGOP lawmaker: Jordan to call wife and talk to McCarthy ahead of third speaker vote\n\nRep. Andy Barr, R-Ky., told reporters Jim Jordan will consult his family and ousted former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy before a possible third speaker election Thursday.\n\n-- Ken Tran\n\nResolution to empower McHenry looks unlikely, GOP lawmakers say\n\nExiting a closed-door meeting, Republican lawmakers said the resolution to empower McHenry will not go to the floor.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., told reporters he expects there to be a third speaker election Thursday, with Jordan as the GOP nominee again.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nMcCarthy: 'Nobody's involved' in key issues\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the closed-door meeting, McCarthy noted how following his ouster, there is no clear GOP leadership to handle key legislative issues, such as funding the government or passing a foreign aid package for Israel.\n\n\"Nobody's involved in this because that brilliant eight people led by Gaetz, this was apparently their plan,\" McCarthy said.\n\n\"I don't quite understand what that helps America for, what that helps the conservative cause because it's actually the reverse,\" he added.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nDoes McHenry already have power? GOP is split\n\nAmong one of the points of debate in the closed-door conference meeting is whether there is even need for a resolution to empower McHenry. McHenry already has powers to oversee legislation on the House floor, some House Republicans have argued.\n\nRep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y., told USA TODAY he believes McHenry already has the \"authority to move forward.\"\n\nThe acting speaker however, has been resistant to the idea, Molinaro said, instead pushing for Congress to pass a resolution instead to resolve the issue.\n\nGOP lawmakers have been huddling for two and a half hours now and there is still no clear timeline for when the measure to empower McHenry would be considered\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nRepublicans might hold internal vote on a path forward\n\nThe efforts to empower McHenry have bitterly divided the House Republican conference to the point members might hold an internal vote to determine support.\n\nRep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, said members are questioning whether the measure is constitutional. An internal vote would effectively be a test to see where the conference stands on granting McHenry temporary powers.\n\n\"There's a desire to still vote on it so it's clarified there's no potential challenges,\" Crenshaw told reporters.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse Democrats says GOP must make concessions\n\nRep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., told reporters House Republicans shouldn't expect Democrats to vote to empower McHenry without making some concessions.\n\n\"We're not just going to give our votes,\" Raskin said. The Maryland Democrat deferred to House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries on what those concessions might look like.\n\n\"Obviously, if our votes are needed, we're going to be substantively involved in the definition of what the agenda is,\" Raskin added.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nGOP lawmaker estimates half of House Republicans against McHenry\n\nRep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., told reporters he expects half of the House Republican conference to oppose the measure granting McHenry temporary powers.\n\nZinke himself did not say whether he would support the resolution, noting he thinks the House should elect a speaker and reiterating his support for Jordan.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse Democrat: 'Time to reopen the House'\n\nRep. Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., left the door open to supporting a resolution to empower Patrick McHenry.\n\n\"We have to see the details\" first, Moskowitz told reporters.\n\nHouse Democrats, Moskowitz said, are biding their time and waiting to hear from Republicans on the proposal.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nDemocratic lawmaker: House GOP needs 'intense therapy'\n\nRep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., said House Democrats were keeping their powder dry on supporting a resolution to empower McHenry.\n\nThe resolution has sparked fury from a sizable portion of the House Republican conference, meaning Democrats will have to pitch in and support the measure.\n\nMcGovern, reacting to the infighting the resolution has caused, suggested for House Republicans to stop holding conference meetings and instead opt for \"intense therapy.\"\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse Democrats hold their own closed-door meeting\n\nMeanwhile, just a one-minute walk away from a closed-door meeting where House Republicans are debating a resolution to empower McHenry, House Democrats are huddling to discuss next steps.\n\nThe move to empower McHenry as a temporary speaker will almost certainly require a heavy lift from Democrats. Hard-right lawmakers have been leaving the GOP meeting furious and lambasting the resolution.– Ken Tran\n\nHouse vote postponed\n\nA roll call vote to determine attendance in the House, scheduled for noon, has been postponed as lawmakers continue to debate a resolution that would empower McHenry as an interim speaker.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJordan to back McHenry as temporary speaker until January\n\nJordan will back empowering McHenry as temporary speaker up until January, according to a source familiar.\n\nIn the meantime, Jordan will continue to run for speaker and work to shore up support over the next few months.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nChair of ultraconservative Freedom Caucus against empowering McHenry\n\nRep. Scott Perry, R-Pa., chair of the House Freedom Caucus, a loose coalition of hard-right lawmakers, told reporters he would oppose empowering McHenry with temporary powers.\n\nThe resolution to make McHenry effectively an interim speaker \"sets a bad precedent,\" Perry said.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse Republicans discussing resolution to empower McHenry\n\nHouse Republicans are currently meeting behind closed doors to discuss a resolution from Rep. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio, to temporarily empower McHenry as acting speaker.− Ken Tran\n\nJohn Boehner for speaker? GOP holdout casts ballot for former speaker in protest\n\nRep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., one of the GOP holdouts against Jordan voted for former speaker John Boehner on Wednesday in the second speaker election as a protest vote.\n\nThe vote drew some applause from House Democrats.\n\nBoehner served as House speaker from 2011 to 2015 and was virtually removed by House Republicans, led by Jordan and the House Freedom Caucus, who threatened to oust him from the speakership akin to McCarthy’s ejection earlier this month. Boehner ultimately resigned in the face of those threats.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWho is Patty Murray?\n\nSen. Patty Murray, a Democrat representing Washington state, currently serves as president pro tempore of the Senate.\n\nWithout an official speaker of the House, Murray was next in line for the presidency after Vice President Kamala Harris in the case of an emergency.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHouse Republicans to meet as Jordan faces steep climb to speakership\n\nHouse Republicans will huddle in a closed-door conference meeting at 11 a.m. Thursday to discuss next steps.\n\nThe meeting comes as Jordan faces growing opposition to his bid for speaker and talks increase about giving temporary speaker Patrick McHenry more power.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhen is the next vote for speaker of the House?\n\nAs Jim Jordan still faces stiff opposition from GOP holdouts after failing two consecutive ballots, it is unclear when the House will hold a third speaker election.The House will come into session at noon for a roll call vote to determine attendance, but it's uncertain when a speaker vote will be held.\n\nJordan, R-Ohio, told reporters Wednesday he intends to stay in the race and expected a vote at noon Thursday. But as it remains clear Jordan has no path towards the 217 votes he needs to become speaker, the timing of the third speaker election is up in the air.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nHow to watch the speaker vote live\n\nLawmakers were originally expected to begin proceedings at noon Thursday in Washington, but timing could change if Republicans meet in conference first. When the House reconvenes, you can follow along here.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJordan holdout: Conservative hardliners 'created the situation'\n\nRep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., one of the moderate GOP lawmakers opposing Jordan, told USA TODAY the House is in its state of paralysis by the fault of the conservative hardliners who have overturned \"precedent.\"\n\nHard-right lawmakers, Lawler told USA TODAY, \"set a new precedent within this congress.\" The New York Republican referenced multiple times ultraconservatives tanked rule votes, traditionally procedural votes that until this year, never failed.\n\nThe historic move to remove McCarthy from the speakership, Lawler added, was done with \"no real planning,\" resulting in the gridlock that has consumed House Republicans.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWho is acting speaker McHenry?\n\nRep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., was chosen to be acting House speaker from a succession list that McCarthy provided to a House clerk in January in case his seat became vacant.\n\nMcHenry is serving his 10th term in Congress and represents the 10th congressional district in North Carolina. He is a McCarthy ally and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, a role that helped him negotiate the debt limit deal earlier this year.\n\nHe was appointed in 2015 by then House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., to serve as the Chief Deputy Whip, helping Scalise build agreement around a conservative policy agenda for the House Republican Conference.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWill Hakeem Jeffries become speaker of the House?\n\nNo.\n\nTechnically, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries could be elected, as there are no requirements for the speaker to be from the majority party (or even a member of Congress). In both rounds of voting this week, Jeffries has received 212 votes, the full backing of House Democrats and more than Rep. Jim Jordan both times.\n\nHowever, the New York Democrat would still need five more votes to hit the necessary 217.\n\nDespite infighting among Republicans, it's very doubtful any lawmaker on the right, let alone five, will cast a vote across the aisle.\n\n−Savannah Kuchar\n\nHow many votes are needed for speaker of the House?\n\nThe number of votes needed is determined by a majority of House lawmakers present and voting.\n\nOn Tuesday, that number was 217. Because no lawmaker received 217 votes in the first election, the speaker race continues today.\n\nWhen the vote for speaker begins Wednesday, members will have a roll call vote to determine how many are present and voting − and how many votes are needed to win. Then they will be called on individually to cast their vote for a speaker.\n\nVoting could last several rounds Wednesday or be postponed until another day if a speaker isn't elected during the second try.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nWhat happened to Kevin McCarthy? Here's what to know about the former speaker of the House\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., had a rocky start to his reign as speaker. He went through 15 rounds of voting to get elected and had to make concessions with hard-line conservatives who opposed him.\n\nBut once elected, his detractors' frustrations only grew, particularly during debt ceiling negotiations between McCarthy and President Joe Biden\n\nThe boiling point of his speakership hit late last month when McCarthy worked with Democrats to pass a stopgap measure, also known as a continuing resolution, to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who criticized McCarthy for the measure, introduced a motion to vacate and remove McCarthy as speaker.\n\nEight Republicans and 208 Democrats voted to oust him. The eight were Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona, Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Rep. Eli Crane of Arizona, Gaetz of Florida, Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Rep. Matt Rosendale of Montana.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nMichigan GOP Rep. Jack Bergman ready to 'step up' and serve as speaker\n\nRep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., is prepared to \"step up\" and serve as House speaker to help lead the party out of the chaos both it and the nation currently face, his spokesman James Hogge said in an email to the Detriot Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\n\"It’s becoming clear Rep. Jordan’s path is narrowing by the hour,” Hogge said. ““We cannot go another day without a Speaker. He simply doesn’t have the votes — we need to have a frank discussion as a conference about a path forward. If as a conference we see he can’t get the necessary votes to become Speaker, General Bergman is prepared to step up.\"\n\n20 House Republicans voted against Jordan in the first House speaker election while 22 Republicans voted against him in the second election. Bergman supported Jordan in both rounds.\n\nBergman said on X, formerly known as Twitter, on Monday that “We need a leader to step up to unite the Republican conference, actually pass critical legislation, and move our Nation forward.”\n\n−Paul Egan and Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho voted against Jordan for speaker? Here are the holdouts so far\n\nThe second ballot was another setback for Jordan’s bid for speaker. Twenty-two GOP lawmakers voted against Jordan, an increase from the 20 that opposed him on Tuesday.

Thomas Massie, R-Ky.\n\nAccording to Womack, lawmakers are heading home for the weekend.\n\nThe House will return into session next Monday at 6:30 p.m.\n\nCandidates have until noon on Sunday to declare their intentions to run for speaker.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nInternal GOP vote exclusively about Jordan\n\nThe internal vote on whether to keep Jordan as the GOP speaker nominee is a secret ballot vote according to Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Pa.\n\nThe options, he said, were to either vote yes, no or present.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nHouse GOP voting whether to keep Jordan as nominee\n\nLawmakers are now leaving the closed-door meeting saying that voting is ongoing on whether Republicans should keep Jordan as their nominee.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nLetter from group who ousted McCarthy included Jordan holdout\n\nThe group of House Republicans who ousted McCarthy sent a letter to the House GOP conference offering to face consequences for removing McCarthy in exchange for putting Jordan in the speaker's chair.\n\nBut one of the GOP lawmakers who voted to oust McCarthy is also a Jordan holdout: Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.\n\nThe letter originally included Buck but after the Colorado Republican noticed his signature, the letter removed Buck's name.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., one of the lawmakers who voted to remove McCarthy said it was \"some miscommunication I guess.\"− Ken Tran\n\nHouse Republicans are meeting behind closed-doors\n\nFollowing Jordan's third defeat, House Republicans are huddling behind closed doors at 1 p.m. Friday.\n\n−Ken Tran\n\n8 GOP lawmakers who voted against McCarthy offer to be 'punished'\n\nSpeaking on the Capitol steps, five of the eight GOP lawmakers who voted to oust McCarthy said the eight are offering to be punished by the rest of the House GOP conference if it would placate Jordan's holdouts.\n\nReps Eli Crane, R-Ariz., Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Bob Good, R-Va., Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., and Nancy Mace, R-S.C., said they would accept any consequences for voting to remove McCarthy.\n\nThose consequences could include removal of committee assignments, censures and/or removal from conference.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nJordan loses third vote for House speaker\n\nJordan lost the third speaker vote, failing to garner enough support behind him and only losing more support among House Republicans.\n\nLike with the second ballot, his detractors only grew in numbers − this time to 25 − making Jordan’s path to the speakership more uncertain.\n\nIt is unclear if a fourth vote will be held and whether lawmakers will stay in session through the weekend.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHere are the 25 GOP lawmakers who voted against Jordan\n\nSome 25 GOP lawmakers voted against Jordan as speaker. Three of those votes against Jordan are new holdouts who previously supported the Ohio Republican. The 25 are:\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.\n\nRep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.\n\nRep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, R-Ore.\n\nRep. Anthony D’Esposito, R-N.Y.\n\nRep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Jake Ellzey, R-Texas\n\nRep. Drew Ferguson, R-Ga.\n\nRep.

Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJordan on track to lose third vote\n\nThe House vote is ongoing, but Jordan is on track to lose a third time.\n\nHe has lost 25 votes so far, which is more than the 22 votes he lost in the second vote and 20 votes he lost in the first vote.\n\n− Candy Woodall\n\nClark nominates Jeffries for speaker\n\nHouse Minority Whip Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., nominated Jeffries for the speakership on behalf of House Democrats. He's earned the most votes this week, but not enough to clinch the win.\n\nClark took aim at Jordan's legislative record, saying the Ohio Republican supports cutting Social Security and Medicare and noting the Ohio Republican has never voted for a farm bill.\n\nJordan, she added, is a \"true threat to our democracy and our Constitution,\" for his vote against certifying Biden's victory in the 2020 election.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nMcCarthy: Jim Jordan is a leader, a listener and a fighter\n\nIn another historic moment in the House, ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy nominated Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, as the representative to succeed him.\n\n\"Being the speaker is not an easy job, but especially in this conference,\" McCarthy said to a few laughs and light applause.\n\nBut Jordan is the representative for the job, he said.\n\n\"Jim Jordan is a leader, a listener and a fighter,\" McCarthy said.\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nMcCarthy defends how many bills Jordan has passed\n\nMcCarthy sought to defend the Jordan from Democratic arguments that the Ohio Republican has never passed one of his own bills with his name attached to it.\n\nThe former speaker called Jordan an \"effective legislator\" and \"selfless,\" drawing laughter and jeers from Democrats.\n\nMcCarthy also took aim at House Democrats, singling out Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., for passing only one bill with his name on it, garnering applause from Republicans.\n\nBut in a display of Jordan's uphill battle towards becoming speaker, several GOP lawmakers, including Jordan's holdouts, remained seated even as the majority of the conference gave a standing ovation for McCarthy.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nJeffries: 'Jim Jordan is a clear and present danger to our democracy'\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries unloaded on the \"national nightmare\" he says his colleagues across the aisle have created in 17 days without a House speaker.\n\nThe GOP nominee who has lost the vote twice, Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, is a threat to the nation, according to Jeffries.\n\n\"Jim Jordan is a clear and present danger to our democracy,\" Jeffries said to reporters Friday morning at the Capitol.\n\nThe Democratic leader then rattled off his list of reasons, saying Jordan is a 2020 election denier and \"the poster child for MAGA extremism,\" who wants an abortion ban and to cut Social Security and Medicare.\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nJordan declines to say whether 2020 election was stolen\n\nJordan, when asked whether he thought the 2020 election was stolen, gave a non-committal answer and said he thought “there were all kinds of problems with the 2020 election.”\n\nOne of Jordan’s holdouts, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., is refusing to support the Ohio Republican for speaker until he acknowledges former President Donald Trump lost in 2020.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nDemocratic leaders consider empowering a temporary speaker\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he hasn't met with acting speaker Patrick McHenry, but he and other Democratic leaders are open to the idea of empowering him to do the House's business.\n\n\"All options are on the table to get the House back open,\" Jeffries said, responding to a question about whether his caucus would support a plan to empower a speaker pro tempore.\n\nMcHenry has limited powers as interim speaker. It would take a majority of the House and some Democratic votes to give him expanded powers to do things like passing an aid package to Israel or negotiating to avoid a shutdown.\n\nDemocratic Whip Katherine Clark said bipartisanship is the only path forward.\n\n\"Come together,\" she said to Republicans. \"You are weakening this country, you are weakening this institution.\"\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nJim Jordan press conference today: He's not dropping out\n\nFrom his bully pulpit as chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, which has spent most of its time this session trying to impeach Biden, Jordan held a press conference at 8 a.m. to try and attract more support for his speaker bid.\n\nJordan said he was not backing down in his pursuit of the speakership, even as his opposition threatens to grow.\n\n\"We can't open the House without a speaker.\"\n\n−Candy Woodall and Ken Tran\n\nCrenshaw says ‘votes aren’t changing’ for Jordan\n\nLeaving a meeting held by the Texas GOP delegation, Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, told reporters the “vote’s aren’t changing” for Jordan ahead of a third speaker election that Jordan is expected to lose.\n\nWhether Jordan should drop out, Crenshaw said, is ultimately the Ohio Republican’s decision, but there’s a “growing sense” that House Republicans will have to find a new candidate to rally behind “quite soon.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nGOP lawmaker is slightly more optimistic about electing a new speaker… slightly\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., told reporters last week he put the odds of the House electing a new speaker by last Friday at 2%.\n\nThis time around, with Jordan as the speaker nominee, he’s feeling a little more optimistic about electing a new speaker by the end of the day: he’s putting the odds at 30%.\n\n“It still isn’t 50%,” Massie quipped.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWill House stay in session this weekend to elect a speaker?\n\nJordan and his allies have hinted on social media and during a press conference Friday that the House will not take the weekend off if there's no speaker.\n\nThe House Judiciary chair said during his news conference today he hopes the lower chamber will elect a new speaker \"this weekend,\" suggesting there could be more elections to come.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhat happened to the speaker of the House?\n\nThe House has been without a speaker since Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was removed from the position more than two weeks ago.\n\nIn a move led by conservative firebrand Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., eight Republicans were joined by House Democrats in a vote to oust him. Gaetz and a handful of hardliners were angry with McCarthy for striking a bipartisan compromise to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nMcCarthy's nine-month speakership started in turmoil, outlasting 15 historic rounds of voting to be elected in January. To get the gavel, he made several concessions, including a rule allowing any one member to call for the vote to remove McCarthy.\n\nGaetz used that rule to remove McCarthy from the top position in the House with no viable plan to replace him.\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nHouse without a speaker: Will Jordan lose again?\n\nWithout a speaker, the House has been in a state of paralysis, unable to pass any legislation. Lawmakers in the lower chamber can't take up crucial funding to avoid a government shutdown or approve aid to Israel as the war with Hamas continues.\n\nRepublicans appeared close to finally getting the House moving again Wednesday morning, as they considered temporarily empowering Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., as an interim speaker. But those plans fell through amidst wide-ranging disagreements within the GOP conference.\n\nJordan is expected to lose his third speaker election, and it is unclear whether he will drop out of the race.\n\n−Ken Tran\n\nBiden’s foreign aid package can’t pass House without a speaker\n\nBiden’s request for foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the U.S.-Mexico border, which totals almost $100 billion, is unable to pass the House without a speaker.\n\nThe House, which is in its 17th day without a speaker, has been unable to take any legislative action. There is a sense of urgency to elect a new speaker among lawmakers so the House can pass a foreign aid package for Israel, a key U.S. ally, but House Republicans have been unable to coalesce behind a speaker despite the calls for decisive action.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhat was the plan to empower McHenry?\n\nHouse Republicans huddled behind closed doors for over three hours to discuss a resolution from Rep. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio, that would have temporarily empowered McHenry as an interim speaker to get the House moving again.\n\nThe move would have allowed Jordan to continue building support for his speakership bid on the sidelines while the House works on crucial legislation to avert a government shutdown and address the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nBut the plans ultimately fell through as it became apparent a sizable number of members opposed the path. Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., who was critical of the resolution, estimated half of House Republicans were against empowering McHenry.\n\n– Ken Tran", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/02/19/rashida-tlaib-michigan-dems-vote-uncommitted-biden/72658662007/", "title": "Rep. Rashida Tlaib urges Michigan Democrats to vote 'uncommitted ...", "text": "WASHINGTON ― Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., is urging Michigan Democrats to vote \"uncommitted\" in the state's upcoming Democratic primary in a display of opposition against President Joe Biden over his support for Israel's war in the Gaza Strip.\n\n\"This is the way you can raise our voices,\" Tlaib, the only Palestinian-American in Congress, said in a video posted Saturday, standing outside an early voting site in Dearborn, Mich. \"Right now, we feel completely neglected and just unseen by our government. If you want us to be louder, then come here and vote uncommitted.”\n\nMichigan's Democratic Primary is Feb. 27.\n\nTlaib, a member of \"The Squad\" whose district includes parts of Detroit and surrounding communities, is joining forces with Arab American activists who are also urging Michigan Democrats to vote \"uncommitted\" to send a message.\n\nDearborn, Mich., outside of Detroit, boasts a thriving Arab-American community that has grown to make up a majority of the city's population. Many residents there say they feel abandoned by Biden because of his backing of Israel's war against Hamas, which has killed more than 28,000 Palestinian civilians. Tlaib has demanded the Biden administration support a cease-fire in Gaza.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nMore:Arab Americans feel 'a bone-deep sense of betrayal.' And they want Joe Biden defeated in 2024\n\nBy voting \"uncommitted,\" Tlaib said the goal is to \"create a voting bloc, something that is a bullhorn to say enough is enough. We don't want a country that supports wars and bombs and destruction. We want to support life.\"\n\nLast year, the House of Representatives censured Tlaib for comments she made about the Israel-Hamas war, including “from the river to the sea,” a pro-Palestinian slogan that Israel’s supporters say is anti-Semitic and a call to destroy the state of Israel.\n\nBiden, lacking a formidable Democratic challenger, is expected to easily win Michigan's primary even with a strong protest vote. But a solid showing for \"uncommitted\" in the primary could signal trouble for Biden in the November general election in Michigan, a critical battleground state.\n\nBiden, who carried Michigan by 154,188 votes in 2020, risks losing some Arab American voters to liberal third-party candidates, while others could sit the election out altogether, if their discontent remains.\n\nMichigan’s “Abandon Biden” movement, part of a larger national campaign, is hosting meetings with third-party candidates such as Jill Stein and Cornel West. A separate initiative called “Listen to Michigan,\" which Tlaib has put her support behind, is calling on Michigan Democrats to vote “uncommitted” in the primary.\n\nThe backlash for Biden is so serious that the White House last week dispatched a large group of senior officials to meet with Arab-American leaders in Michigan. Participants in those meetings said the Biden officials conceded there had been “mistakes and missteps” in the response to the war in Gaza and apologized for how the administration has talked publicly about Palestinians during the deadly conflict.\n\nContributing: Michael Collins", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/20/politics/mclellan-morrissey-virginia-4th-district-congress/index.html", "title": "Virginia state Sen. Jennifer McClellan could make history in special ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nVirginia Democrats will choose a nominee on Tuesday for the special election to fill the term of the late Rep. Donald McEachin, who died in November just weeks after winning reelection.\n\nDemocrats in the 4th Congressional District are holding a “firehouse primary” – or one that’s conducted by the party organization, instead of by election officials – across a handful of pop-up voting locations in the Richmond-area district.\n\nThe nominee will enter the February general election as the favorite in what has been a reliably Democratic district, and the outcome of the election isn’t likely to affect the balance of power in the US House, which Republicans are set to control in January.\n\nVirginia state Sen. Jennifer McClellan, who finished third in the 2021 gubernatorial primary, has the support of Democratic Party leaders and groups ranging from the political arm of the Congressional Progressive Caucus to the moderate-backing Democratic Majority for Israel PAC. If elected, she would be the first Black woman to represent Virginia in Congress.\n\nVirginia Sen. Tim Kaine campaigned with McClellan, a close ally whose wedding he officiated, over the weekend and members of the Commonwealth’s Democratic congressional delegation have all endorsed her, as have Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney and other local officials. Democrats will not know their nominee until Wednesday, at the earliest, when the counting of ballots begins.\n\nThe coalescing around McClellan was influenced in part by the campaign of scandal-plagued state Sen. Joe Morrissey. His feuds with the party establishment may be part of his appeal among some disenchanted partisans, but his critics point to a more damaging history, including his resignation from the state House in 2014 after a misdemeanor conviction for contributing to the delinquency of a minor – a 17-year-old part-time staffer at his law office with whom he had sex and exchanged nude photos. He was in his mid-50s at the time, but has argued, according to a local report, that he believed the woman was 18. (Morrissey has since married the woman and they have several children.) Morrissey has also been stripped of his law license – twice – and remains disbarred following a 2019 state Supreme Court decision to uphold its revocation.\n\nMorrissey attacked the state party for holding the primary on a Tuesday instead of a Saturday, saying it would limit voter turnout. In announcing his run, Morrissey called himself a “worker bee” while highlighting his work on criminal justice reform.\n\nVirginia doesn’t have party registration, so the primary will be open to all voters in the district, provided they sign a pledge to support the Democratic nominee in the general election. Republicans chose their candidate, Leon Benjamin, in a weekend vote.\n\nBenjamin has run for the seat before, having lost to McEachin earlier this year and in 2020.\n\nUnder Virginia state law, there’s no state-run primary for this special election, so the parties are responsible for selecting their own nominees.\n\nThe district’s Democratic committee chairwoman cheered the “firehouse” voting method as a way to increase participation in the process.\n\n“A Firehouse Primary allows as many candidates and voters to participate in the democratic process as possible,” Alexsis Rodgers said. “The Fourth Congressional District Democratic Committee is committed to holding a smooth, transparent, and expedient process to select a nominee.”\n\nRepublican Gov. Glenn Youngkin last Monday set the date of the special election for February 21, creating a quick turnaround as the parties need to formally select their candidates by December 23.\n\nWith just a week to campaign, a host of Democrats jumped into the race. McClellan and Morrissey are the leading contenders, largely because state Del. Lamont Bagby decided to drop out to help clear the way for McClellan, a fellow leader of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus. Bagby’s support largely shifted to McClellan.\n\nMcClellan, who has served in the state legislature since 2006 and succeeded McEachin in the state Senate, spoke about her legislative experience and her work in the capitol with the late congressman in her announcement speech last week.\n\n“This is a bittersweet day for me as I continue to mourn a friend but hear the call to carry on his legacy and carry my servant leadership to Washington,” McClellan said.\n\nVirginia Democrats lost the governorship and the House of Delegates in 2021 and control only a very narrow majority in the state Senate. If McClellan were to win the congressional special election in February, her vacant Senate seat could weaken Democrats’ ability to block Republican bills – like potential restrictions on abortion.", "authors": ["Gregory Krieg Ethan Cohen Melissa Holzberg Depalo", "Gregory Krieg", "Ethan Cohen", "Melissa Holzberg Depalo"], "publish_date": "2022/12/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/10/17/speaker-of-the-house-vote-live-updates/71209976007/", "title": "Jim Jordan loses first speaker of the House vote: What you missed", "text": "WASHINGTON — House Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, lost the first round of voting to choose a new speaker of the House, leaving the lower chamber in disarray.\n\nHouse Republicans nominated Jordan to the speakership last week.

The first vote, which will put members on the record, will provide critical information for Jordan and his allies as they seek to convince holdouts resistant to a Jordan speakership.\n\nLike with the last speaker votes, this will be a roll call vote, which will take a while. Every member, all 432 of the lawmakers in the chamber, must be called one by one to declare their vote.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWho is Jeffries?\n\nHouse Democrats in January nominated Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., in all 15 rounds of votes that eventually gave former Speaker Kevin McCarthy the position.\n\nDemocratic representatives have again coalesced behind Jeffries, as Chair of the House Democratic caucus Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., nominated the party leader for speaker, his speech interrupted by rounds of applause and chants of \"Hakeem.\"\n\n\"We are here because the House has been thrown into chaos,\" Aguilar, D-Calif., said, arguing that Jeffries offered a \"bipartisan\" option.\n\nAguilar called on lawmakers to \"abandon the extremism that is preventing us from getting things done\" and alleged that naming Jordan as speaker would send a \"terrible message to the country and our allies.\"\n\n\"Only Hakeem Jeffries can be trusted to keep his word,\" Aguilar said.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nElise Stefanik nominates Jim Jordan\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., nominated Jim Jordan to be the House speaker during the first round of votes on the floor Tuesday afternoon.\n\nStefanik, the Republican Conference Chair, called him a patriot and an America-first warrior who goes after corruption.\n\n“Whether as Judiciary chair, conservative leader or representative for his constituents in west central Ohio, whether on the wrestling mat or in the committee room, Jim Jordan is strategic, scrappy, tough and principled,” she said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nJim Jordan’s path to speakership could lie an attendance\n\nAttendance could change Jim Jordan’s path to the speakership. There are currently 433 members in the House and if all members vote, Jordan would need 217 votes to be elected speaker.\n\nBut Jordan only needs a majority of voting lawmakers, meaning that if some lawmakers are absent or only vote \"present\" that could change the math.\n\nRight now, all members of the House are currently present besides Rep. Gus Bilirakis, R-Fla., meaning 432 lawmakers will vote. Assuming no lawmakers vote \"present,\" 217 is still the magic number for Jordan to obtain the speakership.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWill Jim Jordan convince Republican holdouts?\n\nJim Jordan entered the House chamber and huddled into a corner of the floor with Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho. Simpson is one of the handful of House Republicans who have either said they will not support Jordan or who have expressed hesitancy over voting for the Ohio Republican.\n\nJordan’s efforts to work the House floor to convince holdouts reflects the uphill battle he is facing to become speaker, as lawmakers prepare for what could be a long day of multiple ballots, reminiscent of McCarthy’s pursuit of the speakership back in January.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHouse is in session for speaker vote\n\nActing speaker Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., has gaveled the House into session ahead of the speaker election, which is expected to take place after nominating speeches and a roll call vote to determine attendance.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nDon't expect Joe Biden and Jim Jordan to have a cozy relationship\n\nIf Jim Jordan is elected speaker of the House, he and President Joe Biden aren't expected to work closely together.\n\nAs chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Jordan is spearheading House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into Biden. He also voted against certifying Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.\n\nBiden hasn't gone out of his way to address the Republican infighting in the House.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said earlier this month that the White House views the process of choosing the speaker as an internal issue, but she said the president \"hopes that the House will quickly elect a speaker, because the urgent challenges facing our nation will not wait.\"\n\n– Ken Tran, Marina Pitofsky\n\nWho are the Republican holdouts voting for?\n\nSome of the Republican lawmakers leaning against voting for Jim Jordan have said they're planning to cast their ballot for former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif, who was ousted from the leadership role earlier this month.\n\nMcCarthy has said he believe Jordan will be the next speaker of the House.\n\nOthers have said they're planning to support Steve Scalise, who withdrew from the speaker's race last week. But what lawmakers say or promise before a House vote isn't binding − they could flip their vote for or against Jordan during the formal proceedings this afternoon.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nIs Steve Scalise running?\n\nNo, the House fell into further chaos last week after House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., withdrew from the speaker's race despite being formally nominated by the House Republican conference.\n\n“It’s been quite a journey and there’s still a long way to go. I just shared with my colleagues that I’m withdrawing my name,” Scalise told reporters exiting a closed-door conference meeting.\n\n“There are still some people that have their own agendas and I was very clear, we have to put our own agendas on the side and focus on what this country needs,” Scalise added.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHow many votes do you need to be speaker of the House?\n\nIt takes a majority of the votes from House lawmakers present and voting for a specific candidate.\n\nOnce the vote for speaker begins, members will be called on one by one to name their choices. The House, which has 433 members and two vacancies at this time, will vote until someone wins, though they could pause and come back another day.\n\nIt’s not clear how many rounds of voting Jordan may need to become speaker, but his allies have predicted that the public vote will pressure the holdouts to support Jordan.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nHere's how to watch the speaker vote\n\nLawmakers aren't expected to begin proceedings until noon in Washington, but you can follow along here.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat’s going on in the Senate?\n\nThe Senate is not waiting for the House to elect a speaker to move on an aid package for Israel, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., reiterated on the Senate floor Tuesday morning.\n\nSchumer, returning to D.C. this week after leading a bipartisan delegation to Tel Aviv over the weekend, said Tuesday the Senate will work quickly to pass an aid package for Israel as soon as possible that includes military support, humanitarians aid, intelligence support and diplomatic help.\n\n“With the House in disarray, the Senate will not wait to vote on an Israeli aid package,” Schumer said. “We can’t wait for the House. Who knows what’s going to be happening there?”\n\nSchumer said he hopes if the Senate can pass an aid package quickly with strong bipartisan support, it will inspire the House to follow suit.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nDemocrats to back Hakeem Jeffries\n\nNo, Democratic House lawmakers aren't going to consider throwing their support behind Jim Jim Jordan, or any other Republican.\n\nDemocrats will likely cast their votes for House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., though they can technically vote for any candidate they want, even if they're not a member of the House. It's a repeat of January, when Democrats held together and supported Jeffries through 15 rounds of voting.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhy do we need a speaker of the House?\n\nIt's simple: the House is frozen without a leader.\n\nLawmakers in the lower chamber can't take up critical legislation without a speaker. That includes spending measures to keep the government open and avoid a shutdown, funding for aid to Israel as their war with Hamas rages on and more.\n\nWhile there is currently a speaker pro tempore, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., his authority is limited compared to a formal speaker.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nDemocrats strategize messaging ahead of a potential Jim Jordan speakership\n\nThe Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent a memo to House Democrats Tuesday outlining a messaging strategy under a potential Speaker Jordan to use against Republicans ahead of next year’s elections.\n\nThe committee urged Democrats to show voters that the Republican Party lacks moderates and is unable to stand up to the ultra-conservatives within the caucus, alleging that a speakership under Jordan would mean extremism governs the House.\n\nRepublicans who vote for Jordan as speaker are “simply following Trump’s marching orders,” according to the memo, and are “incapable of governing themselves.”\n\nThe memos lists several examples of what the committee cites as Jordan’s extremism, including his choice to vote against certifying Biden’s victory in the 2020 election, his role as a founding member of the House Freedom Caucus and his voting record on issues like Medicare, 9/11 aid and disaster relief.\n\n“The DCCC is committed to ensuring that every battleground member of the Republican conference who stands and votes for a Speaker Jordan will be making a career ending move,” the memo states.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nJim Jordan, facing stiff opposition, could see multiple rounds of voting\n\nDespite Jordan’s momentum, the Ohio Republican is still facing stiff opposition from GOP lawmakers skeptical of a Jordan speakership resulting in uncertainty as to whether Jordan can secure the speakership off of the first ballot.\n\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a member of the ultraconservative Freedom Caucus and a Jordan supporter, estimated there would be eight to 10 votes against Jordan in the first ballot in an interview Tuesday morning on “The Glenn Beck Program.”\n\nRoy said he expects multiple rounds of voting akin to what the House saw in January, as McCarthy and his allies worked to convince holdouts to ultimately support the California Republican.\n\nAmong those possible defections is Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., a moderate House Republican who represents a district President Joe Biden won in 2020. Bacon has expressed apprehension about supporting Jordan given the support he has from conservative hardliners.\n\n“I’m not budging. I’m a five-time commander and deployed to Middle-East four times. I’ll do what is best for country,” Bacon said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat time is the speaker vote today?\n\nThe House is scheduled to vote on the election of a speaker at 12 p.m. ET.\n\n−Rachel Looker\n\nDonald Trump stumps again for Jim Jordan\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has already weighed in on the Speaker vote, taking to social media to again push Jordan’s candidacy.\n\n“Jim Jordan will be a GREAT Speaker of the House,” Trump posted Tuesday morning on Truth Social. “As everyone knows, I have long ago given him my Complete and Total Endorsement!”\n\nExpect Trump to take credit if Jordan prevails.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nWho is the new speaker of the House?\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, the nation doesn't have a new speaker of the House.\n\nEarlier this month, a sliver of House Republicans, led by conservative hardliner Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., voted to remove former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy from his post over what they alleged were broken promises.\n\nIn his pursuit of the gavel, McCarthy changed House rules to allow just one lawmaker to initiate the move to remove him, a key concession to hard-right Republicans.\n\nIn September, when a government shutdown loomed over the country and House Republicans failed to find any consensus on a short-term bill to avert a shutdown, Gaetz committed to filing a motion to vacate if McCarthy worked with Democrats to avoid a shutdown.\n\nAs a shutdown looked all but certain, McCarthy ultimately put forth a bipartisan stopgap bill on the House floor to fund the government just hours before a shutdown would have started. Days after the shutdown was averted, Gaetz filed a motion to vacate, and his efforts to oust McCarthy succeeded, putting the House in the frozen state seen today.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWho is speaker of the House?\n\nThere is no speaker of the House, but there is a speaker pro tempore.\n\nMcCarthy had provided a succession list to the House Clerk earlier this year in case his seat became vacant. Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., was chosen to be acting House speaker from that list.\n\nAccording to House rules, the person chosen from the list “shall act as Speaker pro tempore until the election of a Speaker or a Speaker pro tempore.” McHenry is the interim, or temporary, speaker.\n\nBut Charles Stewart III, a professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, previously told USA TODAY that without a speaker, there is no one with the political authority to speak on behalf of the majority and to engage in difficult negotiations on difficult issues.\n\n−Sudiksha Kochi\n\nWho is Jim Jordan? Why did he vote against certifying the 2020 election?\n\nJordan entered the House in 2007 as a conservative bomb-thrower who was a thorn in the sides of GOP leadership. The Ohio Republican is a founding member of the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus, a key faction of House Republicans that haunted McCarthy and forced him to placate to the right flank of his conference throughout his speakership.\n\nAs chair of the House Judiciary Committee, Jordan is also one of few GOP lawmakers spearheading House Republicans’ impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.\n\nJordan is a staunch ally of former President Donald Trump and voted against certifying Biden’s victory in the 2020 election.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhat happened to Kevin McCarthy?\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was removed from the position of House Speaker at the start of the month, when eight Republicans joined House Democrats to vote to oust him.\n\nMcCarthy's nine-month speakership had been rocky from the start, taking 15 rounds of votes and almost a full week to be elected back in January. The California Republican managed to secure the gavel only after making several concessions to a holdout faction in his party, including a rule allowing any one member to call for the vote to remove McCarthy.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., took advantage of that rule immediately after House Democrats helped McCarthy pass a last minute resolution to stave off a government shutdown at the end of September.\n\n− Savannah Kuchar", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/11/12/rep-ilhan-omar-primary-challenge-don-samuels/71559199007/", "title": "Rep. Omar gets challenge from Democrat who criticizes her Israel ...", "text": "Steve Karnowski\n\nAssociated Press\n\nU.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar got a prominent Democratic primary challenger Sunday when former Minneapolis City Council member Don Samuels announced he’ll try once again to unseat her after coming close in 2022.\n\nOmar, a charter member of “the squad” of progressive House Democrats, won reelection twice despite making comments in her first term that were widely criticized for invoking antisemitic tropes and suggesting Jewish Americans have divided loyalties. But Omar — a Somali American and Muslim — has come under renewed fire for condemning the Israeli government’s handling of its war against Hamas.\n\n“Our congresswoman has a predilection to divisiveness and conflict,” Samuels said in an interview with The Associated Press ahead of his official announcement Sunday morning on WCCO Radio.\n\nThe Jamaican-born Samuels still maintains that his narrow primary loss in 2022 showed Omar was beatable, and that he could have won if they had competed later in the general election, where Omar won 74% of the vote over a little-known Republican.\n\nThe big issue in 2022 was the future of policing in the city where George Floyd was murdered in 2020 by a former Minneapolis police officer, which touched off protests around the world and riots in Minnesota. Omar was among the progressives who slammed former President Barack Obama for criticizing the “defund the police” movement as just a “snappy slogan.”\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n“It’s not a slogan but a policy demand,” she posted on Twitter, now known as X.\n\nIn contrast, the centrist Samuels helped lead the opposition that defeated a proposal on the city ballot in 2021 that arose from the “defund” movement and would have replaced the police force with a revamped public safety agency. Samuels thinks safety will be a top issue again.\n\n“The long tails of the George Floyd and COVID issues continue, with empty storefronts and empty strip malls because people don’t want to invest anymore. They don’t think it’s safe,” Samuels said.\n\nJeremy Slevin, a spokesman for Omar, did not immediately return a phone message left Sunday seeking comment on Samuels’ announcement.\n\nThe war in the Middle East has already divided Democrats and upended the dynamics of some House primaries. Omar has been critical of Hamas for attacking Israel and taking hostages — but even more so of Israel’s military response. Her focus has been the plight of civilians in the Gaza Strip. She has also condemned the surge of intimidation and violence against both Muslim and Jewish targets in the U.S.\n\nIt remains to be seen how potent an issue the war will be in an overwhelmingly Democratic district that includes Minneapolis and some suburbs. The district also has a large Somali Muslim population. And it includes St. Louis Park, which historically has been a center of Jewish life in Minnesota.\n\nSamuels said he believes the war will be a big concern. He criticized Omar for voting against placing sanctions on Russia over its invasion of Ukraine but supporting sanctions against Israel, and for boycotting Israeli President Isaac Herzog’s speech to Congress in July.\n\n“She has frightened the Jewish community,” Samuels said, adding that the community “understands that there is a latent and lurking antisemitic sentiment that always needs discouragement, and always in times of national crisis raises its ugly head.”\n\nThe American Israel Public Affairs Committee has been actively trying to recruit a credible challenger to Omar. That drew pushback from a strong supporter of Israel, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, who issued a public show of support for Omar this summer. A super PAC affiliated with AIPAC spent about $350,000 against Omar in 2022. But Samuels said AIPAC didn’t try to recruit him.\n\nOmar’s fellow House Democrats have portrayed her as a serious legislator who in the past four years has earned admiration for giving voice to marginalized groups often forgotten on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut Samuels said people sometimes “mistake her oppositional nature and divisive nature for someone who’s speaking truth to power when in fact she is misusing her power, or not using her power, to make change.”\n\nThe other declared candidates are relatively unknown. One Democrat is Sarah Gad, a Minneapolis attorney and daughter of Egyptian immigrants who is Muslim. The other is military veteran Tim Peterson. The only Republican currently running is Dalia Al-Aqidi, an Iraqi American journalist and self-described secular Muslim who calls Omar pro-Hamas and a terrorist sympathizer.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/rockland/2023/10/18/why-republican-mike-lawler-hudson-valley-congressman-isnt-voting-for-jim-jordan-as-speaker/71227211007/", "title": "Mike Lawler has voted against Jim Jordan for Speaker multiple ...", "text": "Rep.

Mike Lawler has been outspoken in his support of McCarthy and his frustration with the vote to oust him. He called Gaetz's arguments \"a diatribe of delusional thinking\" and vowed several times to vote for McCarthy during any future speaker vote, no matter who the candidate was.\n\n“I believe very strongly that Kevin McCarthy is the right person to lead the house, and so I think is imperative, frankly, that this nonsense stop, that Kevin McCarthy get reinstated as speaker and that we get about the business of the American people,” Lawler said on CNN Oct. 8.\n\nWhere Lawler stands on Israel and how not having a Speaker impacts it\n\nLawler said Congress needs solid leadership now more than ever so the federal government can send aid and support to Israel in the midst of the war with Hamas.\n\n\"We're paralyzed,\" Lawler told CBS News on an Oct. 12 episode of \"The Takeout.\" \"A constitutional crisis. What is happening in Israel, obviously, Congress is going to need to act. Which we cannot do without a speaker. We need to elect a speaker and right now, nobody has a path to 217 (votes).\"\n\nLawler's Congressional district has one of the highest populations of Jewish people in the U.S. and outside of Israel. He has spoken about the need for the United States to get Israeli hostages out of Gaza and to support the Israeli government and people.\n\nBipartisan cooperation\n\nLawler voted for a bipartisan measure to avert a government shutdown on Oct. 1 and has spoken about the need for compromise in a divided Congress. Lawler made waves when he spoke openly about working with Democrats to avoid the government shutdown.\n\nLawler represents a Democratic-leaning swing district and is maintaining a moderate profile as he prepares for what will likely be a fierce re-election fight in 2024. He beat five-term Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, head of the House Democrats' campaign arm, to win the seat last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Jordan has notably blocked bipartisan cooperation in Congress. He is a staunch supporter of former president Donald Trump, who has rallied many ultra-conservative members of the House and Senate behind him as deep political divisions and extreme views took center stage in the GOP.\n\nJordan created an investigation earlier this year as chairman of the House Judiciary Committee into Hunter Biden's financial history as retaliation against Democrats for opening a bipartisan investigation into former president Trump's involvement in the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nProtecting American democracy\n\nJordan helped found the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nDuring the Jan 6. investigation, Jordan was one of the loudest voices against the committee. He was named as one of the primary players who tried to help Trump overturn the results of the 2020 election. The committee said Jordan did not cooperate with subpoenas from the investigation and refused to testify.\n\nLast year, Lawler distanced himself from Trump's call to revise some parts of the U.S. Constitution and reinstate him as president.\n\n“I certainly don’t endorse that language or that sentiment,\" Lawler said on CNN in December. He said that Americans “are tired of looking backwards” to the 2020 presidential election.\n\nPresident Trump endorsed Jordan for the speakership on Truth Social days after McCarthy was ousted.\n\nOn Monday, Lawler told CNN that he was not \"totally opposed\" to a Jim Jordan speakership, but he maintains that McCarthy is the best person for the job.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/22/why-is-new-hampshire-the-first-in-the-nation-primary-state-heres-a-closer-look/72253128007/", "title": "Why is New Hampshire the first in the nation primary state?

Dean Phillips hustle for votes here, thanks to a collision between the national Democratic Party and New Hampshire law.\n\nThe person to thank for that is Jim Splaine, a sunny, 76-year-old former Democratic member of the New Hampshire House of Representatives who first proposed a bill to mandate the state's first-in-the-nation status back in 1975.\n\nSplaine's law has run smack into the a new electoral calendar set by that Democratic National Committee that's handed pole position to South Carolina's Feb. 3 primary, followed by New Hampshire and Nevada on Feb. 6.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nMore:How Nikki Haley could win the New Hampshire primary despite Trump's lead\n\nNew Hampshire, citing both Splaine's legislation and its traditional pride of place as home to the nation's first primary, ignored the Feb. 6 date, and will hold its primary on Tuesday − an entire state thumbing its nose at national Democrats.\n\nThe DNC has threatened to sanction local Democrats participating in tomorrow's primary, raising the possibility that the New Hampshire delegation at the party’s nominating convention could be cut in half.\n\nEarlier this month, state Attorney General John Formella said the national party's efforts to discount Tuesday's vote were \"false, deceptive and misleading.\"\n\nState pride over all\n\nBeing first means a lot to the Granite State.\n\nNew Hampshire held its first presidential primary in May 1916 − a week after the Indiana primary − but legislators soon amended state law to hold the primary on the second Tuesday in March when all the towns in the state would convene, making the state the first in the nation to vote in its primaries.\n\nMore:Blowout? 4 new polls give Trump huge leads in New Hampshire: Live updates\n\n\"Since we are a small state, it is less expensive for candidates to be able to run here and more likely that they are able to meet people,\" Splaine told USA TODAY. \"We talk with people face to face, one on one, and that's a fact that it simply does not occur in a place like New York State, or California or Michigan or some of the southern states, like Florida.\"\n\n\"I think that's something that we don't want to lose,\" he added.\n\nTensions among Democrats and Republicans led to the 1975 bill\n\nSplaine's law requiring New Hampshire to hold the nation's first primary was born of tensions and political exhaustion following a divisive 1972 Democratic primary riven by the Vietnam War and the Republican party's pummeling after the Watergate scandal and President Richard Nixon's resignation.\n\n“I mean, people would not talk with one another after the primaries,” Splaine said. “So a huge number of Democrats weren’t so enthused about having the primary anymore and spending time on national politics and Watergate in the early 1970s just drained the Republicans in New Hampshire and they didn't want to participate in the primary process anymore.”\n\nMore:Will bad weather keep New Hampshire voters home on Tuesday? Don't count on it\n\nAs the 1976 campaign approached, the national Democratic and Republican parties began talking about a regional New England primary that would have spelled the end for New Hampshire's special status, and, Splaine said, the state's person-to-person retail politics.\n\nDuring bigger primaries, candidates “don't meet a lot of people in small groups, but they fly into the area and have some debates,\" Splaine said. \"Not only are the candidates' times spread out, but any available funding that they have will be spread out.”\n\nSplaine, then 28, moved to nip the New England primary in the bud, sponsoring a bill that required the New Hampshire primary to take place seven days or more ahead of any other. He worked on the bill with Republican Gov. Meldrim Thomson Jr., whom he was close with. Back then \"Democrats could talk with Republicans and Republicans could talk to Democrats,\" said Splaine. Now, he said, \"that doesn't work quite so much.\"\n\nMore:Nikki Haley gets boost from Judge Judy at New Hampshire rally: 'Sound of a two-person race'\n\nThe bill passed with a key amendment giving the secretary of state the power to set the primary date.\n\n\"That version, it really has worked very well because the Secretary of State can do this all by himself,\" Splaine said. \"He doesn't have to compromise. He doesn't have to meet with other states. He doesn't have to talk with the political parties. He does what he thinks is right.\"\n\nThe bill passed right before the 1976 presidential primary.\n\nBeing first \"certainly leaves a mark in the country,\" said Splaine.\n\nDNC tried to challenge New Hampshire status\n\nNew Hampshire’s first-in-the-nation status was challenged this election cycle.\n\nLast year, the Democratic National Committee approved a proposal, pushed by Biden, to make South Carolina the first primary, with New Hampshire and Nevada sharing the date of a second primary. Biden said in a letter outlining the decision that the changes were to empower voters of color and let candidates invest in key battleground states. The two states that have traditionally gone first with their nominating contests, Iowa and New Hampshire, are overwhelmingly white.\n\nBut, with Splaine's law requiring New Hampshire to hold the first primary, the Republican-controlled legislature ignored the DNC's February date, and Biden kept his name off the ballot. Local Democrats are pushing an unofficial effort to write in the president's name.\n\nMore:When is the New Hampshire primary? Here's when it falls, plus other key dates in 2024 cycle\n\nWhile 21 Democratic candidates are on the ballot Tuesday, Biden’s future candidacy is at “risk” if he doesn’t get 50% of the vote, Splaine said. “But even worse than that…he hasn't been participating in the process. Voters have been denied that opportunity to see him one-on-one, face-to-face.\"\n\nThe DNC sent a letter earlier this month urging the New Hampshire party to “educate the public” that Tuesday's primary was inconsequential. State Attorney General John Formella shot back with cease and desist order saying that falsely telling voters the primary is “meaningless” violates state law.\n\n\"Nothing has changed, and we look forward to seeing a great Democratic voter turnout on January 23rd,\" Formella wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Splaine said he plans on writing in his mom and dad.\n\n\"I love Joe Biden. I first met him in 1987 at the University of New Hampshire,\" he said. \"But other than that, he hasn't been here.

The Associated Press called the race for Tlaib just after midnight.\n\n\"Our neighbors made it clear: No one should be able to come into our communities and tell us how to think or vote. Our democracy is ours. Yesterday, we showed folks that $1 million in attack ads can’t even come close to stopping our growing movement,\" Tlaib said Wednesday. \"This girl from southwest Detroit isn't going anywhere. I’m just getting started.”\n\nOther candidates in the race for the Democratic nomination, which in this solidly Democratic district was almost certain to decide the winner in November's general election, included Lathrup Village Mayor Kelly Garrett and former state Rep.

Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., one of the first two Muslim women in the U.S. House. In doing so, she split a field of mostly Black candidates — including former Detroit City Council President Brenda Jones — to take the nomination for the full two-year term that followed in the majority Black district.\n\nIn 2020, she beat another challenge by Jones, who later retired from council. Over her two terms, Tlaib has proven herself to be a prodigious fundraiser, tireless campaigner and committed progressive. Still, some of her stances — she voted against a big infrastructure bill last year championed by her own party and has remained a vocal critic of Israel's treatment of Palestinians living in the occupied territories — have led to complaints in her own party, as did her delivering a response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address this year calling on him and other Democrats to do more.\n\nThat said, Tlaib went into this year's campaign and the challenge from Winfrey with a huge advantage in name recognition and money. While Winfrey attracted some support from pro-Israel groups, the funding some others saw from organizations like the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), which is highly critical of Tlaib, never appeared for her at the same level.\n\nEven though Tlaib lived in the newly created 13th Congressional District, she decided to move into the new 12th as it included much of the base she already had on Detroit's west side and in western Wayne County communities including Westland, Redford, Dearborn Heights and Inkster. And while the 12th added two big communities in Southfield and Livonia that were not part of her current district, it also added Dearborn — with one of the largest Arab-American populations in the country and where she is well known.\n\nSusan Hicks, a 57-year-old environmental engineer in Dearborn, enthusiastically voted for Tlaib, though she said she will also miss voting for U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, who moved to Ann Arbor and into another newly created district.\n\n“She (Tlaib) seems like she really tries hard for us,” Hicks said. “I love the fact that she's really (angered) the idiot that used to serve as president (former President Donald Trump). But I think she wants to try hard for people in Dearborn.”\n\nChristel Ciolino, 28, is a new Dearborn resident who also voted for Tlaib.\n\n“I'm progressive and I really do feel like she's the most progressive of all the candidates,” Ciolino said. “And I feel like, with the world we have, we need people who are boldly, really pushing progressive policies.\"\n\nIn the Republican primary in the predominantly Democratic district, Steven Elliott, a tattoo artist and laser specialist of Rochester Hills, defeated James Hooper of Livonia, who worked in the building trades and in overseas religious missions, and businessman Hassan Nehme of Dearborn Heights had.\n\nContact Todd Spangler attspangler@freepress.com.

Gen. Pat Ryder said at the time the top official was “recovering well,” some immediately noticed there was a four-day delay between Austin entering the hospital and the Defense Department confirming the news.\n\nAustin, who is sixth in the line of presidential succession, admitted in a statement on Saturday he “could have done a better job ensuring the public was appropriately informed. I commit to doing better.”\n\nBut why was Austin, 70, hospitalized? What complications does he face? Here’s what you need to know.\n\nWashington:Why Lloyd Austin's secrecy about his hospital stay undercuts a top Biden campaign message\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nWhen was Austin hospitalized?\n\nThe Pentagon late Friday announced that Austin had been in the hospital since Jan. 1 related to his elective medical procedure.\n\nBut the Defense Department didn't alert the White House until Thursday about Austin's condition, three days after he had been admitted to the hospital, according to a senior Defense official who was not authorized to comment publicly on the matter.\n\nHe remained in the hospital as of Monday morning.\n\n\"Secretary Austin is still in the hospital and recovering well,\" Ryder confirmed.\n\nWhy was Austin hospitalized?\n\nNeither Austin nor other Defense officials have explained what his medical procedure was. The Pentagon on Sunday did confirm that Austin had a medical procedure on Dec. 22 and went home one day later.\n\nHe was admitted to to intensive care Jan. 1, after he started feeling severe pain. But officials on Sunday argued that he was placed there \"due to his medical needs, but then remained in that location in part due to hospital space considerations and privacy.”\n\nWhy is Austin facing outrage?\n\nThe failure to disclose that Austin had been hospitalized for days was a breach of the norm in which health issues of senior government officials are released with alacrity.\n\nFor example, Austin in August 2022 announced that he had COVID-19 within hours of taking a test, detailing his symptoms in a statement and explaining his plan to \"retain all authorities.\" At the time, he also included his last in-person contact with the president.\n\nA group of Republican lawmakers quickly hit out at Austin and other defense officials over their handling of the situation. Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., in a statement on Saturday alleged that the Department of Defense \"deliberately withheld the Secretary of Defense’s medical condition for days. That is unacceptable.”\n\nBut GOP officials weren’t the only ones raising concerns.\n\n“Heads have to roll,” said Brett Bruen, a former diplomat and expert in crisis communications who worked in the White House under then-President Barack Obama. “This is not a minor miscommunication. It’s about the confidence that our national security structure has in its leadership and that the leadership is acting in a transparent way.”\n\nDid Austin pass on his authority during his hospitalization?\n\nYes, on Jan. 2, the day after Austin was admitted to the hospital, he transferred authorities that required “constant secure communications capabilities” to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks,\n\nHicks, who was on vacation in Puerto Rico, “keeps a complete suite of communications and capable staff with her at all times, regardless of geographic location,” Ryder said, and she took up Austin's duties from the U.S. territory.\n\nBut in a move that has prompted additional criticism, Hicks wasn’t aware that Austin had been hospitalized until Jan. 4, according a senior defense official who was not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2015/09/04/one-year-anniversary-joan-rivers-death-what-happened-doctors-clinic/71649424/", "title": "A year after Joan Rivers died, what happened to her doctors and the ...", "text": "Maria Puente\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nOn the first anniversary of the death of Joan Rivers following what was supposed to be an ordinary outpatient procedure, nothing much of consequence — except for bad publicity — has happened to the clinic where she was treated and to the doctors who were treating her.\n\nThere's a multi-million-dollar lawsuit pending from Rivers' daughter, Melissa Rivers. The damaging headlines, blaring daily a year ago, have diminished to a few stories here and there about such things as where Melissa spread her mother's ashes (in Wyoming).\n\nThe media and the public have moved on. Even Melissa Rivers has moved on, replacing her mother as host on Fashion Police.\n\nMeanwhile, it's been no easy task prying any intelligible information out of lawyers, government agencies and medical professionals for a status report about what happened to Rivers and why, and whether anyone did anything wrong that led her death.\n\nHere's what we know:\n\nThe autopsy report: Rivers died Sept. 4 in New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, one week after she stopped breathing during a routine procedure on a hoarse throat. She never regained consciousness. The city Medical Examiner's Office ruled that she died due to lack of oxygen to the brain during the throat surgery, or what it called a \"therapeutic complication.\" She was 81.\n\nThe clinic: Yorkville Endoscopy on Manhattan's Upper East Side, where Rivers was being treated when she suffered a medical crisis on Aug. 28, 2014, is still open, still taking patients and still thriving.\n\nA report on the clinic by health authorities was released in November and found a long list of errors by the clinic, including \"failing to identify deteriorating vital signs and provide timely intervention.\"\n\nBut it appears the only consequence was a brief blip in the clinic's Medicare certification.\n\nAfter the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, acting for the New York Department of Health, inspected the clinic and found errors and deficiencies, the clinic's certification was pulled in January, meaning it could no longer receive payments from Medicare and Medicaid for patients 65 or older. That could have been a big problem for the clinic's bottom line had it lasted.\n\nBut it didn't last. By March, the certification was reinstated because the clinic was back in compliance with Medicare regulations, according to Reina Becnel, a public-affairs official for the agency. She did not explain how or why, or how it was related to the Joan Rivers case.\n\nAlso, the clinic's state accreditation for \"office-based surgery\" has switched from the American Association for Accreditation of Ambulatory Surgery Facilities, to the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care. The distinction is apparently legal rather than medical and it's not clear whether it has to do with Joan Rivers.\n\nOn Thursday, Yorkville issued a statement through its new media manager, Jane Hardey, in response to questions about the one-year anniversary.\n\n\"The physicians of Yorkville Endoscopy continue to serve their patients. Yorkville is fully licensed by the New York State Department of Health, Medicare-approved, and accredited by the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care. The physicians directly responsible for Ms. Rivers' care are no longer affiliated with Yorkville in any way.\"\n\nHardy added, \"At no time did the (clinic) cease receiving payment from Medicare nor did any termination of Medicare participation ever become effective.\"\n\nThe clinic doctor: Dr. Lawrence Cohen resigned from Yorkville during the uproar following Rivers' death. Cohen conducted the endoscopy procedure on Rivers and, according to the negligence lawsuit by Melissa Rivers, also took cellphone pictures of Rivers while she was unconscious on the operating table.\n\n\"It wasn't a selfie in the sense that it was a picture of himself,\" says one of Melissa Rivers' lawyers, Jeffrey Bloom. \"It was a picture of Joan on the table, while she was crashing, by the way.\"\n\nCohen's lawyer, Jay Rappaport, says Cohen is still in New York and is still a practicing gastroenterologist — \"He never stopped practicing\" — although he wouldn't say where or otherwise comment. In response to the Melissa Rivers lawsuit, Cohen has denied he took a cellphone picture of Joan Rivers.\n\nThe personal doctor: Dr. Gwen Korovin, Rivers' personal doctor, is still practicing in New York.\n\nKorovin was not authorized to practice at Yorkville but she was there anyway and, according to the lawsuit, conducted an unauthorized laryngoscopy on Rivers. The lawsuit also asserts that Korovin left the operating room while other medical personnel were trying to revive her.\n\nBefore the Rivers tragedy, Korovin was beloved by celebrities and stars, known as \"Broadway's throat doc and keeper of high-profile pipes,\" as the New York Daily News put it in April 2013. And even after Rivers died, her celebrity patients, such as Joel Grey, were effusive about her.\n\n\"I only know her to be prudent and careful and loving, and there was no hour of the day I couldn't call her,\" said Grey, Korovin's patient for 20 years, in the New York Times. \"I never saw her do anything that was less than caring and considered.\"\n\nInitial reports after Rivers' death suggested it was Korovin who took the infamous cellphone photo. But she denied this during a July hearing for the Melissa Rivers lawsuit, and Rivers' lawyers, Bloom and Ben Rubinowitz, confirmed to USA TODAY they believe it was Cohen who took the picture.\n\nThe lawsuit: Like all lawsuits, it's plodding through the legal system, says Bloom, and is still in the discovery phase.\n\nThe lawsuit, which Bloom says \"seeks compensation for the loss of Joan\" targets Yorkville, its parent company, Frontier Healthcare, and Cohen and Korovin.\n\nMelissa made clear her intent at the time it was filed in late January.\n\n\"The level of medical mismanagement, incompetency, disrespect and outrageous behavior is shocking and frankly, almost incomprehensible, \" she said in a statement.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/business/jeff-bezos-charity/index.html", "title": "Exclusive: Jeff Bezos says he will give most of his money to charity ...", "text": "Washington CNN Business —\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos plans to give away the majority of his $124 billion net worth during his lifetime, telling CNN in an exclusive interview he will devote the bulk of his wealth to fighting climate change and supporting people who can unify humanity in the face of deep social and political divisions.\n\nThough Bezos’ vow was light on specifics, this marks the first time he has announced that he plans to give away most of his money. Critics have chided Bezos for not signing the Giving Pledge, a promise by hundreds of the world’s richest people to donate the majority of their wealth to charitable causes.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Exclusive: Jeff Bezos offers his advice on taking risks right now 01:50 - Source: CNN\n\nIn a sit-down interview with CNN’s Chloe Melas on Saturday at his Washington, DC, home, Bezos, speaking alongside his partner, the journalist-turned-philanthropist Lauren Sánchez, said the couple is “building the capacity to be able to give away this money.”\n\nAsked directly by CNN whether he intends to donate the majority of his wealth within his lifetime, Bezos said: “Yeah, I do.”\n\nBezos said he and Sánchez agreed to their first interview together since they began dating in 2019 to help shine a spotlight on the Bezos Courage and Civility Award, granted this year to musician Dolly Parton.\n\nThe 20-minute exchange with Bezos and Sánchez covered a broad range of topics, from Bezos’s views on political dialogue and a possible economic recession to Sánchez’s plan to visit outer space with an all-female crew and her reflections on a flourishing business partnership with Bezos.\n\nDolly Parton\n\nThat working relationship was on display Saturday as Bezos and Sánchez announced a $100 million grant to Parton as part of her Courage and Civility Award. It is the third such award, following similar grants to chef Jose Andrés, who has spent some of the money making meals for Ukrainians — and the climate advocate and CNN contributor Van Jones.\n\n“When you think of Dolly,” said Sánchez in the interview, “Look, everyone smiles, right? She is just beaming with light. And all she wants to do is bring light into other people’s worlds. And so we couldn’t have thought of someone better than to give this award to Dolly, and we know she’s going to do amazing things with it.”\n\nThe throughline connecting the Courage and Civility Award grantees, Bezos said, was their capacity to bring many people together to solve large challenges.\n\n“I just feel honored to be able to be a part of what they’re doing for this world,” Bezos told CNN.\n\nUnity, Bezos said, is a trait that will be necessary to confront climate change and one that he repeatedly invoked as he blasted politicians and social media for amplifying division.\n\nHow to give it away\n\nBut the couple’s biggest challenge may be figuring out how to distribute Bezos’ vast fortune. Bezos declined to identify a specific percentage or to provide concrete details on where it would likely be spent.\n\nDespite being the fourth-wealthiest person in the world, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Bezos has refrained from setting a target amount to give away in his lifetime.\n\nBezos has committed $10 billion over 10 years, or about 8% of his current net worth, to the Bezos Earth Fund, which Sánchez co-chairs. Among its priorities are reducing the carbon footprint of construction-grade cement and steel; pushing financial regulators to consider climate-related risks; advancing data and mapping technologies to monitor carbon emissions; and building natural, plant-based carbon sinks on a large scale.\n\nThough Bezos is now Amazon’s (AMZN) executive chair and not its CEO — he stepped down from that role in 2021 — he is still involved in the greening of the company. Amazon is one of more than 300 companies that have pledged to reduce their carbon footprint by 2040 according to the principles of the Paris Climate Agreement, Bezos said, though Amazon’s (AMZN) footprint grew by 18% in 2021, reflecting a pandemic-driven e-commerce boom. Amazon’s (AMZN) reckoning with its own effect on the climate mirrors its outsized impact on everything from debates about unionization to antitrust policy, where the company has attracted an enormous level of scrutiny from regulators, lawmakers, and civil society groups.\n\nBezos compared his philanthropic strategy to his years-long effort constructing a titanic engine of e-commerce and cloud computing that has made him one of the most powerful people in the world.\n\n“The hard part is figuring out how to do it in a levered way,” he said, implying that even as he gives away his billions, he is still looking to maximize his return. “It’s not easy. Building Amazon was not easy. It took a lot of hard work, a bunch of very smart teammates, hard-working teammates, and I’m finding — and I think Lauren is finding the same thing — that charity, philanthropy, is very similar.”\n\n“There are a bunch of ways that I think you could do ineffective things, too,” he added. “So you have to think about it carefully and you have to have brilliant people on the team.”\n\nBezos’ methodical approach to giving stands in sharp contrast to that of his ex-wife, the philanthropist MacKenzie Scott, who recently gave away nearly $4 billion to 465 organizations in the span of less than a year.\n\nThe economic downturn\n\nWhile Bezos and Sánchez plot out their plans for Bezos’ immense wealth, many people of more modest means are bracing for what economists fear may be an extended economic downturn.\n\nLast month, Bezos tweeted a warning to his followers on Twitter, recommending that they “batten down the hatches.”\n\nThe advice was meant for business owners and consumers alike, Bezos said in the interview, suggesting that individuals should consider putting off buying big ticket items they’ve been eyeing — or that companies should slow their acquisitions and capital expenditures.\n\n“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Keep some dry powder on hand…. Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference for that small business, if we do get into even more serious economic problems. You’ve got to play the probabilities a little bit.”\n\nMany may be feeling the pinch now, he added, but argued that as an optimist he believes the American Dream “is and will be even more attainable in the future” — projecting that within Bezos’ lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public.\n\nBezos and Sánchez’s partnership\n\nSánchez said the couple make “really great teammates,” though she laughed, “We can be kind of boring,” Sánchez said. Bezos smiled and replied, “Never boring.”\n\nSánchez, the founder of Black Ops Aviation, the first female-owned and operated aerial film and production company is a trained helicopter pilot. She said in the interview that they’ve both taken turns in the driver’s seat.\n\nBezos has credited his own journey to space for helping to inspire his push to fight climate change. Now, it is Sánchez’s turn.\n\nSánchez told CNN she anticipates venturing into orbit herself sometime in 2023. And while she did not directly address who will be joining her — quickly ruling out Bezos as a crewmate — she said simply: “It’ll be a great group of females.”\n\nWashington’s NFL team\n\nBezos may be adding NFL owner to his resume. CNN recently reported that Bezos and Jay-Z are in talks on a potential joint bid on the Washington Commanders.\n\nIt is not clear if the two have yet spoken with Dan Snyder and his wife, Tanya, the current owners of the NFL team, about the possibility.\n\nBut during the interview on Saturday, Melas asked Bezos if the speculation was true.\n\n“Yes, I’ve heard that buzz,” Bezos said with a smile.\n\nSánchez chimed in with a laugh, “I do like football. I’m just going to throw that out there for everyone.”\n\nBezos added, “I grew up in Houston, Texas, and I played football growing up as a kid … and it is my favorite sport … so we’ll just have to wait and see.”\n\n– CNN’s Chloe Melas contributed to this report", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/11/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/02/media/jeff-zucker-cnn/index.html", "title": "CNN President Jeff Zucker resigns over consensual relationship ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nCNN Worldwide president Jeff Zucker, the influential news executive who reshaped the iconic network, announced Wednesday morning that he has resigned from his position effective immediately.\n\nZucker’s stunning announcement came less than two months after he fired prime time anchor Chris Cuomo for improperly advising his brother, then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, about how to address sexual misconduct allegations.\n\n“As part of the investigation into Chris Cuomo’s tenure at CNN, I was asked about a consensual relationship with my closest colleague, someone I have worked with for more than 20 years,” Zucker told employees in a memo. “I acknowledged the relationship evolved in recent years. I was required to disclose it when it began but I didn’t. I was wrong. As a result, I am resigning today.”\n\nZucker did not name his colleague, but the relationship is with Allison Gollust, his key lieutenant for the last two decades. Gollust is remaining at CNN.\n\nZucker and Gollust began working together at NBC in 1998. They rose through the ranks at the network together, and when Zucker joined CNN, Gollust was among his first hires. Just before coming to CNN Gollust had worked briefly as communications director for Andrew Cuomo. She is currently executive vice president and chief marketing officer at CNN.\n\nIn a statement of her own, Gollust said, “Jeff and I have been close friends and professional partners for over 20 years. Recently, our relationship changed during COVID. I regret that we didn’t disclose it at the right time. I’m incredibly proud of my time at CNN and look forward to continuing the great work we do everyday.”\n\nZucker and Gollust both divorced from their partners years ago. Rumors that their close working relationship had morphed into a romantic one have long been the subject of speculation and have occasionally surfaced in gossip columns. The journalist Katie Couric, who once worked closely with Zucker, but later had a falling-out with him, even hinted at it in her tell-all memoir released last year.\n\nNews of Zucker’s resignation sent shockwaves inside CNN and across the industry. CNN employees had no idea what was coming before Zucker’s email landed in their inboxes shortly after 11 a.m. ET.\n\nZucker spoke with some of CNN’s top executives on Wednesday morning, shortly before he announced his departure. He indicated that he would have liked to stay on for a short period, to help with a smooth transition, but WarnerMedia wanted otherwise.\n\nAccording to two people involved in the matter, Zucker was facing termination if he did not resign.\n\nUnderscoring just how unexpected the news was, some of Zucker’s direct reports were out of the office and traveling on Wednesday.\n\nKilar, who flew to New York to oversee the transition, stepped in to run the Wednesday meeting Zucker usually holds with his top executive team.\n\nKilar also plans to meet with staffers in Washington and Atlanta, a source said.\n\nWarnerMedia is in the process of merging with Discovery. Many media observers thought Zucker was in line for a promotion once that deal is complete. That is not the only reason this is a pivotal time for the network: CNN plans to launch an ambitious streaming service, CNN+, in the spring, and it also needs to roll out a new 9 p.m. program to replace Cuomo.\n\nIn an email to staffers Wednesday afternoon, Jason Kilar, the CEO of CNN parent WarnerMedia, said three senior executives will lead CNN until the merger with Discovery is complete: Michael Bass, Amy Entelis, and Ken Jautz.\n\n“I have full confidence that Michael, Amy and Ken, as interim heads for News, will provide the leadership this organization needs during this time of transition,” Kilar said, adding that employees will “hear more” from the three executives “in the coming days.”\n\nZucker, with Gollust on his leadership team, took over CNN in 2013, at a time when industry observers said the network was facing an identity crisis.\n\nZucker revamped the network’s programming. A veteran of NBC, where he climbed from a producer on the “Today” show to president of the entire network, Zucker brought an eye for news and talent. He also brought a hands-on management style and gained the trust and respect of talent and staffers throughout the network.\n\nIn recent years, Zucker led the network as it faced sustained attacks from former President Trump and his supporters. Under Zucker, CNN adopted a “Facts First” slogan and approach to the news and was unrelenting in calling out Trump for his lies.\n\nThe approach turned Zucker into a villain for Trump, with the then-president lashing out at him during his years in office. Zucker also became a regular boogeyman in right-wing media, with Fox hosts viciously attacking him in prime time.\n\nIt was all evidence of Zucker’s larger-than-life status in the news business and influence over the broader discourse in American politics.\n\nFallout from Cuomo scandal\n\nZucker defended Chris Cuomo for the better part of a year while critics said the anchorman should have been benched or worse for what was then publicly known about how he’d advised his brother. Zucker eventually fired Cuomo in early December, after further revelations about how the brothers worked together to combat the allegations against Andrew.\n\nBefore taking action, CNN retained Cravath, a white-shoe law firm, to review the Cuomo matter.\n\nWhen Cuomo was fired, CNN said that Cravath’s findings alone were “cause to terminate.” But the network also said it had received an allegation of sexual misconduct from a “former junior colleague” against Chris Cuomo. Though Cuomo denied the allegation, a CNN spokesperson said at the time, “When new allegations came to us this week, we took them seriously, and saw no reason to delay taking immediate action.”\n\nCravath has continued its probe, according to sources familiar with the matter. One complicating factor is Cuomo’s ongoing legal battle with CNN, which is apparently why Zucker was questioned about his relationship with Gollust, one of the sources said.\n\nAccording to WarnerMedia’s Standards of Business Conduct handbook, “employees must not hire or supervise (directly or indirectly) someone with whom they have a personal relationship, and if you are in a position to influence the employment, advancement or hiring of someone with whom you have a personal relationship or a business they are associated with or have an interest in, you must inform the HR department in advance of taking any action.”", "authors": ["Brian Stelter Oliver Darcy", "Brian Stelter", "Oliver Darcy"], "publish_date": "2022/02/02"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/08/health/gun-violence-human-body-damage-gupta/index.html", "title": "Dr. Sanjay Gupta: The damage to the human body caused by ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOne of the most memorable lectures during my first year of medical school at the University of Michigan was delivered by Dr. Julian “Buz” Hoff. He was the chair of neurosurgery and a master at teaching the natural history of brain diseases. We learned about brain tumors, vascular diseases and trauma.\n\nHoff had a way of explaining things that made them really stick, and that was particularly clear in his lecture called “GSW.” Anyone who works in a hospital probably knows that the acronym GSW stands for “gunshot wound,” and the way Hoff wanted us to learn the topic was for us see the impact firsthand.\n\nSo on the last day of his class, we went to an outdoor gun range in Ann Arbor for our GSW lecture. There were handguns there, as well as rifles. In the distance, I saw several watermelons on top of old barrels that would serve as targets. After putting in his ear plugs and donning safety glasses, Hoff shot a watermelon with a handgun. I saw the bullet hit the watermelon but wasn’t confident I saw the bullet exit. The watermelon was then brought to us for inspection.\n\nFirst thing to notice, he told us: There was an obvious entrance and exit “wound,” and they were around the same size. We could see the green skin folding in on itself around the entrance wound and the outward beveled tissue around the exit. After we chopped the watermelon open, he pointed out that the bullet seemed to have traveled in a fairly predictable trajectory, a linear bullet-sized line through the body of the watermelon.\n\nNext came the same demonstration with a rifle. This time, I saw the watermelon shudder as it was struck and then immediately saw a significant amount of red tissue fly out the backside. Upon inspection, the first thing I noticed was how much bigger the exit wound was, compared with the entrance. And after opening the watermelon, the purpose of the demonstration became clear: Instead of a predictable linear track, the watermelon looked like it had been cored out and what was left was shredded. He explained that this was a phenomenon known as cavitation, which is just what it sounds like: The bullet doesn’t simply travel through the body, it creates a big cavity inside it.\n\nThe message was clear: I want you to imagine that had been a human body.\n\nMuch in the way pictures of black lungs had left an indelible impression of smoking on all medical students, Hoff had done the same with me for GSWs.\n\nI was reflecting on that demonstration recently when I operated on a patient with a GSW to the head. It was a handgun injury, and we were able to quickly control the bleeding and relieve the pressure on the brain. The patient spent one day in the ICU for observation and was discharged a few days later. Had it been a rifle injury, there was hardly any chance he would’ve survived.\n\nWith guns front and center yet again with the recent shooting in Nashville, I wanted to share what I have learned over the years about what bullets do to the human body and the challenge it is for surgeons to repair the damage.\n\nMore damage\n\nNearly 30 years after my med school gun range demonstration, Dr. Ernest E. Moore, trauma surgeon and director of trauma research at the Shock Trauma Center named after him at Denver Health, is also using the watermelon example to draw a comparison between different firearms.\n\n“I often use the analogy that the injury to the liver [with a semi-automatic rifle] would be similar to just taking a watermelon and dropping it on the cement. It’s incredible the amount of energy delivered. … By comparison, the 9 millimeter would drill a hole through the liver. So you’d have a sizable hole, but if you didn’t hit a major blood vessel, it’s a pretty tolerable injury. In fact, we in civilian trauma will often manage a 9-millimeter liver injury without an operation, whereas a patient with an assault rifle would be dead within 20 minutes if you didn’t operate,” he said.\n\nOther human tissue in the body reacts differently. “If you struck a bone with an AR-15, like your femur in your leg, it would literally shatter into multiple fragments that would sort of serve as secondary missiles. Whereas … we’ve seen 9 millimeters that will actually drill a hole right to the femur,” he said. (An AR-15 is a lightweight semi-automatic – that is, self-loading – rifle manufactured by Colt; other gunmakers make rifles in a similar style.)\n\nMoore also brings up cavitation as a way of visualizing what is happening in the body. He describes cavitation “as the result of a rapid expansion of the tissues surrounding the path of the bullet. … In essence, instead of a virtual drill hole with a 9 millimeter, your path of injury in tissue with an AR-15 will be 6 inches wide. And the path beyond that is even wider, but the tissue recoils back into it,” said Moore, noting that inelastic tissue – like the liver, heart and brain – are the most vulnerable to this type of energy.\n\nA brief history of the AR-15-style weapon\n\nAlthough the Department of Justice noted last year that 77.2% of mass shootings – which it counts as four or more deaths, excluding the shooter – involve handguns, many of the highest-profile incidents involved assault-style rifles: the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown, Connecticut; Orlando’s Pulse nightclub shooting in 2016; the 2017 shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas; and the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida; the 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, and the shooting at Covenant School in Nashville, just to name a few.\n\nThis kind of rifle unleashes a lot of power, said Moore, who, in addition to being a trauma surgeon since 1976 (who operated on some of the Columbine survivors), co-edited a major textbook on trauma surgery, authored more than 1,700 scientific articles and was the longtime editor of the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery.\n\n“The capacity for tissue injury is reflected in the so-called kinetic energy. And the kinetic energy, simplistically, is the mass or weight of the bullet times the velocity squared. So the velocity – the speed of the bullet exiting the gun – is really its primary effectiveness,” he said.\n\nMoore said a 9-millimeter handgun has a muzzle energy – the kinetic energy of a bullet as it leaves the gun’s muzzle – of roughly 400 foot-pounds of force. For a rifle like the AR-15, that number is 1,300. “So you have a huge increase in the amount of energy imparted from the gun,” he explained.\n\nHe said the size of the bullet has less to do with the damage it causes.\n\n“I think there are some misconceptions with … rifles. A lot of people say, ‘Oh, they’re big bullets.’ Actually, they’re small bullets – interestingly, they’re even smaller than many handguns. So the actual bullet that’s discharged from an AR-15, for example, is a half the size of the bullet from a 9 millimeter. The difference is the … velocity,” he said.\n\nAnd, if that rifle is a semi-automatic weapon, the weapon can be fired repeatedly, without manually reloading, simply by pulling the trigger. In Uvalde, hundreds of rounds were fired into classrooms in the first four minutes, according to Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steven McCraw.\n\nMoore, who grew up in a hunting family, owns firearms and is an avid hunter, has been outspoken in his opposition to civilians owning AR-15-style semi-automatic weapons and does not own one himself.\n\n“The rifle that our military uses to fight our enemies is the same rifle that we allow civilians access to and can create these mass shootings,” he said.\n\nAn Emmett Till moment\n\nDuring my neurosurgery training and the first several years of my career, I didn’t encounter these sorts of injuries. That’s because between 1994 and 2004, certain semi-automatic firearms were banned. In fact, it was in 2003, while I was covering the war in Iraq, that I first saw the damage these weapons cause on the human body, not just a watermelon.\n\nI was embedded with the Devil Docs, the Navy medical team that provides front-line medical care for the Marines. There are things that my cameraman Mark Biello and I saw on the battlefield that we still have a hard time talking about. They are still hard to even write about. Limbs blown clean off the body and wounds so horrific, I thought for sure they must’ve been caused by a bomb or IED.\n\nI never imagined that just a couple of years later, I would see the same sorts of injuries in US cities, including my own, Atlanta. Those are the days when I come home from the hospital simply unable to talk, let alone describe what I had just witnessed.\n\nStill, as you may have read after the tragedy in Uvalde last year, some folks raised whether we should have an “Emmett Till moment.”\n\nEmmett Till was a 14-year-old Black teen who was abducted and violently murdered in 1955 by white racists in Mississippi after a white woman accused him of whistling at her. Till’s mother took the unusual step of holding an open-casket funeral and allowing a photographer from Jet magazine to photograph her son’s disfigured, unrecognizable face to show the country the result of racial violence. Many consider that moment a turning point in the country’s collective support for the civil rights movement.\n\nMany of my colleagues have urged me to further describe the horrific injuries I have seen over the last nearly 20 years as a neurotrauma surgeon.\n\nThe truth is, I’m not sure America is ready to see that. More important, it isn’t a decision anybody can make unless it’s their loss and their story to tell – like Emmett Till’s mother.\n\nPublic health emergency\n\nLouis Klarevas, research professor at Columbia University and author of the 2016 book “Rampage Nation,” credits the 10-year federal assault weapons ban between 1994 and 2004 with significantly reducing the number of mass shooting incidents and deaths (which he defined as injuring or killing six or more people) before rebounding to even higher levels after the ban expired. In 2020, there were an estimated 20 million AR-15 style weapons in circulation in the United States, according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1999, during the decade in which I traveled to that gun range with Hoff, mass shootings claimed an average of 21 lives per year; from 2012 to 2021, that average had gone up to 51, according to the Violence Project. It defines a mass shooting as four or more people in a public place being killed with firearms, without any underlying criminal activity, excluding the shooter. (CNN defines mass shootings as those in which four or more people other than the shooter are injured or killed by gunfire during one event.)\n\nFederal data on the overall impact of gun violence is lacking. Even obtaining the basic numbers can be a challenge, as I learned writing this article. While the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has dashboards for Covid-19 and mpox, gun violence is still an enigma for the public health community. That’s in large part due to the Dickey amendment, which, in 1996, made it challenging and potentially financially punitive for the CDC to conduct or fund research on gun violence if it were to be used in any way to promote gun control.\n\nEven today, it is organizations like the Gun Violence Archive – an independent data collection and research group that collects information on gun violence from more than 7,500 sources daily – and not the CDC that provide some of the most up-to-date statistics on gun violence and deaths on a daily basis.\n\nThe rise of gun violence is something Dr. Bellal Joseph has seen firsthand. He is the chief of the Division of Trauma, Surgical Critical Care, Burns, and Acute Care Surgery at the Banner University Medical Center at the University of Arizona and a professor in the Department of Surgery in the University of Arizona College of Medicine - Tucson.\n\n“I can tell you from our own data, but also from a national perspective, there’s no doubt that … every trauma center in the country is seeing unprecedented numbers of trauma,” he said referring to “violent trauma: more shootings, more victims.”\n\n“Mass shootings are more prevalent at trauma centers than people actually think,” said Joseph. “Oftentimes, it takes a high [profile] school shooting to activate the media, but it actually happens a lot more than we think, unfortunately.”\n\nJoseph, who back in 2011 helped treat nine of the survivors of the mass shooting that targeted US Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, like every other surgeon we spoke to, wanted to emphasize that injuries from AR-15-style semi-automatic firearms are not like other injuries.\n\n“When you see … victims from AR-type assaults, what you’re seeing is a violent crime against others,” he said.\n\nStalemate in the face of mounting violence\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, the US ranks first in firearm homicides per capita among high-income countries of more than 10 million – that’s an age-adjusted rate 13 times greater than France’s and 23 times greater than Australia’s.\n\n\n\nIn 2021, for the second year in a row, firearms were the leading cause of death among children and adolescents, according to a CNN analysis of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That year, 4,733 children and adolescents ages 1 to 19 died from firearms, a 9% increase from 2020 and a 42% jump from 2018. About a tenth of all firearm-related deaths in the United States were among children and adolescents in 2021.\n\nAbout four hundred more children and adolescents died from firearms than car crashes, the second leading cause of death.\n\nThe gun deaths are only a small fraction of those affected. The lives of people who are injured, the victims’ families, friends and the community at large are forever ripped apart.\n\nAnd if you need a reason to look beyond the human cost of gun violence, there is also the cost to society: According to a February 2021 report by Everytown Research and Policy, it comes out to an estimated $280 billion a year, which includes medical, criminal justice and other expenses.\n\nThe American College of Surgeons, the professional organization that represents the people who see this type of injury all too often, has been calling for tighter control of weapons and more common-sense rules. In 2018, the ACS’s Firearms Strategy Task Force released 13 recommendations that includes items like regulating heavy-duty firearms, more safety training, and increasing recognition of mental health issues.\n\nAfter this week’s shooting, President Joe Biden reiterated his call to Congress to pass a ban on assault weapons.\n\n“We have to do more to stop gun violence. It’s ripping our communities apart, ripping the soul of this nation,” Biden said. “We have to do more to protect our schools, so they aren’t turned into prisons.”\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\n“There has to be some vetting, training,” said Joseph, especially when it comes to weapons like AR-15-style semi-automatic rifles. He noted that to be allowed to drive, a person needs many hours of coaching and practice in order to pass an exam and get a license – “no one is getting into a car and just driving.”\n\nAs for objections that “the government can’t tell us what to do,” Moore says, yes, citizens have rights, but they are not limitless.\n\n“We don’t drive tanks through the street. We don’t throw a grenade into the parks. … We need to have some rational thinking,” he said.\n\nThe same sort of rational thinking Hoff impressed on us so many years ago on a gun range in Ann Arbor, Michigan.", "authors": ["Dr. Sanjay Gupta"], "publish_date": "2022/06/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/rockland/2021/03/22/rockland-state-covid-vaccine-site-cuomo-motives-questioned/4765355001/", "title": "Cuomo motives questioned as state lacks COVID vaccine site in ...", "text": "Rockland residents and its political class have been wondering why the county still lacks a state-run mass vaccination site for a county with one of the state’s highest COVID fatality rates and a continued onslaught of active cases.\n\n“I truly don’t know,” said state Sen.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nWhat if doctors could just print a kidney, using cells from the patient, instead of having to find a donor match and hope the patient’s body doesn’t reject the transplanted kidney?\n\nThe soonest that could happen is in a decade, thanks to 3D organ bioprinting, said Jennifer Lewis, a professor at Harvard University’s Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering. Organ bioprinting is the use of 3D-printing technologies to assemble multiple cell types, growth factors and biomaterials in a layer-by-layer fashion to produce bioartificial organs that ideally imitate their natural counterparts, according to a 2019 study.\n\nThis type of regenerative medicine is in the development stage, and the driving force behind this innovation is “real human need,” Lewis said.\n\nIn the United States, there are 106,800 men, women and children on the national organ transplant waiting list as of March 8, 2023, according to the Health Resources & Services Administration. However, living donors provide only around 6,000 organs per year on average, and there are about 8,000 deceased donors annually who each provide 3.5 organs on average.\n\nThe cause of this discrepancy is “a combination of people who undergo catastrophic health events, but their organs aren’t high enough quality to donate, or they’re not on the organ donor list to begin with, and the fact that it’s actually very difficult to find a good match” so the patient’s body doesn’t reject the transplanted organ, Lewis said.\n\nAnd even though living donors are an option, “to do surgery on someone who doesn’t need it” is a big risk, said Dr. Anthony Atala, director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. “So, living related donors are usually not the preferred way to go because then you’re taking an organ away from somebody else who may need it, especially now as we age longer.”\n\nAtala and his colleagues were responsible for growing human bladders in a lab by hand in 2006, and implanting a complicated internal organ into people for the first time — saving the lives of three children in whom they implanted the bladders.\n\nA bladder scaffold is seeded with cells at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. Courtesy Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine\n\nEvery day, 17 people die waiting for an organ transplant, according to the Health Resources & Services Administration. And every 10 minutes, another person is added to the waitlist, the agency says. More than 90% of the people on the transplant list in 2021 needed a kidney.\n\n“About a million people worldwide are in need of a kidney. So they have end-stage renal failure, and they have to go on dialysis,” Lewis said. “Once you go on dialysis, you have essentially five years to live, and every year, your mortality rate increases by 15%. Dialysis is very hard on your body. So this is really motivating to take on this grand challenge of printing organs.”\n\n“Anti-hypertensive pills are not scarce. Everybody who needs them can get them,” Martine Rothblatt, CEO and chairman of United Therapeutics, said in June 2022 at the Life Itself conference, a health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN. United Therapeutics was one of the conference sponsors.\n\n“There is no practical reason why anybody who needs a kidney — or a lung, a heart, a liver — should not be able to get one,” she added. “We’re using technology to solve this problem.”\n\nPrinting organs 101\n\nTo begin the process of bioprinting an organ, doctors typically start with a patient’s own cells. They take a small needle biopsy of an organ or do a minimally invasive surgical procedure that removes a small piece of tissue, “less than half the size of a postage stamp,” Atala said. “By taking this small piece of tissue, we are able to tease cells apart (and) we grow and expand the cells outside the body.”\n\nThis growth happens inside a sterile incubator or bioreactor, a pressurized stainless steel vessel that helps the cells stay fed with nutrients — called “media” — the doctors feed them every 24 hours, since cells have their own metabolism, Lewis said. Each cell type has a different media, and the incubator or bioreactor acts as an oven-like device mimicking the internal temperature and oxygenation of the human body, Atala said.\n\n“Then we mix it with this gel, which is like a glue,” Atala said. “Every organ in your body has the cells and the glue that holds it together. Basically, that’s also called ‘extracellular matrix.’”\n\nThis glue is Atala’s nickname for bioink, a printable mixture of living cells, water-rich molecules called hydrogels, and the media and growth factors that help the cells continue to proliferate and differentiate, Lewis said. The hydrogels mimic the human body’s extracellular matrix, which contains substances including proteins, collagen and hyaluronic acid.\n\nThe non-cell sample portion of the glue can be made in a lab, and “is going to have the same properties of the tissue you’re trying to replace,” Atala said.\n\nThe biomaterials used typically have to be nontoxic, biodegradable and biocompatible to avoid a negative immune response, Lewis said. Collagen and gelatin are two of the most common biomaterials used for bioprinting tissues or organs.\n\nThe printing process\n\nFrom there, doctors load each bioink — depending on how many cell types they’re wanting to print — into a printing chamber, “using a printhead and nozzle to extrude an ink and build the material up layer by layer,” Lewis said. Creating tissue with personalized properties is enabled by printers being programmed with a patient’s imaging data from X-rays or scans, Atala said.\n\n“With a color printer you have several different cartridges, and each cartridge is printing a different color, and you come up with your (final) color,” Atala added. Bioprinting is the same; you’re just using cells instead of traditional inks.\n\nHow long the printing process takes depends on several factors, including the organ or tissue being printed, the fineness of the resolution and the number of printheads needed, Lewis said. But it typically lasts a few to several hours. The time from the biopsy to the implantation is about four to six weeks, Atala said.\n\nA 3D printer seeds different types of cells onto a kidney scaffold at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. Courtesy Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine\n\nThe ultimate challenge is “getting the organs to actually function as they should,” so accomplishing that “is the holy grail,” Lewis said.\n\n“Just like if you were to harvest an organ from a donor, you have to immediately get that organ into a bioreactor and start perfusing it or the cells die,” she added. To perfuse an organ is to supply it with fluid, usually blood or a blood substitute, by circulating it through blood vessels or other channels.\n\nDepending on the organ’s complexity, there is sometimes a need to mature the tissue further in a bioreactor or further drive connections, Lewis said. “There’s just a number of plumbing issues and challenges that have to be done in order to make that printed organ actually function like a human organ would in vivo (meaning in the body). And honestly, this has not been fully solved yet.”\n\nOnce a bioprinted organ is implanted into a patient, it will naturally degrade over time — which is OK since that’s how it’s designed to work.\n\n“You’re probably wondering, ‘Well, then what happens to the tissue? Will it fall apart?’ Actually, no,” Atala said. “These glues dissolve, and the cells sense that the bridge is giving way; they sense that they don’t have a firm footing anymore. So cells do what they do in your very own body, which is to create their own bridge and create their own glue.”\n\nRemaining challenges\n\nAtala and Lewis are conservative in their estimates about the number of years remaining before fully functioning bioprinted organs can be implanted into humans.\n\n“The field’s moving fast, but I mean, I think we’re talking about a decade plus, even with all of the tremendous progress that’s been made,” Lewis said.\n\n“I learned so many years ago never to predict because you’ll always be wrong,” Atala said. “There’s so many factors in terms of manufacturing and the (US Food and Drug Administration regulation). At the end of the day, our interest, of course, is to make sure the technologies are safe for the patient above all.”\n\nWhenever bioprinting organs becomes an available option, affordability for patients and their caregivers shouldn’t be an issue.\n\nThey’ll be “accessible for sure,” Atala said. “The costs associated with organ failures are very high. Just to keep a patient on dialysis is over a quarter of a million dollars per year, just to keep one patient on dialysis. So, it’s a lot cheaper to create an organ that you can implant into the patient.”\n\nThe average kidney transplant cost was $442,500 in 2020, according to research published by the American Society of Nephrology — while 3D printers retail for around a few thousand dollars to upward of $100,000, depending on their complexity. But even though low-cost printers are available, pricey parts of bioprinting can include maintaining cell banks for patients, culturing cells and safely handling biological materials, Lewis said.\n\nSome of the major costs of current organ transplantation are “harvesting the organ from the donor, the transport costs and then, of course, the surgery that the recipient goes through, and then all the care and monitoring,” Lewis said. “Some of that cost would still be in play, even if it was bioprinted.”", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/06/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/11/29/lawsuit-claims-kendall-patient-recovery-caused-cancer-augusta-ga/8748455002/", "title": "Lawsuit claims Augusta medical equipment sterilizer plant's ...", "text": "Kendall Patient Recovery, a medical equipment sterilizer near Augusta Regional Airport, is facing a lawsuit from more than 20 current and former Augusta residents. They claim that the plant released ethylene oxide – a carcinogenic gas – in excess levels, causing everything from breast cancer to miscarriages.\n\n\"These individuals have been unknowingly inhaling ethylene oxide on a routine and continuous basis for decades,\" attorneys for the plaintiffs wrote in the initial complaint, filed in July of this year. \"Now they are suffering from a variety of cancers, miscarriages, birth defects, and other life-altering health effects from their continuous exposure to ethylene oxide.\"\n\nA typical example from the case is plaintiff Evelyn Armstrong, who, according to the suit, lived five and a half miles from the facility since 1989.\n\n\"Evelyn consistently … inhaled contaminated air in and around her home, her work and in the areas surrounding the KPR facility. As a result, Evelyn was diagnosed with breast cancer around 1999. At the time of her diagnosis, Evelyn did not have notice that her medical condition was wrongfully caused or that it was caused by the Defendant's emissions of ethylene oxide.\"\n\nAttorneys for KPR filed to dismiss the case, charging that KPR never broke the law regarding the level of its emission, and that the complaint, which rests on the plaintiffs having lived near or worked in the plant and having health issues, does not actually establish that ethylene oxide from KPR was responsible for their illnesses, or indeed, that ethylene oxide was responsible at all.\n\n\"Plaintiffs rely on a speculative chain of possibilities to reach the unsupported conclusion that their alleged injuries are actually traceable to KPR’s conduct, rather than something else,\" attorneys for KPR wrote.\n\nAttorneys for both the plaintiffs and defendants did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMost of the claims in the lawsuit are related to historical emission levels, which according to the complaint were significantly higher than they have been in recent years. Publicly available EPA data from the Toxic Release Inventory does show much higher quantities of released ethylene oxide from the facility, from over 4,000 pounds in 2009 to 94 pounds in 2020.\n\nDespite the fall off of emissions, some residents are concerned about the KPR plant and want it shut down. The Georgia Environmental Protection Division says the plant is meeting all the expectations for a similar plant. In 2014, when the US Environmental Protection Agency put out its National Air Toxic Assessment, two sterilizer sites in Georgia – in Covington and Smyrna – were flagged as potentially having issues, the KPR plant was not.\n\n\"The risk at KPR was lower than the other, and that's due to several reasons, they use a lot less ethylene oxide, they recycle it, and their process just allows less opportunity for fugitive emissions to occur within the facility,\" said Karen Hays, chief of the Air Protection Branch for the Georgia Environmental Protection Division. \"The risk at some of the (other sites) in the state are now down to levels that KPR already was at.\"\n\nMeasuring cancer risk\n\nCancer risk is measured in amounts of chemical sufficient to create a one in a million additional risk of cancer – that is, among a million people exposed to given conditions over a lifetime of 70 years, one would be expected to contract cancer from the exposure. That risk is added on to the underlying risk that a person will develop cancer for reasons other than air pollution.\n\nThe complaint against KPR relies in part on the NATA, alleging that the census tract that KPR is located in has a 64 in a million risk of developing cancer. The census tract identified, 104, does have the highest cancer risk in Richmond County – the average is about 32 in a million – but according to a GIS analysis by The Augusta Chronicle and a search of a public address to census tract tool the KPR facility at 1430 Marvin Griffin road is located in census tract 106, which has a cancer risk of about 46. In the motion to dismiss, attorneys for KPR say that plaintiffs are not claiming they live in the same census tract as the KPR plant.\n\nLast year the Inspector General of the US Environmental Protection Agency released a report calling on the organization to communicate with communities where ethylene oxide levels increased risks above 100 in a million. The locations in Covington and Smyrna were both flagged, but KPR was not.\n\nHays said it's also often difficult to model where ethylene oxide is coming from and what the risks are, given low concentrations. Sterilizing plants are just one possible source of the gas. Georgia EPD has monitoring sites in both urban and rural areas far from any sterilizing plants to compare to emissions outside the sterilizing plants.\n\n\"The EPA method used to analyze these samples is not robust at these very low concentrations, and EPA is saying the same thing,\" Hays said. \"With the very low concentrations we see in the air, the method is just not accurate. What we're finding is that the concentrations that we monitor in our urban background site are very similar to concentrations we're monitoring near the facility near Covington, near the facility in Atlanta.\"\n\nIn April 2020, EPD wrote a memorandum modeling the ethylene oxide levels outside of the KPR facility, examining acceptable ambient concentrations, which is the amount that would increase cancer risks by one in a million. At the nearest residential areas to the plant, the level was 1.6 to 4.9 times the annual acceptable ambient concentrations.\n\n\"(That AAC measure for the residential areas means) the risk of developing excess cancers over a lifetime would be as much as 4.9 in a million, if exposed to that concentration continuously over a lifetime,\" Hays said. \"You'd add that to (a) one in three chance of developing cancer anyhow. So it would increase your potential for developing cancer slightly.\"\n\nThe AAC is a trigger for further attention – if the emissions are over the AAC, then the EPD will look into requiring additional controls for emissions – not a hard legal limit. At that point, Hays said, they would require a plant to install additional controls if feasible. But she said the KPR plant has not triggered any additional control requirements.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/01/29/is-dave-ramseys-empire-best-place-work-america/4281535001/", "title": "Is Dave Ramsey's empire the 'best place to work in America'?", "text": "Bob Smietana\n\nReligion News Service\n\nThis article has been republished with permission from Religion News Service. NASHVILLE, Tenn. (RNS) — Dave Ramsey has spent the past three decades trying to build what he calls the best place to work in America.\n\nFrom his headquarters south of Nashville, the evangelical Christian personal finance guru runs a media and live events empire that includes a popular national talk radio show. Tickets to workshops on topics such as “EntreLeadership” run from $3,000 to $10,000.\n\nThousands of churches around the country, meanwhile, host Ramsey’s “Financial Peace University,” a 9-week program built around his principles for handling money “God’s way.”\n\nRamsey’s primary product, he says, is hope, often in short supply when debt mounts up. That’s something Ramsey knows firsthand. When he was in his mid-20s, Ramsey and his wife owed millions after his real estate business failed. Following advice from a church friend, they rebuilt their lives.\n\nThe people who have followed his path now make pilgrimages to perform their “Debt Free Scream” on his radio show — celebrating that Ramsey’s methods gave them control of their lives.\n\nBut inside the company’s $42 million headquarters, which opened in 2019 in Franklin, Tennessee, Ramsey’s orchestration of what he calls a “predictable and reliable and safe and godly” company has been under stress from COVID-19, and Ramsey’s demands for unquestioning loyalty.\n\nRamsey’s intolerance for dissent has created what former employees call a cultlike environment, where leaders proclaim their love for staff and then fire people at a moment’s notice.\n\nRamsey Solutions, former employees and their spouses say, is run more like a church than a business. A review of court documents, company emails and recordings of staff meetings backs up these sources’ claims that company leaders attempt to exert control over employees’ personal lives.\n\nAt a staff meeting in July, Ramsey railed at his staff after an employee sued Ramsey Solutions for firing her for having premarital sex, which is against company policy, and said he would pay the price to protect what he had built out of love for his employees.\n\n“I am sick of dealing with all this stuff,” Ramsey bellowed, according to a recording obtained by Religion News Service. “I’m so tired of being falsely accused of being a jerk when all I’m doing is trying to help people stay in line.”\n\nIn a sarcastic email responding to a request for comment on this story, Ramsey Solutions wrote, “We want to confirm for you that you are right, we are horrible evil people.”\n\nIn a follow-up email, the company said that it contests many of “the facts, details and conclusions” of Religion News Service’s reporting,” without specifying their objections. The company also declined to comment on pending litigation.\n\nReligion News Service’s request for comment was also emailed to all the staff at the company and to local pastors. Many of them emailed or called, either to tell how Ramsey’s teaching had changed their lives and their passion to change the “toxic money culture.”\n\nFormer employees also described Ramsey as a great place to work, at least at first.\n\nIn the spring of 2020, Heather Fulk’s husband, Jon, was working as a developer for Ramsey Solutions, a job that offered great co-workers and a family-friendly schedule. The company’s mission, too, was something Jon could believe in, his wife said.\n\nHeather was more skeptical. For one thing, there was the spousal interview. In his 2011 book “EntreLeadership,” Ramsey recommends that companies vet spouses to make sure their hire is not “married to crazy.”\n\n“When hiring someone, you are employing more than just the person,” his website advises. “You’re taking on the whole family. And when they are married to someone who is domineering, unstable or simply full of drama, you’ll end up with a team member who can’t be creative, productive or excellent.”\n\nHeather Fulk balked: She didn’t want to work for Ramsey, her husband did. She had no desire to risk being labeled a “crazy spouse” or to cost her husband a job. But after Jon got the position, Heather said, the company had little impact on their personal life, except for their feeling that they had to keep her credit card a secret — consumer debt is a Ramsey no-no.\n\nThen COVID-19 hit.\n\nFrom the beginning, Ramsey downplayed the virus. His March 2, 2020 radio show began with a long rant against the news media, who, he said, were overstating the threat.\n\n“You would think that the black plague was coming through the U.S., listening to people whine,” he told his audience. “You guys have lost your mind out there.”\n\nHe went on to say that the virus only affected the weak and infirm and that everyone else should get on with business as usual. He vowed to keep the company’s live events rolling, warning there would be no refunds.\n\n“We have people calling in, they are wanting to cancel stuff for a live event in May — let me tell you how much of your money I am going to give you back if you don’t come for the coronavirus in May,” he said. “ZERO. I am keeping your money. You are a wuss.”\n\nPlugging a “Live Like No One Else” cruise, scheduled for late March, Ramsey said he would go on the cruise, even if he was there “by my freaking self.” The cruise was later canceled.\n\nStaffers, who are called “team members,” heard the same message. Don’t freak out. Trust company leaders to make wise decisions. Remember, the company existed to give people hope even in hard times.\n\n“You are ok,” Ramsey said in an all-staff email published by the Nashville Scene in March after a company employee tested positive for COVID-19. “Ramsey is ok. This will soon be a memory.”\n\nWithin a few days, a second team member tested positive. Headquarters was shut down on March 20. Although the work-from-home experiment went well, the company’s leaders soon decided that Ramsey was not a work-from-home employer.\n\nOn May 4, the company’s offices reopened and, despite at least 100 positive cases in the subsequent seven months, have remained open since. Work continued on a $50 million addition to the company headquarters, which would house an additional 600 employees.\n\nRamsey’s return to in-person work frustrated Heather Fulk. She has asthma, which puts her at higher risk if infected with COVID-19. After learning employees were being called back to headquarters, she made what she thought was an innocuous comment in a private Facebook post.\n\n“Jon’s company wants to bring all 900 employees back asap when a majority can do their work from home,” she wrote on April 20. “I do *not* understand how people don’t see we are setting ourselves up for a huge second wave. Ugh, people make me so angry.”\n\nBefore long, Jon got a call from his supervisor who said a co-worker had reported Heather’s comment. They had a screenshot of the post, sent by the co-worker’s spouse.\n\nA few weeks later, Jon was fired. In his exit interview, Armando Lopez, head of human resources at Ramsey, confirmed that the cause was his wife’s social media comment, according to a recording of the meeting.\n\n“There is definitely a line in the sand that we have drawn, for good or for bad,” Lopez is heard saying on the recording. “But it is a definite point that we are making.”\n\nRamsey Solutions offered $18,000 in severance, provided the Fulks would sign a nondisclosure agreement and agree never to make any negative comments about Ramsey.\n\nThe couple refused, forfeiting the severance. The company later claimed in a cease-and-desist letter that Ramsey policies that Jon signed at his hiring required him to keep details about Ramsey confidential.\n\nHeather said that turning down the money was the right thing to do, despite their having to rely on friends who bought groceries and gave them money to pay their bills — a sign, she said, that God was looking out for them.\n\n“I didn’t want to live under the fear of if I say something,” she said. “Dave is watching, you know. And he is. He’s always watching. I just didn’t want to live under that cloud.”\n\nIn mid-May, someone at Ramsey Solutions filed an anonymous complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration alleging that the company was not doing enough to prevent the spread of COVID-19, according to a record of the complaint in OSHA’s database.\n\nThat led to an angry tirade from Ramsey during a staff meeting last May. After ranting about how the pandemic was affecting his golf game, he said the company had told OSHA it was not going to do anything in response to the complaint.\n\n“So whoever you are, you moron, you did absolutely no good, except piss me off,” he told staff. “You are not welcome here if you are willing to do stuff like that. If you are really scared and you really think that leadership is trying to kill you … please, we love you. Just leave. We really don’t want you here.”\n\nHe warned employees not to contact anyone outside the building with their concerns.\n\n“If you really think the people here are evil, bad people and you think that you can effect change by reaching outside of here, you are wrong,” he said. “And you are not welcome.”\n\nAgainst the recommendation of his board not to address the OSHA complaint, Ramsey said he felt duty-bound to talk about it, because “I love this place and I really don’t want any morons here.” If he found out the person’s identity, he continued, “I will fire you instantaneously for your lack of loyalty, your lack of class, and the fact that you are a moron and you snuck through our hiring process,” he said.\n\nThen he went on to tell employees how much he loved them and how Ramsey Solutions was still the best workplace in the world.\n\nRachel Self did not buy it.\n\nA former user-experience designer at Ramsey, Self said Jon Fulk’s firing was a sign that something was wrong at the company. “That was proof to me that they meant what they said about some of these threats,” she said. “He was just gone.”\n\nSelf, who grew up in a Southern, evangelical home where her mom was a big Ramsey fan, said she had heard there had been issues at the company, but, like the Fulks, she liked the stable work environment and the company’s mission.\n\nIt was a chance, she said, to do something bigger than “just making a product people don’t need.” Besides, she said, “People were just kind. Exceedingly, glowing, Christian kind.”\n\nHired in January 2020, she was trained in the company’s 14 core values, which include having a “self-employed” mentality, never giving up and working “as unto the Lord.”\n\nCo-workers asked her about her “Dave story”: a tale about how Ramsey had changed their life.\n\n“It was like asking, ‘How did you meet Jesus?’” she said.\n\nReturning to the office during the pandemic, however, Self became uncomfortable with the level of risk. People would lean over her desk to talk with her without masks, paying no heed to social distancing. Wearing a mask in the office, she said, was seen as a sign of distrust in the company’s leaders.\n\nShe doesn’t blame Ramsey alone. “A lot of Christians these days think COVID is not real,” she said. “I think that’s the underpinning problem.”\n\nAmy Fritz, a Christian writer from Spring Hill, Tennessee, whose husband, Nathan, worked for Ramsey from 2012 to 2019, said that long-term staffers learn to dismiss his rants as just Dave being Dave. They love the work and keep their heads down.\n\n“I think you sort of get inoculated to it,” Amy said.\n\nIt isn’t the Dave Ramsey she expected. Having read his EntreLeadership book, she said, “I thought, wow, here is a Christian businessman who works at a for-profit that’s about Jesus,” she said. “Wouldn’t it be amazing to be part of that?”\n\nDuring the interview process, Fritz said she was asked about the company’s famous gossip policy. Ramsey often described gossip as “when you discuss a negative with anyone who can’t solve the problem.” He is ruthless in rooting it out.\n\n“We will not have it. I will fire your butt for this,” he boasted at a 2017 leadership event.\n\nWhen the interviewer asked what she would do if her husband came home frustrated after work, Fritz said she would tell him to “talk to your leader.” At the time, Fritz said, she believed it.\n\nWhile Nathan finished his interview, a member of the “Lampo Ladies,” a group of employee spouses, gave her a tour of Nashville. (Until a company rebrand in 2014, Ramsey Solutions was known as the Lampo Group.)\n\nHer husband was offered the job but first the couple would have to submit a budget to show that they could live on the salary Ramsey offered.\n\nIt was a stretch, said Fritz, but the couple made it work. And the excitement of going to work for Ramsey overwhelmed any concerns they had.\n\n“We felt like we were chosen,” she said.\n\nAfter they moved, Nathan’s new co-workers showed up to help unload the couple’s moving van. The next day, more Lampo Ladies showed to unpack boxes and set up their home. For years, Fritz did the same for other new employees.\n\n“They just provided this awesome sense of community,” said Fritz, who would eventually serve as a volunteer administrator for the Lampo Ladies Facebook group and encouraged wives of employees to join. “Nathan felt like he was going to Disneyworld every day.”\n\nDoubts about the company began to creep in only after a 2014 incident that came to be known as “Twittergate.” After several anonymous Twitter accounts began to make fun of the company culture, the Daily Beast reported at the time, Dave Ramsey offered bounties during a staff meeting for anyone who would identify the tweeters.\n\nThe Daily Beast also reported that in 2011, Ramsey pulled out a gun to make a point about how much he hated gossip — a detail that a company official would later confirm in a deposition. Since that time, Ramsey has boasted to staff about carrying a gun at all times.\n\nFritz defended the company during Twittergate.\n\n“Kind of bummed to see you tweet in support of an untrue hit piece. My husband works at Lampo. So, we actually know the truth,” she tweeted after the Daily Beast piece. The possibility that something was wrong at Ramsey, she told RNS, was too “horrible to consider.”\n\nBut she remembers thinking, “I don’t want people to see Dave’s character.” She also began to worry about the company’s merging of Christian mission and business opportunism. “When you mix faith, Christianity, and business, it can sometimes feel icky,” she said.\n\nSome employees question how much of the culture at Ramsey Solutions is driven by Christianity and how much by a pursuit of profit.\n\nIn November 2018, as the company was gearing up for a multimillion-dollar book launch for Ramsey radio host Chris Hogan’s “Everyday Millionaires,” Hogan’s wife, Melissa, came to Ramsey leadership with allegations that Chris had been unfaithful to her.\n\nThe husband of a woman Chris had an affair with had begun to comment on Chris’ Twitter feed, responding to his tweets with Bible verses about adultery. Melissa Hogan believed that the allegations against her husband would become public.\n\nMelissa told RNS in an email that she went to see Ramsey to discuss what to do. The company, she said, had been supportive of her and her husband after their youngest son was diagnosed with a rare disease. She also knew, given Ramsey’s outspoken stand against adultery, that coming forward could cost Chris his job and was concerned about the couple’s future.\n\n“If their spouse can’t trust them, neither can I,” Ramsey wrote in “EntreLeadership,” and the company has been willing to defend its code of conduct in court.\n\nIn July 2020, Caitlin O’Connor, a former Ramsey Solutions employee, sued the company, claiming she had been fired after requesting maternity leave in the summer of 2020. According to the lawsuit, O’Connor emailed Lopez, the human resources chief, on June 18, 2020, asking for accommodations under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act because she was 12 weeks pregnant.\n\nA week later, after meeting with two members of Ramsey’s operating board, O’Connor was fired for being pregnant and not married, according to the lawsuit. Board members and Lopez told her it was because she had violated the company’s code of conduct.\n\nThe lawsuit claims the company’s “righteous living” core value “discriminates against employees who do not strictly adhere to Ramsey’s interpretation of ‘Judeo-Christian’ values for non-work related behavior.”\n\nRamsey’s lawyers denied any discrimination. “Defendant admits that Plaintiff’s employment was terminated because she engaged in premarital sex,” which the company’s court filings said is a violation of its core values.\n\nThe day after news of the lawsuit broke, Ramsey defended the company’s policies during the company’s regular Wednesday “devo” meeting, a mandatory all-company chapel service.\n\nRamsey told employees that the policies were necessary to maintain a predictable, safe and “godly” culture. Without them, he said, Ramsey would be just like any other company, a “cesspool” of sex and racism and #MeToo complaints. Sex outside of marriage is wrong, he told employees, according to a recording obtained by RNS.\n\n“Don’t talk to me about how you love your pastor and your church. And I just moved in with my boyfriend,” he said. “That’s so freaking inconsistent and stupid.”\n\nPeople who disagree with company policies should leave, he said, because the company would not sanction “misbehavior.”\n\n“And if you don’t like that, this is your cue,” he said. “Don’t let the door hit you in the ass.”\n\nUnder Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, secular employers, especially larger ones, are generally barred from discriminating on the basis of religion and other factors. Federal law also bars discrimination on the basis of pregnancy.\n\nBut at-will employment states such as Tennessee permit employers to fire employees for almost any reason, said Holly Hollman, general counsel and associate executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee for Religious Liberty. Many companies have codes of conduct that bar behaviors also frowned on by religious groups.\n\nStill, she said, there is a difference between a secular employer and a faith-based one. Secular employers like Ramsey, she said, are not exempt from Title VII, even if their owners are religious. A Christian boss such as Ramsey can’t require employees to share his beliefs or practice Christianity the way he does.\n\nIn 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the owners of Hobby Lobby, who claimed their Christian faith prohibited them from paying for certain kinds of contraceptives. But that was a narrow ruling and very case-specific, said Hollman.\n\n“There is no religious exemption under Title VII based on the piety of the owners,” she said.\n\nStuart Lark, a Colorado Springs attorney who advises nonprofits on personnel issues and religious accommodations, said that in recent years, the courts have supported the religious exercise rights of commercial employers.\n\n“The U.S. Supreme Court has expressly held that employers do not forfeit their religious exercise rights when they enter the commercial marketplace,” said Lark. He thinks that for-profit companies whose owners have strong religious beliefs may be exempt from Title VII in some cases.\n\n“It’s still an open question, and the answer may depend on whether the employer can establish that its activities and policies exercise or express its religious beliefs.” he said.\n\nOn his leadership blog, Ramsey has defended his rights to enforce a moral code and to fire people for things like extramarital affairs. “I’ve got a right to tell my employees whatever I want to tell them,” he wrote. “They freaking work for me.”\n\nAfter RNS asked to interview Ramsey and Hogan and to request comment for this story, the company invited a reporter to attend a worship service entitled “Watch the Darkness Flee” at the company’s headquarters, where hundreds of team members gather in the building’s atrium to sing worship songs. Almost no one wore a mask. There was little social distancing.\n\n“Ramsey, may we be those who trust him even in the day of trouble, because we know he is good,” one of the worship leaders said as the service drew to a close.\n\nIn the end, Ramsey did not fire Hogan. Instead, after a meeting that included the Hogans, leaders from their church and other members of the company’s board, the company set up a “restoration plan” for the couple’s marriage that would allow the book tour to go forward. After the tour, Chris would take time off to work on the couple’s marriage.\n\nMelissa Hogan said she agreed with the plan at first but then became concerned at the level of control that Ramsey’s leadership wanted.\n\n“In essence, as part of that process, we were to waive confidentiality with our therapists in order for them to report to Ramsey Solutions’ leaders,” she said in her email. “I now recognize that to be unhealthy, controlling, spiritually manipulative, and deeply wounding.”\n\nAccording to emails obtained by RNS, the leadership at Ramsey offered to pay for marriage counseling, with “regular and full reports” from the counselor to Ramsey leadership. Dave also asked two of his colleagues to work with the pastor and elders at the church the Hogans attended to get reports on the couple.\n\nWhen Melissa Hogan disagreed with parts of the Ramsey restoration plan, she was told that she “lacked hope for her marriage’s future” and lacked faith in the company’s wisdom. She was eventually barred from her husband’s book tour.\n\n“During a process that was supposed to help restore our marriage, Ramsey Solutions’ board members attempted to manipulate and control me through emails and phone calls,” she said in her email. “They characterized their plan as aligning with the Holy Spirit and suggested that things would not ‘end well’ if I made choices to support healing in my marriage and family that either were not directed by them or decisions that they did not approve.”\n\nRamsey officials justified their approach by saying that working for the company was a “ministry and a mission,” and her husband had a “calling on his life.”\n\nAfter the Hogans filed for divorce, Ramsey told employees in a May 2019 all-staff meeting that Chris Hogan was going through what Ramsey characterized as a “really nasty divorce” and that Melissa had shown up unannounced at his office to make angry and untrue allegations about her then-husband.\n\n“Suffice to say, there are no angels on this story,“ he said.\n\nRamsey said that some staff had already begun to believe rumors that the leadership was somehow covering up misconduct on Chris Hogan’s part. Leadership, on the other hand, had put “rumor and innuendo aside” and focused on fact, he said.\n\n“Looking at it, it was messy but there weren’t clear lines. And we said, OK, not because we are taking up for Chris because he’s getting ready to go on book tour but because there was not a clear line,” Ramsey told his employees at the staff meeting. “If there was a clear line, we would have taken the hit and canceled the book tour. But there wasn’t. And Chris wouldn’t be here anymore.”\n\nDocuments in the Hogans’ divorce filing tell a different story.\n\nAccording to documents related to the divorce proceeding obtained by RNS, Chris Hogan admitted in March 2019 that he had committed adultery with multiple women during his marriage, including affairs with a former Ramsey co-worker and one of his wife’s relatives that lasted more than a year.\n\nHe admitted lying to his employer about the affair with the co-worker and about his relationships with “one or more women.” Hogan also admitted having oral sex, “sensual touching” and “sensual kissing” with one or more women during his marriage.\n\nMelissa Hogan said she provided a statement to RNS because she disputed Ramsey’s retelling of her interactions with company leaders.\n\n“During his remarks at the May 2019 staff meeting, Dave Ramsey also publicly mischaracterized my actions during the ensuing process as involving anger, hyperbole, and drama,” she said. “The fact is that I repeatedly expressed to them my support and concern for my husband, my marriage, our testimony as believers, and the truth.”\n\nShe added: “The trauma I experienced from my interactions with Ramsey Solutions’ leadership was significant, given their public image and their conflicting and controlling communications with me.”\n\nChris Hogan did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt the May 2019 staff meeting, Ramsey told his employees, “If you are worrying about our integrity in leadership and are we covering up for (Hogan) because he is a big brand, the answer is no. No.”\n\nFor Fritz’s husband, though, the company’s handling of the Hogan situation was the last straw, his wife told RNS. For years, company leaders had fired team members for violating the code of conduct, even for minor offenses. Now, Fritz said, the rules didn’t seem to apply.\n\nFritz’s husband and a number of his colleagues eventually quit over the situation. “God has used this organization to do some wonderful things and bring hope to many,” Fritz said in a now-deleted blog post after her husband left. “It broke our hearts to see some of the rot behind the curtain and that it appeared to go all the way to the top.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/30/us/jackson-water-system-failing-tuesday/index.html", "title": "The water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, has gotten so bad, the city ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nRecent torrential rain coupled with years of water system issues have resulted in a crisis in Jackson, Mississippi, where the city doesn’t have enough water to fight fires, flush toilets or even hand out to residents in need.\n\nJackson’s main water treatment facility began failing Monday, according to Gov. Tate Reeves. The National Guard was called up to help distribute bottled water as crews work to get the water treatment plant back online, state officials said.\n\nBut the distribution itself proved unsustainable. Residents of all ages were seen waiting in lines more than a mile long at Hawkins Field Airport for at least two hours Tuesday for just one case of bottled water. The event was supposed to span three hours, but barely ran two as people were eventually turned away when the 700 cases of water ran out.\n\n“I keep saying we’re going to be the next Michigan,” said Jeraldine Watts, 86, who was able to get water at a grocery store Monday night. “And it looks like that’s exactly what we’re headed for.”\n\nWatts was referring to the water crisis in the city of Flint, which has battled water issues since a 2014 water crisis in which lead-contaminated water fed to residents’ faucets.\n\nPeople line up for water in Jackson, Mississippi, on August 30, 2022. CNN\n\nJackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba told CNN’s Pamela Brown the city is working on more water distribution events. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency will provide nearly 30 water trucks to help supplement the city events, the mayor said.\n\n“I have been assured by MEMA that they will supplement those locations with about 28 tanker trucks distributed at various points across the city,” Lumumba told CNN.\n\nExplanations for Jackson’s failing system are complicated: Damage this summer to pumps at the main water treatment facility made failure increasingly likely as the summer progressed, the governor said; and flooding of the Pearl River after heavy rains last week affected treatment processes and therefore the amount of running water the system can provide, Lumumba said.\n\nThis week’s troubles come as the water system has been plagued with problems for years and with the city already under a boil water notice since late July for what the state called a water-quality issue.\n\nThe state is “surging our resources to the city’s water treatment facility and beginning emergency maintenance, repairs and improvements,” Gov. Reeves said. “We will do everything in our power to restore water pressure and get water flowing back to the people of Jackson.”\n\nWater for those in the state’s most populous city would have to be provided “for an unknown period of time,” Reeves said.\n\nThe water shortage is expected to last “the next couple of days,” according to the mayor’s office.\n\nLumumba also announced Monday the city’s public works director – a role that oversees the water treatment facilities – has been reassigned. Marlin King will instead serve as deputy director and Jordan Hillman, the city’s planning and development director, will be the interim public works director, according to Melissa Payne, the mayor’s spokesperson.\n\nKing did not respond to CNN requests for comment. Payne said King’s reassignment “is part of restructuring” and is not a result of the current water crisis.\n\nResidents say faucet water is discolored\n\nState Rep. Ronnie Crudup Jr. said he didn’t have running water Monday, but on Tuesday, discolored water came out of his faucet that he used to flush the toilet. He and his family used bottled water Tuesday morning to brush their teeth, Crudup told CNN’s Alisyn Camerota.\n\nCrudup said that although the city has experienced water issues in the past, rain played a part in the current water emergency.\n\n“It’s been building up for years, but we have had an unprecedented amount of rain in the last two to three weeks, and it just kind of created this havoc, what we are dealing with right now,” he said.\n\nJackson resident Daryl Page told CNN he’s been searching for clean, bottled water since the city’s been under a boil water notice “for a whole month.” He was driving to a distribution site, but as he arrived, he noticed there was nothing there.\n\nFirefighters and recruits for the Jackson Fire Department carry cases of bottled water to residents vehicles, August 18, 2022, as part of the city's response to longstanding water system problems. Rogelio V. Solis/AP\n\n“Everyone is turning around because there is nothing here,” Page said, adding that his next plan of action was to drive to another site in hopes that he could find cases of water there.\n\nBecause of Monday’s failure, officials announced all Jackson public schools will shift to virtual learning Tuesday.\n\nHospitals are also feeling the strain. Jackson’s University of Mississippi Medical Center released a statement Tuesday saying the Jackson Medical Mall air conditioning is not functioning properly “because the water pressure feeding its chillers is too low.” Portable restrooms are being used in locations experiencing low water pressure, the statement said.\n\nThe university medical center statement also said a fire watch was declared for its Jackson-based facilities, “because fire suppression systems are fed by the city water system. Low pressure in the systems may cause them to be less effective.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden has been briefed on the water crisis in Jackson and the White House has been “in regular contact with state and local officials, including Mayor Lumumba, and made clear that the Federal Government stands ready to offer assistance,” press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“(The Federal Emergency Management Agency) is working closely with the state officials to identify needs, and the EPA is coordinating with industry partners to expedite delivery of critical treatment equipment for emergency repairs at the City of Jackson water treatment facilities,” she said.\n\nIn an emailed statement Tuesday, the Environmental Protection Agency said “ensuring all people have access to healthy and safe water is a top priority.”\n\n“We are in communication with officials in Mississippi and stand ready to provide support should the State request federal assistance,” the EPA statement read. “In the interim, we are available to provide technical support and information to Mississippi officials as they navigate their plan to address the immediate concerns at the O.B. Curtis Water Plant.”\n\nLater Tuesday, the governor said FEMA has received the state’s declaration asking the federal government to declare the water shortage a federal emergency.\n\nWater system issues go back decades, mayor says\n\nThe problem this week stems from one of two water treatment facilities in the city: the O.B. Curtis plant, which is run by the city of Jackson, according to the governor.\n\nThe main pumps at O.B. Curtis were severely damaged recently, and the facility began operating on smaller backup pumps about a month ago, around the time the latest boil water notice began in July, the governor said, without elaborating about the damage.\n\nThe governor said he was told Friday that “it was a near-certainty that Jackson would fail to produce running water sometime in the next several weeks or months if something did not materially improve,” the governor said.\n\nThe O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant in Jackson, Mississippi, seen on March 24, 2022. Mark Felix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBut Lumumba said during a Monday news conference that it was only a matter time before the water system failed because Jackson’s water system has been faced serious issues for years.\n\n“I have said on multiple occasions that it’s not a matter of ‘if’ our system would fail, but a matter of ‘when’ our system would fail,” the mayor said, adding that the city has been “going at it alone for the better part of two years” when it comes to the water crisis.\n\nIn early 2020, the water system failed an Environmental Protection Agency inspection. The agency wrote the drinking water had the potential to be host to harmful bacteria or parasites, based on observations of the water’s turbidity, or cloudiness, as well as “disinfection treatment concerns, and/or the condition of the distribution system.”\n\nIn March 2020, the EPA issued an order requiring the city to develop a plan to replace and repair monitoring and treatment equipment, to “address dosing processes for disinfection and pH control” and to take more coliform bacteria samples, among other things.\n\nThe city also has endured weather-related shutdowns.\n\nIn February 2021, a winter storm shut down Jackson’s entire water system, leaving tens of thousands of residents without water for a month amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Residents have been under some sort of boil water notice or advisory several times since that storm, including the state-ordered notice posted in July.\n\n“We were here two Februarys ago when we had system failures, and the world was watching us and the world is watching us again,” Lumumba said during Monday’s news conference.\n\nThe mayor also pointed to recent flooding from the Pearl River as an event that triggered the latest water pressure issues.\n\nBecause O.B. Curtis received additional water from the reservoir during the flooding from last week to this week, the facility had to change the way it treats the water, which has led to the reduction of water being put out into the system and reduced tank levels. This is affecting the water pressure at residents’ homes, he said.\n\n“As one crisis may be diverted, another one rears its head,” Lumumba said Monday during a news conference after addressing the flooding in the city.\n\nO.B. Curtis is meant to provide about 50 million gallons for the city daily. The other plant, which usually provides about 20 million gallons daily, has been approved to ramp up its output amid the shortage, authorities said.\n\nIn July 2021, the EPA and the city entered into an agreement to address “long-term challenges and make needed improvements to the drinking water system.” The EPA recently announced $74.9 million in federal water and sewer infrastructure funds for Mississippi, mentioning Jackson without naming specific projects.\n\nHowever, Lumumba has said it would take $2 billion to fully repair and replace the dated system, which city, state and federal officials say also has too much lead in its water in some places.\n\nLumumba declared a water system emergency Monday. The proclamation noted not only the flooding but also numerous previous “unsuccessful attempts to rectify water system issues.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback CNN meteorologist explains cause of water crisis in Jackson, Mississippi 02:27 - Source: CNN\n\nAs for restoring water pressure and flow and performing emergency maintenance and repairs, the state would split the cost with the city, Reeves said Tuesday.\n\n“We will cash flow the operation, and the city will be responsible for half the cost of the emergency improvements that we make,” the governor said in a statement released on Twitter.\n\nAt a Tuesday news conference at the plant, Reeves said he is “encouraged” and at the same time “discouraged” by some of the news coming out of the facility.\n\n“We do have a plan in place to potentially bring in an additional rented pump that will allow us to put at least 4 million gallons of water additionally, hopefully, which will be installed by tomorrow morning. That is progress and will help,” he said.\n\nReeves added there is no time frame as of now for safe drinking water, but that over the next 24 to 36 hours residents will see significant truckloads of clean water start to be delivered to Jackson.\n\nOver the next few days, more than 108 semi-trucks of water are coming into Jackson and seven mega distribution sites will have 36 truckloads of water a day for the public to be able to retrieve, according to Lt. Col. Stephen McCraney, the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency director.\n\nSystemic issues also contributed to water crisis\n\nLumumba previously told CNN a lack of political will and years of neglect on a national level has prevented Jackson from getting the help it needs to fix its water and sewer crisis. Besides the infrastructure issues, the plant has also been faced with staffing issues, according to the mayor and governor.\n\n“A far too small number of heroic frontline workers were trying their hardest to hold the system together, but that it was a near impossibility,” the governor said Monday.\n\nJackson’s ongoing water system problems already had some residents reporting low to no water pressure and raw sewage flowing in city streets and neighborhoods before this month.\n\nNow, some residents are taking to Twitter – where #jxnwatercrisis and #jacksonwatercrisis were trending – to post pictures of buckets and even tubs full of brown water coming out of their drains.\n\nSome on social media also pointed to systemic and environmental racism as among the causes of the city’s ongoing water issues and lack of resources, given that 82.5% of Jackson’s population identifies as Black or African American, according to census data, while the state’s legislature is majority White.\n\nNAACP president Derrick Johnson called out the Mississippi governor on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n”.@tatereeves, what are you waiting for!? We demand on behalf of the Jackson communities that you request federal aid from @FEMA and other agencies to ensure people have access to a basic human right: WATER,” Johnson’s tweet read. “Make the damn call. This is personal.”\n\nJackson has undergone drastic changes in the past half century. Its economic decline has occurred rapidly over the past two decades, fueled by population decline and demographic shifts.\n\nThe city’s population shrank from almost 200,000 in 1990 to about 160,000 in 2020. Its decline in population in these three decades was driven almost entirely by White flight. The city was 56% Black in 1990. By 2020, 82% of the city’s residents were Black.", "authors": ["Amir Vera Jason Hanna Nouran Salahieh", "Amir Vera", "Jason Hanna", "Nouran Salahieh"], "publish_date": "2022/08/30"}]}

Awards ignored the best movies", "text": "I’d be remiss to say the Oscars aren’t out of touch, most award shows are. Despite that, this year's Oscars got a couple things right.\n\nThe show had a joyous start with Da’Vine Joy Randolph winning best supporting actress for her painfully beautiful portrayal of Mary in \"The Holdovers.\" \"Poor Things\" swept the visual categories. \"Oppenheimer\" won seven awards, including Cillian Murphy winning best actor. \"Anatomy of a Fall,\" a brilliant film that more people should watch, deservedly won best original screenplay.\n\nDespite these satisfying wins (justice for Lily Gladstone), my mind was constantly thinking about the films and actors unrecognized. I remember the day nominations came and many were upset that \"Barbie,\" despite receiving eight nominations, was not nominated for best actress or director. There was a bounty of articles and essays articulating that disappointment, and I’m sure we’re in for even more after \"Barbie\" lost all but one Oscar Sunday night (congrats, Billie Eilish).\n\nHowever, the outrage was somewhat lost on me. I enjoyed \"Barbie\" well enough. I definitely think Greta Gerwig should have been nominated for best director, but the overwhelming outcry about the snubs seemed a tad disproportionate.\n\nSomehow \"Barbie\" only getting eight nominations was a loss to feminism even though other films like \"Anatomy of a Fall\" – which arguably offers a more nuanced portrayal of womanhood – received many nominations. It seemed to me like those who felt most maligned simply hadn’t watched any other films.\n\nOscars got it right:'20 Days in Mariupol,' 'The Zone of Interest' wins show the academy is listening\n\nThe best films and performances the Oscars didn't award\n\nIn fact, there were many movies and performances that were tragically overlooked at Sunday night’s ceremony and awards season as a whole.\n\n\"May December\" is based on the true story that took over popular culture in the 1990s of a middle school teacher pursuing a relationship with her student. The film stars Julianne Moore, Natalie Portman and Charles Melton. That trio gave some of the best acting performances of 2023, yet the cast did not receive a single nomination. The only nomination the film did receive was for best original screenplay, which it lost to \"Anatomy of a Fall.\" It’s certainly not lost on me, however, that a film satirizing Hollywood exploitation wasn’t received warmly by Hollywood.\n\nI watched Oscar best picture nominees.'Oppenheimer' will win, but here's what should.\n\n\"Past Lives,\" a film that chronicles two childhood lovers who reconnect after 20 years, received two nominations for best original screenplay and best picture, unfortunately losing both. What struck me was that for a film that is so atmospheric yet character-driven, it received no acting nominations.\n\nMany on film twitter voiced their disappointment with Greta Lee, who plays one half of the long lost lovers, Nora, not receiving a nomination for best actress. Teo Yoo, who plays Hae Sung, deserves to be part of the conversation as well. Yoo brings Hae Sung to life with such care. He portrays him with a subtly heartbreaking arrested development that’s borne out of the love he lost to Nora at such a young age. His performance is quiet, nuanced and empathetic – and it’s almost criminal that he was left out of the awards conversation.\n\nOscar nods honor 'Oppenheimer,'but what about Americans still suffering from nuke tests?\n\nThe best films and actors the Oscars didn't even nominate\n\nA.V. Rockwell’s incredible feature directorial debut, \"A Thousand and One,\" tells the story of a mother, Inez, who takes her son, Terry, from foster care to raise him in Harlem, where she grew up. The heartbreak of the film unfolds quietly as the audience are mere observers to the cyclical nature of poverty and the crime it breeds.\n\nAmon Warmann from \"Empire\" perfectly articulates the gravitas of Teyana Taylor’s performance as Inez: “At almost every turn she unveils new capabilities, playing all of Inez’s varied notes without sanding off her raw edges. It’s an eye-opening performance that should have us all excited about her future onscreen work.”\n\nThe film received zero nominations.\n\nAndrew Scott in \"All of Us Strangers\" was another performance tragically ignored by the Oscars. The film follows Adam, played by Scott, as he is pulled back into his childhood home and attempts to reconcile his identity and trauma with the ghosts of his late parents. He finds solace in Harry, played handsomely by Paul Mescal. It’s almost a miracle they found each other given their isolation.\n\nRelationships like that are like an oasis in a desert of sand. The film examines love, loss and the pain therein, and the ambiguous shades of gray in which life often paints.\n\nThe list goes on: \"The Iron Claw,\" Ava DuVernay’s \"Origin\" and \"Anatomy of a Fall\" actor Milo Machado-Graner, who gave one of the best performances last year (too bad the academy hates children). Many of the best films and most riveting performances were overlooked by the Oscars.\n\nNevertheless, I understand not everything can be awarded – snubs are bound to happen. It’s just how it is. But the film enjoyer in me, selfishly or otherwise, wants everyone to take home at least a nugget of Oscar gold.\n\nKofi Mframa is a music and culture writer and opinion intern at the Louisville Courier-Journal.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2023/03/12/oscars-2023-live-updates-winners/11430002002/", "title": "Oscars 2023: 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' wins best picture", "text": "Everything was all right Sunday at the 95th Academy Awards, where no one got slapped and \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" ruled the night.\n\nThe acclaimed sci-fi comedy came in as a frontrunner at the Oscars and cleaned up like a powerhouse, winning seven honors including best picture, best actress (Michelle Yeoh), supporting actress (Jamie Lee Curtis), supporting actor (Ke Huy Quan), directing and original screenplay. And the good vibes continued in the best actor category, where Brendan Fraser completed a great awards-season comeback story and won for \"The Whale.\"\n\nHere are all the winners and highlights from the main Oscar ceremony, hosted by Jimmy Kimmel:\n\nOscars winners:See who took home gold at Academy Awards\n\nWho made Oscars history in 2023? See the many 'firsts' from Michelle Yeoh, 'Naatu Naatu,' more\n\n'Everything Everywhere All at Once' wins the Oscars' top prize, best picture\n\n\"We've said enough tonight. You inspire me,\" says director Daniel Kwan, accepting best picture for \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\"\n\nMichelle Yeoh takes best actress for 'Everything Everywhere'\n\nThe longtime action-movie icon finally gets her Oscar and becomes the first Asian woman to win the category. \"For all the little boys and girls who look like me watching tonight, let this be a beacon of hope and possibilities. This is proof dreams come true. And ladies, don't let anyone ever tell you you are past your prime,\" Michelle Yeoh says, winning best actress for \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\" She dedicates the win to her 84-year-old mom and promised to bring Oscar \"home to you and my extended family in Hong Kong where I started in my career. Thank you to the Academy, this is history in the making.\"\n\n'A beacon of hope and possibilities':Michelle Yeoh wins best actress, making Oscars history\n\n'The Whale' comeback kid Brendan Fraser wins best actor\n\nBrendan Fraser shakes fellow nominee Colin Farrell's hand before accepting the best actor honor for \"The Whale.\" \"So this is what the multiverse looks like!\" Fraser says, out of breath with excitement. \"I just want to say thank you for this acknowledgement. It's like I've been on a diving expedition,\" he adds, shouting out his kids and director Darren Aronofsky for \"throwing me a creative lifeline.\"\n\nBrendan Fraser:'The Whale' star wins best actor Academy Award and proves nice guys can finish first\n\n'Everything Everywhere' snags Oscars for film editing, directing\n\n\"This is too much. This is my second film, y'all. This is crazy,\" Paul Rogers says, accepting the Oscar for best film editing for \"Everything Everywhere All at Once.\" Then the best picture frontrunner runs its tally to five awards when Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert take best directing. \"Our fellow nominees, you guys are our heroes, This is weird,\" Scheinert says. He thanks all the \"mommies\" in the house and his parents \"for not squashing my creativity when I was making really disturbing horror films or really perverted comedy films, or dressing in drag as a kid, which is a threat to nobody\" – a shot seemingly at anti-drag legislation popping up around the country.:\n\nAdds Kwan: \"There is greatness in every single person. You have a genius in you that is waiting to be unlocked.\"\n\n'Top Gun' takes best sound, 'RRR' gets original song Oscar for 'Naatu Naatu'\n\nSomewhere, Tom Cruise is smiling. \"Top Gun: Maverick\" finally wins an Oscar, for best sound. And the Academy Award for best original song goes to \"RRR\" dance number \"Naatu Naatu.\" \"I grew up listening to The Carpenters and here I am with the Oscars,\" says composer M.M. Keeravani, doing his own spin on The Carpenters' \"Top of the World.\" John Travolta comes out and chokes up when introducing Lenny Kravitz, who sings \"Calling All Angels\" during the \"In Memoriam\" segment (which includes Travolta's \"Grease\" co-star Olivia Newton-John).\n\nBrutally honest rankings:All the Oscars song performances, from ‘Naatu Naatu’ to Lady Gaga\n\n'Everything Everywhere,' 'Women Talking' win screenplay Oscars\n\n\"Everything Everywhere\" filmmaker Daniel Scheinert thanks his teachers for helping him be \"less of a butthead\" when accepting the original screenplay Oscar alongside partner Daniel Kwan, who admits \"my imposter syndrome is at an all-time high.\" And when accepting the adapted screenplay honor, \"Women Talking\" director Sarah Polley slyly shouts out the Academy for \"not being offended by the words 'Women' and 'Talking' so close together.\"\n\n'Black Panther: Wakanda Forever' presents Chadwick Boseman tribute, Rihanna number\n\n\"Wakanda Forever\" star Danai Gurira arrives on stage to pay tribute to late \"Black Panther\" actor Chadwick Boseman, saying in Wakandan: \"Thank you, king.\" Gurira then introduces Rihanna, who sings her nominated tune \"Lift Me Up\" and receives a standing ovation.\n\n'Lift Me Up':Rihanna soars at 2023 Oscars with powerful first performance of song\n\n'Avatar: The Way of Water' gets the gold for visual effects\n\nElizabeth Banks and the Cocaine Bear come out to present the award for visual effects. The Oscar goes to \"Avatar: The Way of Water,\" which makes sense because the Na'vi main characters are all digital. Afterward, Jimmy Kimmel is ready with an A-plus dad joke: \"The afterparty is at CGI Friday's.\"\n\n'All Quiet on the Western Front' wins two more technical honors\n\nThe Netflix war movie is starting to gain some momentum, as \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" runs over the likes of \"Babylon,\" \"The Fabelmans\" and other Oscar favorites for best production design and score.\n\nLady Gaga sings a raw, rousing version of 'Top Gun' song 'Hold My Hand'\n\n\"It's deeply personal for me and we all need a lot of love to walk through this life. And we all need a hero sometimes. You might find that you can be your own hero, even if you feel broken inside,\" Lady Gaga says before performing her nominated song \"Hold My Hand\" (from \"Top Gun: Maverick\") with stripped-down piano, guitar, bass and drums.\n\nOscars best-dressed:Jaw-dropping looks from Lady Gaga, Michelle Yeoh, Angela Bassett\n\n'Elephant Whisperers' and 'The Boy, the Mole' conquer shorts categories\n\n\"The Elephant Whisperers,\" about an Indian couple that cares for an orphaned baby elephant, wins for best documentary short. And animated short goes to \"The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse,\" based on Charlie Mackesy's book.\n\n'All Quiet on the Western Front' wins best international film\n\nThis isn't a surprise: After ruling the BAFTAs (and with Indian action epic \"RRR\" not in its category), \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" takes the international film Oscar, its second honor of the night. \"This means so much to us,\" says director Edward Berger. He also thanks star Felix Kammerer: \"Without you, none of us would be here.\"\n\n'Wakanda Forever' nabs costume design honor\n\n\"Nice to see you again,\" Ruth Carter says, winning costume design for \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" – the same honor she took home for 2018's original \"Panther.\" The first Black woman to win two Oscars, Carter dedicates the award to her mom, who recently died at age 101, and thanks director Ryan Coogler and producer Nate Moore: \"We are reshaping how culture is represented.\" if that wasn't exciting enough, the original song performance of \"RRR\" tune \"Naatu Naatu\" delivers a ton of rousing dance moves that get the Oscar crowd going.\n\nBrendan Fraser's 'The Whale' wins for best makeup and hairstyling\n\nDigital and physical prosthetics were used to transform Brendan Fraser into the 600-pound main character of \"The Whale,\" and it pays off with an Oscar for makeup. Fraser is one of the first to get on his feet and excitedly cheer the win.\n\nBest cinematography Oscar goes to 'All Quiet on the Western Front'\n\nNetflix's acclaimed German war drama earns its first technical honor of the night. \"My fellow nominees, your work is just outstanding and inspiring,\" says James Friend, who wins best cinematography for \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\" Donnie Yen arrives on stage afterward to introduce the next original song nominee: \"Everything Everywhere\" star Stephanie Hsu, Son Lux and David Byrne doing a weird, ethereal performance of \"This Is a Life.\"\n\n'Navalny' is named best documentary\n\nDirector Daniel Roher's film about Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny wins the Oscar for best documentary. \"We must not be afraid to oppose dictators,\" says Roher, while Navalny's wife Yulia addresses her husband, currently being held in solitary confinement in Russia: \"I'm dreaming of the day you will be free and our country will be free.\" And the award for live-action short goes to \"The Irish Goodbye.\"\n\nJamie Lee Curtis wins her first Oscar, for supporting actress in 'Everything Everywhere'\n\n\"Woo-hoo,\" Jamie Lee Curtis exclaims, hugging Ariana DeBose and taking her supporting actress trophy for \"Everything Everywhere.\" \"I know it looks like I'm standing up here by myself but I am hundreds of people,\" Curtis says, shouting out her directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, \"my bae\" Michelle Yeoh, all her horror folks and her late Hollywood parents, Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh. \"We all just won an Oscar together.\" She leaves the stage and then Sofia Carson and Diane Warren arrive with a choir to perform their original song nominee, \"Applause\" from \"Tell It Like a Woman.\"\n\nJamie Lee Curtis:First-time winner thanks castmates, late parents in touching Oscars speech\n\nKe Huy Quan takes best supporting actor for 'Everything Everywhere'\n\nAfter hugging co-star Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan goes to the stage to take his supporting actor trophy for \"Everything Everywhere\" and immediately starts crying. \"My mom is 84 years old and she's at home watching. Mom, I just won an Oscar!\" he says through tears. He tells how his journey started on a boat, involved spending a year in a refugee camp and \"somehow ended up on the Oscar stage. This is the American dream.\" He concludes by saying that \"dreams are something you have to believe in. I almost gave up on mine. Everyone out there, keep your dreams alive.\"\n\n'This is the American dream':Read Ke Huy Quan's emotional Oscars acceptance speech\n\nGuillermo del Toro's 'Pinocchio' wins best animated feature\n\nEmily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson arrive on stage to give out the first award of the night: best animated feature. And the winner is ... director Guillermo del Toro's Netflix stop-motion feature \"Pinocchio\"! \"Animation is cinema, animation is not a genre. Animation is ready to be taken to the next step. Please help us keep animation in the conversation,\" del Toro says, tearing up when thanking his parents. According to Netflix, del Toro becomes the first person to win best picture, best director and best animated feature Oscars.\n\n2023 Oscars:Why Cate Blanchett, Guillermo del Toro and more celebs wore blue ribbons\n\nJimmy Kimmel gets the 'Top Gun' treatment to begin the show\n\nJimmy Kimmel starts the show by being \"ejected\" out of a fighter jet by Tom Cruise and parachutes onto the Dolby Theatre stage. \"Give me a second to adjust my Danger Zone here. My Banshees are caught in my Inisherin,\" he jokes. Kimmel shouts out audiences returning to the theater to see movies and is also glad to see Nicole Kidman out of that \"abandoned AMC, where she has been held captive for two whole years now.\"\n\nThe host points out first-time nominees Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan, as well as Brendan Fraser: \"Two guys from 'Encino Man' are nominated for Oscar.\" Kimmel calls Steven Spielberg and Seth Rogen \"the Joe and Hunter Biden of Hollywood\" and can't believe Spielberg was sober doing \"E.T.\" \"You were high as a bike when you made that movie,\" Kimmel cracks. He also gives props to John Williams being a nominee at 91 – \"He's still scoring – if you know what I mean\" – and mentions the absence of Cruise and James Cameron: \"Two guys who insisted we go to the theater didn't come to the theater.\"\n\nJimmy Kimmel:Angry actors would have to 'battle' Michelle Yeoh to slap him at Oscars\n\nFor Angela Bassett, the Oscars are all about 'the spirit of never giving up'\n\nSupporting actress contender Angela Bassett, the first actor from a Marvel superhero movie to garner a nod, told USA TODAY that her husband Courtney B. Vance has been an essential support system this Oscar season, accompanying her to awards shows and filming her acceptance speeches on his smartphone. \"He was supportive before the whirlwind,\" says the \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" star. \"He always trusted and believed that a nomination like this might one day happen for me.\"\n\nIn addition to being the subject of Ariana DeBose's viral rap, Bassett has loved going through the awards process with her fellow thespians: \"When I think of my girl Michelle Yeoh and it being her first nomination, it really is about the spirit of never giving up.\"\n\nA Brendan Fraser win would complete an epic Oscar comeback story\n\nThe best actor race seems to be down to Austin Butler, Colin Farrell and Brendan Fraser, though a win by the latter would finish one of this year's most noteworthy comebacks. After becoming a major Hollywood star in the 1990s, Fraser has been honest about his career hardships, including being sexually assaulted, and won accolades for his role in \"The Whale.\"\n\nIn an emotional Screen Actor Guild speech, Fraser shouted out to other actors who've weathered struggles: \"I know how you feel. But believe me, if you just stay in there and you put one foot in front of the other, you'll get to where you need to go.\"\n\nThe new Oscar best picture winner will join Hollywood's most hallowed hall\n\n\"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" is in the pole position to win best picture over \"The Banshees of Inisherin,\" \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" \"All Quiet on the Western Front,\" \"The Fabelmans\" and \"Elvis,\" among others.\n\nThe victor will join a long list filled with some of the greatest movies ever (and a few that don't quite fit that bill). We watched all 94 so far and ranked them, from the first winner – the 1927 silent war drama \"Wings,\" which holds up well! – to the feel-good 2022 Oscar champ \"CODA.\"\n\nGet a video tour of the ultra-exclusive green room at the Oscars\n\nUSA TODAY's Ralphie Aversa has been in LA all week for events leading up to the Academy Awards, and one of them was getting a look at the ultra-exclusive, swanky green room backstage at the Oscars. He was able to do a fun video tour for our readers but come Sunday night at the Dolby Theatre, no cameras will be allowed in – only performers, presenters and winners will be able to enjoy the comfy furniture, floral arrangements and food by celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck.\n\nMichelle Yeoh, Colin Farrell could be first-time Academy Award winners\n\nSixteen of the 20 acting contenders at Sunday's Oscars are first-time , including \"Everything Everywhere\" favorites Michelle Yeoh, Ke Huy Quan and Jamie Lee Curtis, as well as best actor candidates Brendan Fraser, Colin Farrell and Austin Butler. The four returnees: Two-time winner Cate Blanchett (\"Tár\"), Angela Bassett (\"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\"), Michelle Williams (\"The Fabelmans\") and Judd Hirsch (\"The Fabelmans\"), who last received an Oscar nod for 1980's \"Ordinary People.\"\n\nBut the list of thespians who've never won an Academy Award is a pretty star-studded affair overall, including Scarlett Johansson, Antonio Banderas, Glenn Close, Willem Dafoe, Amy Adams, Tom Cruise and Robert Downey Jr.\n\nSupporting actor is Ke Huy Quan's to lose\n\n\"Everything Everywhere\" star Ke Huy Quan has dominated the competition and rolled through awards season. But his quest for a supporting actor victory has also been a Cinderella story for the actor, who was a child star in the 1980s with roles in \"The Goonies\" and \"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\" and then stepped away from Hollywood because of a lack of meaty roles for Asian actors.\n\n\"I'm grateful the landscape has changed, there’s a lot more progress now,\" Quan said backstage after winning at the Golden Globes. He's also made sure to have a bunch of fun heading to Oscar night, posting tons of selfies with peers on his Instagram account.\n\nBest supporting actress is a toss-up\n\nAs far as Oscar predictions go, most of the acting categories are fairly straightforward with a favorite moving out in front. Not so much with supporting actress, which can go a few different ways. \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\" star Angela Bassett – the first actor to be nominated for a Marvel movie – had the early momentum with wins out of the Golden Globes and Critics Choice, but Jamie Lee Curtis of \"Everything Everywhere\" took an important Screen Actors Guild honor while \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" actress Kerry Condon picked up the supporting trophy at the British Academy Film Awards.\n\nGiven SAG and the \"Everything\" goodwill, Curtis probably has the best chance over Bassett, though it's possible the two beloved Hollywood types cancel each other out and Condon sneaks by for a victory.\n\nGood news: Lady Gaga will be performing 'Hold My Hand' after all!\n\nA bevy of original song contenders are slated for prime-time performances. Rihanna will sing \"Lift Me Up\" from \"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever,\" Sofia Carson and songwriter Diane Warren are slated to perform \"Applause\" from \"Tell It Like A Woman,\" Talking Heads frontman David Byrne teams with \"Everything Everywhere All at Once\" supporting actress nominee Stephanie Hsu and music trio Son Lux for “This Is A Life,\" and Indian singers Rahul Sipligunj and Kaala Bhairava will perform the \"RRR\" song-and-dance number – and the frontrunner in the category – \"Naatu Naatu.\"\n\nAnd while Oscar producers previously said she wouldn't perform, Lady Gaga is now slated to sing “Hold My Hand” from \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" a person familiar with the production but not authorized to speak publicly told USA TODAY. (Fun fact: Gaga is shooting \"Joker: Folie à Deux\" with Joaquin Phoenix, who won best actor for the first \"Joker\" movie.)\n\nGlenn Close tests positive for COVID-19, won't be among Oscar presenters\n\nGlenn Close was expected to be among the dozens of A-list stars on tap to hand out trophies and appear on the telecast Sunday but has tested positive for COVID-19. A representative for the actress told The Associated Press she is isolating and resting.\n\nAriana DeBose, Troy Kotsur, Halle Berry, Nicole Kidman and Jessica Chastain are among the previous Oscar winners scheduled to be presenters. Also on the list is a raft of other high-profile names like Samuel L. Jackson, Dwayne Johnson, Melissa McCarthy, Janelle Monáe, Zoe Saldaña and Harrison Ford.\n\nJust don't expect an appearance from Will Smith. Smith, who won best actor last year for \"King Richard\" and would traditionally present the award for best actress this year, was banned from Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences events for 10 years after he slapped Oscar presenter Chris Rock for making a joke about Smith’s wife, Jada Pinkett Smith.\n\nRed carpet coverage is coming for the fashionistas\n\nAll the big stars will be hitting the \"champagne carpet\" and wearing their Sunday best. E!'s \"Live From the Red Carpet\" kicks off at 5 p.m. EDT/2 p.m. PDT while ABC starts its pre-show coverage at 6:30 EDT/3:30 PDT.

It's more whether director Christopher Nolan will need a little red wagon or a Brinks truck to carry home all the golden treasures.\n\nWith a leading 13 nominations, Nolan's atomic bomb thriller rolls into the 96th Oscars ceremony (airing live on ABC, 7 p.m. EDT/4 PDT) as a heavy favorite to pick up some serious hardware, from below-the-line categories to the big-deal races like best actor, supporting actor and picture. At least best actress could be interesting, with previous winner Emma Stone (\"Poor Things\") vs. newcomer Lily Gladstone (\"Killers of the Flower Moon\") for all the marbles.\n\nWhile we root for enough chaos to keep the night interesting, here are our predictions for all the major categories:\n\nBest picture\n\n\"American Fiction\"\n\n\"Anatomy of a Fall\"\n\n\"Barbie\"\n\n\"The Holdovers\"\n\n\"Killers of the Flower Moon\"\n\n\"Maestro\"\n\n\"Oppenheimer\"\n\n\"Past Lives\"\n\n\"Poor Things\"\n\n\"The Zone of Interest\"\n\nWill win: \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nShould win: \"Barbie\"\n\n\"Oppenheimer\" digs into America's past but it also has awards-season history on its side: Nolan's film won top prizes from the directors, producers and actors guilds, and only one movie, 1995's \"Apollo 13,\" has taken those and not also won best picture. So barring one of the biggest Oscar upsets ever, \"Oppy\" has this in the bag − although the Oscars' preferential ballot, where voters rank their top choices, at least presents the possibility for a surprise. And if \"Barbie\" has a chance, we're going for it, because while \"Oppenheimer\" is definitely a filmmaking feat, Greta Gerwig's fun, pink-washed phenomenon feels more of our time with its gender dynamics and existential themes.\n\nBest actress\n\nAnnette Bening, \"Nyad\"\n\nLily Gladstone, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\"\n\nSandra Hüller, \"Anatomy of a Fall\"\n\nCarey Mulligan, \"Maestro\"\n\nEmma Stone, \"Poor Things\"\n\nWill win: Gladstone\n\nShould win: Hüller\n\nQuality wins by Stone and Gladstone throughout this awards season have made this somewhat of a toss-up: Both snagged Golden Globes, Stone was victorious at Critics Choice and BAFTA (where Gladstone wasn't in the race), but Gladstone has the Oscar edge, given her recent Screen Actors Guild trophy. (The Oscar winner has differed from the SAG victor only three times in the past 13 years.) Both are terrific, though instead of zigging, let's secretly hope for a big zag because Hüller powers every scene of courtroom drama \"Anatomy of a Fall\" with mystery and magnetism.\n\nBest actor\n\nBradley Cooper, \"Maestro\"\n\nColman Domingo, \"Rustin\"\n\nPaul Giamatti, \"The Holdovers\"\n\nCillian Murphy, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nJeffrey Wright, \"American Fiction\"\n\nWill win: Murphy\n\nShould win: Wright\n\nAs the intriguing man behind the bomb, Murphy has rolled through Oscar season and there's no stopping him now, between a searingly great, complex performance and heavy-duty \"Oppenheimer\" momentum. Fellow first-timer Wright will no doubt be back in the hunt at some point, but his \"Fiction\" role just suits everything he does well. As a fiery academic dealing with unsuspecting success, Wright out-curmudgeons the mighty Giamatti, gives an irascible grump a big heart, and, as one of our great character actors, makes the most of his spotlight.\n\nBest supporting actress\n\nEmily Blunt, \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nDanielle Brooks, \"The Color Purple\"\n\nAmerica Ferrera, \"Barbie\"\n\nJodie Foster, \"Nyad\"\n\nDa'Vine Joy Randolph, \"The Holdovers\"\n\nWill win/should win: Randolph\n\nRandolph has run the table toward the Oscars, and she'll be grabbing the glory on Sunday night too. As well she should for such a stunning turn. Following appearances in \"Dolemite Is My Name\" and \"The United States vs. Billie Holiday,\" Randolph is both entertaining and heartbreaking as Mary Lamb. She's the tough-love head cook of a boarding school who forms a mini-family with a crusty professor (Giamatti) and rebellious student (Dominic Sessa) while also navigating the absolute grief of the first Christmas without her beloved son.\n\nBest supporting actor\n\nSterling K. Brown, \"American Fiction\"\n\nRobert De Niro, \"Killers of the Flower Moon\"\n\nRobert Downey Jr., \"Oppenheimer\"\n\nRyan Gosling, \"Barbie\"\n\nMark Ruffalo, \"Poor Things\"\n\nWill win/should win: Downey\n\nHe's had box-office success, and his share of ups and downs, but Downey doesn't have an Oscar. That changes Sunday, when he'll clean up at one last awards show and (hopefully) say something interesting with a live mic. He's deserving from a career \"attaboy\" sense but also from the fact that, after playing a superhero for more than a decade, Downey proved he's great at being an antagonist. As Lewis Strauss, he puts Murphy's J.

The film has won virtually every major film award since Affleck was snubbed for a best-director nomination when the Oscars nominees were announced Jan. 10.\n\nBackstage at the Directors Guild honors Saturday, Affleck said he didn't take the snub from the academy personally.\n\n\"I'm thrilled and honored that the academy nominated me as a producer of the movie,\" Affleck said. \"I know our movie, we're a little bit underdog and a little bit the little engine that could, and you take me out of it maybe helps. … It's just about that picture. I feel like it's OK, I'm really lucky, I'm in a good place.\"\n\nOddsmakers were less charitable to the academy.\n\n\"The Oscar race is turning into a classic Hollywood revenge drama,\" says Tom O'Neill, author of Movie Awards and chief forecaster for awards site Goldderby.com.\n\nHe says Saturday's win proves \"what fools Oscar voters were to snub him in the best-director category. How can a movie possibly be the greatest film of the year if it doesn't have great direction? Go ahead, Oscar voters, explain that to your grandkids, who'll try to make sense of this derby someday.\"\n\nHe says that Argo \"now looks like a good bet to win best picture at the Oscars.\"\n\nBut he notes: In 1996, Apollo 13 won top honors from the Directors Guild, Producers Guild and Screen Actors Guild, only to lose to Braveheart for best picture.\n\n\"Things don't always go according to script in Hollywood,\" he says. \"Especially at the Oscars.\"\n\nAffleck's Oscar snub may have earned him some favor among awards voters as an underdog favorite. And Affleck's modest acceptance speeches have helped win fans.\n\n\"I don't think that this makes me a real director, but I think it means I'm on my way,\" says Affleck, who won for just his third film behind the camera.\n\nThe Directors Guild honors continued Hollywood's strange awards season. The guild's prize for best director typically is a final blessing for the film that goes on to win best picture and director at the Oscars.\n\nArgo is up for seven Oscars, including best picture and best supporting actor for Alan Arkin.\n\nWith 12 Oscar nominations, Steven Spielberg's Civil War saga Lincoln initially looked like the Oscar favorite over such other films including Les Miserables and Zero Dark Thirty. Only three films have won best picture without being nominated for best director in 84 years, most recently 1989's best-picture champ Driving Miss Daisy, which failed to earn a directing nomination for Bruce Beresford.\n\nMany of the same film professionals who vote in guild awards also cast ballots for the Oscars, so the early wins for Argo are a strong sign that the film has the inside track for best picture.\n\nMalik Bendjelloul won the guild's documentary award for Searching for Sugar Man, his study of the fate of critically acclaimed but obscure 1970s singer-songwriter Rodriquez. The film also is nominated for best documentary at the Oscars.\n\nJay Roach won the guild trophy for TV movies and miniseries for Game Change, his drama starring Julianne Moore as Sarah Palin in her 2008 vice-presidential run.\n\nRoach said that he watched John McCain rush to choose Palin as his running mate, potentially putting her second in line for the presidency.\n\n\"I said, 'We gotta talk about this,' \" Roach joked.\n\nOn the television front, Rian Johnson won the drama series award for an episode of Breaking Bad, while Lena Dunham took the trophy for directing the pilot to her HBO series Girls.\n\nAmong other TV winners:\n\n— Reality program: Brian Smith, Master Chef.\n\n— Musical variety: Glenn Weiss, The 66th Annual Tony Awards.\n\n— Daytime serial: Jill Mitwell, One Life to Live.\n\n— Children's program: Paul Hoen, Let It Shine.\n\nDespite his snub as best director, Affleck can still walk home with an Oscar. Best picture trophies go to a film's producers, and he produced the movie with pals George Clooney and Grant Heslov.\n\nIt would be his second statuette. He and Matt Damon jump-started their careers with 1997's Good Will Hunting, for which they shared a screenplay Oscar.\n\n(Contributing: The Associated Press)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/02/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2016/02/28/oscars-academy-awards-news/81075110/", "title": "DiCaprio wins but 'Spotlight' takes top prize at Oscars", "text": "Brian Truitt\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nIt was Leonardo DiCaprio's night in the Oscar spotlight, but it was Spotlight that took the big prize Sunday night at the 88th annual Academy Awards.\n\nThe journalism drama, which followed the award-winning Boston Globe team that investigated child sexual abuse by Catholic priests, was named best picture and best original screenplay on Sunday.

But I've found it also includes anyone who spent some formative years here. Mark Cuban went to IU, and I've heard Indiana fans claim him as a Hoosier. Abraham Lincoln spent his boyhood in the state, and you better believe he was a Hoosier.\n\nBasically, if you've lived in the state and we want to claim you, we will. And with those broad parameters in mind, Hoosiers are very much at the forefront of some of last year's biggest film performances.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the Hoosiers poised to make a big noise at Sunday's Academy Awards ceremony, airing at 8 p.m. on ABC. It is by no means exhaustive, as Hoosiers have a hand in everything, but it covers some of the larger names competing for top awards.\n\nRelated:Hollywood actor Dylan Sprouse stars in new movie 'The Duel,' filmed in Indianapolis\n\nBrendan Fraser\n\nPerhaps the biggest modern corollary to the \"Hoosier by birth\" rule is Brendan Fraser, who was born in Indianapolis but moved away as an infant.\n\nStill, at least since \"The Mummy,\" we have claimed him as our own.\n\nAs I wrote following the packed screening of \"The Whale\" that closed Heartland International Film Festival in October, Fraser is beyond deserving of the Oscar for best actor. The audience could feel his pained movements and struggle to reclaim what's important to him. His performance carried the film.\n\nFraser was the early frontrunner, and he has already captured a Screen Actors Guild award for his performance. But Variety, which tracks award season buzz year-round, is predicting a win for Austin Butler, whose turn as Elvis Presley won the Golden Globe in January.\n\nButler is deserving, as is Colin Ferrell, though I did not love \"The Banshees of Inisherin\" as much as seemingly everybody else did.\n\nA lot of this year's top films — \"Elvis,\" \"Tar,\" \"Banshees,\" even \"The Whale\" at times — felt a bit more like vehicles for strong acting performances rather than great overall films with strong plots and character development driven by the acting. \"The Revenant\" is my go-to example of this phenomenon. That movie existed to finally get Leonardo DiCaprio a best acting Oscar and to look really pretty while doing it.\n\nWhether he wins or not, Fraser's comeback is cemented. And Hoosiers love a good comeback story.\n\nSon Lux\n\nI first met Ryan Lott at Monon Coffee Company last April. It was a beautiful Indiana spring afternoon — the rain was pouring so hard I nearly drowned getting over there.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Lott, an IU grad and local music fixture for several decades who typically splits his time between here and Los Angeles, moved his family moved to Indianapolis. The Son Lux founder created the 49-song soundtrack for \"Everything Everywhere All at Once,\" now the clear favorite to win Best Picture and a handful of other Oscars this weekend, in the bedroom of a rented home in Broad Ripple.\n\nLott's work encompassed a score, original songs featuring musical heavy hitters David Byrne, Randy Newman, André 3000 and Mitski and the soundscapes necessary for holding the interdimensional comedy/drama/martial arts film together.\n\nLott and his collaborators produced one hour and 50 minutes of original music for a two hour and 15-minute movie.\n\nMore coverage:The musical journey of 'Everything Everywhere All at Once' began in a Broad Ripple bedroom\n\nAnd for that work, Son Lux earned Oscar nominations for Best Original Score and Best Original Song. The band will also perform \"This Is A Life,\" a song from the soundtrack, at the ceremony alongside Byrne and \"Everything\" co-star Stephanie Hsu.\n\nVariety does not like Son Lux's chances in either category. The band may have to settle for only playing an integral part in by far the year's best movie. But I'm in Indiana manifesting the win for Lott and company.\n\nLott told me something about a film composer's work that has stuck with me as I've watched however many dozens of films since:\n\n\"You don't want (the score) to stand out, yet it has to have a massive opinion … it has to have the same sized heart and personality of the movie.\"\n\n'Stranger at the Gate'\n\nMuncie is at the forefront of a film nominated for Best Documentary Short Film.\n\n\"Stranger at the Gate\" tells the stories of Richard \"Mac\" McKinney, a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who planned to bomb a mosque, and the Muslim family that embraced their would-be attacker as a friend and brother.\n\nUpon getting to know the congregants of the Islamic Center of Muncie, McKinney not only abandoned his plan but underwent a total transformation in his soul.\n\nMore:A Muncie man planned to bomb a mosque. A film on his redemption is up for an Oscar.\n\n\"This film shows the power of talking to each other, of staying open to each other and of building bridges and searching for that shared humanity,\" director Joshua Seftel told me in a recent interview. \"There's a power in that, and in this case, it saved lives.\"\n\nIt's a gripping and necessary film about hate and prejudice in Indiana and beyond. It's short and easily digested. It's also available for free on YouTube.\n\nI'm not familiar with the other nominees in this category, but \"Stranger at the Gate\" is deserving on message alone.

Winning best picture, best adapted screenplay and best film editing, Argo fared better than its other high profile counterparts, such as Silver Linings Playbook, which accepted only one award for its eight nominations, or Lincoln, which took two of 12.\n\nIn all, the Academy largely granted recognition to the films that deserved it, if in an egalitarian manner where the best woman doesn't necessarily win (see my best actress analysis). While the winner's circle seemed to represent the large number of quality films at the 85th annual Academy Awards, there were obvious overlooked films -- Zero Dark Thirty and Beasts of the Southern Wild -- which easily could have stolen the top honors from Argo.\n\nExcept Argo director Ben Affleck got his own snub in the best director category, making best picture a necessary apology for the film that had moviegoers in full applause when I saw it last weekend.\n\n\n\nRELATED: Life lessons from Oscar-nominated films\n\nCategory by category, here’s my analysis of last night’s ceremony based on the movies I saw: Argo, Silver Linings Playbook, Zero Dark Thirty, Beasts of the Southern Wild and Lincoln.\n\nBest picture: Director drama aside, Argo was a solid choice in a category of nine well-received films. True to the undercover operation itself, every single element of this production came through, from performances to editing to screenplay. The focus is on the story, not the actors, and it will have you on the edge of your seat even though, like Zero Dark Thirty, you know how it ends.\n\nBest actress:Jessica Chastain was robbed. That said, this category featured such powerful performances from strong, defiant leading ladies, the measure of difference between them was so small that the award could have been anyone's. Go watch Quvenzhané Wallis, for instance, who had no real chance in this category -- she’s nine and the star of an independent film -- but performed with such naked vulnerability that I wouldn't object to her taking home the gold. In the end, Jennifer Lawrence’s interpretation of Tiffany was memorable and I was glad to see Silver Linings Playbook get something.\n\nBest actor:Daniel Day-Lewis was this year’s single best performance in film, bar none. Anyone who would like to argue can go watch My Week With Marilyn. Michelle Williams embodies Marilyn Monroe as perfectly as Day-Lewis captures Abraham Lincoln, and I contend that, like Chastain, she was deservedly awarded at the Golden Globes if passed over for a higher profile pick (Meryl, anyone?) at the Oscars. Plus, Day-Lewis needed to take this award home for Lincoln, the movie that had everyone predicting Steven Spielberg for best director but only got one other award: best production design.\n\nBest director: Having read and loved the book, Life of Pi was not on my list of films I wanted to see. I remained skeptical that it could pull off Yann Martel’s allegorical story. But when Ang Lee beats Spielberg and a director who got a best actress performance out of a nine-year-old, I’m all eyes.\n\nBest adapted screenplay: Talk about a loaded category. I could hardly predict how the Academy would fall. Argo is a commendable choice -- its witty dialogue and dramatic scenes propel the narrative forward and I’m especially happy it beat out Lincoln. Personally, I thought Lincoln was made for history buffs and not the general public. Historically accurate sure, but the movie missed an opportunity to tell a story audiences could fall in love with. Lincoln’s wife was crazy -- why not give the facts through the lens of family struggle, instead of a Doris Kearns Goodwin history lesson? Other notable screenplays certainly include Silver Linings Playbook, which had me laughing as much as it had me thinking about mental health in the United States, and Beasts of the Southern Wild, which perfectly embodied the voice of a child narrator, while prompting discussion about problems adults face, such as climate change.\n\n\n\nClara Ritger is a Spring 2013 USA TODAY Collegiate Correspondent.

Sarasota-Manatee is no exception, with its plentiful beaches and waterfronts, ornate mansions and vestiges of Old Florida.\n\nThe area’s biggest production to date remains 1952’s “The Greatest Show on Earth,” Cecil B. DeMille’s extravagant love letter to the circus. The film dazzled locals with its star-studded cast including Charlton Heston and Betty Hutton and its downtown Sarasota parade scene, and went on to be a nationwide box-office smash and Best Picture Oscar winner.\n\nNo film made here in the next few decades came near that level, though there were some intriguing curios like “Midnight Cowboy” director John Schlesinger’s road-trip comedy “Honky Tonk Freeway” or the acclaimed adaptation of Sarasota author John D. MacDonald’s novel “A Flash of Green.”\n\nThen in the late ’90s, Sarasota-Manatee experienced the excitement and bustle of a major Hollywood production again when the films “Great Expectations” and “Palmetto” came to town, bringing stars like Ethan Hawke, Gwyneth Paltrow, Woody Harrelson and Elisabeth Shue. Five years later, Denzel Washington visited Manatee and Charlotte counties while making the thriller “Out of Time.”\n\nThose were the last blockbusters to shoot mainly in Sarasota-Manatee, though some big-budget films still visited for partial shoots. Those included Harmony Korine’s surreal St. Pete-set crime film “Spring Breakers,” which shot in Sarasota along with the Jason Statham thriller “Parker.”\n\nSince Florida ended its film tax incentives program in 2016, big-budget productions have largely abandoned the Sunshine State altogether, even those that take place here. Ben Affleck’s Ybor City-set gangster film “Live by Night,” which also partially takes place on Longboat Key, headed to Georgia instead.\n\nYet as the surprise Best Picture win for the Miami indie drama “Moonlight” demonstrated, smaller-scale films can still make a big splash nationally. That includes the Sarasota-shot “Dark Night,” which premiered at Sundance Film Festival in 2016.\n\nDating back over six decades, here’s the backstory on the biggest movies to be made in Sarasota-Manatee.\n\n“The Greatest Show on Earth” (1952)\n\nWhen renowned “Samson and Delilah” director Cecil B. DeMille decided to make his next epic film about the circus, he and some of Hollywood’s biggest stars headed to Sarasota, then the winter quarters for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus.\n\nTaking its name from the circus’ famous tagline, “The Greatest Show on Earth” starred Charlton Heston as a circus manager, Betty Hutton as his trapeze artist girlfriend and Cornel Wilde as another aerialist who she develops feelings for. The cast also included Dorothy Lamour as an iron-jaw performer, Gloria Grahame as an elephant girl and James Stewart as a clown. (Only Stewart didn’t film any scenes here.)\n\nJoining them were real-life Ringling Bros. circus performers and Sarasota residents such as iconic clowns Emmett Kelly and Lou Jacobs, as well as circus president John Ringling North, playing himself. And to create the film’s throng of circus fans, around 3,000 locals were hired as extras.\n\nAbout half of the movie was filmed in Sarasota during a six-week shoot in early 1951. Much of that took place at Ringling Bros.’ winter quarters, located near where Bobby Jones Golf Club is today.\n\nAn extravagant circus parade scene at the end of the film was shot in downtown Sarasota, with past Sarasota landmarks like Palmer First National Bank and Oleander Ice Cream visible in the background. An estimated crowd of 65,000 to 100,000 came out to see the film’s stars and a cavalcade of animals including elephants and lions in the parade.\n\nThe stars in town caused a great deal of excitement throughout the shoot. When Lamour arrived by train to Sarasota, the Herald-Tribune reported it “required three husky policemen several minutes” to move her a few feet past “a seething mob of male, female and juvenile bobby-soxers, camera fans and autograph hunters.”\n\nThe film returned to town a year later for a premiere at Sarasota Opera House, then known as Florida Theater. The festivities included another circus parade down downtown’s Main Street drawing tens of thousands of spectators, with elephants and a convertible carrying Kelly and Florida Gov. Fuller Warren among the procession.\n\n“The Greatest Show on Earth” went on to become the highest-grossing film of 1952 and win two Oscars, including Best Picture.\n\n“Great Expectations” (1998)\n\nBefore Alfonso Cuarón won two Best Director Oscars for “Gravity” and “Roma,\" he made “Great Expectations,” Sarasota’s most star-studded production since “The Greatest Show on Earth.”\n\nThe modern reimagining of Charles Dickens’ classic stars Ethan Hawke as the protagonist, Robert De Niro as a convict he saved as a child, Anne Bancroft as a wealthy recluse whose home he frequently visits and Gwyneth Paltrow as her niece that Hawke falls for. The film updates the novel’s locations from London and Kent to New York City and Sarasota-Manatee.\n\nThe Manatee County fishing village of Cortez serves as the town that Hawke and Paltrow grow up in. Meanwhile, John and Mable Ringling’s Sarasota winter home of the Ca’ d’Zan portrays Paradiso Perduto, the decaying mansion where Bancroft lives.\n\nHeidi Taylor, an associate registrar who’s worked for 29 years at The Ringling that houses Ca’ d’Zan, said the timing was ideal, as the mansion was preparing for restoration and had its furniture in storage. So the film began the process of transforming it into a decrepit property, adding props like a crashed chandelier on the floor and an abandoned piano outside, along with sullying the interior and exterior.\n\n“They sprayed the outside of the Ca’ d’Zan with a protective layer,\" Taylor said. “Then they dirtied that covering and fake ivy and Spanish moss and all kinds of stuff, all over the outside of it. Then afterwards it was pressure-washed off, so it was pretty amazing.”\n\nThe movie stars’ presence caused a big buzz in town. Along with the cast, Bancroft’s husband Mel Brooks and Paltrow’s then-boyfriend Brad Pitt also visited Sarasota, with Pitt reportedly leaving a tour of the Ca’ d’Zan impressed.\n\nThe film also brought a national spotlight to Sarasota-Manatee, including a theatrical trailer with multiple glimpses of Ca’ d’Zan. The movie’s final scene features Hawke and Paltrow together on the mansion’s terrace overlooking Sarasota Bay.\n\nDespite its A-list talent, “Great Expectations” came out in 1998 to mixed reviews and no major awards attention. Cuarón returned to his native Mexico for his next film “Y Tu Mamá También,” with it and every feature he’s made since either winning or being nominated for Oscars.In an interview with the Herald-Tribune during a 2017 visit to Ringling College of Art and Design, Hawke said making the film was challenging, but also fascinating for the chance to work with a future filmmaker great in Cuarón.\n\n“He really pissed me off because we had such a bad time making that movie, then he went off and made ‘Y Tu Mamá También’ right after,” Hawke said. “I called him up afterwards, ‘Why is the next movie you make brilliant, and the one you made with me flawed?’”\n\n“Palmetto” (1998)\n\nFresh off recent Oscar nominations, Woody Harrelson and Elisabeth Shue headed to Sarasota-Manatee in 1997 to make the Florida neo-noir “Palmetto.”\n\nSet in the fictional town of Palmetto — not the Manatee County city of the same name — the film stars Harrelson as a reporter framed for a crime after uncovering city council corruption and Shue as a femme fatale who recruits him for a scheme once he’s released from prison. Gina Gershon, Chloe Sevigny and Michael Rapaport co-star, with the filmmaker of the Oscar-winning “The Tin Drum” Volker Schlondorff directing.\n\nPerhaps the most recognizable onscreen location is historic downtown Sarasota bar Gator Club, used as a local watering hole where Harrelson and Shue meet for the first time.\n\nGator Club’s then-owner Ernie Ritz, who sold the bar in 2005, said the film’s crew chose it because they considered it the most authentic Florida bar they could find. Several changes were nonetheless made to Gator Club before filming, including adding a phone booth, pool table and window blinds.\n\nThe shoot took four days, with Shue leaving in a limousine every day after filming, Ritz said. But Harrelson, not unlike the “Cheers” bartender character Woody that made him famous, would hang around the bar for hours.\n\n“He would talk to everybody that wanted to talk to him,” Ritz said. “He autographed a baby’s diaper, he autographed girls’ T-shirts, he autographed whatever you gave him. He was one hell of a great guy. After a while, everyone just referred to him as, ‘Hey, Woody!’ as though we were old friends.”\n\nPelican Shore Cottages on Manasota Key in Englewood also plays a prominent role in the film, serving as a retreat for Harrelson where he has rendezvouses with Shue and Sevigny. Anna Maria City Pier, Manatee County Courthouse and a Casey Key residence were among the other filming locations.\n\n“Palmetto” received a lukewarm critical and commercial response when it hit theaters nationwide. Perhaps its greatest cultural footprint remains at Gator Club, which has a display with film shoot photographs on its wall and the wooden blinds still on its windows.\n\n“Woody Harrelson put those blinds in,” Ritz said. “Best gift I ever got.”\n\n“Out of Time” (2003)\n\nJust months after winning the Best Actor Oscar in 2002 for playing corrupt L.A. cop Alonzo in “Training Day,” Denzel Washington hopped from the West Coast to Florida’s sunny Gulf Coast to film “Out of Time.”\n\nHe reunited with his “Training Day” co-star Eva Mendes and “Devil in a Blue Dress” director Carl Franklin for the thriller. Washington played police chief Matt, estranged from his detective wife (Mendes) and having an affair with the married Ann (Sanaa Lathan). But when Ann and her husband appear dead in a fire and the evidence points to Matt, he must cover his tracks and find the real culprit.\n\nMultiple Florida locations were used to create the fictional town of Banyan Key, where the movie is set. Those included Cortez, with a dock in Cortez Cove Marina transformed into Matt’s sea shack home.\n\nThe house is seen multiple times in the movie, including the final scene with an aerial shot soaring over the water. Karen Bell, an owner of Cortez’s A.P. Bell and Star Fish Company as well as the marina, said the dock used to be a net camp where fishermen would store their cotton nets.\n\n“It was amazing how quickly they did it,” Bell said of the shack’s construction. “Of course, it wasn’t built to code or anything, it was just slapped together. But it looked great, it just looked very authentic and real.”\n\nIn between filming scenes, Bell said Washington would fish by a fuel dispenser on the docks near A.P. Bell and Star Fish.\n\n“He liked to catch sheepshead,” Bell said. “My uncle went out and spoke with him and he had no clue who he was, and just sat there and talked. Real low-key, they said he was really nice.”\n\nThe movie also filmed at The Fishery restaurant in Placida in Charlotte County, and Boca Grande on Gasparilla Island, with the film’s opening scene featuring the sign for Temptation Restaurant in Boca Grande.\n\n“Out of Time” hit theaters a year later and proved moderately successful critically and commercially, opening at No. 2 in its opening weekend behind “School of Rock.” The shack has since been dismantled, but the dock is still there.\n\n“Honky Tonk Freeway” (1981)\n\nOscar-winning director John Schlesinger’s most famous film, “Midnight Cowboy,” ended with a road trip to Florida. Then a decade later, he made a movie where that was the entire premise, which ended up being a historic box-office bomb.\n\n“Honky Tonk Freeway” centers on a fictional Florida town called Ticlaw, featuring a safari park that boasts a water-skiing elephant named Bubbles. The mayor (William Devane) attempts to pay officials off to get a Ticlaw freeway exit that would draw more tourist traffic, but is unsuccessful.\n\nFrom there, it follows a sprawling cast of characters headed to Florida, including an aspiring children’s book author (Beau Bridges), a woman transporting her mother’s ashes in an urn (Beverly D’Angelo) and an elderly couple planning their retirement (Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn). Their paths finally intersect when Ticlaw’s mayor, in a desperate last gambit, blows up an overpass.\n\nMost of the Ticlaw scenes were shot in the central Florida city of Mount Dora, but the movie’s two most remarkable stunts were filmed here. An overpass of a then-under-construction Interstate 75 in the Fruitville area of Sarasota was detonated. Then in the movie’s final scene, a truck carrying safari animals accidentally jumps over the blown-up overpass, causing a pile-up and releasing the animals.\n\nIn an interview with the Herald-Tribune in July while filming the movie “Acting: The First Six Lessons” in Sarasota, Bridges said his main memory of “Honky Tonk Freeway” was sitting on a freeway with D’Angelo in “hot as hell” 100 degree weather.\n\n“They shut down one whole side of the freeway and they had wild animals out on the freeway, rhinos and lions and crap,” Beau said. “But what they forgot to do was shut down and control the other side of the freeway, so you had people rubbernecking and looking at all this craziness happening.”\n\nSuch stunts proved costly, with the film’s budget estimated at $24 million plus at least $5 million in marketing, according to the New York Times. When it was released nationwide in August 1981, it struggled to make back $2 million, leading the Times to call it “the unquestionable commercial disaster of the summer.”\n\nReviews were also generally negative, but the film has since found a cult following, including with Floridians proud of this piece of their history. Bridges called it “a bizarre movie,” but enjoyed working with Schlesinger, calling him “one of our better ones.”\n\n“A Flash of Green” (1984)\n\nAfter starring in “The Right Stuff,” Ed Harris visited Sarasota-Manatee for “A Flash of Green.” Based on the novel by Sarasota literary luminary John D. MacDonald, it was also made by one of Florida’s most acclaimed filmmakers.\n\nVictor Nunez, who later directed the Florida-set movies “Ulee’s Gold” and “Ruby in Paradise” and currently teaches film at Florida State University, had MacDonald suggested to him by his production partner Sam Gowan, who worked at University of Florida’s library where the author’s collection resides.\n\nHarris stars as Jimmy Wing, a newspaper reporter in the fictional Palm City. County commissioner Elmo Bliss (Richard Jordan) wants to develop on Grassy Bay and bribes Jimmy for his help. Though Jimmy initially agrees, his relationship with a woman (Blair Brown) opposing the development and threats other environmental activists begin to receive trouble him.\n\nThe movie filmed in several Sarasota-Manatee locations such as Casey Key and Cortez. Sarasota restaurant Waffle Shop (now Waffle Stop) acts as a diner where characters meet, while Sarasota County Courthouse served as the setting for the commission meetings.\n\nIt also employed local actors in prominent roles, including Asolo Repertory Theatre veteran Isa Thomas, who played scientist Doris. Actual county commissioners and other state politicians even agreed to play commissioners, in an example of the film shoot’s heavy community involvement.\n\n“Doing a movie was a novelty,” Nunez said. “I just thought we were local filmmakers having a good time, but because we had Ed Harris and Blair Brown and Richard Jordan, we ended up having to have a press conference for everybody. (Wayne) Mixson, who was lieutenant governor at the time, he flew his helicopter down there to come and visit on the set.”\n\n“A Flash of Green” played film festivals like Toronto and Cannes before airing on television in 1986 as part of the PBS anthology series “American Playhouse.” IFC did a restoration of the film about a decade ago, which currently remains limited to theatrical screenings.\n\nThose who praised the film included Roger Ebert and the New York Times’ Vincent Canby, as well as MacDonald before his death in 1986. The author, whose novel “The Executioners” was filmed as \"Cape Fear\" in 1962 and 1991, attended a Sarasota premiere. According to Gowan, MacDonald said it was the best film based on his writing he’d seen.\n\n“This was a very emotional, I think, novel for John, and it’s strangely timely,” Nunez said. “John was no tree-hugger, but he was passionate about what he felt was just this blind destruction of the very reason that people were there.”\n\n“Spring Breakers” (2013)\n\nBefore partying in Pinellas County for Harmony Korine’s Florida crime film “Spring Breakers,” Disney stars Selena Gomez and Vanessa Hudgens first made a stop in Sarasota.\n\nGomez and Hudgens, along with “Pretty Little Liars” star Ashley Benson and Harmony’s wife Rachel Korine, play four college students desperate to go on spring break. Their debauchery becomes increasingly criminal when they cross paths with drug dealer and rapper Alien (James Franco.)\n\nSarasota plays the town where the girls go to college, with the film spending a week at Ringling College in March during the school’s own spring break. It was also the movie’s first week of filming overall, said Christine Meeker Lange, who managed the shoot while then working at the college.\n\n“It was exhausting — we were probably filming at least 12 hours a day, and then the set-up and take-down was additional time,” Lange said. “But they always say that the first week of the shoot is critical to determine how the rest of it will go, and they were just so thrilled. I couldn’t be happier in how it went.”\n\nOn-campus locations included the college’s academic center for a classroom scene with a sea of computer screens illuminated in the dark, representative of the film’s day-glo visual style. Some cottages on vacant property Ringling College owned were converted into fraternity houses used for one of the film’s several party scenes.\n\nFranco didn’t visit the Sarasota shoot, but the four leading ladies did, with fans gathering near the set in hopes of glimpsing Gomez or her then-boyfriend Justin Bieber. Lange said the spectators were very respectful, except for one who jumped a fence and another who hid under a stairwell with a camera.\n\n“Spring Breakers” also filmed at Sarasota’s New College of Florida for exterior shots and a gleeful nighttime run. The Sunshine Skyway Bridge appears in multiple scenes as well.\n\nThe movie hit theaters nationwide a year later in March 2013 and was both a commercial and critical success. There was even talk of a sequel to be written by “Trainspotting” author Irvine Welsh without Harmony’s involvement, but that has yet to materialize.\n\nHarmony did shoot his next film in South Florida, this year’s Matthew McConaughey stoner comedy “The Beach Bum,” and moved to Miami. Other potential projects the director has discussed — Miami gangster film “The Trap,” an adaptation of Alissa Nutting’s novel “Tampa” — are also set in Florida, so don’t be surprised if he returns to Sarasota-Manatee someday.\n\n“Parker” (2013)\n\nThe same year “Spring Breakers” hit multiplexes, so did “Parker,” another Florida film with big-name stars partially filmed in Sarasota.\n\nThe movie was based on the criminal character of the same name in Donald E. Westlake’s novels, previously portrayed by actors like Lee Marvin in “Point Blank” and Mel Gibson in “Payback” under different monikers. Jason Statham played Parker in this 2013 adaptation, with “Ray” filmmaker Taylor Hackford directing.\n\n“Parker” was primarily set and shot in Palm Beach, where Parker searches with the help of a local real estate agent (Jennifer Lopez) for a group of robbers who double-crossed him. But a climactic scene where the robbers pull off a heist at a jewelry auction was filmed at Ca’ d’Zan.\n\nSarasota County Film and Entertainment Office Director Jeanne Corcoran said the film struggled to find a suitable Palm Beach mansion for the scene, with Mar-a-Lago being too expensive. Sarasota-based crew member Pamela Alessandrelli then suggested Ca’ d’Zan. The production was interested, but wondered if they could find enough extras who could provide their own tuxedo and gown wardrobes.\n\n“I laughed and said, ‘You absolutely can, you know this is Sarasota, right?’” Corcoran said. “‘With the opera and the ballet and the theater and the galas, I don’t think there’s any problem whatsoever with people having their own tuxedos and gowns.’”\n\nAround 300 locals were ultimately hired, including members of Sarasota County Sheriff’s Office Marine Unit for the robbers’ getaway on the water. Smoke-based pyrotechnics were also used during the shoot, which Corcoran said spent about $500,000 overall.\n\nStatham and Lopez didn’t visit Sarasota, but other stars did, including Emmy-winning “The Shield” actor Michael Chiklis, who played the robbers’ leader Melander. Hackford’s wife, Oscar-winning British actress Helen Mirren, also accompanied him to Sarasota, Corcoran said.\n\nDespite its pedigree, “Parker” received poor reviews and a No. 5 box-office debut. The movie was suggested as the potential start of a franchise before its release, but no follow-up film has since been announced.\n\nCa’ d’Zan remains one of Sarasota-Manatee’s most popular filming locations, however. Singer Jackie Evancho’s PBS special used it as a backdrop, as did the Palmetto-set TNT crime series “Claws,” which primarily shoots in Louisiana.\n\n“Dark Night” (2017)\n\nIndie drama “Dark Night” easily has the lowest budget and least-known stars of any movie on this list, but it nonetheless scored national attention, and could represent the future of Sarasota-Manatee filmmaking.\n\nThe film is loosely based on the 2012 Aurora, Colorado, movie theater shooting during a screening of “The Dark Knight Rises” that resulted in 12 deaths and 70 injuries. The story follows several strangers throughout their everyday lives leading up to the shooting, which is not shown onscreen.\n\nMultiple recognizable Sarasota locations appear throughout the film, with downtown’s Regal Hollywood and its neon-lit lobby serving as the backdrop for the ending. In another scene, one character meets someone for drinks at beloved Sarasota dive bar Memories Lounge.\n\nYet it’s also set largely in anonymous strip malls, as well as the actual houses of local cast members, the majority of whom weren’t professional actors. Sutton told the Herald-Tribune in a previous interview that he was drawn to Sarasota because of its “universal” suburban landscape.\n\n“The landscape of the film was always supposed to feel like Florida, but it could be Arizona or Connecticut,” Sutton said.\n\nThe film’s crew was a similar blend of professional and aspiring filmmakers, including several from Ringling College, where the movie also shot. Students worked in key roles including assistant camera and the art department, alongside Sutton and Independent Spirit Awards-nominated cinematographer Helene Louvart.\n\n“Dark Night” premiered at the 2016 Sundance Film Festival. Unsurprisingly, given its sensitive subject matter and experimental nature, reviews were divided. But the positive ones were often highly so, such as Entertainment Weekly’s Leah Greenblatt, who called it “a haunting, thought-provoking piece of work.”\n\nAnd the setup of making movies with a blend of professionals and Ringling College students has continued in Sarasota.\n\nKevin Smith’s horror anthology film “Killroy was Here” wrapped filming last year at Sarasota locations like Booker Middle School and Fruitville Grove and is currently in post-production. So is Beau Bridges’ “Acting: The First Six Lessons,” which used Ringling College students on its crew as well.\n\nThese indie films may not boast the glitz and glamour of “The Greatest Show on Earth,” but they could be what continues Sarasota-Manatee’s long history of filmmaking into the new decade.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/20"}]}

One child is 6 years old,” Newman said. Most of the infected children are 2 years old or younger.\n\nHealth officials with Columbus Public Health and Franklin County Public Health have been investigating these cases and tracing any contacts who may have been exposed to the measles virus.\n\nOfficials at Columbus Public Health are encouraging parents to make sure their children are up to date on their immunizations, including the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine, known as the MMR vaccine.\n\nExperts recommend that children receive the vaccine in two doses: first between 12 months and 15 months of age and a second between 4 and 6 years old. One dose is about 93% effective at preventing measles if you come into contact with the virus. Two doses are about 97% effective.\n\n“We are working diligently with the cases to identify any potential exposures and to notify people who were exposed,” Columbus Public Health Commissioner Dr. Mysheika Roberts said in a news release last week. “The most important thing you can do to protect against measles is to get vaccinated with the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is safe and highly effective.”\n\nAbout 90% of unvaccinated people who are exposed to measles will become infected, according to Columbus Public Health, and about 1 in 5 people in the US who get measles will be hospitalized.\n\nHowever, the CDC says that more than 90% of children in the US have been vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella by age 2.\n\nMeasles is a highly contagious disease that can spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes or if someone comes into direct contact with or shares germs by touching the same objects or surfaces. Measles symptoms may include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes and a rash of red spots. In rare cases, it may lead to pneumonia, encephalitis or death.\n\nThe measles outbreak in Columbus is a “fairly typical scenario” of an infectious virus finding its way into one environment and spreading among unvaccinated people, said Dr. David Freedman, professor emeritus of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and founding director of the Travelers’ Health Clinic.\n\nFreedman said that during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, while many people stayed home and some health-care facilities were closed, many children missed their routine immunizations – and they still may not have gotten their MMR shots.\n\n“There are a lot of children nationwide that are behind on their routine vaccinations. So I think the message is still, if your child is 1 year of age or older, they need to be vaccinated,” said Freedman, a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\n“Measles is not particularly a wintertime disease. It is not as likely to be affected by travel because it usually is in young, not immune children. Most adults are vaccinated,” he said. However, he added, “measles is highly contagious. Measles is probably the most contagious disease we know. It’s probably 10 times as contagious as Covid is.”\n\nThe history of measles in America\n\nIn 1912, measles became a nationally notifiable disease in the United States, meaning health care providers and laboratories were required to report diagnosed cases. In the decade afterward, an average of about 6,000 measles-related deaths were reported annually.\n\nIn the 1950s, researchers isolated the measles virus in a patient’s blood, and in the 1960s, they were able to transform that virus into a vaccine. The vaccine was licensed and then used as part of a vaccination program.\n\nBefore the measles vaccination program was introduced in the United States in 1963, an estimated 3 million to 4 million people got the disease each year nationwide, according to the CDC. Afterward, cases and deaths from measles in the United States and other developed countries plummeted. There were 963 cases reported in the United States in 1994 and 508 in 1996.\n\nThe last major measles outbreak reported in the US was in 2019. It was the largest since the disease was declared eliminated in 2000 and involved more than a thousand confirmed cases in 31 states – the highest number of cases reported in the US since 1992.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nOverall, the number of measles infections reported in the United States each year remains low because of the widespread use of vaccines, said Dr. Martin Hirsch, professor of medicine at Harvard University and Massachusetts General Hospital, who also serves as editor of the Journal of Infectious Diseases.\n\nAs of October 28, a total of 33 measles cases have been reported this year in five jurisdictions across the United States, according to the CDC.\n\n“Over 90% of people in the United States have been vaccinated against measles, and even though it’s a highly transmissible virus, I wouldn’t expect to see the rates, for example, that we’re seeing with RSV now because we don’t have an RSV vaccine,” Hirsch said, referring to a surge of respiratory syncytial virus infections across the country, mostly among children.\n\n“Most of the cases of measles that we do see in the United States result from people who are coming to this country from other countries where the immunization rates are much less, followed by transmission to US residents who are not vaccinated,” said Hirsch, a spokesperson for the Infectious Diseases Society of America. “So the possibility that someone carrying measles virus coming into the country could spread into an unvaccinated population is always there.”", "authors": ["Jacqueline Howard"], "publish_date": "2022/11/17"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/07/us/carnival-cruise-ship-covid-outbreak-cdc/index.html", "title": "The CDC is investigating a Covid-19 outbreak on board a Carnival ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating a recent Covid-19 outbreak on a Carnival cruise ship that docked in Seattle after a two-week voyage.\n\nThe Carnival Spirit, which sailed through the Panama Canal, departed Miami on April 17 and arrived in Seattle on May 3, according to a statement from the cruise line. The ship holds 2,124 guests and 930 crew members, Carnival said.\n\nThe CDC says it’s not permitted to publicly share the number of passengers and crew members who quarantined or tested positive. But the ship is labeled as orange status per the agency’s cruise ship Covid-19 threshold, indicating that 0.3% or more of total passengers and or crew members tested positive, according to CDC’s guidelines.\n\nThe ship’s color status helps the CDC determine the scope of investigation, the agency said.\n\nCarnival Spirit is one of 62 cruise ships currently sailing at orange status, the CDC said in a statement to CNN.\n\nBoth the cruise line and CDC said there were no severe outcomes or serious health issues among those who tested positive, and Carnival said most guests were asymptomatic.\n\n“Our health and safety protocols exceed CDC guidelines and were closely followed including vaccination requirements and pre-cruise testing of all guests. Our crew are also vaccinated and wear masks,” Carnival said in a statement to CNN.\n\n“Our protocols are designed to flex up as needed and additional measures were implemented during the voyage,” the statement added. “In addition, all guests who were scheduled to continue on with the ship’s next cruise to Alaska were tested and any guests and their traveling companions who tested positive were disembarked.”\n\nThe ship departed Seattle for Alaska later on May 3, according to Carnival’s statement.\n\nThe CDC is working with the cruise line as well as state and local health agencies to “enact existing Covid-19 agreements and protocols,” the statement added.\n\nPassengers say cruise ship was “overwhelmed”\n\nSome passengers who were on board the Carnival Spirit alleged that crew members mishandled the Covid-19 outbreak on the ship.\n\nDarren Siefertson, who is from Las Vegas, Nevada, told CNN he boarded the ship on April 17 from Miami and was informed by April 26 that there was a Covid-19 outbreak on the ship.\n\nAfter testing positive, Siefertson said he was promised to be moved to an isolation cabin but ended up being forced to stay in the same room as his roommate.\n\nSiefertson said when he called the medical center for an update, the center had already closed before its scheduled closing time, and no one was picking up the phone.\n\nWhen Siefertson’s cabin mate went to guest services to ask what they should do, he was told there were no more isolation cabins available, and he would have to stay in the same room as Siefertson.\n\nCarnival Spirit is one of 62 cruise ships currently sailing at orange status, according to the CDC. Darren Siefertson\n\nShip guests also complained that room service took “hours to get food to those who were in quarantine,” Siefertson said.\n\n“There were times we ordered our food at 1 p.m. and it didn’t show up until 7 p.m.,” Walter Babij, who was on the cruise with his wife, told CNN. Both Babij and his wife tested positive for Covid-19 while aboard the ship and quarantined in an isolation cabin.\n\n“There were also a few times we didn’t get our complete orders. We would have to call several times to track down our food. We were completely dependent on them,” Babij said.\n\nSiefertson also complained that a few days after testing positive, his cabin and two other cabins near him began to reek of sewage.\n\n“You couldn’t even call to ask someone to fix the problem because no one would pick up the phone and we couldn’t leave our room, so I had to stay in this room that smelled like a toilet. It was terrible,” Siefertson said. “Carnival said they managed the situation, but that is so not true. They were so overwhelmed.”\n\nBoth Siefertson and Babij told CNN they felt the cruise line was “overwhelmed.”\n\n“I don’t think they expected that level of cases and when it got to a certain level they didn’t know what to do.

Ron DeSantis on Tuesday asked his state’s Supreme Court to green-light an investigation of “any and all wrongdoing in Florida with respect to Covid-19 vaccines,” his latest move to cast doubt on the vaccines’ effectiveness and amplify fears about side effects.\n\nIn the petition filed with the Florida Supreme Court, the Republican governor requests the empaneling of a grand jury to investigate a broad group of entities associated with the development, distribution and promotion of the vaccines, including pharmaceutical manufacturers and their executive officers, as well as medical associations.\n\nDeSantis also said Tuesday he was launching a public health integrity committee – a panel that would counter the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which DeSantis said “is not serving a useful function; it’s really serving to advance narratives rather than do evidence-based medicine.” The panel would assess guidance and actions from federal agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health, US Food and Drug Administration and the CDC.\n\nDeSantis has made Covid-19 vaccine skepticism his calling card ahead of a potential run for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. The governor, who cruised to victory in his bid for a second term in November, is positioning himself to the right of former President Donald Trump, a potential rival who who was in office when the vaccine was developed.\n\nThe announcements Tuesday came at a roundtable focused on vaccines that DeSantis led. The Florida governor’s surgeon general, Dr. Joseph Ladapo, during the roundtable pointed to examples of the vaccine causing myocarditis, inflammation of the heart, and said pharmaceutical companies need to provide more data to independent researchers so they can further study the side effects from vaccines.\n\n“We will answer this question. It is a question that I am sure keeps the CEOs of Pfizer and Moderna up late at night, hoping no one ever looks. But we’re going to look here in Florida,” Ladapo said during the roundtable.\n\nCases of myocarditis and pericarditis, inflammation of the heart and heart lining, are rare after mRNA vaccines, although they are more likely to occur among young men. The risk of heart inflammation is far greater from Covid-19 than from vaccination.\n\nFollowing large clinical trials, the FDA authorized the shots for use in people 6 months and older, and CDC continues to recommend them. Experts and government agencies say the benefits far outweigh the risks as the vaccines dramatically reduce the risk of hospitalization or death from Covid-19.\n\nAn analysis released Tuesday by the Commonwealth Fund and the Yale School of Public Health estimated Covid-19 vaccines prevented more than 3.2 million deaths and 18.5 million hospitalizations in the United States and saved more than $1.15 trillion in medical costs.\n\nDeSantis has frequently touted his decision to avoid the restrictions that many other states implemented in the early months of the pandemic.\n\n“I kept this state open and I kept the state free, and we now have the biggest budget surplus in the history of Florida,” he said in an October debate against Democratic challenger Charlie Crist.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, DeSantis had advocated the need for vaccines. But his message has changed since mid-2021 – a shift that coincides with skepticism among conservatives who have at times booed or chided Trump for touting vaccines.\n\nDeSantis last year moved to block cruise lines departing from Florida from requiring their customers to be vaccinated, and to block municipalities from imposing vaccine mandates. In June, DeSantis touted Florida’s status as the only state not to preorder vaccines for children younger than 5.\n\nFlorida is an outlier in that that it recommends against the Covid-19 vaccine for healthy children – which puts it at odds with CDC, recommendations from other states and Florida’s chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.", "authors": ["Eric Bradner Kit Maher", "Eric Bradner", "Kit Maher"], "publish_date": "2022/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/04/health/cdc-updated-guidance-covid-isolation/index.html", "title": "Facing criticism, CDC updates Covid-19 isolation recommendations ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance on the recommended Covid-19 isolation period Tuesday, telling people that if they have access to a Covid-19 test and want to take it, the best approach is to use a rapid test toward the end of their five-day isolation period.\n\nThe agency has faced pressure over the past week from outside medical experts to include a testing component in its new shortened isolation period.\n\nThe updated recommendations do not advise a test for isolated people, but they offer guidance on how those people should respond to a test result if they choose to take one. If the test is positive, isolated people are advised to continue their isolation until 10 days after their symptoms started. If the test is negative, isolated people can end their isolation but are advised to wear a mask around other people until day 10.\n\nThe recommendations advise people who are isolating to avoid places where they can’t wear a mask, such as restaurants and gyms, and to avoid eating around others until day 10.\n\nPeople who are isolating are now urged to wait to travel until at least 10 days after the start of symptoms. Those who must travel on days six to 10 should wear a mask for their entire trip.\n\nThe CDC says the changes aim to “focus on the period when a person is most infectious. … These updated recommendations also facilitate individual social and well-being needs, return to work, and maintenance of critical infrastructure.”\n\nThe White House defended the CDC on Tuesday, calling the recommendations “based on the science” and not based on “a clear communications plan.”\n\n“The CDC is offering its updated guidance in real time of a fast moving and changing pandemic environment,” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins at a news briefing. “We’ve seen them change guidance and update guidance on other occasions. They made this recommendation last week based on science. The vast majority of transmission infectiousness occurs in the first five days after diagnosis with Covid-19 – somewhere in the range of 85 to 90%.”\n\nShe said the CDC was “continuing to assess every day, every week.”\n\nCDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky foreshadowed the updated guidance Monday night on CBS’ “The Late Show.”\n\n“So, if you have access to a test, and if you want to do a test at day five, and if your symptoms are gone and you’re feeling well, then go ahead and do that test. But here’s how I would interpret that test. If it’s positive, stay home for another five days. If it’s negative, I would say you still really need to wear a mask. You still may have some transmissibility ahead of you. You still should probably not visit grandma. You shouldn’t get on an airplane. And you should still be pretty careful when you’re with other people by wearing a mask all the time,” she said.\n\nThe updated guidance advising people to stay isolated until day 10 if they have a positive rapid test after five days in isolation appears to contradict Walensky’s claim to CNN last week that “we wouldn’t change our guidance based on the result of the rapid test.”\n\nWalensky had steadfastly defended the agency’s decision not to include recommending a rapid test in earlier guidance, telling CNN last week, “We opted not to have the rapid test for isolation because we actually don’t know how our rapid tests perform and how well they predict whether you’re transmissible during the end of disease.”\n\nOn CNN on Sunday, Dr. Anthony Fauci said the “likelihood of transmissibility is considerably lower” in the second half of the 10-day period after a positive result.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nWalensky has also maintained that the CDC’s decision to not include a testing recommendation had nothing to do with the nationwide shortage of rapid tests.\n\n“This decision really, from an isolation standpoint, had everything to do with the fact that we wouldn’t change our guidance based on the result of that rapid test.

Stephen Morrison, senior vice president of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “Those who have been vaccinated … and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death.”\n\nIn contrast, those who are not vaccinated are “going to get the brunt of the severe aspect of this,” he added.\n\nAcross the United States, at least one in five eligible Americans – roughly 65 million people– are not vaccinated against Covid-19. More than 62% of the country has been fully vaccinated, but only 23% are fully vaccinated and boosted, according to data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFauci’s comments came in response to a question about whether the pandemic has entered a new phase. That will come when there’s enough protection in the community and drugs to easily treat severe Covid-19, he said, adding, “We may be on the threshold of that right now.”\n\nAlso Tuesday, US Food and Drug Administration acting commissioner Dr. Janet Woodcock said that while most people could catch the virus, the focus now should be on making sure hospitals and essential services function.\n\nWoodcock was responding to a question from Sen. Mike Braun about whether it’s time for the United States to change its Covid-19 strategy. Her statement was not a new assessment of Covid-19, but rather an attempt to make clear the need to prioritize essential services as the Omicron variant surges.\n\n“I think it’s hard to process what’s actually happening right now, which is: Most people are going to get Covid,” Woodcock said Tuesday at a Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing. “And what we need to do is make sure the hospitals can still function, transportation, you know, other essential services are not disrupted while this happens.”\n\nOn Tuesday, the number of US patients hospitalized with Covid-19 hit a record high, adding strain to health care networks and pushing states toward emergency staffing and other measures as they struggle to cope.\n\nMore than 145,900 people were in US hospitals with Covid-19 as of Tuesday – a number that surpasses the previous peak from mid-January 2021 (142,246), and is almost twice what it was two weeks ago, according to data from the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe hospitalization record comes amid a surge in cases fueled by the highly transmissible Omicron variant.\n\nThe United States averaged more than 754,200 new Covid-19 cases daily over the past week, according to Johns Hopkins University data. That’s about three times last winter’s peak average (251,987 on January 11, 2021), and 4.5 times the peak from the Delta-driven surge (166,347 on September 1), according to JHU.\n\nThe country has averaged 1,646 Covid-19 deaths a day over the past week – 33% higher than a week ago, according to JHU. The peak average was 3,402 daily on January 13, 2021, JHU data shows.\n\nThe Omicron variant caused 98.3% of new coronavirus cases in the United States last week, according to estimates posted Tuesday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nA technician administers a Covid-19 test Monday at a drive-thru location at Churchill Downs, Kentucky. Jon Cherry/Getty Images\n\nLeaders activate new measures to combat surging numbers\n\nHospitals are increasingly juggling staffing issues – not just because of the increased demand, but also because their employees, who are at a high risk of infection, have to isolate and recover after testing positive.\n\nIn Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a limited state of emergency Monday after the number of intensive care unit hospitalizations more than doubled since December 1. The order allows hospitals to expand bed capacity and gives more flexibility in staffing, he said, adding that it also expands the use of telehealth as well as expanding which medical professionals can give vaccines.\n\nIn Texas, at least 2,700 medical staffers are being hired, trained and deployed to assist with the surge, joining more than 1,300 personnel already sent across the state, the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement to CNN.\n\nKentucky has mobilized the National Guard to provide support, with 445 members sent to 30 health care facilities, the state announced.\n\n“Omicron continues to burn through the commonwealth, growing at levels we have never seen before. Omicron is significantly more contagious than even the Delta variant,” said Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, noting the earlier variant that spurred a surge of cases in the summer and fall.\n\n“If it spreads at the rate we are seeing, it is certainly going to fill up our hospitals,” he said, and Kentucky is “down to 134 adult ICU beds available.”\n\nAnd New Jersey reinstated a public health emergency, Gov. Phil Murphy announced, saying the state needed to “commit every resource available to beating back the wave” caused by Omicron. In the past two weeks alone, the state saw more than 10,000 people requiring hospitalization due to Covid-19, the governor said in a video announcement.\n\nMitigation measures such as mandatory masking are also being revived in some areas.\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney signed a universal indoor mask mandate Monday because of hospitalization increases, with some hospitals “over 100% inpatient bed capacity amid crippling staffing shortages,” he said. Churches and places of worship are exempt, while businesses should provide masks to customers and have signage about indoor mask requirements.\n\n“It’s time for everyone to pitch in and do what works. Wear your mask indoors. Avoid gatherings or expect to get and spread Covid. Get your vaccine and, if eligible, get boosted. That’s how we’ll get through this surge without endangering more lives,” Carney said.\n\nShare of hospitalizations from breakthrough infections is growing, but risks for unvaccinated are higher\n\nThe HHS data on Covid-19 hospitalizations includes both those patients who are hospitalized because of Covid-19 complications and those who may have been admitted for something else but test positive for Covid-19. This has been true throughout the pandemic, though the share of patients who fall into each category may have changed over time.\n\nFully vaccinated people are accounting for a growing share of people hospitalized with Covid-19 – but hospitalizations among people who received a booster shot are still rare, and the gap in risk by vaccination status has been wide.\n\nBetween April and July 2021, before the emergence of the Omicron variant, more than 90% of Covid-19 hospitalizations were among people who were either unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, according to a study published by the CDC.\n\nBut a sampling of data collected by CNN suggests that figure has dropped to somewhere between 60% and 75% in recent days and months:\n\n• In Pennsylvania, about 75% of Covid-19 hospitalizations between September and early December 2021 were among people who were not fully vaccinated, according to data from the state health department.\n\n• In New York, about 61% of Covid-19 hospitalizations during the week ending January 2, 2022 were among people who were not fully vaccinated, according to data from the state health department.\n\n• Beaumont Health, the largest health care system in Michigan, reported on Thursday that 62% of Covid-19 patients in its eight hospitals were unvaccinated.\n\nIn some hospitals, up to 40% of patients with Covid-19 “are coming in not because they’re sick with Covid, but because they’re coming in with something else and have had Covid or the Omicron variant detected,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told Fox News on Sunday.\n\nBut Covid-19 cases in hospitals strain resources, regardless of whether a patient was hospitalized because of Covid-19, CNN chief medical correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.\n\n“If they get (incidentally) diagnosed with Covid in the hospital, they still need to go into infection protocol – personal protective equipment, all of that still needs to be utilized. So it’s a huge drain on the system overall,” Gupta said Tuesday.\n\nWhile fully vaccinated people are accounting for a larger share of Covid-19 hospitalizations, multiple accounts suggest that those who are fully vaccinated and boosted account for a small share.\n\nIn the University of Maryland Medical System, less than 5% of hospitalized patients were fully vaccinated and boosted, President and CEO Dr. Mohan Suntha said Thursday. Beaumont Health reported Thursday that only 8% of Covid-19 patients were fully vaccinated and boosted.\n\nThe CDC did not respond to CNN’s multiple requests for data on the share of Covid-19 hospitalizations by vaccination status.\n\nThe agency publishes data on its website regarding the relative risk by vaccination status. Cumulatively, the risk of hospitalization has been eight times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people. But in the last week of November, CDC data showed that hospitalization rates were about 17 times higher for unvaccinated people than for fully vaccinated people.\n\nSchools and industries face Omicron issues\n\nThe debate over safety in schools from Covid-19 continues to play out as only about one in six children ages 5 to 11 is fully vaccinated, according to data from the CDC.\n\nAs Los Angeles prepared to return to school on Tuesday, approximately 62,000 students and staff had tested positive for Covid-19 and will have to stay home, data from the Los Angeles Unified School District showed Monday, equating to a 14.99% positivity rate. The positivity rate of Los Angeles County at large, by comparison, has spiked to 22%.\n\nIn Chicago, educators returned to school Tuesday and students are expected to resume in-person learning Wednesday following a nearly weeklong dispute. The Chicago Teachers Union had voted to teach remotely last week, and the school district responded by canceling classes for four days.\n\nThe agreement, announced late Monday, included metrics for when a classroom would need to go remote due to Covid-19 levels.\n\nIn areas where schools have returned to in-person learning after the holiday break, the time needed for those with Covid-19 to recover has impacted some essential services.\n\nOther sectors also are struggling due to high infection rates.\n\nSome municipalities have seen nearly a quarter of their trash collection workforce call in sick in recent weeks due to Covid-19, leading to delays, according to the Solid Waste Association of North America.\n\n“This coincided, unfortunately, with increased trash and recycling volumes associated with the holidays. However, we hope that as volumes decline and sanitation workers return to work, these delays will prove temporary,” executive director and CEO David Biderman said in a statement Monday.\n\nIn travel, US airlines canceled thousands of additional flights over the weekend due to Covid-19 callouts and winter storms, and cruise line Royal Caribbean International announced it has canceled voyages on four ships because of “ongoing Covid-related circumstances around the world.” Last week, Norwegian Cruise Line canceled the voyages of eight ships.\n\nPublic transit systems in major metropolitan areas such as New York City and Washington, DC, have had to scale back service with employees ill from Covid-19.

The problem for Walensky was the out-of-context comments were already out there.\n\n(She later tweeted an explanation that she “went into medicine – HIV specifically – and public health to protect our most at-risk.”)\n\nOn Tuesday, Walensky told a Senate health committee that “it was a pre-taped interview and much of it was cut and that phrase was taken out of context. ”\n\n“The study was a cohort of 1.2 million people who were vaccinated and 36 people passed, demonstrating their remarkable effectiveness of our vaccines, but no less tragic is the 36 people who passed because of Covid-19 and that many of them had comorbidities,” she said.\n\nIn the meantime, conservatives had also seized on Walensky’s unwillingness in a Sunday interview with Fox to delineate how many of the 800,000 deaths of Americans during the pandemic were the direct result of the virus. “Walensky Dodges on How Many U.S. Covid Deaths Are Actually Caused by Covid,” read a headline from National Review. Walensky did say in that interview “our death registry takes a few weeks to collect and Omicron has been with us for just a few weeks but those data will be forthcoming.”\n\nThose moments are part of a broader problem with the CDC, particularly as it relates to the organization’s at-times confusing and seemingly contradictory about quarantine times in regards people who test positive for Covid-19.\n\nSo you could see why some within the Biden administration would want to throw Walensky a life preserver. Enter Secretary Xavier Becerra, the head of the Department of Health and Human Services, in an interview he did on CNN on Monday.\n\nHere’s the key bit (bolding is mine): “Rochelle Walensky is an infectious disease expert.

Who do I want running CDC? Someone who knows infectious diseases, someone who understands this stuff. And so while we may have issues with some of the marketing that’s been done, I guarantee you, Dr. Walensky is someone we need at CDC.”\n\n“Marketing”? Really?\n\nLet’s remember what we are talking about here when we talk about the CDC: It’s the country’s main repository of knowledge and guidance about best practices to successfully mitigate the spread of a virus that has killed more than 839,000 Americans and 5.5 million people globally.\n\nWhat the CDC does isn’t trying to make a product more appealing to a theoretical consumer. It’s to help save lives, to keep people from unnecessarily dying from this awful virus. Walensky isn’t hocking the “ShamWow”; she is a medical doctor telling America how to stay safe.\n\nThe problem then isn’t “marketing.” It’s clear communication on, literally, a matter of life and death.\n\nLook, I get what Becerra was trying to do.

These flexibilities – while critical in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic – can also help address many of the challenges you face during the spread of non-COVID-19 illnesses, including RSV and flu,” the letter says. “They remain available to you and health care providers as you all make care available in response to flu, RSV, COVID-19, and other illnesses.”\n\nFor example, if a hospital has staffing shortages that have been exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, it may use a waiver that would allow increased surge capacity or easier patient transfers – even if the patients need treatment for something other than Covid-19, such as flu or RSV.\n\nThe letter also highlights available funding, including $400 million from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prepare for and respond to public health threats each year, including flu and other respiratory diseases such as RSV, along with data, analysis and other planning resources put together by the federal government.

But it knows all about you.\n\nChances are, it’s living inside you right now. About 95% of American adults are infected sometime in their lives. And once infected, the virus stays with you.\n\nMost viruses, such as influenza, just come and go. A healthy immune system attacks them, kills them, and prevents them from sickening you again. Epstein-Barr and its cousins, including the viruses that cause chickenpox and herpes, can hibernate inside your cells for decades.\n\nThis viral family has “evolved with us for millions of years,” said Blossom Damania, a virologist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. “They know all your body’s secrets.”\n\nAlthough childhood Epstein-Barr infections are typically mild, exposure in teens and young adults can lead to infectious mononucleosis, a weeks-long illness that sickens 125,000 Americans a year, causing sore throats, swollen glands, and extreme fatigue. And while Epstein-Barr spends most of its time sleeping, it can reawaken during times of stress or when the immune system is off its game. Those reactivations are linked to a long list of serious health conditions, including several types of cancer and autoimmune diseases.\n\nScientists have spent years trying to develop vaccines against Epstein-Barr, or EBV. But recently several leaps in medical research have provided more urgency to the quest — and more hope for success. In just the past year, two experimental vaccine efforts have made it to human clinical trials.\n\nWhat’s changed?\n\nFirst, the Epstein-Barr virus has been shown to present an even greater threat. New research firmly links it to multiple sclerosis, or MS, a potentially disabling chronic disease that afflicts more than 900,000 Americans and 2.8 million people worldwide.\n\nThe journal Science in January published results from a landmark 20-year study of 10 million military personnel that offers the strongest evidence yet that Epstein-Barr can trigger MS. The new study found that people infected with Epstein-Barr are 32 times as likely as people not infected to develop MS.\n\nAnd shedding new light on the mechanisms that could explain that correlation, a separate group of scientists published a study in Nature describing how the virus can cause an autoimmune reaction that leads to MS. The disease, which usually strikes between ages 20 and 40, disrupts communication between the brain and other parts of the body and is often marked by recurring episodes of extreme fatigue, blurred vision, muscle weakness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. At its worst, MS can lead to impaired speech and paralysis.\n\nAmplifying that newfound urgency, several new studies suggest that reactivation of the Epstein-Barr virus also is involved with some cases of long covid, a little-understood condition in which patients experience lingering symptoms that often resemble mononucleosis.\n\nAnd just as crucial to the momentum: Advances in vaccine science spurred by the pandemic, including the mRNA technology used in some covid vaccines, could accelerate development of other vaccines, including ones against Epstein-Barr, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. Hotez co-created a low-cost, patent-free covid vaccine called Corbevax.\n\nSome researchers question the need for a vaccine that targets a disease like MS that, while debilitating, remains relatively rare.\n\nEliminating Epstein-Barr would require vaccinating all healthy children even though their risk of developing cancer or multiple sclerosis is small, said Dr. Ralph Horwitz, a professor at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University.\n\nBefore exposing children to the potential risks of a new vaccine, he said, scientists need to answer basic questions about MS. For example, why does a virus that affects nearly everyone cause disease in a small fraction? And what roles do stress and other environmental conditions play in that equation?\n\nThe answer appears to be that Epstein-Barr is “necessary but not sufficient” to cause disease, said immunologist Bruce Bebo, executive vice president for research at the National MS Society, adding that the virus “may be the first in a string of dominoes.”\n\nHotez said researchers could continue to probe the mysteries surrounding Epstein-Barr and MS even as the vaccine efforts proceed. Further study is required to understand which populations might benefit most from a vaccine, and once more is known, Hotez said, such a vaccine possibly could be used in patients found to be at highest risk, such as organ transplant recipients, rather than administered universally to all young people.\n\n“Now that we know that Epstein-Barr is very tightly linked to MS, we could save a lot of lives if we develop the vaccine now,” Damania said, “rather than wait 10 years” until every question is answered.\n\nModerna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases launched separate clinical trials of Epstein-Barr vaccines over the past year. Epstein-Barr vaccines also are in early stages of testing at Opko Health, a Miami-based biotech company; Seattle’s Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center; and California’s City of Hope National Medical Center.\n\nScientists have sought to develop vaccines against Epstein-Barr for decades only to be thwarted by the complexities of the virus. Epstein-Barr “is a master of evading the immune system,” said Dr. Jessica Durkee-Shock, a clinical immunologist and principal investigator for NIAID’s trial.\n\nBoth MS and the cancers linked to Epstein-Barr develop many years after people are infected. So a trial designed to learn whether a vaccine can prevent these diseases would take decades and a lot of money.\n\nModerna researchers initially are focusing on a goal more easily measured: the prevention of mononucleosis, which doubles the risk of multiple sclerosis. Mono develops only a month or so after people are infected with Epstein-Barr, so scientists won’t have to wait as long for results.\n\nMono can be incredibly disruptive on its own, keeping students out of class and military recruits out of training for weeks. In about 10% of cases, the crippling fatigue lasts six months or more. In 1% of cases, patients develop complications, including hepatitis and neurological problems.\n\nFor now, the clinical trials for Epstein-Barr immunizations are enrolling only adults. “In the future, the perfect vaccine would be given to a small child,” Durkee-Shock said. “And it would protect them their whole life, and prevent them from getting mono or any other complication from the Epstein-Barr virus.”\n\nThe NIAID vaccine, being tested for safety in 40 volunteers, is built around ferritin, an iron-storage protein that can be manipulated to display a key viral protein to the immune system. Like a cartoon Transformer, the ferritin nanoparticle self-assembles into what looks like a “little iron soccer ball,” Durkee-Shock said. “This approach, in which many copies of the EBV protein are displayed on a single particle, has proved successful for other vaccines, including the HPV and hepatitis B vaccine.”\n\nModerna’s experimental vaccine, being tested in about 270 people, works more like the company’s covid shot. Both deliver snippets of a virus’s genetic information in molecules called mRNA inside a lipid nanoparticle, or tiny bubble of fat. Moderna, which has dozens of mRNA vaccines in development, hopes to learn from each and apply those lessons to Epstein-Barr, said Sumana Chandramouli, senior director and research program leader for infectious diseases at Moderna.\n\n“What the covid vaccine has shown us is that the mRNA technology is well tolerated, very safe, and highly efficacious,” Chandramouli said.\n\nBut mRNA vaccines have limitations.\n\nAlthough they have saved millions of lives during the covid pandemic, the antibody levels generated in response to the mRNA vaccines wane after a few months. It’s possible this rapid loss of antibodies is related specifically to the coronavirus and its rapidly evolving new strains, Hotez said. But if waning immunity is inherent in the mRNA technology, that could seriously limit future vaccines.\n\nGet CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.\n\nDesigning vaccines against Epstein-Barr is also more complicated than for covid. The Epstein-Barr virus and other herpesviruses are comparatively huge, four to five times as large as SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes covid. And while the coronavirus uses just one protein to infect human cells, the Epstein-Barr virus uses many, four of which are included in the Moderna vaccine.\n\nEarlier experimental Epstein-Barr vaccines targeting one viral protein lowered the rate of infectious mononucleosis but failed to prevent viral infection. Targeting multiple viral proteins may be more effective at preventing infection, said Damania, the UNC virologist.\n\n“If you close one door, the other door is still open,” Damania said. “You have to block infection in all cell types to have a successful vaccine that prevents future infections.”", "authors": ["Liz Szabo"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2023/08/17/new-york-asylum-seekers-public-health-crisis/70598475007/", "title": "Migrants bussed from the border is not just an immigration crisis ...", "text": "Dr. Marc Siegel\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIn 1903, my grandfather Alex entered the United States from Bialystok, Poland, following a pogrom that saw his parents killed. Once in the United States, he did not enter right away, despite a brother who was already here. Instead, he first waited at Ellis Island in New York Harbor, not just to be processed but also so that he could be screened for tuberculosis as well as other contagious diseases.\n\nAdmittedly, screening methods were ineffective back then compared with now, but immigrants knew that it was part of gaining admission to this land of promise, land of sanctuary.\n\n120 years later, I was out on the street in front of my office recently when I saw a man lying in the hundred degree heat barely moving. I examined him with my stethoscope and found that he was still breathing. I called 911 and the ambulance took him to the hospital where I had trained, Bellevue, which proudly takes all comers. The ambulance attendants said they thought the man was a migrant who had crossed the border from Mexico, and without being detained had been bussed to New York City, where he had nowhere to go but the street.\n\nMayor Eric Adams, who was initially welcoming in our status of sanctuary city, is now expressing alarm as about 100,000 asylum seekers have come to New York City since spring 2022. Our shelters are full, and there are few other places for them to go than the streets and the summer heat.\n\nAdams is making a major plea to the state and Gov. Kathy Hochul, but so far not nearly enough has been done. A public health emergency for the city is a public health emergency for the state and for the country as well. USA TODAY just reported \"plans to use $25 million in state funds to rent temporary homes for up to 1,250 asylum-seeking families who opt to leave New York City's crowded shelters.\" But this is just a drop in the bucket.\n\nMigrants could be carrying infectious diseases\n\nLast week I also visited migrants, including many children who looked at me with sad, expectant eyes, camped outside the Roosevelt Hotel here in Manhattan, without proper means to wash or toilet or without guaranteed hydration.\n\nThey were immediately at risk for dehydration and dysentery. I offered them my medical services, but they proudly refused.\n\nWhy aren't we searching for answers?More young Americans are dying – and it's not COVID\n\nMigrants could be bringing infectious diseases across our southern border. When they are bussed to New York and elsewhere, these diseases go with them. A recent study showed that more than 4% percent of migrants from Central and South America to Europe were sick with Chagas' disease. It's contagious without the help of an animal or a blood-sucking bug and can cause serious complications, including heart failure.\n\nTuberculosis is on the rise in this country, as is syphilis and other sexually transmitted infections.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that immigration applicants with communicable diseases are inadmissible to the United States, but they can’t be stopped if they aren't routinely screened before entering the country, as is the case with undocumented migrants.\n\nDr. Deborah L. Birx:Now that the COVID-19 national public health emergency is over, it’s time to fix the CDC\n\nWhat doctors and law enforcement face at the southern border\n\nNeha Jaggi Sood, a spokesperson at the Division of Global Migration and Quarantine at the CDC, told me that though the CDC has ”comprehensive systems to track communicable diseases,” they do not “track diseases by immigration status.”\n\nSood added that “underreporting might occur.”\n\nDr. James Hodges, an internist practicing at the Texas border, told me that in his experience, the “open border” is leading to more drug-resistant tuberculosis in the United States because patients are only partly treated by over-the-counter antibiotics available in Mexico.\n\nIn southern Arizona, Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb told me, “Border Patrol and local agencies have seen all types of diseases like tuberculosis, scabies, COVID, hepatitis A and B, gonorrhea, syphilis, mumps, chicken pox, dengue fever, etc. When the discussion was hot and heavy about Title 42 (a law that allows denial of entry to limit the spread of a disease) going away, I would consistently say it wasn’t just about COVID; it was about all the other health hazards being brought across our borders.”\n\nDr. Paul Offit, head of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, told me in a radio interview recently that it is measles that keeps him up at night. With measles vaccination rates dropping, and not all undocumented migrants are screened for measles before entry, he might well be right.\n\nMeasles and other vaccines are offered to eligible U.S.-bound migrants and refugees, but there's no enforcement in place yet.\n\nThe health risk extends wherever the migrants are sent, including here in New York City. The porous border is not just a national security crisis, it is also a public health emergency.\n\nDr. Marc Siegel, a member of USA TODAY's Board of Contributors, is a professor of medicine and medical director of Doctor Radio at New York University's Langone Health.

Although no actual votes were changed, hackers did breach Illinois' voter registration database.\n\nOn Friday, special counsel Robert Mueller filed his first criminal charges against Russian citizens and businesses for what he called a wide-ranging effort to undermine the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\"The threat is real and the response needs to be robust and coordinated,\" said Matthew Masterson, chairman of the Election Assistance Commission, an independent agency of the U.S. government that provides information about how to administer elections. \"Folks in the election community are taking the threats very seriously and taking whatever steps they can to address it.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nSo far, Congress has done little to help.\n\nA bipartisan Senate bill to provide $386 million in federal grants to states to help them improve their election systems hasn't received a hearing or vote in the Senate Rules and Administration Committee. And there are no immediate plans by Senate leaders to bring the Secure Elections Act to the floor for a vote.\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., who introduced the bill with Sens. James Lankford, R-Okla., Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif., said she will try to attach it to a must-pass government-funding bill in March. She said more than 40 states rely on electronic voting systems that are at least 10 years old.\n\n\"Two-hundred-and-sixty six. That's the number of days left before the 2018 (general) election ... a little more than 9 months and we still cannot assure Americans that our elections are secure,\" Klobuchar said Monday during a speech at the Center for American Progress. \"It is unacceptable and, at this point now, it's on us.\"\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who is co-sponsoring Klobuchar's bill, said Congress needs to act soon to do states any good.\n\n\"This is an election year in our country, and it's frankly frustrating to me that we haven't passed legislation to help states strengthen the security of their voting systems,\" Collins said Tuesday at a hearing where the heads of the FBI, CIA and National Security Agency warned the Senate Intelligence Committee that Russian hackers will target the 2018 congressional elections.\n\nThe committee plans to release a plan soon to help give states recommendations on ways to protect their voting systems. The first primary is set for March 6 in Texas, followed by one on March 20 in Illinois. There is also a special election for a western Pennsylvania congressional district March 13.\n\nThe Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, released a report this week evaluating state election systems. Not a single state received an \"A\" rating. Eleven states received a B, 23 states received a C, 12 states received a D, and five states received an F.\n\nMasterson said financially strapped state election agencies could use more funds to safeguard against cyber attacks.\n\n\"Whether it’s at the congressional level, state level or the local level there’s a big need for resources for elections officials,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, states are doing what they can.\n\nIn Mississippi, Secretary of State Delbert Hosemann said his agency just finished encrypting its system, including its voter database, and recently paid $27,750 for a company to try to hack its election system. The hackers could not penetrate the system.\n\n\"That doesn’t mean it’s not hackable,\" Hosemann said. \"I guess everything is in some form or fashion. We continue to be vigilant about that. We have all kinds of firewalls.\"\n\nOther states have set up task forces and hired cyber security experts. Election officials also created the Government Coordinating Council last fall to improve communication between federal agencies and state and local officials.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security came under fire last year for taking so long to tell states about Russia's hacking attempts.\n\n\"They have not been as helpful as they could have been. That’s probably an understatement,’’ said Alabama Secretary of State John Merrill, who complained to federal officials. \"We were not pleased with the communication that we received. Because if you’re not helping us by informing us about what we can do to be better prepared, then why are you even talking?\"\n\nMerrill, a Republican, said there has been a lack of communication under both the Obama and Trump administrations.\n\n\"This is not new,’\" he said. \"It’s something that has to receive attention.\"\n\nJeanette Manfra, the chief cybersecurity official for the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement Monday that \"there's no question\" that state, local and federal officials are \"making real and meaningful progress together.\"\n\n\"States will do their part in how they responsibly manage and implement secure voting processes,\" she said. \"For our part, we’re going to continue to support with risk and vulnerability assessments, offer cyber hygiene scans, provide real-time threat intel feeds, issue security clearances to state officials, partner on incident response planning, and deliver cybersecurity training.\"\n\nManfra said DHS \"will stand by our partners to protect our nation’s election infrastructure and ensure that all Americans can have confidence in our democratic elections.\"\n\nLouisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler said DHS officials are visiting his office next week to review any vulnerabilities in his system and offer advice.\n\n“I’m going to let them do as much as they can — as long as it’s free,\" he said.\n\nSchedler said the state also has taken steps to secure its equipment, including updating its laptops, and is staying in contact with federal security officials.\n\n“We are as comfortable as you can be comfortable in this day and age,\" Schedler said.. \"I don’t know if you ever can go to sleep and say nothing could ever happen, when I see the Department of Defense being hacked … I don’t want to be brash and say, ‘Oh it’s impossible.’ But we’ve always felt that we’ve done as good a job as you can do.\"\n\nSchedler, Hosemann, Merrill and other state election officials are in Washington, D.C. this weekend for the winter conference of the National Association of Secretaries of State and have have been invited by the Department of Homeland Security to a meeting to discuss election security.\n\nU.S. intelligence agency officials also will meet with election officials to discuss cyber threats and preventative steps that states can take, according to the office of the director of national intelligence.\n\nSchedler, a Republican, said he has little faith in federal officials or Congress.\n\n\"For the federal government to be telling me how to do it — and they get hacked every other week, I don’t have a lot of confidence in the folks telling me what I’m supposed to do,\" he said.\n\n", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/16/politics/russia-us-cyberattack-infrastructure-invs/index.html", "title": "US has 'significant' cyber vulnerabilities, but a sweeping Russian ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn the winter of 2015, computer hackers working for the Russian government attacked Ukraine’s power grid and switched off the lights and heat to more than 200,000 consumers.\n\nLast year, a cybercriminal group with operatives in Russia launched a successful ransomware attack on a key East Coast pipeline that forced the company, Colonial Pipeline, to temporarily close the spigot and pay 75 bitcoins – or $4.4 million – to bring it back online. It was the largest cyberattack on an oil facility in US history.\n\nAnd it was a Russian government lab that built tools used in one of the most dangerous cyber offensives in the history of the digital age, penetrating the control systems of a Saudi petrochemical plant in 2017 for the purpose of setting off an explosion that, had it succeeded, could have killed people.\n\nSo established is Russia’s reputation for cyber sabotage that on February 24 – as its troops began rolling into Ukraine – President Joe Biden issued a warning to the country and its autocratic leader, Vladimir Putin.\n\n“If Russia pursues cyberattacks against our companies, our critical infrastructure, we are prepared to respond,” he said during remarks from the White House.\n\nBut now, even as the Russian army drops bombs and mortar shells on civilians in hospitals and neighborhoods and its invasion of Ukraine nears its fourth week, no known nightmare cyber scenario — a widespread power outage, a poisoned water system, a crippled supply chain – has come to pass in Ukraine, the US or elsewhere.\n\nTo be sure, a ripple of smaller cyberattacks ricocheted through the websites of Ukrainian banks and government agencies just before the invasion, and larger attacks may still be in store for the besieged country of 43 million people.\n\nBut the general consensus among the nearly 20 experts who spoke with CNN for this story is that while Russia is well positioned to launch catastrophic cyberattacks on the US, it is not likely to do so.\n\n“We do need to consider this possibility as a low probability but high-impact scenario,” said Paul Prudhomme, the head of threat intelligence advisory at the cybersecurity firm IntSights.\n\nThe prospects for a grand-scale cyberattack in America are low, experts say. For one, Putin understands that his country’s cyber capabilities, though formidable, are outmatched by those of the United States, which is generally thought to be the most sophisticated player in the domain.\n\nThe federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency told CNN it hasn’t yet received any credible cyber threats resulting from the conflict in Ukraine, but it emphasized that the energy sector has been bolstering its defenses in recent years and is on high alert as it urgently prepares for any attempted breach.\n\nExperts say Russia’s ability to conduct an impactful cyberattack in the US shouldn’t be underestimated.\n\n“If we look at just what they’ve been able to do, there is only, according to public knowledge, one country out there that has any experience taking down electric systems – that’s Russia,” said Robert M. Lee, a cybersecurity expert who investigated the 2015 attack in Ukraine.\n\nTesting the waters\n\nCyberattacks against the US by Russia are more than merely possible – they’ve been happening for years on a low-grade scale.\n\nThe country has been testing the waters in the US, laying the groundwork, experts say, for a much more extensive cyber campaign.\n\nFor instance, in 2018, the Department of Homeland Security revealed that a group of state-sponsored hackers from Russia had compromised the networks of multiple US electric utilities the year prior and allowed intruders to gather detailed information on the control systems that US electric utilities use to power American communities.\n\nThat same year, the Department of Justice announced the indictments of 12 Russian intelligence officers for carrying out large-scale cyber operations against the Democratic Party in advance of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThen, in late 2020, came the most advanced cyber-op yet: About 100 organizations around the world – including multiple US government agencies – were revealed to have been breached by Russian hackers who compromised the software provider SolarWinds and exploited their access to monitor internal operations and withdraw data.\n\n(L-R) FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia, SolarWinds CEO Sudhakar Ramakrishna and Microsoft President Brad Smith testify during a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing on Capitol Hill on February 23, 2021. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nPutin has been systematically testing vulnerabilities in Europe and the US for the past four years, and is in a position to cause all sorts of economy-crushing problems, experts say.\n\n“They know how to weaponize these things – they’ve done it,” said Melissa Hathaway, who led cybersecurity initiatives in the presidential administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. “If I need to cause a national crisis in another country, they know how to do this, they’ve systematically been testing the system.”\n\nPrudhomme said a stealthy Russian hacking group called Energetic Bear – which has been tied to Moscow’s Federal Security Service, or FSB – is the most likely Russian third-party, state-sponsored actor to execute any high-level attack.\n\nThe group, which industry analysts refer to by several aliases, including “Dragonfly” and “Berserk Bear,” has carried out a number of successful hacks in recent years. In 2017, it targeted a nuclear power plant in Kansas in what cybersecurity experts refer to as a “watering hole”-type attack – a practice where hackers place malicious links on websites frequently visited by employees.\n\n“The group has a history of gaining access and maintaining access to US and European utility companies, but they don’t do anything with it,” Prudhomme said. “They want to have that access ready at a moment’s notice so, if and when they get the order on demand, they can flip the switch.”\n\nIn 2020, another state-sponsored Russian group identified by analysts as Cozy Bear, believed to be within Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, likely orchestrated the SolarWinds hack. US officials said the group used SolarWinds software to breach internal email systems at the US Treasury and Commerce departments, among other key agencies, in what was one of the largest-ever cyber attacks.\n\nBut it’s a two-way street. Experts say that while it’s true Russians are lurking in the software of various structural areas, Americans are also lurking in theirs.\n\nIt’s the “cyber equivalent of mutually assured destruction,” said Karen Walsh, CEO of a cybersecurity firm called Allegro Solutions, using a term that historically described a philosophy of deterrence during the nuclear standoff of the Cold War.\n\nAnd the Americans, experts say, are currently the more capable threat.\n\nWhile Russian cyberattacks tend to attract headlines, experts told CNN, the most sophisticated hacks are often carried out in a more professionalized manner by countries such as the US and Israel, which are good at hiding their tracks. One secret operation that spilled into public view in 2010 was known as Stuxnet, in which the US and Israel are widely believed to have jointly sabotaged a nuclear facility in Iran with a computer virus that temporarily hampered the country’s nuclear program.\n\nPutin, experts say, understands the extent of this sophistication and is likely loath to poke the bear.\n\n“He seems to recognize that that’s a different level of escalation,” Timothy Frye, Columbia professor and author of “Weak Strongman: The Limits of Power in Putin’s Russia,” said of a crippling cyberattack on a major electric utility in the US or another NATO country. “That might be part of the calculations as well.”\n\nStill, some experts say, Europe’s critical infrastructure could be an enticing target for Russia. That’s in part because the continent is far more dependent on Russian oil than the US is.\n\n“I don’t think anyone’s thought through how much control Russia has over the future of Europe,” said Hathaway, now the president of Hathaway Global Strategies.\n\nPutin has been most willing to wreak havoc on the Ukrainian power grid, which the Russians also hacked in 2016 – just a year after shutting off power to more than 200,000 consumers.\n\nLee said the second attack – which reportedly took out about a fifth of the power consumption in Kyiv for an hour – was by far the more impressive of the two.\n\n“That one scared the hell out of everybody,” said Lee, now CEO of a cybersecurity firm called Dragos and a former cyber warfare specialist with the Air Force. “That was a capability they developed that could be deployed on any electric transmission site in the world and have reliable effects everywhere. Like, it was – it was bad.”\n\nThe United States and the United Kingdom also have blamed the NotPetya hack of 2017 – which the Trump administration called “the most destructive and costly cyber-attack in history” – on Russia.\n\nThe NotPetya attack was launched against a Ukrainian accounting software firm, but the malware spread to companies across the globe, resulting in billions of dollars in damage.\n\n“It was part of the Kremlin’s ongoing effort to destabilize Ukraine and demonstrates ever more clearly Russia’s involvement in the ongoing conflict,” White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in 2018.\n\nSome experts say the extensive meddling in Ukraine is due in part to how the country is seen as a kind of testing ground for belligerent cyberactivity. This is because the country’s power grid is in some ways similar in structure to those in the US and other Western countries, but Ukraine’s ability to retaliate has historically been minimal.\n\nStill, the US has seen a rise in high-profile cyberattacks. The growing threat prompted Biden to issue an executive order in May to shore up the nation’s cybersecurity and protect federal government networks. And it is a reminder that cyber defense in the United States has troubling vulnerabilities.\n\nThe US has ‘significant’ cyber vulnerabilities\n\nIf the Colonial Pipeline breach demonstrated anything, it is the extent to which critical infrastructure in America is susceptible to cyberattacks.\n\nThat event in May prompted the Georgia-based company to shut down the pipeline for the first time in its 57-year history. The six-day shutdown scrambled logistics for several airlines and caused a panic at the pump that led to shortages and briefly raised gas prices. But while it was allegedly carried out by a Russian hacker group called DarkSide, authorities haven’t been able to link it to the Kremlin. (In fact, the Russian domestic intelligence agency arrested the alleged culprit – though the hacker was not extradited.) The ordeal ended when Colonial ponied up the $4.4 million ransom — more than half of which was later recovered by the Justice Department.\n\nMotorists wait in line at a gas station on May 12, 2021 in Fayetteville, North Carolina, following the Colonial Pipeline hack. Sean Rayford/Getty Images\n\nThat attack, Prudhomme stressed, was financially motivated. The hackers, he said, used a compromised password found in a dark-web data dump and were able to employ an inactive VPN account to penetrate the Colonial Pipeline’s network, which didn’t use multifactor authentication.\n\n“Criminal hackers will tend to go for low-hanging fruit,” he said. “The point of entry here was fairly simple.”\n\nAnother sensitive breach happened in early 2021, when hackers – whose country of origin isn’t known – were able to gain access to a Florida water treatment facility by using dormant remote access software for the purpose of poisoning the water supply. The hack was quickly caught by a human operator at the facility. But the incident illustrates the dangers of remote access work without proper security: The plant had used multiple computers running an aging version of Microsoft Windows to monitor the facility remotely. All of the computers shared a single password.\n\nAbout a year later – this past January – the Biden administration announced a plan to shore up the cyber defenses of the nation’s roughly 150,000 public water systems.\n\nBut even if localized networks are vulnerable, experts say that the American power grid is far too complex to shut down in one simple motion.\n\n“For a successful attack to be able to take the lights out, they need to gain access to a lot of different points … and nobody is looking,” said Vikram Thakur, technical director at cybersecurity company Symantec. “We don’t think it’s plausible.”\n\nSophisticated hackers could, however, still seize on any vulnerabilities to cause smaller-scale damage to the electrical grid and other means of energy production.\n\nSmaller utility companies may not be able to make enough of an investment in cybersecurity, potentially making their systems more vulnerable to attacks. The equipment and devices specifically used to distribute electricity to consumers are also more at risk, experts say, because they are not required to adhere to federal cybersecurity standards that apply to the higher-voltage generators and transmission lines in the electrical industry.\n\nAnd while new cybersecurity requirements were introduced for certain oil and gas pipelines last year, they are not as comprehensive as the electrical industry standards and there aren’t federal cybersecurity regulations for water systems, said Ernie Hayden, who has spent decades working in the power sector, identifying risks to energy and electric providers as a chief information security officer, cybersecurity engineer and consultant.\n\nIf networks aren’t properly secured, a hacker could not only launch a ransomware or malware attack but directly infiltrate systems, known as operational technology, that control critical equipment, said Hayden.\n\nDepending on the location of the attack and the lack of controls, this could result in a range of potential outcomes. If hackers get into the operational controls of a water system – as nearly happened in Florida last year – they could potentially poison a water supply by causing chlorine to be injected at a dangerous level, said Hayden. They could cause short power outages if they found a way to access devices that control the circuit breakers at one of the country’s tens of thousands of substations, which are used to transform voltage before electricity is delivered. And turning off the ventilation controls or valves that control the flow of chemicals, gas and oil at refineries could cause equipment failures and leaks, he said.\n\nEven these smaller-scale, localized disruptions are unlikely, however, and experts said they would not cause the cascading blackouts or mass destruction that many fear. But they could still have a psychological impact, which may be the intent of the attacker.\n\nTom Alrich, a cybersecurity risk management consultant specializing in supply chain threats to software, said he doesn’t believe hackers, including any from Russia, would be able to cause outages by accessing electrical infrastructure. Even if they could, he said, they would get nothing out of it. Instead, Alrich said, the focus should be on ransomware attacks that shut down a company’s operations without directly attacking the systems that control the physical infrastructure, which is what happened in the case of the Colonial Pipeline, or cyberattacks that “poison” the software developed by a given company or organization, such as the infamous SolarWinds hack.\n\nMax Stier, president and CEO of Partnership for Public Service – a nonpartisan non-profit that promotes better government – pointed to some federal failures. He noted that the Department of Energy has some key positions unfilled because the US Senate has been slow to confirm nominees.\n\n“The notion of cyber risk is profound,” Stier said. “It’s a battlefield that doesn’t respect physical boundaries, one where we know the Russians already have been playing, and not just the Russians; and it’s one where we have significant vulnerability.”\n\nCORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated the number of organizations breached in the SolarWinds hack.

The hack occurred on Friday, according to the interior ministry, and by early Saturday evening, the ministry said it expected to have all aspects of the TIMS restored soon.\n\nThe incident poses a fresh challenge for the Biden administration, which this week vowed to “hold Iran accountable for actions that threaten the security of a US ally” and NATO member following the July cyberattack.\n\nThe Treasury Department on Friday sanctioned Iran’s spy agency for allegedly carrying out the July hack, which knocked some Albanian government services offline and left the Albanian government scrambling to recover. The White House said US officials were on the ground for weeks helping. Albania severed diplomatic relations with Iran in what may be the first case of hacking prompting a break in ties between countries.\n\nThe July hack took place before a conference in Albania due to be attended by members of MEK, an Iranian group that advocates the overthrow of the Iranian government and that Tehran considers a terrorist organization.\n\n“We strongly condemn such malicious cyber activities designed to destabilize and harm the security of an Ally, and disrupt the daily lives of citizens,” NATO members in a statement Thursday.\n\nIn response, Iran’s embassy in Brussels on Friday “rejected the baseless accusations” that Iran was behind the July hack.\n\nA spokesperson for the Iranian Permanent Mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Saturday on the latest hacking incident.\n\nThe US government in 2007 helped Albania, an ally in the Bush administration’s self-described “war on terrorism,” deploy the TIMS hardware and software systems for processing immigration, according to an archived State Department page.\n\nThe White House National Security Council late Saturday condemned the latest hack and reiterated that the US government is “supporting Albania’s efforts to mitigate and recover.”\n\nNATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has said a cyberattack could trigger NATO’s collective defense clause, requiring all members to defend an attack on another member. But that principle has never been tested in practice, and it’s unclear what the threshold for such a collective defense is.\n\n“Unfortunately, I wouldn’t be surprised if it were true [that Iran was behind the latest hack],” John Hultquist, vice president of intelligence analysis at security firm Mandiant, which investigated the July hack, told CNN. “States like Iran don’t seem to be deterred by diplomatic solutions. It’s as if the price of these incidents is ultimately acceptable to them.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional reaction.", "authors": ["Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/09/10"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/08/politics/china-hacking-state-governments-mandiant/index.html", "title": "Cybersecurity firm says Chinese hackers breached six US state ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nA Chinese government-backed hacking group has breached local government agencies in at least six US states in the last 10 months as part of a persistent information-gathering operation, investigators at cybersecurity firm Mandiant said Tuesday.\n\nThe wide range of state agencies targeted include “health, transportation, labor (including unemployment benefit systems), higher education, agriculture, and court networks and systems,” the FBI and US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in a separate, private advisory to state governments obtained by CNN.\n\nFor agencies in two states, the hackers broke into networks using a critical software flaw that was revealed in December just as the Biden administration was scrambling to respond to the flaw’s discovery, according to Mandiant.\n\nThe revelation shows how difficult it can be to keep state-backed hackers from accessing US networks — even when US officials are sounding the alarm about a potential threat. And it’s a reminder that as many analysts are watching for Russian cyber threats during the Ukraine war, other foreign governments aren’t letting up in targeting US networks.\n\nThe hackers’ motives aren’t clear, but their victims are “consistent with an espionage operation,” the firm said. The list of state agencies affected by the hacking could grow as the investigation continues.\n\nCISA on December 10 publicly warned that Log4J — software used by big tech firms around the world — had a vulnerability that hackers could easily exploit to gain further access to computer systems.\n\nHundreds of millions of computers around the world ran the vulnerable software, US officials later estimated. For weeks, US officials urged companies to update their software; the White House hosted a meeting in January with tech executives to try to address the root problem of software that is not secure by design.\n\nWithin hours of the CISA advisory, the Chinese hackers had begun using the Log4J flaw to break into the two US state agencies, according to Mandiant. Agencies in four other states were hacked via other means.\n\nIn one state, Mandiant said, the hackers accessed personal data on some Americans, including names, email addresses and mobile phone numbers. Mandiant declined to name the US states or agencies affected.\n\nWhile the hackers’ ultimate objectives are unclear, state agencies could provide a wealth of useful information to foreign spies, whether data related to elections or government contracting.\n\n“This campaign is likely still going on. [The hackers] probably haven’t completed their mission,” said Rufus Brown, senior threat analyst at Mandiant’s Advanced Practices team.\n\nThe hackers have used multiple methods to access the state agency networks, and in some cases have returned to the same compromised network after Mandiant specialists contained the activity.\n\n“CISA is actively working with our JCDC [Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative] private sector partners, including Mandiant, and government partners to address this advanced persistent threat to state government agencies and assist impacted entities,” a CISA spokesperson said. “We encourage all organizations and critical infrastructure entities impacted by cyber intrusions to report to CISA, and to visit CISA.gov to take action to protect themselves.”\n\nMandiant blamed the hacking campaign on a group that the Justice Department has linked with China’s civilian intelligence agency. That hacking group, according to a US indictment unsealed in September 2020, has been linked to attempts to breach hundreds of organizations around the world, from hardware makers to pro-democracy politicians in Hong Kong.\n\n“We firmly oppose and combat cyberattacks of any kind,” Chinese Embassy in Washington spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in an email. “We oppose making groundless accusations against China on cyber security and other related issues.”\n\nWhile Russian spying operations, such as the so-called SolarWinds hacking campaign, have gained considerable attention, analysts say Chinese hacking continues to pose a challenge to the Biden administration’s efforts to defend government networks. Suspected Chinese hackers compromised at least five US defense and technology firms in an apparent espionage effort, CNN reported in December.\n\n“We assess that China presents the broadest, most active, and persistent cyber espionage threat to US Government and private sector networks,” US intelligence agencies said in their annual assessment of global threats released on Tuesday.", "authors": ["Sean Lyngaas"], "publish_date": "2022/03/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/10/26/pharmacy-chains-dangerous-conditions-medication-errors/71153960007/", "title": "Pharmacy chains ignored pleas to fix broken system. Now it's in revolt", "text": "Pharmacists with the nation’s largest retail pharmacy chain felt dangerously burned out.\n\nIt was August 2020. The pandemic was in full swing, straining an already weary workforce hit by a decade of relentless budget cuts and rising demands.\n\nOne by one, the pharmacists dialed into a weekly conference call with their boss. He could have empathized with them or addressed the reality of their pressure-cooker environment – one that breeds medication errors and creates missed opportunities to prevent potentially deadly mistakes.\n\nInstead, CVS District Leader Khalil Haidar turned up the heat. He harped on his Texas-and-Louisiana-based team to hit corporate quotas: Sell more store memberships. Push for more prescription pickups. Vaccinate more people. He threatened discipline and staff cuts unless pharmacists convinced at least five customers that week to get a flu shot before flu season had even officially started.\n\n“If you get your goal, nobody will come after you,\" Haidar said on the call, one of several recorded and shared with USA TODAY. \"And many patients, they are ignorant. They don’t know what the flu is ... How are you going to convince them? How can you persuade them? That’s your job as a pharmacist.”\n\nPharmacists take an oath to hold patient safety in the highest regard when preparing and dispensing medication. But rising pressures inside the nation’s largest retail chains have forced pharmacists to choose between that oath and their job.\n\nThe situation was bad before the pandemic. COVID-19 made it worse. It has only gone downhill since then. Frustrations boiled over this autumn in a series of high-profile walkouts that left a string of CVS and Walgreens pharmacies shuttered or short-staffed. Those actions might have caught consumers off guard. But inside the troubled industry, it was the clarion call of a beleaguered workforce pushed to the brink.\n\nCorporations like CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Walmart have consistently slashed pharmacy staffing levels while simultaneously saddling their frontline workers with a burgeoning list of additional duties.\n\nStores that a decade ago might have had two pharmacists and six pharmacy technicians filling an average of 500 prescriptions a day now may have half the staff and an even higher prescription volume – plus an endless crush of vaccine appointments, rapid tests and patient consultation calls.\n\nEvery task is timed and measured against corporate goals that reward speed and profits. Staff who do not fill prescriptions fast enough, answer the phones quickly enough or drum up enough vaccination business can face discipline, reassignment or termination.\n\nPharmacists said it’s nearly impossible to meet all the demands without cutting corners, and when corners get cut, patients can get hurt.\n\n“The public’s health is in danger,” said Oklahoma City pharmacist Bled Tanoe, who quit her job at Walgreens in August 2021 over what she considered unsafe staffing levels and an emphasis on hitting corporate targets. “The incidents of error are multiplied by infinity.”\n\nUSA TODAY interviewed four dozen current and former retail pharmacists from different chains across the nation and spoke with industry leaders, patient advocates and patients harmed by pharmacy errors. Many pharmacists spoke to USA TODAY on the condition of anonymity to protect their jobs.\n\nThe media organization also reviewed more than 100 emails from chain pharmacists sharing their concerns; inspected internal emails, text messages, metric score sheets and coaching notes; and listened to more than five hours of recorded conference calls.\n\nThese interviews, audio recordings and documents – along with dozens of pharmacist workplace surveys, task force studies and state board of pharmacy reports – add up to a prescription for disaster.\n\n“I could cry as to what’s happening in my profession,” said Daniel A. Hussar, a professor and dean emeritus at the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, where he taught for 52 years before retiring in 2018 to focus on his family and his blog, The Pharmacist Activist.\n\nHussar lamented the transformation of a once-vaunted career into the equivalent of a fast-food job whose workers are pressured to upsell every customer and race through every order. Mistakes in that environment are not only common, he said, they’re potentially fatal.\n\n“At corporations like CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Rite Aid – the huge pharmacies – errors are a cost of doing business,” Hussar said. “I don’t think the boards of pharmacy or the colleges of pharmacy or the professional associations are doing enough to address the issues.”\n\nFor years, pharmacists have reported these problems to their state boards, complained to their professional organizations and warned the media. The New York Times wrote about how the dangerous workload imperils patient safety just before the pandemic hit U.S. shores.\n\nPromises were made and broken – documented by pharmacists themselves in state surveys that followed.\n\nIn California, 91% of chain pharmacists surveyed by the state Board of Pharmacy in 2021 said they lacked the staff needed to ensure adequate patient care. More than half of pharmacists polled by the Kansas Board of Pharmacy in 2022 said they didn’t feel they could perform their jobs safely; the biggest reasons cited were a lack of adequate staffing and employer-imposed metrics, like filling a specific number of prescriptions a day or providing service to customers within a set time.\n\nHundreds of pharmacists in Ohio responded to a 2020 callout from their state board about the toll of their workload on patient safety in a report made public in the next year.\n\n“I feel a mistake is breathing down my neck as I try to manage all the tasks that I am asked to perform,” one wrote. Another said they had left the profession because “the environment was set up for me to fail.”\n\nState regulatory bodies overseeing pharmacies have for years refused to intervene. Their role is mainly to protect consumers, not pharmacists, and they traditionally considered many of these complaints – staffing, metrics, workload – outside their purview. They were seen as business decisions, not consumer safety issues, said Karen Winslow, interim executive director of the Virginia Pharmacy Association.\n\nThat’s starting to change, but not without a fight.\n\nOhio proposed a series of rules this year aimed at improving pharmacy working conditions. Among them: A ban on quotas and requirements for sufficient staffing. The rules are currently pending a vote amid overwhelming support from pharmacists and opposition from retail pharmacy chains, including Walgreens and CVS.\n\n“The Board should stay focused on the regulation of the practice of pharmacy rather than the business of pharmacy,” wrote CVS Director of Regulatory Affairs John Long in opposing an early version of Ohio’s rules last year.\n\nVirginia passed emergency regulations in late September also banning production quotas and bolstering pharmacy staffing. Those rules are in effect until March 2025, giving the state time to develop and pass more permanent measures.\n\nEnforcing these rules could prove challenging. California, one of the first states to outlaw pharmacy production quotas and mandate minimum staffing, is coping with routine violations by retail pharmacies that then fail to provide records to inspectors seeking to verify complaints, state Board of Pharmacy minutes show.\n\nProfessional associations, meanwhile, have earned their members’ scorn for hosting workshops on resiliency rather than advocating for better working conditions. Many pharmacists told USA TODAY they feel like no one stands up for them.\n\nThat, too, is starting to change. In the wake of the CVS walkouts last month, the new head of the American Pharmacists Association, the industry’s largest professional organization, flew to Kansas City to meet with the organizers and committed to more aggressive leadership on these issues.\n\n“The APhA has been focused on longer-term fixes, and what we’ve heard loud and clear is we need to focus on the acute problems,” said Michael Hogue, the association’s chief executive officer and executive vice president. “That’s what we’re going to do.”\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to CVS, Walgreens, Walmart and Rite Aid for comment.\n\nRepresentatives of CVS and Walgreens generally acknowledged the challenges their pharmacists have faced in recent years but denied allegations of dangerous working conditions. They said goal-based metrics on measurable objectives such as quick prescription turnarounds, short telephone hold times and vaccination volumes are standard within the industry and meant to assess quality rather than penalize staff.\n\nCVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and Walmart all emphasized their commitments to patient safety and described their various efforts to continually reduce error rates.\n\n“Patient safety is our highest priority,” Amy Thibault, CVS Pharmacy’s lead director of external communications, told USA TODAY. “Our more than 30,000 CVS pharmacists approach this responsibility with seriousness and dedication and we work hard to earn the trust of our pharmacy patients.”\n\nCVS, Walgreens and Walmart also said they have invested in new technologies to streamline services, increased wages to better recruit and retain staff, and rolled out new initiatives to support their teams and reduce their workloads.\n\nThe major chains now provide half-hour lunch breaks for staff. Many also recently announced reduced pharmacy hours at locations nationwide. Walmart spokesman Tyler Thomason said reduced operating hours promote a “better work/life balance.”\n\nBut pharmacists told USA TODAY their workloads remain the same and that they’re pressured to work through lunch and stay late to finish everything. At locations where hours were cut, many pharmacists said, they’ve seen their salaries decrease accordingly.\n\n“I’ve given the company thousands and thousands of dollars in free labor,” said a CVS pharmacist who was on Haidar’s team during the pandemic-era conference calls. “Our bosses can log into the computer any time and tell how far behind we are. They will send group texts and say, ‘I see you’re trending behind. What are your plans to finish it tonight?’ Very intimidating comments. You fear for your job all the time.”\n\nHaidar, who now leads a different team, told USA TODAY the recordings must have been altered and that he never threatened staff with discipline for falling short of vaccination goals. He also said they are not an accurate depiction of his leadership. When asked if he would like to listen to the recordings, Haidar declined.\n\nMichael DeAngelis, CVS’ executive director of corporate communications, said it is not the company’s “policy or practice to penalize pharmacy teams regarding the number of vaccinations they administer” and that it “is committed to compensating our colleagues appropriately for the hours they work.”\n\nDeAngelis also said CVS recently reduced its pharmacy metrics by 50%, but he declined to provide additional details.\n\nWalgreens announced last year the complete elimination of performance-based metrics, the only major chain to have taken such a step. But interviews with pharmacists and documents provided to USA TODAY show the company continues to push staff to hit unrealistic goals.\n\nOne Walgreens pharmacist said she was reprimanded earlier this month for taking too long to verify prescriptions, even though her extra diligence had caught several serious mistakes.\n\nAccording to notes from her coaching session, shared with USA TODAY, she should take less than 30 seconds to verify the accuracy and appropriateness of every prescription, in addition to checking for potential problems like drug allergies or interactions.\n\n“I pray every day that I don’t miss something or cause a patient harm,” said the Tennessee-based pharmacist, who estimates she handles several hundred prescriptions daily. “I feel guilty knowing that I would want someone to double check the math on a prescription of antibiotics for my child, but I don’t have time to do that for their child.”\n\nMedication errors: A pharmacist's worst nightmare\n\nMedication errors are a pharmacist’s worst nightmare. Many told USA TODAY they lie awake at night wondering if, in their haste, they made a mistake that might hurt or kill someone.\n\nIn May 2021, that someone was Brenden Fisher.\n\nThe Sarasota, Florida, child overdosed on a newly prescribed anti-seizure medication after the CVS pharmacy near his home dispensed the drug with the wrong instructions on the label.\n\nBy the third dose, Brenden was lethargic, dazed and struggling to breathe. His parents, Paris Bean and Jason Fisher, rushed their then-2-year-old to the hospital, thinking he was dying.\n\nHospital staff didn’t know what was wrong with him, Bean recalled, until a nurse asked if he was taking his 1.2 ml of levetiracetam twice daily.\n\nWhen Bean told her the instructions said to give him 7.5 ml, “you could almost hear her jaw drop,” Bean recalled. “She said, ‘Did you give that to him?’ And I said, ‘Yes. Is that why we’re here?’ She said, ‘I wouldn’t be surprised.’”\n\nBrenden still suffers from a full-body tic he first developed during the incident, his parents said. Dozens of times a day, he will suddenly stop whatever he is doing, clasp his hands together, clench his jaw and tense every muscle in his body while staring off into space. Each episode lasts anywhere from 5-10 seconds.\n\nHis parents haven’t been able to definitively link the tic to the overdose, but they said they have no other explanation for it.\n\nAnti-seizure medications like levetiracetam depress the central nervous system, Hussar said. Because nerves tell muscles when to contract and relax, he said, there could be a connection between the overdose and Brenden’s involuntary muscle contractions.\n\nBean said she blames CVS for the mistake but also herself: “I’m the one who physically administered it ... I could have killed him.”\n\nCVS declined to comment on the error.\n\nBean and her husband filed a lawsuit against CVS in February that was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum. But they said they did not file a complaint with the Florida Board of Pharmacy.\n\nThat means it’s one of countless errors for which there’s no official tally or public record.\n\nDespite a widespread industry belief that medication errors are on the rise as a result of unsafe working conditions, there is no reliable or comprehensive public data to prove it.\n\nNo federal agency requires pharmacists to report medication errors, and few state boards of pharmacy mandate it. Many pharmacies and pharmacy chains track errors internally but do not share the numbers with the public. CVS and Walgreens both declined to share their data with USA TODAY.\n\n“There really is no way of knowing how many errors are actually out there,” said Larry Selkow, a retired California pharmacist who recently served on the American Public Health Association’s task force on pharmacy medication safety issues.\n\nThe group estimated U.S. pharmacies annually make 54 million dispensing errors, of which 2.3 million are potentially harmful. It recommended the establishment of a national pharmacy reporting system to collect data on errors and their underlying causes. Having such information, Selkow said, would allow pharmacies to adopt practices to prevent future mistakes.\n\nNumerous pharmacists told USA TODAY that errors are not consistently reported – even internally. Small mistakes and those caught early are routinely hidden.\n\n“Some pharmacists don’t report it especially if they’ve already had, like, five errors that year,\" said Shane Jerominski, a California pharmacist who worked for both Walgreens and CVS. \"For every error that gets found out, there will be an error that never gets caught.\"\n\nEven when they do report potentially fatal errors, some pharmacists said, no one from their companies investigates how they occurred or makes changes to prevent them from repeating.\n\nA former CVS pharmacy manager at a short-staffed, high-volume store in Georgia said he was horrified when one of his patients who was prescribed Bisoprolol for high blood pressure accidentally received a sleeping aid called Belsomra and got sick after she started taking it.\n\nThe pharmacist, who now works for Walmart, said he had hoped the error would be a wake-up call for higher-ups who might finally give his store adequate staffing. It didn’t work out that way.\n\n“They had me do that little report, but my manager, nobody ever followed up,” he said. “They were like, ‘OK, cool, see if she would like a gift card, and we’ll handle it from here.’ And that was it. It’s like they could care less. Like it didn’t even happen.”\n\nCVS did not comment on the incident, but Thibault said that the company’s first priority when it learns of any error is the patient’s safety. She said it then takes steps to correct the error and learn from it. Walgreens said in a statement that it’s mandatory for employees to report errors under the company’s “Continuous Quality Improvement Program.”\n\n“We take any prescription error very seriously and have a multi-step prescription filling process with numerous safety checks to minimize the rare chance of human error,” said Marty Maloney, Walgreens’ senior manager of media relations.\n\nPharmacists are personally liable for medication errors and risk fines, discipline and loss of license if investigated and found responsible by their state board. Many told USA TODAY they get little or no support from their company when mistakes happen, even if the conditions imposed by those companies contributed to the error.\n\nThe Nevada Board of Pharmacy in September fined and suspended the licenses of two CVS pharmacists who accidentally gave a pregnant woman the abortion drug misoprostol instead of the fertility treatment she was prescribed. The mistake, which was first reported by 8NewsNow in Las Vegas, ended the woman’s pregnancy.\n\nThe Nevada board also fined CVS $10,000 over the objections of company attorney William Stilling who argued CVS itself did nothing wrong.\n\n“The only allegation” against CVS, Stilling said, “is that they had these pharmacists.”\n\nPharmacy benefit managers played role in the current crisis\n\nRetail pharmacy wasn’t always this bleak.\n\nTwenty years ago the industry was thriving. CVS and Walgreens were opening new locations at a rapid clip. New pharmacy schools popped up to meet the needs of a profession in high demand. Meanwhile, Americans’ appetite for prescription drugs was soaring.\n\nIndependent and chain pharmacies alike were earning relatively healthy profits from drug sales and could afford to hire and retain enough staff to keep their operations humming.\n\nA constellation of factors contributed to the industry’s downturn. They include rising drug costs, changing consumer habits and the emergence of online pharmacies.\n\nBut none looms larger than the outsized influence of pharmacy benefit managers. These third-party administrators of health insurers’ prescription drug programs have eroded the profits of retail pharmacies to the point where they now lose money on many sales.\n\n“In today’s world, 7 out of 10 medicines dispensed by a pharmacy are dispensed at a loss,” Hogue said, referring to the non-generic drugs that represent pharmacies’ largest expense.\n\nPharmacy benefit managers, commonly referred to as PBMs, act as a middleman between the insurers, the drug manufacturers and the pharmacies. They negotiate drug prices with manufacturers, determine which drugs will be covered by insurance plans and set reimbursement rates for pharmacies that buy and sell the drugs.\n\nAs the power of PBMs rose over the years, they demanded bigger rebates from drug manufacturers and pocketed increasingly bigger shares of those savings instead of passing them along. They also lowered pharmacy reimbursement rates and tacked on hefty fees known as Direct and Indirect Remuneration.\n\nThe three largest PBMs – ExpressScripts, owned by Cigna; CVS Caremark, owned by CVS Health; and OptumRx, owned by the same company as UnitedHealthcare – control a majority of the market.\n\nWhile PBMs’ collective profits skyrocketed over the past decade, their tactics plunged retail pharmacies into financial distress and left them scrambling for alternative sources of revenue, like vaccinations, to stay afloat.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission launched an inquiry last year into PBM practices, which have already been the subject of several lawsuits.\n\nIndependent pharmacies have been hit especially hard. Not only are their reimbursement rates lower than those of chains, but their patients have been steered away by PBMs that insist they use a preferred chain pharmacy instead.\n\nCharles Thompson, a pharmacist and independent owner of Grove Park Pharmacy in Orangeburg, South Carolina, said he has lost countless customers who were told by their PBMs to use CVS and Walgreens instead. Between that and the lower reimbursements, he said, Grove Park had to diversify to stay open. It now offers an in-store medical clinic, hospice services and medical equipment rentals.\n\n“If I had to rely only on filling prescriptions,” Thompson said. “I would be out of business.”\n\nOther independent pharmacies simply closed. The United States has lost more than 3,500 mom-and-pop pharmacies in the past decade, according to data from the National Community Pharmacists Association, which represents independent pharmacies.\n\n“The independents have been the canaries in the coal mine,” said B. Douglas Hoey, chief executive officer of the National Community Pharmacists Association.\n\nNow the chains are following suit. CVS, Walgreens and Rite Aid all recently announced the closure of hundreds of pharmacies as they face slumping revenues and the fallout from multiple lawsuits for their alleged roles in the nation’s opioid crisis. Rite Aid filed for bankruptcy earlier this month.\n\n“It’s all coming home to roost,” Hoey said of the PBMs’ unchecked power and their practice of steering patients away from the independents and into the chains. “It has overloaded the system, and also that corporate mentally of just, ‘we’re going to work the workers to death,’ I think that’s coming home to roost, too.”\n\nPharmacists bleeding, crying, working alone\n\nLike the metaphorical frog boiling in the pot, Wendy Lear said she didn’t realize how bad her job at CVS had gotten until there were so few staff left that she was forced to work alone, even when she had no business being behind the pharmacy counter.\n\nLear’s stint with CVS started in 2009 when the chain bought the independent pharmacy where she worked in Lexington, Kentucky. The transition was dramatic but initially tolerable, Lear said, because CVS retained enough pharmacists and technicians to meet the patients’ needs.\n\nBut that changed over the years as CVS whittled away its staff while heaping more work upon the few who remained.\n\nOne time, Lear recalled, she went to work while miscarrying her first child because her boss couldn’t find anyone to cover her overnight shift and begged her to go in. Bleeding, cramping and emotionally distraught, Lear said, she fielded phone calls and filled prescriptions until she had to lie down on the floor.\n\nAnother time when she was sick with norovirus and vomiting in a trash can behind the pharmacy counter, Lear said, she was asked to keep working until her boss could find someone to replace her. Lear toughed it out for two hours before texting her boss for an update.\n\n“Any word???” she wrote. “I can’t stay here. I am so sick. I am going to have to close.”\n\nHer boss texted back, instructing Lear to have the store manager take care of patients in her absence.\n\n“That’s illegal,” Lear told USA TODAY of her boss’ request. “You have to have a pharmacist on premises to sell prescriptions. She was so frustrated I had to go home, and, it’s like, you have to have contingencies for when people fall ill during their shift.”\n\nEventually, Lear said, the demands of the job became too intense and the risk of errors too great – especially during solo shifts – that she quit CVS in 2021 and found a new job at an independent pharmacy, Remington Drug Co., in northern Virginia.\n\n“Answering phone calls, taking prescriptions at drop off, entering those prescriptions, verifying once, filling those prescriptions, verifying twice, running the register, giving vaccinations, making metric-monitored phone calls, all fell on one person,” she said of her job at CVS. “In a double-check system, who’s checking me? This is when patient safety is most compromised.”\n\nDeAngelis told USA TODAY it is not CVS’ policy or practice to require staff to work when they are ill.\n\nBut retail pharmacists from CVS and other chains across the country shared similar stories of corporate pressure and severe burnout:\n\n“All day long stuff’s blowing up and management is yelling at us because we can’t answer the phones fast enough and we’re not giving enough immunizations,” said a current Walgreens pharmacist in Arizona. “I’ve seen pharmacists cry back in the pharmacy because it’s so busy.”\n\n“This situation has slowly worsened, but the big turning point was when we started giving COVID shots,” said a current Walmart pharmacist in Iowa. “One day it was just me there, and I did 77 COVID shots.”\n\n“There was not a single week where I didn’t work 80 hours, but I was only paid 42,” said a former CVS pharmacist from Virginia. “We were behind on prescriptions the entire year. I was begging, ‘please can we get more hours?’ Instead, corporate would suggest we do these overnighters to get caught up.”\n\nThousands of retail pharmacists left the industry during the first two years of the pandemic, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which reported a 6% drop in employment numbers between 2019 and 2021.\n\nAlthough those numbers have rebounded to pre-pandemic levels, the latest data shows, overall interest in the profession has nosedived, raising questions about the future of pharmacy.\n\nApplications to U.S. pharmacy schools plummeted nearly 70% from their peak in the fall of 2009 to the fall of 2021, according to the most recent data published by the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy. Those schools, which graduated nearly 15,000 students a year at their peak, are expected to produce just 11,000 new pharmacists annually by 2025, Hogue said.\n\nStuart Beatty, dean of Ohio Northern University’s Raabe College of Pharmacy, said his school is facing the same enrollment slump despite efforts to recruit students and reassure them of a bright future.\n\nIf he and his academic peers can’t reverse the tide, he said, the nation soon could face a severe pharmacist shortage.\n\n“It makes sense. Why would you go into a doctoral degree when all this is happening?” said Janan Sarwar, a Louisville-based pharmacist, publisher and career coach. “They want to help patients. They don’t want to enter a profession that oppresses their ability to help and do good in the world.”\n\nMistakes like this are why pharmacists say they're leaving\n\nShelby Richards blames chronic pharmacy understaffing for the medication error that cost her thousands of dollars.\n\nThe Memphis Walgreens she frequented was always “busy, low staffed, lines out the door,” Richards said, including the day in March 2021 when she retrieved a newly prescribed anti-anxiety medication to treat panic attacks after a car wreck.\n\nInside the bottle were two sizes of round, white pills. Richards said she assumed they were different doses of the same drug because her doctor had mentioned wanting to start her on 5 mg of Buspar before increasing it to 10 mg.\n\nSo she started taking the smaller of the two pills, not realizing it was a different drug altogether – a calcium channel blocker called amlodipine to treat high blood pressure.\n\nWithin days, Richards said, she began to feel nauseous, light-headed and her legs were swelling – all common side effects of amlodipine. Uninsured, she racked up $15,000 in bills from three hospital visits as doctors tried in vain to determine the cause, records show.\n\nIt wasn’t until her boyfriend took a closer look at her medication and noticed the different-sized pills that she had an answer.\n\n“I told her it … should always be a separate bottle,” said her now-husband Taylor Richards, who researched the two pills online and learned the one she had been taking was the highest dose of amlodipine available.\n\nThe couple called Walgreens to report the error and said they were dismissed without an apology. They tried to sue but missed the state statute of limitations, so they filed a complaint with the Tennessee Board of Pharmacy, which they provided to USA TODAY.\n\n“It seems like their staff is working like slaves,” Taylor Richards said. “There are usually two people back there, and it’s probably one of the busiest pharmacies around. I imagine they’re requiring them to fill so many prescriptions that it will continue to cause these types of errors.”\n\nWalgreens declined to comment on the error.\n\nPharmacists, meanwhile, said it’s a prime example of how working conditions put patients at risk and why so many of them are quitting the profession altogether.\n\nIt’s also why dozens of pharmacists recently walked out recently in protest. Another walkout is planned for Oct. 30-Nov. 1. Pharmacists are calling it Pharmageddon.\n\n“The primary reason is our concern for public safety,” said Corey Schneider, one of the CVS pharmacists who participated in the Kansas City walkout. “It’s also about basic decency. Pharmacists shouldn’t have to cry at work or go home worried that they made a mistake.”\n\nA few, like Tanoe, have funneled their frustration into advocacy. The former Walgreens pharmacist launched a public campaign in 2021 around the hashtag #PizzaIsNotWorking to highlight the dangerous working conditions that gestures such as free pizza from corporate won’t fix.\n\nSince then she has connected with thousands of retail pharmacy workers through her Facebook page, LinkedIn account and the online pharmacist advocacy community, RPhAlly, of which she is the vice president. She also helped organizers of the recent CVS and Walgreens walkouts share their messages and recruit participants and supporters.\n\nTanoe said it’s time the state pharmacy boards, professional organizations and corporate owners take these concerns seriously. If not, she said, the nation will see fewer pharmacies, fewer pharmacists and more incidents of patient harm.\n\n“For so long we have been told our patients come first – no matter what you do, your patient comes first,” Tanoe said. “Now, we are saying, no. We come first. We hold our patients’ lives in our hands. If we’re not well, they’re not well.”\n\nEmily Le Coz is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

Scary, I know. Here’s how to check if your phone is infected.\n\nWhile you’re at it, check your computer. These are the signs that stalkerware is hard at work tracking your web activity, searches, and even the passwords you type in.\n\nShockingly, your car isn’t immune. With the proper electronics and software techniques, a determined hacker can intercept or block your key fob signal, infiltrate your car’s software, and even remotely control your vehicle.\n\nSo, is your connected car hackable? Most likely, yes. Here’s how:\n\nJoin 400,000+ who get my free daily tech news email.\n\nSoftware hacks\n\n• Compromised car apps\n\nDoes your car have a smartphone app that allows you to unlock and start it remotely? Almost every car manufacturer offers this convenience in some makes and models.\n\nAccount usernames and passwords protect these apps. If hackers can break into your account or exploit a bug in the car’s software, they can compromise your entire vehicle.\n\nMy advice: To protect your remote start app, change the default password, use strong and unique credentials and never reuse your passwords from other services. Enable two-factor authentication if you can, and keep that software current.\n\n• Telematics exploits\n\nTelematics is the broad term describing a connected system that remotely monitors your vehicle's behavior. This data may include your car's location, speed, mileage, tire pressure, fuel use, braking, engine/battery status, and driver behavior.\n\nBy now, you know anything connected to the internet is vulnerable to exploitation. Hackers that intercept your connection can track and even control your vehicle remotely. Now that’s scary.\n\nMy advice: Before you get a car with built-in telematics, consult with your car dealer about the cybersecurity measures they’re employing on connected vehicles. If you have a connected car, ensure its onboard software is always up-to-date.\n\n• Networking attacks\n\nHere’s a throwback. Cybercriminals can also employ old-school denial-of-service attacks to overwhelm your vehicle and potentially shut down critical functions like airbags, anti-lock brakes, and door locks.\n\nThis attack is feasible since some connected cars have built-in Wi-Fi hotspot capabilities. As with regular home Wi-Fi networks, they can even steal your data if they infiltrate your car’s local network.\n\nAlso, it’s a matter of physical safety. Remember, multiple computers and Engine Control Modules run modern cars. If hackers can shut these systems down, they can put you in grave danger.\n\nMy advice: Regularly changing your car’s onboard Wi-Fi network password is a must. Turning off your car’s Bluetooth and Wi-Fi is also a good idea when not in use.\n\nYour home’s Wi-Fi needs to stay locked down too. Use these steps to find and remove anything that shouldn’t be on your network.\n\n• Onboard diagnostics (OBD) hacks\n\nEvery newer car has an onboard diagnostics port. This interface allows mechanics to access your car’s data, read error codes and statistics, and even program new keys.\n\nAnyone can buy exploit kits that can utilize this port to replicate keys and program new ones to use them for stealing vehicles.\n\nMy advice: Always go to a reputable mechanic. A physical steering wheel lock can also give you extra peace of mind.\n\n• In-car malware\n\nAnother old-school internet hack reaches connected cars, specifically models with internet connectivity and built-in web browsers.\n\nCrooks can send you emails and messages with malicious links and attachments that can install malware on your car’s system. Anything is possible once the malware is installed.\n\nCar systems don’t have built-in malware protections, so this can be hard to spot.\n\nMy advice: Practice good computer safety practices even when connected to your car. Never open emails and messages nor follow links from unknown sources.\n\nSecurity 202: How to remove malware from your phone or computer\n\nKey fob attacks\n\nWith the proliferation of cheap electronics and relay gadgets that can be purchased easily online, key fob attacks are more common than ever.\n\n• The relay hack\n\nAlways-on key fobs present a serious weakness in your car’s security. If your keys are in range, anyone can open the car, and the system will think it’s you. That’s why newer car models won’t unlock until the key fob is within one foot.\n\nHowever, criminals can get relatively cheap relay boxes that capture key fob signals up to 300 feet away and transmit them to your car.\n\nOne thief stands near your car with a relay box while an accomplice scans your house with another. When your key fob signal is picked up, it is transmitted to the box closer to your car, prompting it to open.\n\nKeep reading for steps on how to protect your keyfob.\n\n• Keyless jamming\n\nIn this scenario, crooks will block your signal. Say you issue a lock command from your key fob. It won’t reach your car, and your doors will remain unlocked. The crooks can then have free access to your vehicle.\n\nMy advice: Always manually check your car doors before stepping away. You can also install a steering wheel lock to deter thieves from stealing your car, even if they get inside.\n\nHow to stop key fob attacks\n\nThere are a few easy ways to block key fob attacks. You can buy a signal-blocking pouch that can hold your keys, like a shielded RFID-blocking pouch.\n\n• Stick it in the fridge …\n\nHere’s a free solution: Stick your key fob into the refrigerator or freezer. The multiple layers of metal will block the signal. Just check with your manufacturer to ensure freezing your key fob won’t damage it.\n\n• … or even inside the microwave\n\nThe microwave will also block signals. Just don’t turn it on.\n\n• Wrap your key fob in foil\n\nSince your key fob’s signal is blocked by metal, you can also wrap it up in aluminum foil. While it’s the easiest solution, it can leak the signal if you don’t do it right. You could also make a foil-lined box to put your keys in if you’re in a crafting mood.\n\nKeep your tech-know going\n\nMy popular podcast is called “Kim Komando Today.” It’s a solid 30 minutes of tech news, tips, and callers with tech questions like you from all over the country.

For example, there’s an advertiser ID on your phone that’s supposed to keep your location anonymous. Are you surprised it doesn’t? Me neither. Tap or click here for steps to see and remove your advertiser ID.\n\nIt’s not always advertisers and Big Tech spying. A stranger or someone you know might be poking around your accounts. Tap or click for a quick check you must do to keep your Facebook, Google, and Netflix accounts secure.\n\nPrivacy isn’t a given. Here are five ways to take as much as you can back:\n\n1. Everyone’s least favorite kind of cookie\n\nYou collect cookies when you browse the web on your phone, computer, or tablet. These bits of data store information about the websites you visit. Cookies store your logins, personalization settings, advertising information, and other details.\n\nThe upside is that cookies save images and files and stop you from having to log in every time you visit a site. But these cookies contain a lot of your details. Fortunately, you can delete cookies manually in a few steps.\n\nTap or click here to delete cookies from your phone. Hit this link for steps to clear cookies from your computer’s browser.\n\nBetter yet, use Incognito Mode. When you surf the web Incognito, your browser doesn’t save your history, cookies, site data, or information you enter in forms. It does keep any downloaded files or bookmarks created during the session.\n\nExclusive limited-time offer: As a special thank you to my readers, I'm giving you a free Windows or Mac guide full of tips, tricks, and great downloads. Claim your free Windows or Mac guide now at my website at Komando.com/FreeGuides.\n\nBe warned: Your internet service provider can still see your activity, as can a school or employer providing your internet access or computer.\n\nTo go incognito on Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, press Ctrl + Shift + N (or Command + Shift + N on Mac). Tap or click for three times you should always browse Incognito.\n\nFor even more privacy, fire up a VPN. A virtual private network, or VPN, is a layer of protection between your devices and the internet. It hides your IP address and your location. It also encrypts your data after leaving your device and traveling to whatever website you’re visiting.\n\nDon’t even think about using a free VPN. At best, it will lack the necessary privacy features and slow you down. At worst, it's hiding malware or tracking your information. My pick is ExpressVPN, the VPN I used before they became a sponsor of my national radio show.\n\n2. Your emails are a wealth of information\n\nJust think about everything sitting in your inbox. In the wrong hands, those digital messages can do much damage.\n\nEncryption is a method to protect your email from hackers, criminals, and prying eyes. It's a process where your email messages are scrambled, so if hackers manage to intercept them, all they'll see is gibberish.\n\nBig-name email services like Gmail and Yahoo don't provide end-to-end encryption. Encryption is tough to implement, and it generally requires all correspondents to participate. The process isn't end-to-end if your email uses encryption, but mine doesn't. At some point, your message will be vulnerable.\n\nIf encrypting your emails is essential, you'll need to switch to a secure service like StartMail, ProtonMail, Mailfence, Tutanota, or Hushmail.\n\nUse Gmail? You can send a Confidential email. Email sent in Confidential mode can't be forwarded, and you can choose whether to require a recipient to use a passcode to read it. Tap or click here and scroll to No. 3 for steps to try it yourself.\n\n3. Your apps are watching where you go\n\nYour phone knows precisely where you’ve been over the past few days, weeks, and even months. If it’s been a while since you looked at your phone’s location settings, do it now.\n\nCheck this hidden location setting on your iPhone:\n\n• Click Settings, then Privacy.\n\n• Select Location Services, then scroll down to System Services.\n\n• Choose Significant Locations to see the record of where you’ve been and toggle it off.\n\nHere’s how to adjust location settings on an Android:\n\n• Open Settings, then scroll down and tap Location.\n\n• To stop all tracking, you can toggle Use location off.\n\n• If you don’t want to remove all permissions, tap App location permissions.\n\n• For each app, tap it to choose your preferred setting: Allow all the time, Allow only while using the app, Ask every time, or Don't allow. You can also decide whether an app sees your precise location or an approximate location.\n\n4. Your TV is watching you right back\n\nSorry to break it to you. Your streaming services are tracking your activity too. It makes sense. Netflix, Hulu and all the rest want to know what shows you like so they can recommend content you’ll enjoy and don’t mind paying for.\n\nThe monitoring isn't for your benefit, though. Streaming services collect your viewing history and the ads you watch or skip. Then, they share this data with advertisers.\n\nTap or click here for a step-by-step guide on deleting your history on Netflix, Hulu and more.\n\nIf you have a smart TV, you have essential settings to review there, too. Tap or click to stop your Samsung, LG, Amazon Fire TV, or Roku TV from spying.\n\n5. Stop sharing everything you buy and browse\n\nGoogle always seems to know just what you want, and it’s not in your head. Google tracks every search, click, message, and request. Now and then, clear your search history and activity. Here's how:\n\n• Go to myaccount.google.com and log in. Alternatively, go to google.com and click the circle icon in the upper right-hand corner with your image or initials inside. Then click Manage your Google Account.\n\n• Click Data & Privacy in the left-hand menu.\n\n• You will see checkmarks next to Web & App Activity, Location History, and YouTube History. Click each one to adjust your settings. Toggle them off to stop further tracking if you choose.\n\nOn these pages, you can also set up Auto-delete for future activity. I highly suggest you enable this. You can choose from three months, 18 months, or 36 months.\n\nDon’t stop there. Tap or click for more Google privacy settings you can change now.\n\nPODCAST PICK: Clone dead voices, crypto fraud, hacked hot tubs\n\nWant your dead grandmother to read you a story?

I'm Taylor Wilson and this is 5 Things you need to know Wednesday, the 2nd of March 2022. Today, one week of Russian invasion, plus initial games from the upcoming MLB season have been canceled, and more.\n\nHere are some of the top headlines:\n\nPresident Joe Biden gave his first State of the Union address last night. In addition to promising to check Russian aggression, Biden also touched on soaring inflation and the remnants of the coronavirus pandemic. The death toll has now risen to 14, amid severe flooding in Eastern Australia, and up to eight inches of rain are forecast for Sydney late today into tomorrow. And the moon this week will get slammed with three tons of space junk. A leftover rocket is set to smash onto the far side of the moon at 5,800 miles an hour on Friday. Experts believe China launched it nearly a decade ago.\n\nIt's been one week since Russia invaded Ukraine, and attacks are increasingly taking aim at Ukraine's largest cities. The second largest, Kharkiv, was hit by missile fire this week, including an attack on its central square that killed at least six people.\n\n[Sound of explosions and people scrambling].\n\nThat was the scene as rescuers entered a bombed-out building in Kharkiv. A 40 mile convoy of hundreds of Russian tanks also remains outside the capital of Kyiv. It's not clear how many people have been killed since Russia sparked violence last week. Neither Russia nor Ukraine is releasing clear troop casualty numbers, but the UN Human Rights Office said it's recorded 136 civilian deaths. Some Western officials have estimated that Russia has lost thousands of troops, but tactics may be shifting away from the ground to the air with bombardments, like the one in Kharkiv continuing in major cities.\n\nBritain's Defense Ministry said it has seen an increase in Russian air and artillery strikes on populated urban areas over the past two days. Ukrainian officials said five people were killed in an attack on a TV tower near central Kyiv yesterday. And the nearby Babi Yar Holocaust memorial was also hit. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy spoke to the European Parliament by video yesterday. He applied for EU membership and asked EU lawmakers for help amid the invasion.\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy:\n\n[Speaking Ukrainian]\n\nTaylor Wilson translating for Volodymyr Zelenskyy:\n\n\"We are fighting for our rights, for our freedom for life, for our life. And now we are fighting for survival with our motivation at its peak, but we are fighting also to be equal members of Europe.\"\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMeanwhile, Russia is becoming increasingly isolated by the rest of the world. The country has almost no international friends at the moment beyond a handful like China, Belarus and North Korea. And sanctions are crippling the economy. Leading Russian bank, Sberbank, announced earlier today that it's pulling out of European markets amid tightening Western sanctions. For his part, President Joe Biden, during his State of the Union Address last night, condemned Russian President Vladimir Putin directly.\n\nPresident Joe Biden:\n\nSix days ago, Russia's Vladimir Putin sought to shake the very foundations of the free world thinking he could make it bend to his menacing ways, but he badly miscalculated. He thought he could roll into Ukraine and the world would roll over. Instead, he met with a wall of strength he never anticipated or imagined, he met the Ukrainian people. From President Zelenskyy to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination, literally inspires the world.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nMany Ukrainian civilians continue to huddle underground in basements and other structures. And many essential workers are continuing their work amid the violence. At least 660,000 refugees have fled Ukraine. And that number is expected to continue to rise.\n\nSecurity professionals are urging Americans to take immediate steps to protect themselves from a higher risk of Russian cyberattacks after the invasion of Ukraine. Senior Tech and Economic Opportunity Reporter Jessica Guynn has more.\n\nJessica Guynn:\n\nFiguring out how to protect ourselves is hardly anyone's idea of a good time. And most of us don't really know how to do it or where to even start. And the problem kind of seems overwhelming, especially since a lot of these threats are going to be against critical infrastructure like power plants and so on, or against big corporations or institutions, and there's just not a lot we can do to prevent our local hospital or city agency from getting targeted by ransomware.\n\nSo that's why I asked a whole bunch of security experts like, so what seriously can we do to safeguard our devices, our computers, our laptops, our tablets, our phones, because we're so dependent on technology? And the answers are actually pretty simple and straightforward. And to get that extra layer of protection is to do the things that people have been telling us to do for a really long time, like use multifactor authentication so that you have to get a code or a text to log in that the app has a way of verifying that it's really you. Update your malware and all your operating systems and make sure that's done automatically so you don't miss any of that.\n\nIf you can afford it, subscribe to a password manager. If you can't, use strong, unique passwords, stop reusing them all over the place and then do that common sense stuff, like you get an email, there's a link in there, an attachment, don't just click on things. Take a beat, practice some mindfulness, figure out if you should really be doing that. If there's important stuff that you have, back it up, back it up multiple places, back it up in the cloud, back it up in an external drive. And if you're traveling, use a VPN to protect yourself, if you're using public wifi and make sure your home wifi is secure. Lock it down, make sure it's password protected.\n\nI think the final thing is also, we're going to be hearing a lot of stuff that's being propagated by different sides and the conflict. And it's really important to have your bull... detector on all of the time, because there's going to be a lot of effort to manipulate public sentiment. And the less we contribute to that by sharing it willy-nilly with our friends and family and so on before we know it's real or legit, that way we can do our part in keeping things a little more sane.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can find Jessica's full story in today's episode description.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify before Congress today. His appearance in front of the House Financial Services Committee comes as the stock market tumbles under the prospect of higher interest rates and the war in Eastern Europe. In January, Powell indicated that a rate hike was all but certain this month.\n\nJerome Powell:\n\nAt the Federal Reserve, we are strongly committed to achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us, maximum employment and price stability. Today, in support of these goals, the Federal Open Market Committee kept its policy interest rate near zero and stated its expectation that an increase in this rate would soon be appropriate. The committee also agreed to continue reducing its net asset purchases on the schedule we announced in December, bringing them to an end in early March. As I will explain, against a backdrop of elevated inflation and a strong labor market, our policy has been adapting to the evolving economic environment and it will continue to do so.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nBut since then, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has driven up oil and gas prices and made supply chain bottlenecks even worse, which could mean even higher inflation. At the same time, the invasion raises the possibility of slower economic growth if soaring prices and supply chain issues cut down on spending and falling stocks weaken consumer and business confidence.\n\nYesterday, Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred announced that he was canceling Opening Day, which was originally scheduled for March 31st, as well as the first two series of the regular season. That comes as the League's lockout and labor dispute with players continues with no new collective bargaining agreement in sight. That could mean the first regular season games lost to a labor dispute since 1995. A deal did appear to be within reach as of Monday night. So then what happened? Producer PJ Elliot sat down with Baseball Reporter Gabe Lacques to find out.\n\nGabe Lacques:\n\nWell, first of all, the representatives for the players caucused with all 30 team representatives, union reps from every individual team. So you had Max Scherzer and executive director Tony Clark of the union and others in the meeting. MLB sweetened its offer a little bit, but still fell far short of what the union wanted. And the union went back and caucused with their people overnight and came back the next morning and presented a counter offer. The way MLB negotiates is if you don't accept what they offer, they take that as hostility, as opposed to just what we might call negotiations. So things went a little bit sideways from there. A couple of more offers were exchanged. They got a little bit closer on many of the core economic issues, but ultimately not quite enough to close the gap. And we'll see how many games this cost us and how long it takes to kind of get this settled.\n\nPJ Elliot:\n\nSo where do things stand now and what happens next?\n\nGabe Lacques:\n\nYeah, so everybody's leaving Florida and both the union and MLB are headquartered in New York. They're both heading up there. They are expected to sit down again on Thursday. If we're treating this like a game of tennis, it would be the union's turn to whack the ball over the net and maybe come forth with another offer. Probably won't happen that quickly. I imagine they'll sit down and get the niceties out of the way and maybe talk philosophically a bit and then perhaps prepare a counter offer from there.\n\nThe key thing for fans to keep in mind is MLB has estimated there to be a five-day lag between agreement on a collective bargaining agreement and the time by which training camps could open. So as Rob Manfred, Commissioner, said it today, if an agreement is somehow miraculously reached on Thursday, the soonest that camps could open would be March 8th. And then that wouldn't leave a whole heck of a lot of time to ramp up for Opening Day.\n\nSo if you think that an agreement means that the doors are going to fling open to all the training camps and Spring Training begins, not quite. It does take a few days to ratify it and all sorts of other wonky labor stuff, and of course, the logistics of getting 100 people to one place, although I'm sure the majority of the players are already hovering around Florida and Arizona as they do anyway. So yeah, keep that in mind, just add five more days from an agreement to the point which training camps can open.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou can follow along with Gabe's work on the lockout over on Twitter @GabeLacques.\n\nToday is Ash Wednesday. For Christians, it marks the start of the 40-day season of Lent. On Ash Wednesday, a priest or minister puts ashes on a worshiper's forehead in the shape of a cross. That signifies a person's acknowledgement of their sins, the same sins that Christians believe Jesus died on the cross for. Christians show repentance for their sins during Lent with prayer, fasting and other sacrifices. The six-week Lent period wraps up with Easter next month.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nThanks for listening to 5 Things. You can find us on whatever your favorite podcast app is. Thanks as always to PJ Elliot for his great work on the show. And I'm back tomorrow with more of 5 Things from USA TODAY.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/03/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/04/minaret-vaccination-rushmore-fight-enrollment-drops-news-around-states/115964070/", "title": "Minaret vaccination, Rushmore fight: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: With demand for COVID-19 shots flagging at an immunization clinic set up at the Alabama Cruise Terminal, an official said the site could shut down soon as the cruise industry prepares to restart. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines recently that would allow companies that meet certain benchmarks to resume operating around mid-July, and officials are hopeful Carnival Cruise Lines can resume its trips to the western Caribbean from Mobile. The city’s cruise terminal near downtown is being used as a mass vaccination site by the Mobile County Health Department, but Health Officer Dr. Bert Eichold told WALA-TV he expects the operation to wrap up in the next couple of weeks. More than 22% of Mobile County residents are fully vaccinated, according to CDC statistics. But the county also has one of the higher levels of community disease transmission in Alabama, according to the state. And Alabama is last in the nation in the rate of COVID-19 vaccinations. The area tourism agency said cruises account for 35,000 hotel nights and $150 million annually, and the more than yearlong shutdown of the industry has taken a chunk out of the local economy. “It’s been a big blow,” said David Clark, chief executive of Visit Mobile. “Tourism’s never, ever seen what they’ve seen in terms of disaster in the economy, from travel, or the lack of travel.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Alaska Court System temporarily disconnected most of its operations from the internet after a cybersecurity threat Saturday, including its website and removing the ability to look up court records. The threat blocked electronic court filings, disrupted online payments and prevented hearings from taking place by videoconference for several days, officials said. “I think for a few days, there may may be some inconveniences, there may be some hearings that are canceled, or some judges who decide to shift from videoconference to teleconference proceedings or the like. We don’t have all of that figured out yet,” Alaska Supreme Court Chief Justice Joel Bolger told the Anchorage Daily News. The court system said in a statement that it was working to remove malware from its servers. “At this time, the court system does not believe any confidential court documents or employee information has been compromised, but will promptly notify any affected individuals if that occurs,” the statement said. “No customer credit card information was compromised.” On Sunday, the court system posted on its Facebook and Twitter that all in-custody arraignments would proceed as scheduled. “Local courts have reached out to justice partners to let them know of any changes,” the posts said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: More than 38,500 children disappeared from both virtual and physical classrooms this school year as the coronavirus spread through the state. The loss – a 3.3% drop year over year, according to Arizona Department of Education data – has school officials scrambling to figure out where these children went, if they will return in the fall and how they will fashion curricula for students who may have had significant learning loss. Their conclusions also will shape budget decisions, as schools are funded based on the number of children who show up in the fall. The steepest enrollment declines came at the youngest ages: About 42% of the loss is due to preschoolers and kindergartners not showing up on public school rolls, according to state data. Eighth graders and high school seniors were the only classes to show an increase, though the gains were minimal. Teachers, counselors and school administrators say many kids just stayed home, moved to private schools or began homeschooling. Then there are the questions left hanging when school officials visit family homes only to find no one there and no evidence of where the children went. “That’s the burning question,” said Kayla Fulmer, director of marketing and community relations at the J.O. Combs Unified School District. “We wonder and worry about that.”\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: More than 84,000 state residents have missed their second COVID-19 vaccine dose. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website, the second dose should be given within three to four weeks of the first, depending on the product. However, if an individual misses that time frame, they can still receive a second dose within six weeks of the first. As of April 30, 84,191 people in Arkansas were noted as being outside that 42-day window. Dr. Jennifer Dillaha, the state epidemiologist and medical director for immunizations and outbreak response for the Arkansas Department of Health, said that number may not be entirely representative of those who actually missed the second shot, but officials are working on correcting that. “What we noticed when the people in our call centers started calling was some people reported they had received the second dose,” she said. The ADH is now allowing for more time before compiling numbers to allow for delayed reporting from vaccine providers. The department uses call center employees to make contact with people who are close to missing or have missed the window for the second shot.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPalm Springs: Enrollment drops at the Desert Sands and Palm Springs Unified school districts are outpacing the already steep statewide decline reported across California public schools amid the coronavirus pandemic. At the same time, Coachella Valley private schools are reporting a surge in enrollment, as some parents say distance-learning models simply haven’t worked for their kids and families. Desert Sands Unified reports a 3.4% decline in enrollment and Palm Springs Unified a 3.2% decline from the 2019-20 academic year, the two districts reported. Those are greater than the 2.6% decline reported statewide for the same time frame, according to California Department of Public Education data that was released April 22. The statewide loss equates to a decrease of 160,000 enrolled students for a total of 6,002,523 students currently enrolled at K-12 schools. The statewide drop in enrollment – the largest decline in at least 20 years, according to California Department of Education data – came after Gov. Gavin Newsom closed public schools in March 2020, and the state’s school districts kept students in distance-learning models for much of the 2020-21 school year.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis extended a statewide mask mandate for another 30 days Sunday but loosened face covering requirements for groups of people who are vaccinated against COVID-19. Under the new executive order, people gathering inside in groups of 10 or more are no longer required to wear masks if at least 80% of the group is vaccinated. The order says people must show proof of vaccination, but it does not elaborate on what proof is considered acceptable. In April, Polis lifted mask requirements in most indoor settings in counties where the threat of COVID-19 was the lowest – the counties that fall under “Level Green” on the state’s scale. In counties with higher rates of COVID-19, masks must be worn in all public indoor spaces when 10 or more unvaccinated individuals or individuals of unknown vaccination status are present. Residents statewide are still required to wear masks at schools, child care centers, indoor children’s camps, public-facing state government facilities, correctional facilities and health care settings. About 1.9 million people in Colorado are fully vaccinated, and 2.6 million have received at least one dose, according to state data.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Residents were breathing a sigh of relief over the weekend as some statewide restrictions that were put in place a year ago were eased. As of Saturday, bars that don’t serve food can open on an outdoor-only basis, and an eight-person limit per table for outdoor seating has been lifted. The limit remains in effect for indoor dining. Face masks are still required indoors, though NBC Connecticut reports Gov. Ned Lamont is expected to announce whether that will shift to a recommendation when there’s a wider easing of restrictions later this month. The rollback, scheduled to go into effect May 19, is contingent on low rates of infection and increasing vaccination rates.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A conservative group pushing back against pandemic-related restrictions is making a push into school board elections, endorsing candidates up and down the state with platforms dedicated to hot-button issues like fully reopening schools and keeping concepts like social justice and lessons about race out of classrooms. Since the start of the pandemic, the grassroots group Stand Up Delaware has held rally after rally calling Gov. John Carney’s COVID-19 orders an infringement on individual liberties. Stand Up Delaware has since merged with the newly formed Patriots for Delaware, which has grown to include 11,000 members in its private Facebook group and turned its sights toward school board seats. Patriots for Delaware calls itself nonpartisan, but its members are largely right-wing conservatives, supporting former President Donald Trump, resisting COVID-19 restrictions and decrying mask mandates. “Within three years, we can change things completely,” Lisa McCulley, a lead organizer of Stand Up Delaware, told a crowd at a March rally outside Legislative Hall. “But we have to stop being complacent.” She pointed to Appoquinimink School District as an example of where the group sees an opening: a school board with “one awesome conservative” overruled by “three women who control the whole board.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: After 2020 threw wrenches in the wedding plans of so many couples, some are now facing yet another hurdle. Mayor Muriel Bowser has banned dancing at indoor and outdoor weddings, leaving many lovebirds scrambling to find venues outside the district, WUSA-TV reports. One wedding planner complained that the city is starting to feel a little like the mythical town of Bomont in the classic movie “Footloose” – the town that banned dancing. Stephanie Sadowski of SRS Events said she was “completely shell-shocked” upon hearing the news. The district is loosening some pandemic restrictions, but Bowser sneaked in a bombshell at her news conference last Monday, Sadowski said. The latest order allows indoor weddings at 25% capacity, or 250 people, but “standing and dancing at receptions are not allowed.” For some couples, that’s a deal breaker, and they’re rushing to relocate their celebrations to Maryland or Virginia venues where restrictions are looser. Sadowski said she had four weddings planned in D.C. next month, at the height of wedding season, and she’s scrambling to move all of them. “I cannot even believe we’re in 2021 right now, and we are saying no dancing,” she said. “Why can’t we just have masks?”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis moved to suspend all remaining COVID-19 restrictions imposed by communities across his state Monday, signing into law freshly passed legislation giving him sweeping powers to invalidate local emergency measures put in place during the pandemic – including mask mandates, limitations on business operations and the shuttering of schools. “We don’t know what’s going to happen in the future,” DeSantis said, “but I think this creates a structure that’s going to be a little bit more respectful, I think, of people’s businesses, jobs, schools and personal freedom.” The Republican governor has been touting his record on the coronavirus as he readies to launch his reelection campaign and considers a run for president in 2024. Even as DeSantis has urged Floridians to get vaccinated, he has become among the most nationally prominent Republicans to push back on mask mandates and other precautions that federal health officials have recommended in the continuing battle against the pandemic. Some mayors, particularly those aligned with the Democratic Party, decried Republican-led preemptions as a power grab against local government’s ability to control a potential resurgence of the coronavirus but also restrict their ability to respond to future public health emergencies.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: It’s one shot and no appointment needed at all eight state-run mass vaccination sites. Starting Monday, the sites are offering the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine and are no longer accepting appointments. Instead, people who haven’t received a first dose are asked to drive up. The sites are still accepting appointments for people who need a second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. Those appointments can be made at myvaccinegeorgia.com. The sites are in Clarkesville, Columbus, Emerson, Hapeville, Macon, Sandersville, Savannah and Waycross. Most operate from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. five days a week, either Monday through Friday or Tuesday through Saturday. The state-run mass vaccination sites are scheduled to close May 21 amid what state officials described as slackening demand for vaccination. More than 6.4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been given in Georgia, but the state ranks 44th in doses administered per capita to people 18 and older, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Health officials reported 113 newly confirmed coronavirus cases across the state Sunday, increasing the statewide total to more than 32,500 infections since the pandemic began early last year. The Hawaii Department of Health said there were no virus-related deaths, keeping the statewide toll at 483, including 374 fatalities on Oahu. The report includes cases reported to the department Friday, officials said. There were 80 reported cases in Honolulu County, 16 in Maui County, nine in Kauai County and three in Hawaii County, as well as five residents diagnosed outside the state, health officials said. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports one previous case appears to have been removed from the state’s tally. There have been more than 1,100 new infections in the state in the past two weeks. As of Sunday, the state has administered about 1.4 million vaccine doses through state and federal programs. More than 53% of the state’s population has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Some 35% of the population is fully vaccinated.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A state Senate panel on Monday rejected legislation intended to give lawmakers veto power over decisions by the federal government and courts, with senators citing its potential violation of the Idaho and U.S. constitutions. The Senate State Affairs Committee voted 7-2 to kill the legislation brought forward by Republican Rep. Sage Dixon, who after the meeting said he would bring forward revamped legislation next year to try again. His bill would have allowed any member of the Republican-dominated state House or Senate to make a complaint about a federal action, potentially leading to a polling of members of the Committee on Federalism, which Dixon co-chairs. If the committee found merit in the complaint, the federal action would be immediately “paused” until the full Legislature acted to potentially declare it null and void. Federal actions involving abortion, gun laws, taxes and other issues could have been challenged under the proposed measure. The range of those issues made lawmakers uncomfortable. Lawmakers opposed to the bill said it violated the state and federal constitutions, with some citing their oaths of office and noting that at the start of each full Senate session they recite the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum is offering free admission to people vaccinated against COVID-19. Officials at the museum in Springfield announced last week that the offer is good throughout May and June. Anyone who has received at least one shot is eligible to get a free ticket at the museum’s website. “Vaccination is key to beating this disease, keeping everyone healthy and returning to normal in America,” said Melissa Coultas, acting executive director of the museum. “If we can help by offering a little extra incentive, then we’re happy to do so.” People claiming a free ticket will have to show a vaccination card at the museum. Admission is $15 for adults, $12 for seniors or students, and $10 for military personnel. There is no charge for kids younger than 5 and a $6 fee for children between the ages of 5 and 15. Visitors to the museum must wear a mask. The facility also limits the number of people inside.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state on Monday reported 812 new coronavirus cases and a single death. More than 1.9 million residents 16 and older, or more than 35% of the eligible population, are now fully vaccinated. Black and Latino Hoosiers remain less likely to be vaccinated than those who identify as white. While Black residents make up 9.4% of the population, they represent just under 6% of people who have gotten a shot, according to the state’s vaccine dashboard. Latino residents comprise 6.2% of the population and 3.5% of those vaccinated. However, the statistics shift when only the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine is considered. Black people received 7.6% of those vaccines and Latino people 5.9%. White people made up just under 78% of those receiving this vaccine and comprise 86% of the state’s population.\n\nIowa\n\nGranger: A vaccination event at the Islamic and Cultural Center Bosniak on Sunday morning aimed to deliver COVID-19 protection to 300 people. Ankeny vaccine distribution startup VaxiTaxi.com hosted the event, where Elvedin Sivac, president of the Es-Selam Mosque, was among those receiving their first shot. Alma Michelson, a pharmacist for Walgreens, helped set up Sunday’s clinic and said many of her fellow Bosnians distrust vaccines. “It’s a community that’s not quite on board with vaccines because they were influenced by the media so much,” she said. Other Bosnians in town are considered “essential workers” and were already given vaccines through their employers, Michelson said. Casey Villhauer started VaxiTaxi in July as a way to bring all types of vaccines into people’s homes or directly to them. She gave a flu shot to a person on a tractor once but said the shot she gave contractor Safet Tabakovic inside the minaret he’s building atop the mosque was unique. Michelson, Sivac and Villhauer hiked up 111 steps to give him his injection 80 feet off the ground. “We reached a lot of people that otherwise wouldn’t have gotten a shot,” Villhauer said.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: COVID-19 vaccinations slowed last month, even as more contagious variants of the coronavirus surged and as hospitalizations from the disease rose in the state, according to health officials. Kansas Department of Health and Environment numbers show about 91,000 fewer people received first doses of the available vaccines in April than in March, the Wichita Eagle reports. There were 520 new hospitalizations and 157 new intensive care unit admissions in April, compared with 438 new hospitalizations and 150 new ICU admissions in March, officials said. “Almost exclusively, the answer is those needing hospitalized are unvaccinated,” Dr. David Wild with the University of Kansas Health System said Friday. Statewide, children account for a growing share of the new cases. Of the more than 6,750 new cases in April, more than 1 in 5 were in patients younger than 18, according to health department numbers. Children accounted for about 12% of all cases in March. Meanwhile, confirmed variant cases nearly tripled over the last three weeks of April, officials said. Officials did see a decrease in deaths from COVID-19 in April, at 69, compared with 170 deaths in March.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Berea College appears to be the first institution of higher learning in the state to require students to be vaccinated when they return to campus in the fall. The college announced Thursday that COVID-19 vaccines will be mandatory except for limited exemptions for medical or religious reasons. So far, none of Kentucky’s public universities have announced mandatory vaccines for students, but they’ve said they are strongly encouraging them, including the University of Kentucky, the University of Louisville and Western Kentucky University. At Berea, students who decline the vaccine will be offered online classes, according to a news release. First-year students who aren’t vaccinated may defer their admission, and current students may request a leave of absence if they don’t choose online courses. The small, private college in Eastern Kentucky was among the first colleges in the country to stop in-person learning when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the state in March 2020. The vaccine policy was developed after surveying students, faculty and staff, the news release said. Founded in 1869 by abolitionists, Berea was the first integrated and co-educational college in the South. Aided by a $1 billion endowment, Berea charges no tuition to its 1,600 students, who are required to work on campus.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state has paid roughly $6.2 million in improper unemployment benefits to nearly 1,200 people locked up in jails or prisons, the state Legislative Auditor’s Office said in a report released Monday. The state labor department didn’t dispute the findings and said it was working to correct the problems. It said criminal enterprises have targeted the state’s unemployment insurance program to take advantage of increased payouts during the coronavirus pandemic. The report noted two possible factors contributing to the improper payments, which amount to a tiny fraction of more than $8 billion in unemployment benefits paid during the pandemic. The report noted that the labor department failed to correctly match its data on unemployment benefits with information a vendor provides on inmates. Also, the report said more than 80% of the incarcerated recipients got the money through a program for contractors and gig workers that was created as part of a 2020 coronavirus relief bill. That complicates the job of the labor department, known as the Louisiana Workforce Commission, because it doesn’t have electronic wage data on gig and contract workers.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: L.L. Bean’s flagship store returned to 24-hour operations, and Amtrak’s Downeaster resumed its full schedule Monday, marking moves toward normalcy amid the pandemic. Amtrak’s expanded schedule includes a new southbound train that will depart Brunswick mid-morning and a new northbound train that will depart Boston mid-afternoon. In Freeport, workers removed the locks Monday as L.L. Bean’s flagship store resumed around-the-clock sales. The store had been operating on limited hours after Bean briefly closed all stores last year during the pandemic. Returning to 24-hour operations marks an important milestone for the company, restoring a tradition that dates to 1951, said Shawn Gorman, company chairman. Meanwhile, the Maine International Film Festival is returning this summer with a mix of in-person and virtual events. Movies that are normally screened at Railroad Square Cinema and the Waterville Opera House were moved to the nearby Skowhegan Drive-In Theater and online last summer. This summer, movies will be screened at all three of those locations, as well as online, from July 9 to July 18, the Morning Sentinel reports. To protect attendees’ safety, indoor movie showings will have capacity limits and require social distancing and protective masks.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Despite growing optimism that larger crowds could return for the 2021 tourism season, many business owners in the town worry a worsening labor shortage could spoil what might be a strong summer. The labor shortage that plagued businesses in 2020 has grown into a crisis in 2021. Seasonal business owners say it’s become more difficult to hire people, and it’s unlikely the J-1 visa program that brings foreign student workers will return this year. Altogether, many businesses might be short-staffed at critical levels as the demands of the tourist season take hold in a few weeks. “There’s a sign on every street in Ocean City that says ‘now hiring,’ ” said Anna Dolle Bushnell, owner of Dolle’s Candyland. This summer could be a financial challenge if Dolle’s doesn’t hire enough employees, Bushnell said, as it will have to cut its hours if it can’t hire enough staff. “This summer is going to hurt unless we get the help like we did last year from the government for being closed and for the reduced profits,” Bushnell said. Each summer approximately 12,000 seasonal jobs open up in Ocean City, said Susan Jones, executive director of the Ocean City Hotel-Motel Restaurant Association. Last year, nearly 4,000 weren’t filled because then-President Donald Trump placed a temporary ban on the J-1 cultural exchange visa program.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state plans on closing four of its seven mass vaccination sites by the end of June in favor of a more targeted approach to reach the roughly 30% of its eligible population that has not yet received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, Gov. Charlie Baker said Monday. The state will instead send more doses to 22 smaller regional sites, expand mobile vaccination efforts, and bring vaccine clinics to senior centers, YMCAs, houses of worship and other community sites, the Republican governor said at a news conference. While there has been some hesitancy among people who have not yet been vaccinated, more often that not it’s a matter of convenience, Baker said, and he wants to make it as easy as possible to get a shot. The state can change its focus because it is on target to reach its goal of getting more than 4 million people vaccinated by the end of May. “Now that we believe we are going to hit the 4.1 million goal we started with over the course of the next few weeks, it’s time to adapt or vaccination effort to get make sure we get to some of the harder-to-reach populations,” he said. Mass vaccination sites at Gillette Stadium, the Doubletree hotel in Danvers, the Natick Mall and the Hynes Convention Center in Boston will close at the end of June. But Baker stressed that there are still plenty of appointments available.\n\nMichigan\n\nTraverse City: The Traverse City Film Festival is being canceled for the second consecutive year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Michael Moore said Friday. “This is truly upsetting for us and for everyone here who loves the movies and sees this festival as a cultural cornerstone of the community,” said Moore, the Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker who co-founded the event in 2005. The festival board concluded it would be irresponsible to invite thousands of visitors to the Lake Michigan resort town as the coronavirus continues to ravage the state, said Moore, the board’s president. As of Friday, Michigan had the nation’s highest seven-day infection rate, although numbers have been improving. Of the 30 counties across the U.S. with the most new cases per capita in the past 14 days, 17 are in Michigan, according to Johns Hopkins University. “We have simply run out of time waiting for this virus to be contained,” board secretary David Poinsett said, adding that it takes six months to plan and produce the event. A shortened version of the festival could take place late this year or in early 2022 if the virus situation improves, Moore said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Child care providers were hit hard by the pandemic, and helping them may be crucial to economic recovery. Closures of family child care centers have caused a shortage of child care spots across the state, and COVID-19 accelerated that because many parents kept their children home. Now the shortage is dire. There is a need for 39,000 child care spots in Minnesota, including more than 1,400 in St. Cloud, according to the Greater Minnesota Partnership. “If we’re going to entice (women) back into the workforce, they’re going to need child care. Or maybe they’d like to consider going into child care,” said Don Hickman, vice president for Community and Workforce Development at the Initiative Foundation. “But without child care, we’re going to have a much slower economic recovery.” In recent months, a new solution has emerged to help address that need. Pine Technical and Community College launched a new training program for child care providers in March, with St. Cloud Technical and Community College set to follow suit. Participants will pay next to nothing to take classes and earn a certificate because outside funders are so eager to bolster the child care workforce.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Despite the state’s declining COVID-19 vaccination rate, a statewide survey shows residents are actually more likely to get vaccinated than what has been indicated in national polls, according to state health officials. Survey results published last month by the Morning Consult, a national data intelligence company, had claimed Mississippians are the most unwilling in the U.S. when it comes to getting a COVID-19 shot. It showed 30% of more than 2,000 survey-takers in Mississippi were unwilling to get a vaccine to armor against the coronavirus. Another 18% were undecided. A recent trust survey conducted by the state health department and the Community Engagement Alliance from December to March told a different story. Of over 11,000 Mississippians surveyed, Director of Preventive Health and Health Equity Victor Sutton said 73% were willing to get vaccinated. The survey also showed there was not much variation based on political affiliation. That strays from the Pew Research Center’s national data revealing Republicans are less likely to get a shot than Democrats. The conflicting results stem from how questions were asked, Sutton said. The variation isn’t unusual. “We did a really rich, grassroots outreach,” he said. “It’s very Mississippi-centric.”\n\nMissouri\n\nCarthage: A gathering that traditionally has drawn tens of thousands of Vietnamese Catholics from across the U.S. to southwest Missouri has been canceled for a second straight year because of the pandemic. The Joplin Globe reports the city of Carthage and the Congregation of the Mother of the Redeemer have decided that the risk of COVID-19 transmission is still too great to hold the Marian Days celebration. Before 2020, the event had taken place in the city every year since 1978, reuniting families and friends separated after the fall of Saigon. The Rev. John Paul Tai Tran, provincial minister of the congregation, said the decision not to hold the celebration during the first week of August was again difficult. “Our people come from all over, and there are a lot of states in the U.S. where the cases of infection are still booming,” he said. Carthage police Chief Greg Dagnan said the leaders of the congregation met with city officials last Tuesday about the event but had pretty much decided beforehand that it would still be too dangerous. “We’re not at the level where we can have 50,000 or 60,000 people stand shoulder-to-shoulder and camp together for a week,” Dagnan said.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: About 96% of residents who have received their first COVID-19 vaccine have been returning to get their second dose, state health officials said. Jim Murphy, administrator of the health department’s Communicable Disease Control and Prevention Bureau, told Montana Public Radio he’s pleased that nearly everyone who got a first dose is following up with a second. Nationally, 8% of people who were due to get their second dose by April 9 didn’t return for their second shot, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. Out of almost 400,000 Montanans who have received a first dose of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, about 14,600 are at least two weeks overdue for their second shot, Murphy said. It’s possible some have received a second dose in another state or decided to get a second dose at a pharmacy rather than returning to a mass vaccination clinic, he said, while others could wrongly believe they are protected after one dose. Others may be wary after their initial experience or reports of side effects by others. Dr. Douglas Kuntzweiler with Mountain-Pacific Quality Health told a nervous woman last week during a virtual AARP Montana town hall that a bad case of COVID-19 would cause a person to feel a lot worse than the brief potential side effects of being vaccinated.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state government will collect an extra $90 million in tax revenue in the current fiscal year that ends June 30 but will face a less rosy outlook over the following two years, based on new state estimates. The Nebraska Economic Forecasting Advisory Board on Friday lowered its revenue projections by $5 million over the following two budget years, starting July 1. The new predictions will give lawmakers about $38 million more than expected in the current legislative session, after adjusting for requirements of state law. The projections will also trigger an automatic boost to a new state property tax credit program. Gov. Pete Ricketts urged lawmakers to “stay the course” with his plan to ease the local property tax burden for Nebraska residents. “Nebraska’s economy continues to show significant signs of strength as we emerge from the pandemic,” Ricketts said.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: Gov. Steve Sisolak said Friday that the panel he appointed to oversee the state’s coronavirus pandemic response won’t meet regularly after June 1, the date he has set for lifting coronavirus mitigation restrictions except mask mandates. Caleb Cage also will step down as COVID-19 response director and return to the Nevada System of Higher Education with a promotion to vice chancellor of workforce development and chief innovation officer, the governor and the university system announced. Sisolak praised Cage for “a year of selfless public service” and called Cage’s emergency management leadership and expertise invaluable to the state. “While the pandemic is not yet over, our state response efforts will naturally transition as the situation evolves and we focus on mass vaccination of Nevadans,” the governor said. The task force began regular meetings last August. Sisolak said it will continue to meet through May, while the state’s 17 counties assume full local control of COVID-19 restrictions. Weekly COVID-19 Task Force calls with the media will end in June, the Democratic governor said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: An annual contest that rewards high school journalists in the state has been adjusted this year to take into account the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Previously, those competing for the Brodsky Prize were required to submit examples of published work. But given the challenges the pandemic posed to school papers, this year’s contest asks students to submit essays of up to 800 words about how the pandemic has challenged their communities or schools and how it could lead to positive changes. The $5,000 prize, established by a former editor of the school paper at Central High School in Manchester, is open to all New Hampshire high school seniors. The deadline for submissions is May 14.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state will lift all COVID-19 outdoor gathering limits and remove a 50% capacity limit on indoor restaurants and bars beginning May 19 as long as social distancing can be maintained, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. Murphy said the state’s positive coronavirus trends have enabled the change. “This means that the events that we all associate with summer, from fireworks displays to parades to the state fair, can all go forward, as long as attendees keep 6 feet of distance,” he said. Murphy also announced that relaxed restrictions slated to take effect May 10 will now apply Friday, three days earlier. Those changes include increasing the outdoor gathering limits to 500 people and raising indoor capacities to 50% up to 250 individuals for political gatherings, weddings, funerals, memorial services and performances. Privately catered events will also be permitted to have dancing. Murphy, a Democrat seeking reelection this year, will also remove a prohibition on tables of eight diners or more. Tables can be spaced closer than 6 feet if partitions are used. Also done away with is a 50% capacity limit for religious services, retail, gyms, saloons and amusement businesses. Instead, Murphy said, the state will require a minimum of 6 feet of distance between people.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State legislators bristled Friday at vetoes by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham that block legislative authority over new federal pandemic aid, and they said they may seek a court ruling to defend the Legislature’s authority over that spending. Pandemic relief legislation signed this year by President Joe Biden assigns $1.6 billion in aid directly to New Mexico’s government. Legislators in March assigned $1.1 billion to backfill the state’s unemployment insurance trust, underwrite roadway projects, provide several years of tuition-free college to in-state students and shore up finances at state museums. Lujan Grisham vetoed those provisions, and several leading legislators say the governor went too far in asserting her authority over the money. Lawmakers also say several line-item vetoes to a budget bill went beyond simple spending deletions to alter or expand state spending. During a meeting Friday of a year-round legislative committee on budgeting and accountability, state Sen. George Munoz, D-Gallup, urged colleagues to seek an opinion from the state Supreme Court. “I just think that the Legislature has to determine under their purview if they’re going to be the funding body, or are we going to let the governor dictate,” he said. “This is not a personal battle.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city’s subway will begin rolling all night again, and capacity restrictions for most types of businesses will end statewide in mid-May, as COVID-19 infection rates continue to decline, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Monday. City subway service will return to 24-hour operation May 17 after being closed for cleaning during overnight hours since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic last year, the Democratic governor said. Capacity restrictions on businesses – including restaurants, offices, beauty salons and gyms – will be lifted in New York and its neighboring states of New Jersey and Connecticut on May 19, Cuomo said. Businesses in New York will still be required to operate in a way that guarantees that unvaccinated people can keep 6 feet of social distancing space, even after the occupancy limits go away, the governor said. New York City’s subways, famous for all-night operation, were shut down between 1 a.m. and 5 a.m. starting April 30, 2020, so that trains and stations could be disinfected. The change was also intended to make it easier to remove homeless people from trains where many had been spending the night. The overnight closure was scaled back to 2 a.m. to 4 a.m. in February.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: In light of the COVID-19 pandemic’s strain on students through virtual, hybrid and distanced in-person instruction, local school districts anticipate an uptick in summer school attendance this year. Buncombe County Schools spokesperson Stacia Harris said the district predicts more students will attend school this summer than last year, when 1,600 students participated in the county’s summer program, which was available virtually and in person for students going into first through fifth grades. Before the pandemic, the district’s only summer programs were reading support for first through third grades and credit recovery for high schoolers who failed classes and needed to retake them. Asheville City Schools spokesperson Ashley-Michelle Thublin said the district is still finalizing the number of students who need summer school. Daniel Winthrow, a member of the North Carolina Association of Educators and teacher for the academically and intellectually gifted at Isaac Dickson Elementary School, said he could see many students opting for summer instruction for Asheville City Schools. “As a teacher, I’m seeing a lot of students just academically are not in the same place that you would expect them to be at this point in the year, which makes sense having a global pandemic,” he said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum has signed into law a bill that directs the state’s Department of Health and its Department of Human Services to unite into the North Dakota Department of Health and Human Services, effective Sept. 1, 2022. “North Dakota’s Department of Health and Department of Human Services have a long history of working together to serve the citizens of our state, as evidenced by their lifesaving work during the current pandemic,” Burgum said in a statement. “By bringing these two agencies together, we will build on each agency’s strengths, enhance collaboration, provide expanded career opportunities for team members and, most importantly, deliver programs and services more efficiently and effectively to the citizens of North Dakota.” The governor’s office will lead an integration team with representation from the two agencies. “Team members from both agencies have distinguished themselves with their dedication, commitment and sacrifice throughout the COVID-19 pandemic,” Burgum said. “Improving health, providing quality human services and supporting our team members will continue to be our top priorities as we build a streamlined service delivery system for North Dakota citizens.”\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: Fully vaccinated employees at nursing homes and assisted living facilities don’t need to be tested for the coronavirus, Gov. Mike DeWine announced Monday. Staff who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 must still be tested twice a week. “When staff is not vaccinated, that does increase the odds of the virus getting into the nursing home,” DeWine said. Someone is considered fully vaccinated two weeks after his or her final shot. The state reported fewer than 1,000 new COVID-19 cases between Sunday and Monday. “We are moving in the right direction in regard to cases,” DeWine said. Ohio reported 89 new COVID-19 hospitalizations and 17 patients admitted to intensive care units during that time, according to Ohio Department of Health data. Ohio is at 147.9 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 residents over the past two weeks. If the state dips below 50 new cases per 100,000 residents, DeWine said he would lift all health orders, including the mask requirement.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: More than 110,000 people who got a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine in the state are overdue for a second one, according to state health department data. Of those who have received a first dose through state allocations, 9.4% are at least two weeks late on their second. That doesn’t include those who have received vaccines in Oklahoma through federal allocations, such as those given through tribal governments. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are a two-dose regimen, given three and four weeks apart, respectively. The first dose can offer some protection, but to get the 90%-plus efficacy shown in the vaccines’ clinical trials, both shots are necessary, experts say. Health Department Deputy Commissioner Keith Reed said vaccine providers try to set second-dose appointments at the time someone gets their first dose and send reminders to return to complete the series. “We also realize that things do come up, life gets in the way sometimes, and people need to reschedule, so hopefully they’ll respond to our reminders and step up and get vaccinated,” he said. “Because while we’re pleased to get one dose into people, because that does afford some significant protection, we want them to be fully vaccinated and receive the full benefits of vaccination.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Last week was unusually slow for Oregon National Guard members distributing COVID-19 vaccinations at the Oregon State Fairgrounds. For the past four months, the site has seen a steady stream of Oregonians receiving their first and second doses. “But this past week, it’s like we fell off a cliff,” said Col. Ron Smith, of Sherwood, who oversees the vaccine administration at the fairgrounds. Smith and his fellow supervisors are unsure why. Smith, 59, said the site has the resources to vaccinate 5,000 people per day, though Guard members vaccinated about half that number of people Wednesday. “We have the doses, we have the staffing and everything ready to go, and we’re kind of just sitting here begging for people right now,” Smith said. Guard supervisors are still scratching their heads about the drop-off in vaccine recipients. “Maybe we’ve got all the people who want to get shots, and now we’re down to the people who for whatever reason are hesitant. Who knows what it is, but it is,” Smith said. The State Fairgrounds is not the only site experiencing a drop in demand. Statewide, vaccinations peaked at about 52,000 per day April 8. They were down to 26,000 on April 28.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state should immediately terminate the no-bid state contract of a company that performed coronavirus contact tracing and exposed the private medical information of tens of thousands of residents, Republican lawmakers said Monday. GOP leaders also called for state and federal probes into the Atlanta-based contractor’s mishandling of the data and what they said was the slow response by the Wolf administration. Employees of Insight Global used unauthorized Google accounts – readily viewable online – to store names, phone numbers, email addresses, COVID-19 exposure status, sexual orientations and other information about residents who had been reached for contact tracing. The company’s contract with the state required it safeguard people’s data. The Department of Health said last week that at least 72,000 people were affected. The state plans to drop Insight Global once its contract expires at the end of the July. But GOP lawmakers said at a news conference at the Capitol on Monday that the administration of Gov. Tom Wolf needs to find a new vendor immediately. “The public trust in Insight Global is gone,” said state Rep. Jason Ortitay, R-Allegheny. “And as as long as the company continues to do contact tracing for our state, who is going to give them any information?”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: High schools across the state have scheduled vaccination clinics this week for their students 16 and up, starting Monday at Cranston East. Another clinic is scheduled for Wednesday at Cranston West, Barrington is scheduled to host a clinic Thursday, and Johnston and North Kingstown are set to vaccinate students starting Friday. Cranston Mayor Kenneth Hopkins told WPRI-TV that vaccinations will help students feel safe during prom and graduation season and give them a chance to get a shot before college, as many schools are requiring students to be vaccinated for the fall semester. The city is providing the Pfizer vaccine, which is authorized for use in those over the age of 16. Students can get a shot without parental authorization, the state Department of Health said. Second doses for Cranston students are scheduled to be administered May 24 and 26. Gov. Daniel McKee said last week that his administration will work with any high school that wants to host a vaccination clinic for students.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Greenville County got nearly twice as much federal pandemic aid as all other South Carolina counties combined, and more than a third of that money was kept for county government’s own use. Because of its population, the county qualified for a direct allocation of $91.3 million from the $2 trillion stimulus package enacted last spring. Greenville County Administrator Joe Kernell dispersed about $58.5 million in community health grants, financial assistance to businesses, and funding for other government agencies and nonprofits. He decided to keep the remaining 35% of the money for county government’s own uses. Nearly $33 million was spent to pay emergency medical personnel and buy equipment ranging from medical mannequins to take-home computers as well as cover other expenses such as face masks, advertising costs and cellphone bills. Because they had fewer than 500,000 residents, South Carolina’s 45 other counties had to submit requests to state officials in Columbia for funding from the federal package. Those counties ended up getting a total of about $46 million. Kernell didn’t face such oversight. After approving a budget outline in June, Greenville County Council members allowed the administrator to make spending decisions.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nMount Rushmore National Memorial: Gov. Kristi Noem on Monday told the state’s tourism industry to gear up for a busy summer, as she expects an influx of visitors itching to travel after more than a year of dealing with the coronavirus pandemic. During an event at Mount Rushmore National Memorial, where she is suing to hold another fireworks display this summer, the Republican governor said there are many signs that tourism – the state’s second-largest industry – will make a big rebound. Tourism spending dropped by 18% in 2020, but Noem said the state still welcomed ample visitors. She drew widespread attention and criticism for forgoing virus restrictions and hosting a fireworks display at Mount Rushmore that featured former President Donald Trump. She also welcomed people to the annual Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, where hundreds contracted COVID-19 and brought it back to 30 states. “The tourism industry is so important to our entire state,” Noem said, pointing to the tax revenue it brings in and jobs it sustains. The governor has initiated a legal battle with President Joe Biden’s administration over holding fireworks at the monument to celebrate Independence Day again this year. The National Park Service denied the state’s application to hold the event this summer due to safety concerns and objections from local Native American tribes.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The city’s financial leaders have presented what credit-rating agencies deemed a stable $2.6billion budget package despite devastating natural disasters, the pandemic and social unrest that dragged at city coffers. Finances are so steady that $267 million in federal COVID-19 pandemic recovery funds can be set aside for more services and economic growth, officials said Friday. A controversial 34% property tax increase will set the city up for years of fiscal health while maintaining relatively low rates, they said. “The property tax increase stabilized our revenue base,” Finance Director Kevin Crumbo said Friday. “The American Rescue Plan will move us from a stable position to one that is sustainable for generations to come.” The full line-item budget will be released this week. But Crumbo outlined key takeaways, and Mayor John Cooper released his priorities for the fiscal year beginning July 1. Cooper will invest in a hefty pay raise for teachers, improved roads and expanded bus routes, and more affordable housing development. “Last year’s budget was a crisis budget. This year’s budget is an investment budget,” Cooper said. “We’ve weathered the storm. And we have a new opportunity to rise, together.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Serving up a to-go margarita with Maudie’s Tex Mex fare “has been a lifesaver” for the restaurant chain over the past year, said Ryan Leugers, director of operations for the Austin-based company. He said the to-go alcohol option, temporarily afforded to Texas restaurants as the pandemic ravaged sales, has boosted mixed-beverage sales 10% to 20% across the restaurant’s six Austin-area locations. Now, a bill headed to Gov. Greg Abbott’s desk would make alcohol to-go sales at restaurants a permanent option. Abbott last year expressed support for making such sales permanent. Under the bill, establishments could sell beer, wine and mixed drinks as part of pickup and delivery food orders. House Bill 1024 was filed by Republican state Rep. Charlie Geren, who owns a barbecue restaurant in Fort Worth. The House approved the bill in March, and the Senate gave final approval Wednesday. If Abbott signs the bill, it will go into effect immediately. If he doesn’t sign it and allows it to become law, it will take effect Sept. 1. The Texas Restaurant Association applauded the legislation to make alcohol to-go sales permanent. “This ability has saved thousands of restaurant jobs during the pandemic, and it will remain a critical tool as the industry rebuilds,” the association said in a statement.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: State health officials have announced more options for free rapid coronavirus testing. The test sites, which are determined by health officials based on an area’s positivity rates, testing rates, wastewater sampling and other surveillance data, offer free tests to anyone 3 or older, with test results typically expected in less than an hour. Some of the locations are drive-thru, while others are held indoors. Those held inside ask people to wear masks and maintain social distancing while waiting in line. Anyone with symptoms associated with COVID-19, even if they are minor, is encouraged to get tested. Those who have been in contact with someone who has had COVID-19 while they could have been infectious are also encouraged to get tested. The Utah Department of Health asks that anyone seeking a test register online first. Registration can be done on site, but it could take longer to receive a test. Identification may also be required. Rapid antigen tests are less sensitive than the also-common polymerase chain reaction tests, according to the department. This means PCR tests are better than antigen tests at detecting the virus, especially when a person has small amounts of virus in their body.\n\nVermont\n\nSt. Johnsbury: The Vermont Department of Motor Vehicles is considering whether to reopen a number of regional offices across the state that were closed during the early days of the pandemic. DMV Commissioner Wanda Minoli said officials are in the process of evaluating the future of offices in St. Albans, St. Johnsbury, Middlebury, Dummerston and White River Junction. Offices in Bennington, Rutland, Newport, South Burlington and Springfield are open by appointment only. The pandemic spurred significant improvements to online services, such as license renewals and some vehicle registration services, that has reduced demand for in-person services. Minoli has said the reopening of satellite locations is dependent on how things go in the locations that are open. “Accessibility and user-friendliness are at an all-time high, with additional online systems and services that were developed throughout the pandemic to enable customers to do their business right at their own computer,” Minoli said in an email to the Caledonian Record. Among the services now available online are online vehicle registration and standard learner’s permit tests. Commercial learner’s permits tests must still be taken in person, as must driving tests.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Those who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can forgo a face mask outdoors, Gov. Ralph Northam says, as long as they are alone or with others who have also completed a vaccine regimen. The Democratic governor amended his mask order Thursday to align with federal guidelines released last week by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Anyone who is considered “fully vaccinated” – meaning they are two weeks removed from their last or only dose of a vaccine – is safe to be outside without a mask as long as they are alone or in a small group with others also fully vaccinated. Masks still would be required in crowded outdoor settings such as concerts and sporting events. “The CDC’s recommendations underscore what we have said all along – vaccinations are the way we will put this pandemic behind us and get back to normal life,” Northam said in a statement. “Our increasing vaccination rate and decreasing number of new COVID-19 cases has made it possible to ease mitigation measures in a thoughtful and measured manner.” Northam also changed the effective date of new guidelines for outdoor sporting events from May 15 to immediately accommodate this past weekend’s slate of state high school football championship games.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: With coronavirus cases rising dramatically in Kitsap in recent weeks, the county faces the possibility of tighter restrictions and being sent back a phase in the state’s reopening plan. Counties must either keep new case rates below 200 cases per 100,000 residents over a two-week period or new hospitalizations below five per 100,000 over a one-week period to stay in Phase 3. Kitsap Public Health District Administrator Keith Grellner said Friday that Kitsap’s case rate is now well above 200. “There is a strong possibility that the state will move Kitsap County back to Phase 2 ... because COVID-19 disease activity and hospitalizations appear to be exceeding the state’s thresholds,” he said. “This a wake-up call for our community. We need to get as many residents as possible vaccinated so we can curb the spread of COVID-19 and get our recovery back on track.” The tightened restrictions in Phase 2 limit gatherings to 25% capacity in settings like indoor eating and drinking establishments, entertainment venues, worship services, retail stores and fitness facilities, among other limitations. A phase rollback would be announced Tuesday, and the new restrictions would be implemented Friday. The next reevaluation would happen in three weeks. All but three counties statewide are currently in Phase 3.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nKeyser: WVU Potomac State College will hold its spring commencement ceremony Saturday, but it will look different from in years past as the college implements safety protocols amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This year, the location has changed to the Keyser High School Alumni Stadium to meet the physical distancing requirements mandated by state regulations for graduation ceremonies. The event will be held rain or shine. Additionally, the college is issuing guest tickets this year, allowing four per graduate. Tickets are required to enter the stadium. Children 2 and younger will be allowed to sit on parents’ laps without the need for a ticket. Masks will be required at all times. The college will also welcome back May, August and December 2020 graduates who registered to participate with the May 2021 graduates. Giving the keynote address will be campus President Jennifer Orlikoff. The ceremony will be livestreamed for family and friends who are unable to attend in person.\n\nWisconsin\n\nBaraboo: Observation towers and playgrounds at Wisconsin state parks have reopened, as more restrictions in place during the coronavirus pandemic are loosening. The state Department of Natural Resources has also increased capacity to 100 at open-air shelters, amphitheaters and outdoor group campgrounds, WMTV reports. “Over the course of the past year, we have been closely monitoring the health activities going on and making adjustments to our operations when it’s safe to do so,” said Brian Hefty, Wisconsin State Parks deputy director. “We’ll continue to do that with public safety being the No. 1 priority for us.” Attendance at state parks has increased 25% so far this year compared to 2020, the DNR said. Hefty said state park staff will continue to monitor public areas and keep an eye on park capacity limits. If the crowds grow too large, staff may enact a temporary capacity closure.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Bicyclists will no longer be allowed to ride into Yellowstone National Park through the south gate before the road opens for motorized vehicles each spring. After spring plowing, Yellowstone keeps some of its interior roads closed to motorized vehicles for several weeks while opening them to human-powered recreation. The park recently announced a permanent ban on bikes between the South Entrance and Grant Village during the spring shoulder season, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. “Usually there are high snowbanks, no place to get out of the road and no restrooms in that section,” Yellowstone spokeswoman Linda Veress said. “It wasn’t the safest place to ride a bike.” Fewer bicyclists ride in southern Yellowstone in spring compared to the more accessible main road through nearby Grand Teton National Park. Snow and ice prevented Yellowstone’s South Entrance from opening to bicyclists in 2018 and 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic closed the road through much of the spring of 2020. Yellowstone officials plan to open the south gate to all traffic May 14.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/crime/crime-and-courts/2022/10/24/pike-county-killings-cyber-surveillance-ohio-bureau-criminal-investigation/69578829007/", "title": "'It's not Hollywood.'

The measure failed to ban any weapons, but it includes funding for school safety and state crisis intervention programs. Many states – including California, Delaware and New York – have also passed new laws to help curb gun violence, such as regulating untraceable ghost guns and strengthening background check systems.\n\nThe year 2022 is the second-highest year of mass shootings in the United States on record, according to data compiled by the Gun Violence Archive, a non-profit tracking gun violence incidents across the country.\n\nThere have been at least 647 mass shootings through December 31 this year. The country saw 692 mass shootings in 2021, the worst year on record since the Gun Violence Archive began tracking mass shootings in 2014.\n\nThe Gun Violence Archive, like CNN, defines a mass shooting as one in which at least four people are shot, excluding the shooter.\n\nThere is a direct correlation in states with weaker gun laws and higher rates of gun deaths, including homicides, suicides and accidental killings, according to a January study published by Everytown for Gun Safety, a non-profit focused on gun violence prevention.\n\nNot everyone agrees increased gun control is the answer. Some Americans advocate for their right to keep and bear arms, enshrined in the Constitution, while others argue gun control measures save lives and do not infringe citizen rights.\n\nAmid the debate, some lawmakers have forged ahead with passing gun control laws.\n\n“States continue to lead on gun safety, passing new and innovative policies that we will work to replicate across the country while continuing to secure significant investments in community violence intervention programs,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, which has been fighting for gun safety measures since the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut, which killed 20 children and six educators.\n\n“This progress and our electoral victories in November shows that the gun violence prevention movement is stronger than ever and sets the stage for continued progress in the new year,” Watts continued.\n\nHere is a summary of the state and federal laws approved in 2022:\n\nFederal legislation\n\nOn June 25, Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act after the House and the Senate approved the measure. The package represents the most significant federal legislation to address gun violence since the expired 10-year assault weapons ban of 1994.\n\n“God willing, it’s going to save a lot of lives,” Biden said at the White House as he signed the bill.\n\nThe package includes $750 million to help states implement and run crisis intervention programs, which can be used to manage red flag programs, as well as for other crisis intervention programs such as mental health, drug and veteran courts.\n\nRed flag laws, approved by the federal measure, are also known as Extreme Risk Protection Order laws. They allow courts to temporarily seize firearms from anyone believed to be a danger to themselves or others.\n\nThe legislation encourages states to include juvenile records in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which would provide a more comprehensive background check for people between 18 and 21 who want to buy guns.\n\nIt also requires more individuals who sell guns as primary sources of income to register as Federally Licensed Firearm Dealers, which are required to administer background checks before they sell a gun to someone.\n\nThe law bars guns from anyone convicted of a domestic violence crime who has a “continuing serious relationship of a romantic or intimate nature.” The law, however, allows those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence crimes to restore their gun rights after five years if they haven’t committed other crimes.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalifornia was ranked the top state in the nation for gun safety in 2021. It has the strongest system in the nation for removing firearms from people who become prohibited from having them, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom in July signed a package of five bills on gun safety after they were passed by the California State Senate.\n\nOn July 1, Newsom signed AB 2571, which prohibits the gun industry from marketing firearm-related products to minors, as well as AB 1621, which further restricts ghost guns, including the parts used to build them.\n\nOn July 12, the governor signed AB 1594, legislation establishing a firearm industry standard of conduct to promote “safe and responsible firearm industry member practices,” the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is AB 2156, signed on July 21, which cracks down on the manufacture of firearms by prohibiting any person, regardless of federal licensure, from manufacturing firearms without a state license. It also prohibits unlicensed individuals from using 3D printing to manufacture any firearm or precursor part.\n\nThe last bill, signed on July 22, is SB 1327. It allows private citizens to bring civil action against anyone who manufactures, distributes, transports or imports assault weapons or ghost guns, which are banned in the state.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis signed House Bill 22-1086, or The Vote Without Fear Act, on March 30.\n\nThe law prohibits a person from openly carrying a firearm within any polling location or central count facility.\n\nIt also bans individuals from open carrying within “100 feet of a ballot drop box or any building in which a polling location or central count facility is located,” while election activity is in progress, according to the legislation. Violations are punishable by a maximum $1,000 fine, up to 364 days imprisonment in the county jail, or both.\n\nDelaware\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney on June 30 signed a package of gun safety bills including legislation to prohibit assault weapons, regulate high-capacity magazines and strengthen background checks.\n\nThe Delaware Lethal Firearms Safety Act of 2022 prohibits the manufacture, sale, offer to sell, transfer, purchase, receipt, possession or transport of assault weapons in Delaware, subject to certain exceptions, according to HB 450.\n\nThe package also includes legislation to raise the minimum age requirement to purchase or possess a firearm from 18 to 21, ban the use of devices which convert handguns into fully automatic weapons and hold gun manufacturers and dealers “liable for reckless or negligent actions that lead to gun violence,” the bill states.\n\nIllinois\n\nIllinois Gov. JB Pritzker signed two bills to address secure storage of firearms and regulating ghost guns.\n\nOn May 18, the governor signed HB 4383, which prohibits individuals from selling or possessing ghost guns and ensures all firearms are serialized, allowing law enforcement to better trace them.\n\nPritzker later signed HB4729 on June 10, which requires the Department of Public Health to develop and implement a two-year public awareness campaign focused on safe gun storage, which includes sharing information about safe gun storage, the bill says.\n\nMaryland\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan announced on April 8 he would allow Senate Bill 387, which bans the sale or possession of ghost guns, to become law without his signature, noting it doesn’t go far enough in taking “decisive action to hold violent criminals accountable.”\n\nThe bill, which took effect on June 1 after bipartisan support, expands the definition of “firearm” to include an unfinished frame or receiver. It requires the Secretary of State Police to maintain a system to register firearms imprinted with serial numbers and “prohibits a person from purchasing, receiving, selling, offering to sell, or transferring an ‘unfinished frame or receiver’ or a firearm unless imprinted with specified information,” the bill states.\n\nThe law also requires the governor to allocate $150,000 in the annual state budget to fund registration proceedings.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy on July 5 signed seven gun safety bills, six of which were part of his Gun Safety 3.0 package he introduced to the state legislature in April 2021.\n\nThe package includes legislation which would allow the state’s attorney general to sue members of the firearm industry for violations stemming from the sale or marketing of firearms, the bill states.\n\nAlso included in the package is legislation to regulate the sale of handgun ammunition, developing a system of electronic reporting of these sales; and require training prior to the issuance of a gun purchaser identification card with a validity date of 10 years.\n\nAnother bill in the package mandates firearm owners who become state residents to obtain a Firearm Purchaser Identification Card and register out-of-state acquired handguns, according to the bill.\n\nOn December 22, Murphy signed another gun safety bill strengthening the state’s firearm licensing laws and established a list of ‘sensitive places’ where concealed carry is prohibited, including playgrounds, bars and restaurants serving alcohol, train stations, and polling places.\n\nNew York\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul signed a package of bills and an additional piece of legislation to address a wide range of gun safety issues.\n\nHochul signed a gun safety package on June 6, which includes bills requiring microstamping on handguns, strengthen the state’s extreme risk and firearm purchase permit law, raise the minimum age to purchase semi-automatic rifles to 21 and enhance information sharing between state, local and federal agencies when guns are used in crimes.\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court decision on June 23 to strike down a New York gun law enacted more than a century ago which places restrictions on carrying a concealed handgun outside the home, Hochul signed legislation to strengthen the state’s gun laws and bolster restrictions on concealed carry weapons.\n\nThe law, which takes effect on September 1, will expand eligibility requirements in the concealed carry permitting process, restrict the carrying of concealed weapons in sensitive locations and establish state oversight over background checks for guns and regular checks on license holders for criminal convictions, according to the legislation.\n\nOregon\n\nIn the November 2022 US midterm elections, Oregon voters enacted a gun safety ballot measure, Measure 114, which strengthens background checks and prohibits the sale and transfer of ammunition magazines holding more than 10 rounds.\n\nThe measure also closes the “Charleston Loophole,” which allows gun purchases to move forward by default after three days even if a background check has not been completed. It requires state police to complete background checks on individuals before a gun sale or transfer is made.\n\nRhode Island\n\nRhode Island Gov. Daniel McKee signed three gun safety bills on June 21. They prohibit high-capacity magazines, ban the open carry of rifles and shotguns in public and raise the legal age to purchase firearms or ammunition from 18 to 21, with exceptions for law enforcement officers.\n\nOne of the bills also changes the definition of “rifle” and “shotgun” consistent with federal law.\n\nVermont\n\nVermont Gov. Phil Scott signed into law a package on March 25 banning firearms from hospital buildings and prohibits the transfer of firearms between unlicensed people.\n\nThe governor vetoed a similar bill, S.30, in February which would have closed the “Charleston Loophole.”\n\nThe new law, S.4, addresses the policy by extending the time period to seven days for the federal government to complete a background check before an individual can purchase a firearm. It also strengthens protections for victims of domestic violence, according to the bill.\n\nWashington\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee signed three gun safety bills into law on March 23.\n\nHB 1705 prohibits the manufacture, sale, purchase or possession of ghost guns, while HB 1630 prohibits the open carry of firearms at local government meetings and restricts them at school board meetings and election-related locations.\n\nThe third bill, SB 5078, prohibits high-capacity magazines, defined as an “ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than 17 rounds of ammunition,” the bill states.", "authors": ["Emma Tucker"], "publish_date": "2022/07/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/20/politics/biden-laws-passed-priorities-to-get-done-executive-orders/index.html", "title": "5 significant bills and 5 executive orders Biden signed in his first ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPresident Joe Biden took the oath of office a year ago with the country facing challenges not seen in generations.\n\nOn top of a once-in-a-century pandemic, the new President inherited an economy that had crumbled as Covid-19 cases rose and a nation so divided that his predecessors supporters had stormed the US Capitol two weeks prior in a bid to stop his ascent. Still, expectations for Biden were sky high among Democrats after Jon Ossoff and the Rev. Raphael Warnock won run-off elections in Georgia to become the Peach State’s senators and flip the chamber to the Democrats, giving the Democrats control of Congress by the narrowest of margins.\n\nOver the last year, Biden managed to get some of his top priorities passed through Congress but remains stymied on others, leaving him with less than a year to work with Democrats to pass his legislative agenda before the next Congress is sworn-in following the 2022 midterm elections. He also used his executive branch powers to sign 77 executive orders in his first year in office, outpacing his predecessors former President Donald Trump, who signed 58 executive orders in the same time; former President Barack Obama, who signed 41; and former President George W. Bush, who signed 56, according to data from the Federal Register.\n\nHere are the top five bills Biden signed into law this year, his top five executive orders and the top five things he will prioritize in 2022.\n\nFive marquee laws Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. The American Rescue Plan Act and extending existing Covid-19 programs\n\nUS President Joe Biden signs the American Rescue Plan on March 11, 2021, in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC. - Biden signed the $1.9 trillion economic stimulus bill and will give a national address urging \"hope\" on the first anniversary of the start of the coronavirus pandemic.

The series of measures – which make up one of the most consequential pieces of legislation in decades intended to bolster the US’ recovery from the coronavirus pandemic – included stimulus payments of up to $1,400 per person for about 90% of American households, a $300 federal boost to weekly jobless benefits and an expansion of the child tax credit of up to $3,600 per child.\n\nThe plan, which did not receive support from any Republicans in Congress, also included $350 billion in state and local aid, as well as billions of dollars for K-12 schools to help students return to the classroom, to assist small businesses hit hard by the pandemic and for vaccine research, development and distribution.\n\nThat same month, Biden also signed two bills extending existing economic relief during the pandemic. He signed legislation into law extending the Paycheck Protection Program – the federal government’s key relief effort to deliver aid to small businesses hard hit by the pandemic. He also signed through the COVID-19 Bankruptcy Relief Extension Act, which extended temporary bankruptcy relief provisions granted by the CARES Act.\n\n2. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act\n\nBiden signed the legislation into law in November, which infuses $1.2 trillion dollars into Americans’ traditional “hard” infrastructure, such as roads and bridges. The bill’s passage was marked at a White House event with lawmakers from both parties.\n\nThe legislation provided $550 billion in new federal investments for American roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports and waterways. The package also included $65 billion for improving broadband infrastructure and billions for improving the electric grid and water systems. Another $7.5 billion is going toward establishing a nationwide network of plug-in electric vehicle chargers.\n\nThe “hard” infrastructure package is part one of a two-part infrastructure plan proposed by Biden. The second portion, a $1.75 trillion economic and climate package called “Build Back Better,” has yet to pass in the Senate.\n\n3. Bills to avoid a government shutdown and keep the federal government running\n\nBiden signed two stopgap measures – one in late September and one in December – to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nDecember’s extension, which came just hours before a midnight deadline, marked the end of an impasse over some Republican senators’ objections to Biden’s Covid-19 vaccine requirements. Funding in the December stopgap bill extends through mid-February.\n\nIn December, Biden also signed a bill raising the national debt limit by $2.5 trillion and extending it into 2023.\n\nAdditionally, the President signed two emergency provisions for funding in July and September – the Extending Government Funding and Delivering Emergency Assistance Act and the Emergency Security Supplemental Appropriations Act.\n\nThe first provided additional emergency funding to address the aftermath of the January 6 insurrection, financial needs arising from the US withdrawal from Afghanistan and expenses incurred at the US Capitol as a result of the pandemic. The second bill provided funding for disaster relief and Afghanistan evacuees, among other appropriations.\n\n4. Juneteenth National Independence Day Act\n\nBiden signed a bill into law in the summer establishing June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day – a US federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the US.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday commemorates June 19, 1865, when Union Major General Gordon Granger announced the end of slavery in Galveston, Texas, in accordance with President Abraham Lincoln’s 1863 Emancipation Proclamation. Efforts to establish Juneteenth as a federal holiday gained momentum following Black Lives Matter protests sparked by the police killing of George Floyd.\n\nJuneteenth is the first federal holiday established since Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 1983 and becomes at least the 11th federal holiday recognized by the US federal government.\n\n5. Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act\n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which banned imports from China’s Xinjiang region, was signed into law in December.\n\nThe new law bans imports unless an importer can prove the goods were not made with forced labor in the region of the country accused of human rights violations over its treatment of Muslim-majority Uyghurs.\n\nFive significant executive orders Biden signed in his first year\n\n1. Reversing Trump-era policies\n\nThe first days of the Biden administration were marked, largely, by a reversal of actions taken by the Trump administration. Biden campaigned, in part, on dismantling his predecessor’s legacy, and moved quickly to undo some of Trump’s policies starting on day one. In his first 100 days in office, Biden signed more than 60 executive actions, 24 of which were direct reversals of Trump’s policies.\n\nIn his first hours after he was inaugurated, Biden halted funding for the construction of Trump’s border wall, reversed his travel ban targeting largely Muslim countries and embraced progressive policies on the environment and diversity that Trump spent four years blocking. Biden also reversed several of Trump’s attempts to withdraw from international agreements, beginning the process of rejoining the Paris climate accord and halting the United States’ departure from the World Health Organization. And he imposed a mask mandate in federal buildings, a symbolic break with Trump’s handling of the pandemic.\n\nBiden later revoked Trump-era executive orders targeting TikTok and other Chinese apps, another aimed at “Preventing Online Censorship,” and an order to build “the Garden of American Heroes” announced by Trump during an Independence Day celebration at Mount Rushmore in 2020.\n\n2. Vaccine requirements\n\nPerhaps the most controversial executive action taken by Biden in the past year was his effort to mandate Covid-19 vaccinations or testing for large businesses, an effort ultimately thwarted by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn September, as part of a push to get more Americans vaccinated, Biden directed the Labor Department to require all businesses with 100 or more employees to ensure their workers are either vaccinated or tested once a week. He also signed an executive order requiring all government employees to be vaccinated, with no option of regular testing to opt out. And he required the 17 million health care workers at facilities receiving funds from Medicare and Medicaid to be fully vaccinated, expanding the mandate to hospitals, home care facilities and dialysis centers around the country.\n\nAs companies rushed to implement policies, the requirement was met with nearly immediate court challenges. And last week, in a devastating blow to the administration, the Supreme Court blocked the requirement for large businesses, but allowed the mandate for certain health care workers to go into effect nationwide. However, the action may have led to some increased vaccinations despite its failure. Citigroup, for instance, reported 99% compliance with its vaccine mandate.\n\n3. Gun control\n\nWhile talks on Capitol Hill have failed to produce any breakthroughs on gun reform legislation, Biden has sought to take some actions on gun control in his first year, which comes amid a record-breaking spike in homicides and gun violence.\n\nUS President Joe Biden speaks about gun violence prevention in the Rose Garden of the White House in Washington, DC, on April 8, 2021. - Biden unveiled measures aimed at curbing rampant US gun violence, especially seeking to prevent the spread of untraceable \"ghost guns.\" BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLast year, Biden took a limited set of steps directing his administration to tighten restrictions on so-called ghost guns and pistol stabilizing braces that allow the weapons to be used more accurately. He also expanded background checks for certain types of guns, made new investments in intervention programs for violence-prone communities, and created model “red flag” legislation for states to pass.\n\nBiden campaigned on sweeping actions to curb gun violence, but those actions fell short of more significant reforms requiring legislation. Biden and top administration officials have repeatedly called on Congress to pass a bill on background checks, one aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of abusers and the Build Back Better Act, which includes programs for community violence intervention, but those bills remain stalled.\n\n4. Climate targets\n\nBiden leveraged his executive power in December to direct the federal government to get to net-zero emissions by 2050, a step toward meeting his stated climate goals as his sweeping Build Back Better agenda, which has significant climate provisions, remains stalled in Congress.\n\nThe executive order directed the US government to buy clean energy, purchase electric vehicles, and make federal buildings more energy efficient. The federal government maintains 300,000 buildings, drives 600,000 cars and trucks in its vehicle fleet and spends hundreds of billions of dollars each year. That action came after Biden pledged that the US will reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 50% to 52% below its 2005 levels by 2030.\n\n5. Improving government processes\n\nBiden also took steps last year to streamline government services, aiming to improve the customer experience on a variety of services run by the federal government that can be frustrating and time-consuming; for instance, waiting in line at the airport, renewing your passport, filing taxes, the process of retiring, paying back student loans, applying for a small business loan, changing your name and using telehealth services.\n\nThat order, signed in December, directed 17 federal agencies to focus on more than 30 key areas where Americans can expect more efficient services and less hassle. The reform efforts are organized around major life experiences, from having a child to surviving a natural disaster. Notably, Americans will be able renew passports online. And it will allow tax filers to schedule a customer support call-back when they are trying to reach the IRS for help. Those actions, officials said, would be completed within the year.\n\nBiden’s top five 2022 priorities\n\n1. Covid-19\n\nHow Biden handles the coronavirus pandemic is the defining issue of his presidency. Nearly two years into the pandemic, the US is grappling with a surge of the Omicron variant, with cases and hospitalizations again on the rise in many states across the country.\n\nThe administration will soon be making one billion at-home rapid tests available to Americans for free after it received criticism for test shortages amid the Omicron surge. The President has also said his administration will distribute 400 million high-quality masks to Americans for free to help stop the spread of the virus. The administration also continues to allocate $1.9 trillion in funds from the Democrats’ Covid-19 emergency relief law the President signed into law last year.\n\nDespite the administration rolling out a national vaccination program last year and vaccines being free and readily available to Americans, the President faces a steep challenge in getting the rest of the country vaccinated. Tens of millions of Americans are bucking the advice of health and medical experts and refuse to get the shot, as disinformation about the safety and efficacy of the vaccines runs rampant throughout the nation.\n\n2. Build Back Better\n\nThe centerpiece of Biden’s domestic agenda – a nearly $2 trillion climate and economic spending package – remains stalled in the Senate amid opposition from Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. The massive piece of legislation includes key party priorities that Democrats want to deliver before the midterm elections in November and while they still have control of the House, Senate and White House.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said the chamber will vote on a revised version of the package that the Democrat-led House has already passed and said, “We will keep voting on it until we get something done.” What the package ultimately looks like remains uncertain. But in the current bill, most of the funding is focused on reducing the cost of child and health care and combating the climate crisis. It would create universal pre-kindergarten, send families an enhanced child tax credit and provide beefed-up subsidies on the Affordable Care Act exchanges.\n\nThe White House will also be focusing this year on implementing the bipartisan infrastructure law – the first part of Biden’s two-part infrastructure plan – and touting the benefits of the law to the American people ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n3. Voting rights\n\nThe President and congressional Democrats are under pressure to pass legislation to safeguard voting access amid a push by Republicans across the nation to make it harder for people to vote. The Democratic-led House has approved a measure that combined key provisions of two major voting bills – the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act – but its fate remains uncertain in the Senate.\n\nThe problem is Democrats don’t have the votes to pass the voting legislation under the current Senate rules because of Republican opposition and they also do not appear to have the votes to change those rules. Manchin and Sinema have been steadfast in their opposition to changing the filibuster rules, which require 60 votes to end debate on legislation.\n\nThe President recently ramped up efforts on the issue and delivered a forceful speech in Atlanta vowing to protect voting rights and calling on the Senate to amend the filibuster rules.\n\n4. Inflation\n\nPrices rose at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years last month as the US economy continues to struggle to rebound from the coronavirus pandemic. Global supply chain issues, worker shortages and high consumer prices are all contributing to the economic anxiety currently gripping the United States and causing Biden’s approval ratings to dip.\n\nThe White House has taken several steps to attempt to mitigate supply chain issues and lower prices for Americans, including extending hours and speeding up operations at key ports and assembling a task force dedicated to the issue. In an attempt to lower high gas prices, Biden directed the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve – the largest release from the reserve in US history – in coordination with other major countries. The Omicron variant is now threatening to put renewed pressure on global supply chains and exacerbate existing issues that the administration will be working to manage this year.\n\n5. Foreign policy challenges\n\nBiden came into office vowing to restore the US’ credibility on the world stage and is currently facing several foreign policy challenges that will test that promise.\n\nRussia has amassed tens of thousands of troops on the Ukrainian border and the world is watching to see whether Russian President Vladimir Putin invades the nation. US officials have grown increasingly pessimistic about the possibility of salvaging the Iran nuclear deal and have warned of turning to other options if diplomacy fails. And China remains accused of forced labor and human rights abuses in the country’s western region of Xinjiang.\n\nParticularly in the wake of the a messy withdrawal from Afghanistan, Biden faces the challenge of defining the US’ role in the world under his administration as well as responding to crises that may occur.", "authors": ["Maegan Vazquez Kate Sullivan Betsy Klein", "Maegan Vazquez", "Kate Sullivan", "Betsy Klein"], "publish_date": "2022/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/05/19/ron-desantis-stances-presidential-campaign-disney-lgbtq-woke-book-bans/70009493007/", "title": "Ron DeSantis influence: A list of what would power a presidential run", "text": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is on the verge of a presidential announcement that will bring his \"Free Florida\" philosophy into national focus.\n\nAll the signs are in place and he is widely expected to file next week for the Republican nomination and announce shortly thereafter.\n\nThe Florida-born governor, a Navy veteran elected three times to the U.S. House of Representatives, won a landslide reelection to governor in 2022 and has carried forward his agenda that steers Florida far to the right.\n\nDeSantis wields power more aggressively than any governor in modern memory, most notably by removing an elected prosecutor and putting a board he appointed in charge of Walt Disney World’s property. He targeted key pillars of democracy, restricting protests and voting access while seeking new limits on media companies.\n\nMany of the governor’s policies have impacted marginalized groups, including banning a course on African-American history, flying migrants to Martha’s Vineyard, curtailing transgender health care and reshaping Florida’s education system – from kindergarten to college – to limit how race and LGBTQ issues are discussed.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIt's all become part of his blueprint for what he calls the \"Free State of Florida\" – and offers a glimpse at the policies he would push through Congress if elected president.\n\nTrump vs DeSantis:Two political figures. Two political speeches. Two diverging brands.\n\nHere, in one place, is a list of how his \"freedom agenda\" has played out in Florida, often leading to controversy, protest and legal challenges.\n\nWAGING WAR ON WOKE\n\nSigned by DeSantis last year, this law governs how schools and businesses can discuss racial issues. It outlaws the teaching of critical race theory, which argues that the U.S. still struggles with systemic racism.\n\nThe bill also prohibits any lessons that could make students feel responsible for historic racial injustices. Business practices and training with similar themes also are prohibited. An ongoing court battle has blocked the state from enforcing some provisions of the law impacting colleges and universities.\n\nUsed since the early to mid-20th century by Black Americans to signal an awareness of social and racial injustice, \"woke\" has been co-opted by the GOP as a sort of umbrella term for progressive ideology.\n\nThe DeSantis administration announced in January that a new Advanced Placement course in African American studies would not be offered in Florida. DeSantis said that aspects of the course pushed a \"political agenda,\" pointing to lessons on Black queer studies and other topics. Florida's rejection of the course outraged many Black leaders, who saw it as another example of DeSantis pushing a racially charged agenda.\n\nThe College Board, which oversees AP exams, revised the course to remove any mention of queer studies and other politically sensitive topics, but denied that pressure from conservatives played a role in the revision. A DeSantis spokesman said the state is reviewing the revised course for \"compliance with Florida law.\"\n\n'Hostile to Black Americans':Breaking down 5 laws NAACP named in Florida travel advisory\n\nRESTRICTING LESSONS ON SEXUALITY IN SCHOOL\n\nThis law, dubbed by critics the \"Don't Say Gay bill,\" began by prohibiting schools from teaching about sexual orientation or gender identity in younger grades, and limiting instruction in older grades to material that is \"age appropriate.\" This year the ban was extended through the 12th grade.\n\nThe bills drew fierce opposition from LGBTQ advocates and their allies. Disney's opposition to the law led to an ongoing feud between DeSantis and the iconic Florida company. The law is being challenged in court.\n\nAccused of running afoul of the policy, a fifth-grade teacher in Hernando County is being investigated after showing her students Disney's 2022 movie \"Strange World.\" It's the first Disney movie with an out, gay character.\n\nBanned in the classroom:Florida bans teaching of gender identity, sexuality through 12th grade\n\nWhat this means:Florida's 'Parental Rights in Education' bill, dubbed 'Don't Say Gay' by critics, explained\n\nBANNING TRANSITION CARE FOR TRANSGENDER FLORIDIANS\n\nThe mainstream medical establishment supports gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth as treatment for gender dysphoria, the distress one sometimes feels when their gender identity doesn't align with their sex assigned at birth.\n\nBut the DeSantis administration departed from that guidance last year, when his pick to lead the Florida Department of Health directed a little-known administrative board to look into the medical care. Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo said the care was experimental and dangerous, drawing criticism from hundreds of health experts, including his predecessor, who say Ladapo and other state leaders are misrepresenting the evidence.\n\nThe Florida Board of Medicine, whose members are also DeSantis appointees, ultimately voted last year to ban transition-related medical care for youth patients who hadn't already started treatment. Lawmakers followed suit this year, advancing bills that take the restrictions even further.\n\nThe outcome has devastated trans children and their families, many of whom have moved or are considering moves out of state. Health experts, along with trans people themselves, say the care can be life-saving for a population that faces higher rates of suicide and suicidal ideation.\n\n'We're just people':As care ban becomes law, trans Floridians face excruciating decisions\n\nFacts on the new Florida laws:Four new Florida laws target transgender, broader LGBTQ community. Here's what they do\n\nState steadily erasing trans options:What can I do if I'm a transgender person living in Florida?\n\nCRACKING DOWN ON DRAG, BATHROOMS AND PRONOUNS\n\nDrag is a centuries-old performance art form that explores gender fluidity and challenges gender norms. Like any performance art, some drag shows have risqué elements, but it's not the standard.\n\nStill, DeSantis has taken issue with drag events that admit children, saying such a practice is part of a trend to \"sexualize\" children. He's threatened to revoke the liquor licenses of venues that host the events, even if they're advertised as family-friendly. He sent undercover state agents to one such event, a Christmas drag show in Orlando. The agents witnessed no lewd activity.\n\nRepublican lawmakers followed suit with their own crackdown, passing a law that restricts children from attending certain adult live performances. The bill isn't as explicit as a recent ban on drag shows passed by lawmakers in Tennessee, but advocates are concerned the vague language will be used to crack down on drag shows and Pride events, some of which have already been canceled.\n\nJumping on the governor's culture war agenda, the Legislature proposed a host of other bills targeting LGBTQ rights, including legislation that bans transgender Floridians from using the restroom that corresponds with their gender identity and prohibiting preferred pronouns in the classroom if they don't correspond to a person's gender at birth.\n\nGUTTING 'TRENDY' DEI PROGRAMS\n\nFresh off his double-digit victory in the midterm election, DeSantis announced that he would be reviewing diversity, equity and inclusion programs at Florida's 12 universities and 28 state colleges.\n\nWhile DeSantis has characterized such programs as \"trendy\" and \"woke,\" DEI initiatives have existed on college campuses and in workplaces for years. In fact, in the wake of the 2020 police murder of George Floyd, the Board of Governors instructed the state universities it oversees to bolster anti-racism and social justice efforts, including DEI programs.\n\nLawmakers carried the torch for DeSantis, ultimately sending to his desk a bill that bans state funding for DEI initiatives and calls for university leaders to review any curriculum “based on theories that systemic racism, sexism and privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States and were created to maintain social, political and economic inequities.”\n\nBoth the legislation and DeSantis' rhetoric have angered college students and professors who say the efforts will hurt student enrollment and faculty recruiting efforts. Especially impacted are students and professors of color who say the attacks deny the struggles for civil rights of past generations and their own experiences with racism on college campuses and elsewhere.\n\nWhiplash:Florida universities were told to prioritize diversity plans. Now, DeSantis aims to gut them\n\nTARGETING FIRST AMENDMENT PROTECTIONS FOR JOURNALISTS\n\nIn February, DeSantis alarmed First Amendment advocates when he expressed support for changing defamation law to make it easier to sue journalists.\n\nSoon after, a House Republican filed legislation that would have made it easier to sue for defamation, assumed anonymous sources are false in a defamation case and could have increased legal costs for those sued.\n\nIt could have also ended up as a challenge to the nearly 60-year-old legal precedent set by the 1964 New York Times Co. v. Sullivan United States Supreme Court decision, which states public officials can not get legal damages from journalists who report false information unless it was done with “actual malice.\"\n\nFree speech advocates were joined by media companies and officials from both the left and right in opposing the legislation, saying it would lead to the shuttering of news outlets and the suppression of speech.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Cory Mills, who represents the southern half of Florida's Volusia County in Congress, said in a letter to state lawmakers that the legislation was \"unpatriotic\" and \"not representative of the free state of Florida.\"\n\nThe legislation died. But lawmakers say they'll bring it back next year.\n\nFailure to launch:DeSantis-desired defamation legislation didn't go the distance. Here's why\n\nREFORMING (OR SURPRESSING) VOTING LAWS\n\nUnder DeSantis, Florida has made a multitude of sweeping, controversial election law changes since the 2020 election, when former President Donald Trump and his supporters spread false claims of widespread voter fraud.\n\nSupporters of the changes say they're necessary to protect the efficiency and integrity of the state's election process. But voting rights advocates blast them as voter suppression.\n\nDeSantis, who has danced around the stolen election question for years, has signed into law restrictions on mail-in ballots, ballot boxes and third-party voter registration organizations.\n\nLast year, he and lawmakers created a security office to investigate claims of voter fraud. But there's no evidence that organized voter fraud is a problem in Florida, and opponents have said they fear the new security force could become a weapon used against voter groups opposing DeSantis.\n\nWhile DeSantis hasn't signed it yet, lawmakers this year passed a bill reducing the amount of time third-party voter registration organizations have to submit voter registration applications, while dramatically increasing the fines for late submissions and other violations.\n\nThat bill also \"clarifies\" that DeSantis can run for president without resigning, and, controversial to voting rights groups, reduces by two days the time frame voters have to request a vote-by-mail ballot and send one in.\n\nAdvocates also accuse it of not doing enough to help formerly-incarcerated Floridians determine their voter eligibility. Confusion over this has led to arrests courtesy of DeSantis' new security office — that advocates and others say have made many people, especially in communities of color, fearful to vote, even if they're eligible.\n\nYANKING BOOKS OFF THE SHELVES OF LIBRARIES\n\nObjectionable books getting pulled from library shelves has become a more common occurrence in recent years, and a recent lawsuit by the nation's largest publisher, authors and a free speech organization says Florida has become the epicenter for the trend.\n\nLast year, DeSantis signed the Curriculum Transparency Act last year, which requires districts to catalog every book on their shelves and put a formal review process in place for complaints.\n\nWhile neither Florida Department of Education nor the governor's office have called for any bans on books, parent complaints have some districts preemptively pulling books off of shelves to err on the side of caution – especially since a teacher could be charged with a third-degree felony or face discipline if materials are found harmful to minors.\n\nA new law signed on May 17 requires districts to pull texts within five days of the complaint and keep them off shelves during the review process.\n\nThe book banning has generated nationwide attention and controversy, even as DeSantis and his administration insist it's a \"hoax.\"\n\n\"If educators are confused about what can and cannot be taught in Florida schools, the blame lies solely on media activists and union clowns who purposefully sow confusion and mislead the public,\" a Department of Education spokesperson said.\n\nOrder in the court:Nation's largest publisher files federal suit to block Florida county's book ban\n\nREDRAWING DISTRICT MAPS TO HELP THE GOP\n\nBreaking with the usual hands-off approach of Florida governors, DeSantis last year stepped in and took control of congressional redistricting. The result: Republicans gained four congressional seats in Florida – helping the party win narrow control of the U.S. House.\n\nBut it was messy.\n\nThe Republican-controlled Legislature, usually subservient to DeSantis, bucked at first over the governor’s approach, which relied on a novel interpretation of federal and state laws protecting minority voting rights which guide once-a-decade redistricting.\n\n'What happens to us?'With North Florida congressional district gone, Black voters wonder\n\nInside the records:How Gov. DeSantis blew up Black-held congressional districts in Florida's redistricting fight\n\nDeSantis vetoed a congressional map approved by lawmakers that didn’t go as far as he wanted. And called back to the Capitol for a special session, Republican leaders caved and went along with the governor’s demand for what he’d termed a “race-neutral” district in North Florida.\n\nU.S. Rep. Al Lawson, a Black Democrat from Tallahassee first elected to Congress in 2016, lost his seat. More than 370,000 Black voters who lived in Lawson’s old district were scattered across four, Republican-held districts from the Tallahassee-area to Jacksonville.\n\nA Leon County judge, J. Layne Smith, himself a DeSantis-appointee, declared the map unconstitutional for its negative impact on Black voting strength. But an appeals court allowed the new boundaries to stand for the 2022 elections in which Republicans regained House control and a place to challenge President Biden’s policies.\n\nBefore Election Day, Republicans held a 16-11 edge in Florida’s congressional delegation. The state has another seat now, because of population gains in the last census. After DeSantis’ map-drawing, Republicans now hold a 20-8 margin in the delegation.\n\nA sit-in on the House floor:Amid shouts of 'stop the Black attack', Florida lawmakers pass DeSantis congressional redistricting map\n\nIMPLEMENTING STATE RULE OVER HOME RULE\n\nIn a siege that began during his fight against strict COVID-19 policies in blue-leaning cities and counties, DeSantis has steadily eroded authority from local governments.\n\nHe’s enacted laws that limit their overall emergency powers, apparently not satisfied with merely swiping away any masking or vaccine requirements local officials put in place. Since the COVID-19 drama quieted down, the governor has emerged with more measures limiting the regulatory role of Florida communities.\n\nThe Legislature has gone along with his demand to prohibit state and local governments from using environmental, social and governance (ESG) guidelines when investing taxpayer funds, extending a policy already in place at the state level but which he wanted enshrined in state law.\n\nDeSantis also has generally supported so-called preemption measures by the Legislature, which take away local government authority or empower businesses challenging land-use or zoning decisions.\n\nThe governor did veto one such proposal last year, fearing it would spawn too many lawsuits. But he has revived his push for more control over local decision-making by calling for a constitutional amendment making school board races partisan and for a controversial, “Digital Bill of Rights,” that would add new restrictions on city and county websites.\n\nState rule not home rule:In push to the right, Florida cities and counties become focus for DeSantis and lawmakers\n\nEVICTING UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS\n\nAfter luring about 50 mostly Venezuelan asylum-seekers from Texas last fall and flying them to Martha’s Vineyard off the coast of Massachusetts, DeSantis had a headline-grabbing moment that struck at President Biden’s immigration policies.\n\nBut the Florida governor was on shaky legal ground. And lawsuits filed by a Democratic legislator and immigrant-advocacy groups forced him to seek help from the Republican-controlled Legislature.\n\nLawmakers complied. And in a February special session they hastily approved legal fixes that resulted in the lawsuits being dismissed.\n\nWith the rewrite, DeSantis managed to avoid any legal damage and continue his political chest-thumping over immigration into the regular session, where he championed tough penalties and restrictions aimed at undocumented immigrants in Florida.\n\nThe new law strengthens employment requirements and allows state law enforcement officials to conduct random audits of businesses suspected of hiring undocumented workers. Criminal penalties are increased for human smuggling, with third-degree felony charges imposed on anyone caught “knowingly” and “willingly” transporting anyone illegally in the country across state lines into Florida.\n\nCritics say the law will hurt Florida business, drive away workers and intimidate undocumented immigrants.\n\nWhile blasting President Biden's border policies, DeSantis is also sending more than 1,100 Florida National Guard soldiers and state law enforcement officers to deploy to the border, amid concerns about a surge of people seeking to cross into the United States as the Title 42 public health emergency expires.\n\n'What are we going to do?'Two migrants share fears for the future in Florida crackdown\n\nSUBJUGATING SOCIAL MEDIA (OR TRYING TO)\n\nDeSantis is hoping to get Florida’s 2021 law imposing state regulations on social media companies argued before the U.S. Supreme Court after losing twice in lower federal courts.\n\nDeSantis enacted the measure back when conservative media was ablaze over former President Donald Trump being deplatformed following the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. DeSantis and Trump are now on a collision course for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nThe Florida legislation imposes fines on social media platforms that refuse to air the views of politicians who violate their standards. A Texas law touches on similar territory, and justices are being asked to review the state laws.\n\nThe court hasn’t yet agreed to hear the case. But lower courts concluded Florida’s law violates the First Amendment rights of the social media companies.\n\nThis session, DeSantis pushed legislation and signed into law a bill that banned TikTok in schools and on government devices amid fears the social media platform is being used by the Chinese government to collect data and spy on the United States.\n\nBATTLING THE MAGIC KINGDOM AND DISNEY\n\nCash into courts:DeSantis gets millions in taxpayer money to fight lawsuits over hard-right policies\n\nBrawling with Florida's most iconic company is among the most shocking actions DeSantis has taken during his time as governor, and the most attention-grabbing. It started when Disney came out against the Parental Rights in Education Act, dubbed by critics the \"Don't Say Gay\" bill.\n\nAccusing Disney of supporting \"indoctrinating very young schoolchildren in woke gender identity politics,\" he planned with lawmakers to undo \"Disney’s special arrangement.\"\n\nUrged on by DeSantis, the Legislature met in special session to strip Disney's properties in Central Florida of self-governing status. Before the legislation took effect, though, Disney was able to get the upper hand and pushed through an agreement that gave it control over development rights on its properties, stripping a new governing board appointed by DeSantis of power.\n\nThe governor has responded angrily, initiating an inspector general investigation of Disney's actions and promising more legislation to rein in and punish the company. After keeping quiet for months, the entertainment giant filed a lawsuit in April saying DeSantis was engaging in a \"targeted campaign of government retaliation\" against the company. DeSantis' board responded with a lawsuit of its own and the governor signed into law a measure that subjects the Walt Disney World monorail system to state inspection.\n\nThen on May 18, Disney canceled long delayed plans to invest $1 billion and base 2,000 jobs at new offices in the Central Florida community of Lake Nona. The announcement followed Disney chief Bob Iger's suggestion earlier that the Disney conglomerate might rethink plans to invest upwards of $17 billion, creating 13,000 new jobs, in Florida over the next decade.\n\nMouse trapped:Graphics timeline illustrates the length, bitterness of Disney-DeSantis dispute\n\nUPENDING SCHOOL BOARDS\n\nLocal school board races have been low-key contests in Florida over the years, but COVID-19 supercharged school politics and DeSantis seized on the energy around school issues, making these races a focus in 2022. DeSantis took unprecedented steps to help conservative school board candidates, injecting a level of partisan politics never before seen in these races and bolstering the conservative Moms for Liberty movement.\n\nHe endorsed 30 candidates and most went on to win after the governor devoted significant time and money to their campaigns, paying for mailers and holding rallies with his preferred candidates. Later, some of the newly minted boards would go on to oust their appointed superintendents.\n\nChanging face:After contentious elections, conservative Florida school boards boot out superintendents\n\nOUSTING AN ELECTED OFFICIAL\n\nAlong with punishing Disney, removing Hillsborough County's top prosecutor from office ranks among the biggest power plays of DeSantis' governorship and his most boundary-pushing actions. It's not uncommon for the governor to remove a local official accused of malfeasance, but popularly elected State Attorney Andrew Warren didn't break any laws or get involved in a major scandal.\n\nInstead, the progressive prosecutor clashed with the governor on ideological grounds. The governor said he removed Warren for not properly enforcing the law. Warren called it an undemocratic effort to target a political opponent, and his filed legal action to be restored to office.\n\n'Not a hint of misconduct':DeSantis broke law, judge says, but tosses ousted prosecutor's suit\n\nSTAGING A HOSTILE TAKEOVER AT NEW COLLEGE\n\nNew College of Florida is the smallest school in the state's university system, but it has received the most attention recently after DeSantis appointed six new board members, including prominent conservative activists and intellectuals, in an effort to overhaul the state's liberal arts honors college. The governor says he wants progressive New College to be more like Hillsdale College, a conservative Christian school. That means turning New College upside down.\n\nSuch an effort to completely transform a public university in a partisan fashion may be unprecedented nationally, and has drawn intense criticism. The conservative new board members have plowed ahead, though, firing the former president and installing a DeSantis ally in her place while eliminating the school's office of diversity, equity and inclusion and denying five professors early tenure.\n\nThe Florida legislature pumped almost $50 million into the new school amid worries about decaying infrastructure and fundraising challenges.\n\n'Go to Berkeley':DeSantis has advice for Florida DEI students\n\nQUELLING PROTESTS\n\nThe wave of protests that swept the nation in 2020 after Black Minneapolis resident George Floyd died at the hands of police eventually led to backlash within the GOP.\n\nDeSantis led the effort, signing a law he pitched as an \"anti-riot\" measure that was denounced by critics as an effort to stifle protests. The law has been tied up in a court challenge.\n\nMeanwhile, the DeSantis administration pushed through new regulations recently for demonstrations at the Capitol Complex, which has seen large protests recently on everything from guns to abortion. The new rules require groups seeking to demonstrate at the Capitol to be sponsored by a state agency, and their message must align with the agency's mission.\n\nThey also give police more discretion in removing protesters and charging them with trespassing.\n\nTwice during the 2023 legislative session, a peaceful protest led to mass arrests, something without precedent in recent history, when demonstrators refused orders to leave. More than a dozen were arrested after a sit-in at the governor's office about a month after 11 abortion rights protesters – including Florida Democratic Party Chair Nikki Fried and Senate Democratic Leader Lauren Book – were arrested after refusing to leave a park area outside City Hall.\n\n'Florida is on fire':About a dozen protesters arrested while singing in DeSantis' office during sit-in\n\nUNMASKING MANDATES\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic turned DeSantis into a major national figure after he repeatedly drew attention for pushing back against public health recommendations.\n\nAfter a brief lockdown early in the pandemic, DeSantis worked to quickly reopen businesses. He also fought against school closures, mask mandates and vaccine mandates. DeSantis' COVID-19 response is central to his political identity and a cornerstone of his \"freedom\" agenda.\n\nMore than 87,000 people died of COVID-19 in Florida through early April, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAnniversary stump speech:Gov.

But by afternoon, lawmakers are tabling dozens of bills and narrowing the legislation they advanced. On Wednesday, Senators continued to table bills and took up just four at their afternoon floor session.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions began rising as activists pushing for gun reform were removed from a committee hearing. The ACLU filed a lawsuit in the morning and won a temporary injunction on the House rules.\n\nFollow for the latest updates.\n\nControversial guns in schools bill fails to advance in House\n\nA controversial bill to relax restrictions on who could bring guns on public school campuses died on a tie vote after a dramatic, four-hour committee meeting in the Tennessee House on Wednesday.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe bill was nearly voted on without debate due to a parliamentary move to shut down debate, an action that riled Democrats on the committee and members of the audience, which included parents from the Covenant School waiting to testify. The committee temporarily shut down to cool tempers.\n\nCovenant parents vehemently opposed HB 7064, sponsored by Rep. Chris Todd, R-Madison County, who argued more guns at schools will make children safer.\n\nSeveral Covenant parents temporarily left the committee room in disgust after Todd suggested that the guns used by the Covenant shooter weren't the issue in the tragedy, and the shooter probably would have \"driven over\" the kids at recess if a gun wasn't available.\n\nAbby Mclean, a Covenant mom, questioned how she should tell her kids that lawmakers want to allow more guns into school, when her children are still scared of firearms.\n\n“How do I explain to these children that that’s your solution? I want an answer,” McLean said.\n\n— Melissa Brown, The Tennessean\n\nCovenant victim's mom pleads for alarm standards\n\nThrough a statement read by a friend, the mother of Covenant victim William Kinney urged lawmakers to support a proposed bill that would establish standard rules for school protocol in the event of a fire alarm outside of a scheduled fire drill.\n\nErin Kinney said many at Covenant initially believed the active shooter situation was a fire due to a blaring fire alarm, masking the initial sounds of gunfire. William, as line leader of his class, followed protocol to lead his classmates out of the classroom ahead of the teacher, who is trained to stay behind and sweep the classroom in the event of a fire emergency.\n\n\"Fire alarms can be deadly, forcing kids toward a shooter and not away from one,\" Kinney, who was not at Wednesday's hearing, said in the statement. \"At Covenant, for example, the thick haze of smoke released by a rapidly fired rifle automatically triggered a fire alarm.\"\n\n\"He was fulfilling his duty to lead his class to safety from a possible fire. Within seconds of the building being breached, his class encountered the shooter and he and two of his classmates were lying dead.\"\n\nHB 7002 was sponsored by House Majority Leader William Lamberth, R-Portland. Lamberth said there are different ways schools can differentiate between alarms through alerts and technologies, and his bill is simply requiring each school board to have procedures in place that make sense for their schools.\n\nThe Education Administration Committee advanced the bill.\n\n— Melissa Brown, The Tennessean\n\nLawmakers debate controversial bill allowing minors to be tried as adults in certain offenses\n\nAs the Senate wrapped for the day, House committees remained in session to consider a number of bills related to crime and school safety.\n\nThe House Criminal Justice Committee passed a controversial bill that would that allow minors to be tried as adults for certain offenses, despite opposition from Democrats and some juvenile court judges. The bill, introduced by House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville.\n\nThe Senate has not advanced the bill.\n\nJuvenile justice advocates testified that the law would increase recidivism for young people pushing into the adult system and it doesn’t include exceptions for youth with disabilities.\n\nLawmakers who supported the bill said it would be a strong deterrent for young people committing crimes. House Majority Leader William Lamberth, R-Portland, said the bill is a “good balance” because it gives judges the discretion to keep youth in juvenile court longer.\n\nBut Rep. G.A. Hardaway, D-Memphis, said the bill doesn’t focus on rehabilitation.\n\n“There’s an art and science to juvenile justice reform. This bill fails on both,” he said. “We can lock folks up until the cows come home, but if we haven’t given them the proper a rehabilitation program, they will come out worse then they went in.”\n\nThe bill didn't sit well with those in the audience.\n\n“Shame on you!” demonstrators shouted as they left the room after the vote.\n\n— Kelly Puente, The Tennessean\n\n'You've done nothing': Demonstrators slam Senate as it concludes initial work\n\nAfter passing four bills, including one to fund the special session, the Senate adjourned until Thursday morning at 9 a.m. CT.\n\nAs the chamber adjourned, demonstrators in the gallery broke out in chants of “you’ve done nothing! You’ve done nothing!” and unfurled a banner that read “no gun reform, no peace!” They were escorted from the chamber.\n\nAn appropriations bill, including $16.3 million in bonus funding for mental health workers, $3 million for mental health scholarships, and $10 million for a stop-gap measure to allow for more security officers in schools, passed 26 to 0, with several members voting present.\n\nThe Senate also overwhelmingly passed bills to codify Lee's executive order requiring swift updates to the state's background check database, tax incentives for safe gun storage, and to require the TBI to make a new report on the state of human trafficking in Tennessee.\n\n— Vivian Jones, The Tennessean\n\nBill to exempt gun safes from sales tax passes; PSA campaign on safe gun storage expanding\n\nSenate members passed a bill backed by Gov. Bill Lee to provide gun locks, exempt gun safes and similar tools from sales tax, and expand a PSA campaign on safe gun storage.\n\nSenators adopted the bill in a vote of 28 to 1. Sen. Todd Gardenhire, R-Chattanooga, cast the lone opposing vote. Sens. Bowling and Lundberg abstained from the vote.\n\n\"It's a step in the right direction. It's not the last step that we will take, but it is an important step forward,\" said Republican Caucus Chairman Ken Yager, R-Kingston.\n\nAhead of the start of the Senate session, members of the Senate Republicans caucus sought to assuage the concerns of hesitant caucus members by arguing the bills proposed would do very little.\n\n“This just eliminates very low-hanging barriers,” Lowe explained to caucus colleagues ahead of the meeting.\n\nLowe explained that the free gun locks program is already in place at the Department of Safety, and the agency already has a surplus of locks left over from previous years that have not yet been distributed.\n\n“There is no mandate in this bill, there is no requirement or anything,” said Majority Leader Jack Johnson, R-Franklin, prior to the session. “This is to encourage you to safely store your weapon, and provide you with the means to do so should you choose to use them.”\n\n“I got the impression that this is something we’re already doing,” said Sen. Bo Watson, R-Hixson. “It doesn’t require anybody to do anything.”\n\n— Vivian Jones, The Tennessean\n\nSenate leadership to discuss plans for adjournment\n\nAfter reviewing the four bills that will be on the Senate floor this afternoon, Lt. Gov. Randy McNally, R-Oak Ridge, announced that the chamber’s leadership plans to meet with House leaders to figure out a path to adjourn the special session.\n\n“As you know, we’re in a sort of Mexican stand-off with the House,” McNally told caucus members, during a bill review meeting in his conference room.\n\n“I brought my shovel,” joked Sen. Janice Bowling, R-Manchester, who noted that this is the second wedding anniversary she has had interrupted by a special session.\n\n“We’ve learned that they would like to discuss some things with us,” McNally said.\n\n“Hopefully it will provide a path to adjourn. It takes both houses to agree on adjournment resolutions, otherwise you just keep going and going and going.”\n\nMcNally said members should make plans to be at the Capitol in the morning, and could not say whether adjournment would happen before Friday.\n\n“If they’re reasonable, I think it behooves us to come to an agreement,” said Sen. Becky Duncan Massey, R-Knoxville.\n\n“Just tell them they’re lucky to get the three bills we gave them,” said Sen. Rusty Crowe, R-Johnson City.\n\n“I didn’t really want to be here in the first place,” added Sen. Mark Pody, R-Lebanon, “I don’t want to go much more on giving to the house.”\n\n— Vivian Jones, The Tennessean\n\nSenate finance committee adjourns after passing 2 bills\n\nThe final Senate committee closed less than 48 hours after the session gaveled in, having passed only two funding bills.\n\nSenators unanimously passed a bill backed by Gov. Bill Lee to permanently suspend sales tax on gun safes and storage items, and expand a two-year-old program to provide free gun locks and public service announcement campaigns to encourage safe storage of guns.\n\nNo part of the bill requires the Department of Safety to measure or report success of the gun locks or PSA efforts to the legislature.\n\n“If this program has been in place for two years, and we still have gun locks left over, what are we going to do to make sure that the gun locks are actually distributed across the state?” asked Sen. London Lamar, D-Memphis. “What are we going to do different to make sure this program is going to work differently?”\n\nIncluded in the appropriations bill funding the session is a stop-gap measure to allow school districts to place school safety officers and use other safety measures in schools, building on a funding allocation this spring designated specifically for POST-certified sworn School Resource Officers.\n\n“The intent is to allow the School Resource Officer program to build capacity,” Senate Finance Chairman Bo Watson, R-Hixson said.\n\n— Vivian Jones, The Tennessean\n\n'A terrible thing': Protesters get heated as bill allowing more guns in schools passes committee vote\n\nSobs echoed through a Tennessee House committee room Wednesday morning as Becky Hansen described how her 5-year-old son's Covenant School teacher told her class they had to race to see who was fastest when she realized someone had opened fire inside the school on March 27.\n\nThe teacher wanted to get her pre-K class into their safe space as fast as possible without scaring the children.\n\nHansen and fellow Covenant mom Melissa Alexander testified in opposition of HB 7064, which would allow any active or retired law enforcement, military and enhanced handgun permit holders to carry handguns on public school grounds. The gun-carriers would not have to identify themselves to school authorities, who would have no authority to block carriers.\n\nHansen and Alexander said they do not want more guns on school campuses, describing how Covenant teachers' hands shook so severely during the March shooting that they struggled to lock the doors.\n\nRep. Chris Todd, R-Madison County, is sponsoring the bill and argued more guns in schools and their grounds would make children safer, alleging shooters seek out \"gun-free\" zones.\"\n\nA retired teacher and Vanderbilt University student planning to be a teacher also testified against the bill.\n\n\"We had armed representatives in the Covenant School. That was not a deterrent for the shooter,\" Hansen said. \"Expecting a handgun to go up against a semi-assault rifle that can expend multiple rounds is going to add another death. It's unreasonable to expect a small gun to go against that powerful of a weapon.\"\n\nDespite the emotional testimony, Republicans on the committee voted to advance the bill, though the measure will likely stall without similar movement in the Senate.\n\nThe vote sparked widespread condemnation from the audience. As protesters stood to leave, several yelled \"y'all are disgusting\" and \"you're sick\" to lawmakers seated at the dias.\n\nJim Polk, a 74-year-old former Davidson County educator, stood after the vote, pointing his finger toward lawmakers as he clutched his hat in his right hand. Polk called it \"ridiculous and absurd\" to pass legislation that would override school administration's authority to control activity on their campuses.\n\n\"This should never happen in America. You are wrong, fellas,\" Polk said, jabbing his finger toward lawmakers. \"You are wrong to have made this decision.\"\n\nSecurity asked Polk to leave, which he agreed to do.\n\n\"I'll leave, but I'll be back,\" Polk said. \"You are wrong, you have done a terrible thing today, a terrible thing.\"\n\n— Melissa Brown, The Tennessean\n\nCommittee: State's revenue slowing, $330 million needed to make expected gap\n\nThe final Senate Finance, Ways and Means Committee kicked off with an update on the state’s financial outlook from Finance and Administration Commissioner Jim Bryson.\n\nBryson asserted that the state’s revenue growth is slowing, and noted the ongoing three-month sales tax holiday, which is impacting state revenues. Finance officials said that the state would need $330 million more in revenue next year to make up for a projected gap.\n\nNo mention was made of the $3.2 billion rainy day fund, or a $153.5 million revenue surplus reported last month, but the presentation seemed to impact members on the committee.\n\n“We are probably moving into a period of more disciplined spending control and more sensitivity to spending than we have been in the last 10 years,” said Finance Committee Chair Bo Watson, R-Hixson.\n\nTwo of the four bills on the committee's calendar were scuttled, while the two remaining bills – an appropriations bill to cover the costs of the special session, and a proposal backed by the governor to do a public service announcement on safe storage, provide firearm locks and exempt gun safes from sales tax – sparked the longest discussion of any bill taken up in the Senate so far this week.\n\nElizabeth Stroeker, legislative director for the Tennessee Department of Safety, told members that the agency has already done similar PSAs on safe storage in the past, and already has a program to distribute free gun locks. They’ve already distributed 44,000 locks.\n\n“What we’re going to do is kind-of robust that program,” Stroeker said, adding that it would be advertised on the agency’s website.\n\nCommittee recessed briefly to reconcile a fiscal discrepancy.\n\n— Vivian Jones, The Tennessean\n\nGun-control group calls lawmakers 'petulant'\n\nWith frustration brewing, members of the Tennessee chapter of Moms Demand Action held a news conference Wednesday calling Republican lawmakers “petulant” children for their inability pass any meaningful gun legislation.\n\nSenate members have so far passed just three bills, while scuttling dozens more in meetings that have lasted less than two minutes. Many of those bills, though, did not deal directly with firearms.\n\nMoms Demand Action member Jason Sparks, whose brother was killed in a road rage incident, said the lawmakers are still bitter over becoming a national embarrassment last spring when they expelled two House members.\n\n“This is like a petulant child,” he said. “They carry animosity and it just shows how little importance they have for their job. It’s a waist for taxpayers and it’s a slap in the face to these poor victims.”\n\nThe Senate is set to meet for a final floor session at 2 p.m.\n\n— Kelly Puente, The Tennessean\n\nBill limiting autopsy records tabled by Senate committee\n\nA bill that would have blocked public release of the autopsies and medical examiner reports for child victims of violent crimes is effectively over in the Senate.\n\nIn the third seconds-long Senate committee meeting of the day, the State and Local Committee tabled Senate Bill 7090, which would have made those changes, when the bill sponsor, Majority Leader Jack Johnson, did not appear to present the bill.\n\nThe committee scuttled two other bills on its consent calendar during the whirlwind meeting.\n\nAhead of the Senate Finance, Ways and Means Committee only three bills remain alive in the upper chamber.\n\n— Vivian Jones, The Tennessean\n\nJudge issues temporary restraining order against new sign rule\n\nA Davidson County judge issued a temporary restraining order Wednesday against the Tennessee House of Representatives, blocking the chamber's new rule barring signs in the galleries.\n\nThe order, signed by Chancellor Anne Martin, comes as part of a lawsuit filed earlier in the morning by the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee.\n\n\"Defendants are not harmed by issuance of this motion as they have no legitimate government interest in violating First Amendment rights or enforcing patently unreasonable rules—and Plaintiffs’ conduct of silently holding small signs cannot be said to have disrupted the proceedings of the House of Representatives,\" the attorneys wrote in the motion for a temporary restraining order. \"The public interest is extremely great: nothing less than the constitutional rights of Tennesseans to participate in their government is at stake.\"\n\nThe lawsuit stems the removal of three activists from a House committee hearing for holding paper signs supporting gun reform. The residents were removed by state troopers on Tuesday after being told to lower paper signs and not clap during the House Civil Justice Subcommittee hearing.\n\nA temporary injunction hearing for the matter is now scheduled for Sept. 5 at 10 a.m.\n\n— Angele Latham, The Tennessean\n\nSenate Health and Welfare Committee tables all bills\n\nThe Senate Health and Welfare Committee tabled all 20 bills on its calendar, and adjourned in a matter of seconds after the roll was taken.\n\nTabled bills included proposals to expand physicians’ “duty to warn” of specific threats of harm shared by patients, and increased coverage for mental health and psychiatric services.\n\nSen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville – who is the only democrat on the committee – objected to the tabling motion, but the Republicans on the committee all supported tabling the bills.\n\n— Vivan Jones, The Tennessean\n\n'It was not funny': Ostrich egg stunt riles up legislators\n\nSenatorial obstinance over taking up bills has roiled House GOP leadership.\n\nHouse Republican Caucus Chair Jeremy Faison, R-Cosby, presented Senate Republicans with an ostrich egg late Tuesday, posting a photo of the token on the speaker’s dais in the Senate chamber.\n\n“It must be egghausting sending so many bills to Gen Sub instead of doing the work people sent us here to do,” the House Republican Caucus wrote in a social media post late Tuesday.\n\nSenators didn’t find the stunt funny.\n\n“This would be a lot more compelling if these guys didn’t think ‘the work people sent us here to do’ was arming teachers, locking up juveniles, and bullying moms w/the temerity to hold up paper signs,” said Sen. Jeff Yarbro, D-Nashville. “But sure enough, we should be doing more real work around here.”\n\nWednesday morning, Faison wrote an email apologizing to members of the Senate GOP, obtained by The Tennessean.\n\n“Members, I have offended you with my actions yesterday and I want to offer you my sincerest apologies,” he wrote. “My only intention was to provide some levity while we are dealing with some very serious matters. It was not funny at all.”\n\n“You should be apologizing to the moms that were unjustly removed!” responded Sen. Paul Bailey, R-Sparta.\n\n—- Vivian Jones, The Tennessean\n\nACLU files lawsuit on behalf of people booted from subcommittee meeting\n\nThe ACLU of Tennessee filed a lawsuit Wednesday against House Speaker Cameron Sexton, R-Crossville, alleging House leaders violated the constitutional rights of three people removed from a subcommittee meeting.\n\nTennessee Highway Patrol removed the three on Tuesday for holding paper signs during the meeting, which House Republicans had banned from the session in new rules passed on Monday night.\n\n\"These rules are unreasonable,\" said ACLU-TN Legal Director Stella Yarbrough. \"The Tennessee House’s ban on silently holding signs in House galleries directly undermines Tennesseans’ First Amendment right to express their opinions on issues that affect them and their families.\"\n\n— Melissa Brown, The Tennessean\n\nSenate Education Committee steamrolls remaining bills\n\nMembers of the Senate Education Committee tabled all 21 bills on the calendar Wednesday morning, effectively killing them for the session.\n\nGavel to gavel, the committee meeting lasted 54 seconds, about half of which was roll call.\n\nAmong the scuttled bills were proposals to allow school faculty to carry handguns on school campuses, permit police and corrections officers to carry on campus, and a bill to create a student loan forgiveness program for psychiatrists, psychologists and counselors.\n\nWith only three bills considered and passed on Tuesday, the Senate looks to be plowing ahead for an early adjournment. The body is set to return for a floor session at 2 p.m., and Senate Majority Leader Jack Johnson, R-Franklin, has filed resolutions to adjourn as early as today.\n\nWithout passage of a companion bill in the Senate, any legislation passed in the House is also essentially barred from moving forward. So while House committees are expected to meet throughout the day, any bill without a Senate companion will likely, ultimately, be unsuccessful.\n\n— Vivian Jones, The Tennesean\n\nBill limiting public access to autopsy records passes committee\n\nAs the State Government Committee passed HB 7007, lawmakers advanced a bill to make autopsy records and medical examiners' reports of minors excluded from public records law. Under the law, records of underage victims of violence like mass shootings could be requested by the public or media.\n\nThe parents of Covenant victims Hallie Scruggs and William Kinney urged lawmakers to pass the bill via written statements read by Mary Joyce, the mother of a 9-year-old who was in the classroom shot at by the active shooter in March.\n\n\"If Hallie had only been wounded, there would be no public access to the medical trauma her body sustained,\" the Scruggs said in the statement. \"Why should that be any different when her injuries resulted in death?\"\n\nErin Kinney, William's mother, said in her statement the availability of records retraumatizes and revictimizes \"those of us who had to go to the hospital and identify the broken bodies of our children, shot through with multiple holes they could not survive.\"\n\n— Melissa Brown, The Tennessean\n\nCatch up on Tuesday's news", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/25/politics/where-abortion-banned-states-court-legal-challenges/index.html", "title": "Abortion is banned or severely limited in a number of states. Here's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nLaws that ban abortion or severely restrict the procedure have gone into effect in about a dozen states after the US Supreme Court ended a constitutional right to abortion on June 24.\n\nOn July 26, the Supreme Court transmitted its judgment in the case, taking the procedural step that started the process for some states to implement their so-called trigger bans on abortion.\n\nIn several of these states, abortion rights advocates and providers have taken legal action to challenge abortion restrictions and have seen some success in temporarily blocking bans.\n\nHere are the states that have enacted restrictions on abortion or face legal challenges over their bans:\n\nStates where abortion bans or limits are in effect\n\nAlabama: abortion banned\n\nA federal judge on June 24 lifted an injunction against a 2019 state law that bans abortions, allowing the law to go into effect.\n\nThe law allows exceptions to prevent a “serious health risk” to the mother, for ectopic pregnancy and if the “unborn child has a lethal anomaly.”\n\nArizona: abortion banned\n\nAn Arizona Superior Court judge ruled on September 23 that a 1901 ban on nearly all abortions in the state could be enforced. The judge granted a request by Arizona’s Republican Attorney General Mark Brnovich to lift a court injunction that had barred enforcement of the pre-statehood ban on abortion after the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v. Wade in 1973.\n\nIn addition to barring abortion in all cases except when “it is necessary to save (the mother’s) life,” the pre-statehood law carries a prison sentence of two to five years for abortion providers.\n\nArizona has a separate law banning abortion after 15 weeks that takes effect on September 24.\n\nArkansas: abortion banned\n\nArkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge certified the state’s trigger ban, allowing it take effect on June 24. The law bans abortions except in the case of a life-threatening emergency.\n\nFlorida: 15-week ban in effect but being challenged in court\n\nIn Florida, a law banning abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy took effect on July 1. The law has exemptions involving “serious risk” to the pregnant person and for a fatal fetal abnormality if two physicians confirm the diagnosis in writing.\n\nA state judge on June 30 said he would issue a temporary statewide injunction and signed a written order on July 5. But the state also filed an appeal, a move that automatically stayed the judge’s order that temporarily blocked the ban.\n\nWith the appeal, the law remains in effect while litigation continues.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case, Florida abortion providers, asked the state Supreme Court in August to put the 15-week ban back on hold while the appeal plays out.\n\nGeorgia: 6-week ban in effect but being challenged in court\n\nA state law that bans abortions as early as six weeks of pregnancy took effect on July 20, after a federal appellate court allowed the law to be enforced immediately.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court ruled on Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization (which overturned Roe), the Georgia ban remained on hold for several weeks, until the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals stayed a lower district court’s order that had blocked the law.\n\nAbortion providers and advocates filed a new challenge against the Georgia law in state court, arguing that it violates the state constitution and cannot be enforced because it went against federal constitutional precedent when it was enacted in 2019 and can’t be revived. The judge, however, declined in August to halt the law’s enforcement while the lawsuit played out, because he concluded he did not have the authority to issue the preliminary order.\n\nIdaho: abortion ban in effect but parts of it blocked by court\n\nIdaho’s trigger law banning most abortions went into effect August 25, but litigation continues around certain aspects.\n\nThe ban prohibits abortions unless necessary to prevent the death of the pregnant person, or in situations of rape or incest that have been reported to law enforcement.\n\nThe law was designed to take effect 30 days following the US Supreme Court’s transmission of its judgment overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nA federal judge on August 24, however, blocked enforcement of the ban in certain medical emergencies, after the Biden administration sued the state, arguing that the law opened doctors up to prosecution for abortion care they were obligated to offer under federal law.\n\nThe case could be appealed, potentially leading to the Supreme Court being asked to weigh in.\n\nKentucky: abortion bans in effect while court challenge unfolds\n\nA Kentucky state court of appeals on August 1 reinstated the state’s so-called trigger law banning abortion as well as a separate law banning the procedure after roughly six weeks of pregnancy, siding with Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron and allowing the laws to temporarily be enforced while the case proceeds in the courts.\n\nOn August 18, the state Supreme Court allowed the laws to remain in effect, as it plans to hear oral arguments on the appeal of the temporary injunction in November.\n\nLouisiana: abortion ban in effect but being challenged in court\n\nLouisiana’s abortion trigger ban went into effect again on August 1 while a legal challenge to the law continues.\n\nThe law had been temporarily blocked by a state judge in July but is again in effect after a ruling from a state appellate court allowed the law to be enforced.\n\nThe Center for Reproductive Rights, which is challenging the law, has filed a request with the state Supreme Court to reinstate the temporary order that had blocked the law’s enforcement. The Supreme Court has not acted on that request.\n\nMississippi: abortion banned\n\nMississippi’s trigger law went into effect on July 7, after the last abortion clinic in the state was unsuccessful in its attempts to get the law blocked. The trigger ban prohibits abortions in the state with exceptions only in cases of rape or if the pregnant person’s life is endangered.\n\nMissouri: abortion banned\n\nMissouri’s law that bans abortion except in medical emergencies went into effect on June 24.\n\nNorth Carolina: 20-week ban in effect\n\nA US district court judge in North Carolina on August 17 allowed a state law that bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy to be reinstated, lifting an injunction he had placed on the law prior to the US Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nIn 2019, District Judge William Osteen had stopped the law from being enforced and declared the ban unconstitutional based on Supreme Court precedent.\n\nBut in his August 17 order, Osteen wrote that “under Dobbs, there is now no constitutional right to a pre-viability abortion, thus depriving the injunction of any constitutional basis from which to enjoin the challenged North Carolina laws regulating abortion.”\n\nOklahoma: abortion banned\n\nAbortion had been unavailable in the state since May, after the governor signed bills into law that allowed civil enforcement of abortion restrictions.\n\nAfter the Supreme Court overruled Roe, Oklahoma Attorney General John O’Connor said that the state may enforce its 1910 pre-Roe abortion ban, under which abortion is a felony up to five years in prison except to preserve the woman’s life.\n\nThe attorney general’s office had said that SB 612, which goes into effect on August 27 and enacts harsher penalties for performing an abortion, would become the primary prohibition on the procedure.\n\nAbortion providers had challenged Oklahoma’s pre-Roe abortion ban and the abortion statutes signed by Stitt, calling the laws overlapping and contradictory.\n\nSouth Dakota: abortion banned\n\nSouth Dakota’s trigger law, which makes it illegal to perform an abortion except in life-threatening medical emergencies, went into effect on June 24.\n\nTennessee: abortion banned\n\nAbortions up to six weeks of pregnancy had been available in Tennessee, but the trigger law that took effect on August 25 bans abortions at all stages of pregnancy, except when necessary to prevent the pregnant woman’s death or serious risk of “substantial and irreversible impairment” of a bodily function. It does not allow for abortions in cases of rape or incest.\n\nTexas: abortion banned\n\nTexas’ trigger law went into effect on August 25, putting in place new criminal penalties for abortion and offering an exemption only for certain health emergencies. The state additionally has a civil enforcement law – authorizing private citizens to bring lawsuits against alleged violators in state court – for abortions performed after around six weeks into the pregnancy.\n\nWest Virginia: abortion banned\n\nWest Virginia’s governor on September 16 signed a bill into law that prohibits abortion except in certain medical situations or in cases of rape or incest.\n\nHouse Bill 302, which was passed in a special session, allows exceptions for cases of rape or incest up to eight weeks of pregnancy for adults and the first 14 weeks of pregnancy for minors – and needs to be reported to law enforcement.\n\nIt also allows exceptions if the embryo or fetus is nonviable, a medical emergency exists or in the case of an ectopic pregnancy.\n\nBetween July and now, abortion had briefly been available up to 20 weeks, after a state court judge blocked a West Virginia abortion ban dating back to the 1800s that was in effect in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs.\n\nWisconsin: pre-Roe ban in effect but being challenged in court\n\nDemocratic state officials in Wisconsin have asked a state court to block Wisconsin’s pre-Roe abortion ban, which was allowed to take effect after the high court overturned the federal holding. The 1849 law criminalizes abortion in the state, including in cases of rape and incest.\n\nThe lawsuit asks a state court to “clarify that Wisconsin’s 19th century abortion ban with no exceptions for rape or incest has not gone back into effect,” and to deem it unenforceable.\n\nStates where abortion bans or extreme limits are on hold due to court order\n\nIndiana: ban blocked while lawsuit continues\n\nIndiana’s law banning most abortions took effect on September 15 – but a week later, a state judge blocked the ban from being enforced.\n\nIndiana was the first state to pass a restrictive law against abortion after Roe v. Wade was overturned, doing so during a special legislative session.\n\nSenate Bill 1 provides exceptions for when the life of the mother is at risk and for fatal fetal anomalies, up until 20 weeks post-fertilization. It also allows exceptions if the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest during the first 10 weeks post-fertilization.\n\nThe judge on September 22 issued a preliminary injunction requested by plaintiffs, saying that they are likely to succeed on the merits as to their claim that the law violates the Indiana constitution’s liberty guarantees.\n\nIowa: GOP governor asks court to revive state’s 6-week abortion ban\n\nIowa Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds asked a state court on August 11 to revive a six-week abortion ban that had previously been halted in 2019.\n\nIn her brief filed in the Iowa District Court for Polk County, Reynolds pointed to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe in June, as well as the Iowa Supreme Court’s separate reversal earlier that month of its own 2018 decision that had interpreted the state constitution as extending protections for abortion rights.\n\nMichigan: ban blocked\n\nIn Michigan, the state’s pre-Roe abortion ban – a 1931 abortion law, which was invalidated by the decision in Roe v. Wade but remained on the state’s books – was deemed unconstitutional by a state court judge in September. The judge’s September 7 order permanently enjoined the Michigan state attorney general, a Democrat, and county prosecutors from enforcing the law.\n\nThe court had temporarily put the law on hold in May, before the US Supreme Court decision was handed down. After an appellate court said that order applied only to state officials, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer successfully sought an order from a separate court halting the ban’s enforcement by county officials as well. There are also pending requests before the state Supreme Court asking the court to declare definitively that the pre-Roe ban violates the state’s constitution.\n\nNorth Dakota: judge blocked trigger ban day before it would take effect\n\nThe state’s trigger ban was blocked a day before it was set to go into effect on August 26.\n\nA state judge granted a preliminary injunction on August 25, blocking the law while a legal challenge plays out.\n\nThe abortion ban would make it a felony to perform an abortion in the state with exceptions to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest.\n\nOhio: 6-week abortion ban temporarily blocked\n\nA state judge on September 14 temporarily blocked Ohio’s law prohibiting abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy, restoring abortion access in the state for now.\n\nWith the judge’s ruling, abortion is again available up to about 22 weeks after a person’s last menstrual period.\n\nThe temporary restraining order is in place for the next 14 days, and the plaintiffs have requested a preliminary injunction while the case plays out.\n\nOn September 2, Ohio abortion providers filed a new challenge against the law in Hamilton County Court of Common Pleas, arguing that the law violates the state constitution. The groups said they withdrew their initial challenge to the law that was before the state Supreme Court, which had denied their request for an emergency hold.\n\nSouth Carolina: 6-week abortion ban temporarily blocked\n\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court on August 17 temporarily blocked the state’s six-week abortion ban from being enforced, granting a request from state abortion providers for a temporary injunction while their challenge to the law continues.\n\nSouth Carolina’s law, S.1, had been in effect since June 27, when a judge lifted a federal court’s hold on the ban days after the US Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. A circuit court judge in late July declined to block the ban and recommended the lawsuit move to the state’s high court.\n\nUtah: trigger ban blocked while court challenge continues\n\nAbortion services have remained available in Utah, after a state judge blocked the state’s trigger law while litigation continues.\n\nThe law would ban abortions with exceptions for cases of rape or incest, detection of severe birth defects, or prevention of the death or serious injury of the person giving birth.\n\nFor now, abortions up until 18 weeks of pregnancy have been able to continue.\n\nWyoming: trigger ban blocked while lawsuit continues\n\nWyoming’s abortion ban was blocked on July 27, the day it was set to go into effect.\n\nA state court judge issued a temporary restraining order in a lawsuit brought by abortion providers, an access fund and two women, who argue that the ban violates Wyoming’s constitution.\n\nThe law – which includes exemptions for incest, sexual assault or “serious risk of death or of substantial and irreversible physical impairment” – was a trigger law set in motion by the Dobbs ruling. Under the law, the ban could be implemented five days after certification from the governor, which happened on July 22. The judge has placed a preliminary injunction on the ban while the lawsuit continues.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed Veronica Stracqualursi", "Tierney Sneed", "Veronica Stracqualursi"], "publish_date": "2022/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/06/health/permanent-daylight-savings-health-harms-wellness/index.html", "title": "Permanent Daylight Saving Time will hurt our health, experts say ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: Sign up for CNN’s Sleep, But Better newsletter series. Our seven-part guide has helpful hints to achieve better sleep.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe end of Daylight Saving Time is upon us again, an autumn tradition when the United States, Europe, most of Canada and a number of other countries move their clocks backwards an hour in a sort of Groundhog Day trust fall. We’ll move them forward (again) next spring when governments put daylight saving back in place.\n\nBut are we putting our trust in an unhealthy, outdated idea?\n\nNot according to the United States Senate, which in March passed the Sunshine Protection Act of 2021 – if it becomes law, Daylight Saving Time will be permanent.\n\n“The call to end the antiquated practice of clock changing is gaining momentum throughout the nation,” said Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL), who first introduced the bill in the US Senate, in a statement. Florida’s legislature voted to make Daylight Saving Time permanent in Florida in 2018, but it can’t go into effect until it is federal law as well.\n\nThe bill still has to make its way through the US House of Representatives and be signed into law by the President. If or when that is the case, we’ll move our clocks forward and leave them that way, permanently living one hour ahead of the sun.\n\nHowever, a growing number of sleep experts say the act of moving our clocks forward in the spring is ruining our health. Studies over the last 25 years have shown the one-hour change disrupts body rhythms tuned to Earth’s rotation, adding fuel to the debate over whether having Daylight Saving Time in any form is a good idea.\n\n“I’m one of the many sleep experts that knows it’s a bad idea,” said Dr. Elizabeth Klerman, a professor of neurology in the division of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School.\n\n“Your body clock stays with (natural) light not with the clock on your wall,” Klerman said. “And there’s no evidence that your body fully shifts to the new time.”\n\nDr. Phyllis Zee, director of the Center for Circadian and Sleep Medicine at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine in Evanston, Illinois, also opposes Daylight Saving Time.\n\n“Between March and November your body gets less morning light and more evening light, which can throw off your circadian rhythm,” she said.\n\nStandard time, which we enter when we move our clocks back in the fall, is much closer to the sun’s day and night cycle, Zee said. This cycle has set our circadian rhythm, or body clock, for centuries.\n\nThat internal timer controls not just when you sleep, but also when you want to eat, exercise or work, as well as “your blood pressure, your heart rate and your cortisol rhythm,” Zee added.\n\nOur bodies need the early morning light to set our internal body clock, experts say. Marilyn Nieves/E+/Getty Images\n\nA call to ban Daylight Saving Time for good has come from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine: “Current evidence best supports the adoption of year-round standard time, which aligns best with human circadian biology and provides distinct benefits for public health and safety.”\n\nThe proposal has been endorsed by more than 20 medical, scientific, and civic organizations, including the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, the National Parent Teacher Association, the National Safety Council, the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms and the World Sleep Society.\n\nWhat’s the harm?\n\nWhen our internal clocks are offset from the solar day-night cycle by even one hour we develop what sleep experts call “social jet lag.” Studies have shown social jet lag increases the risk of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, raises the risk of heart disease and stroke, worsens mood disorders such as depression, affects the digestive and endocrine systems and shortens our sleep duration. It can even reduce life expectancy,\n\nA 2003 study found getting one hour less sleep for two weeks had the same effect on thinking and motor skills as going without sleep for two full nights. Reducing sleep by 90 minutes from the recommended 7 to 8 hours for adults altered the DNA of immune cells and boosted inflammation, a key cause of chronic disease, according to another study.\n\nMaking the time change permanent would make the chronic effects of any sleep loss more severe, not only “because we have to go to work an hour earlier for an additional 5 months every year but also because body clocks are usually later in winter than in summer with reference to the sun clock,” according to a statement from the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms.\n\n“The combination of DST and winter would therefore make the differences between body clocks and the social clock even worse and would negatively affect our health even more,” the authors concluded.\n\nWhy did the Senate pass the bill?\n\nThere are reasons the US Senate unanimously passed the Sunshine Protection Act. Proponents say that extra daylight in the evening cuts down on car accidents and crime, and increases opportunities for commerce and recreation, as people prefer to shop and exercise during daylight hours.\n\nHowever, research has shown both heart attacks and fatal car accidents increase after the clock falls forward in the spring. Children also end up going to school in the morning while it is still dark – with disastrous consequences.\n\nWhen President Richard Nixon signed a permanent Daylight Saving Time into law in January 1974, it was a popular move. But by the end of the month Florida’s governor had called for the law’s repeal after eight schoolchildren were hit by cars in the dark. Schools across the country delayed start times until the sun came up.\n\nBy summer, public approval had plummeted, and in early October Congress voted to switch back to standard time.\n\nA similar backlash occurred when the US first implemented Daylight Saving Time in 1918, as a way to to reduce demand for electricity usage by adding sunlight to the end of the day in response to World War I. (Studies since have found little to no cost savings from the practice.) The time switch was so unpopular that the law was repealed the following year.\n\n“The United States has tried permanent daylight saving time twice before and ended it early. The UK tried once before and ended it early. Russia tried it once, so did India and ended it early,” Klerman said. “I think we should learn from history.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/11/06"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/14/politics/idaho-abortion-bill-six-weeks/index.html", "title": "Idaho Legislature passes bill banning abortion after six weeks | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Idaho Legislature gave final approval Monday to a bill that would ban abortion after six weeks and allow the father, sibling, grandparent, aunt or uncle of the fetus to bring legal action against the medical professional who performed the abortion.\n\nIdaho’s GOP-controlled House passed Senate Bill 1309, dubbed the “Fetal Heartbeat, Preborn Child Protection Act,” in a 51-14 vote, according to the legislature’s Assistant Chief Clerk Chris Taylor.

Eddie Lucio, Jr. has voted for anti-abortion legislation more than a dozen times in the last decade. He was one of the state lawmakers who both sponsored and voted for the controversial “Heartbeat Bill,” which criminalized abortion as soon as a fetus’ heartbeat is detected and did not include exceptions for victims of rape or incest. He also voted for the state’s so-called trigger ban, which outlawed the procedure almost entirely upon the fall of Roe v. Wade.\n\nHe is “the extremist right’s trusted vote when it comes to attacking abortion access,” one abortion rights advocacy group in Texas proclaimed in 2021.\n\nHe is also a lifelong Democrat.\n\nA CNN analysis of legislative records and reported party affiliations shows that the Republicans passing increasingly strict abortion bans around the country have been joined by scores of unlikely allies: Democrats.\n\nMore than 140 Democrats from eight of the roughly dozen states with the most restrictive abortion laws voted in favor of the bans, and the vast majority of these state lawmakers were men.\n\nAll but one of the laws would have passed with Republican votes alone, and a few were passed without a single vote from a Democratic lawmaker. Republican legislators almost always voted in favor of the restrictions, which experts say shows how the issue has been much more of a litmus test for Republican state lawmakers than it has for Democrats.\n\nThe right to abortion had been guaranteed in the United States for nearly 50 years until the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in June. In its wake, the procedure has been outlawed or severely restricted thanks to state trigger bans and other anti-abortion laws passed between 2005 and today that are now taking effect. Most of these laws were passed in the last five years, though two of the state trigger bans were passed more than a decade ago in the hopes that Roe v. Wade would someday be overturned. In Mississippi, for example, a law that passed in 2007 received yes votes from more than 60 Democrats — some of whom have since crossed over to the Republican Party. In this case, the law would not have passed without that support from Democrats.\n\nThese strict abortion bans run contrary to public opinion, with more than 60% of Americans saying they disapprove of the recent Supreme Court decision in a July CNN poll. In August, voters in Kansas rejected a ballot measure that would have limited abortion rights in the state, while in upstate New York, a Democrat won a special election for a swing House district – a sign of the motivating power of abortion rights as an issue.\n\nTexas State Senator Eddie Lucio Jr., a Democrat, spoke in favor of a controversial anti-abortion bill in 2021. He told CNN most of his constituents are \"Christians whose upbringings taught them fundamental values of what is right and wrong.\" Jay Janner/AP\n\nLucio told CNN that being an anti-abortion Democrat “feels lonely” at times, but that most of his constituents are “Christians whose upbringings taught them fundamental values of what is right and wrong.”\n\nHe said he doesn’t believe abortion is only a women’s issue, since both men and women are involved in conception, and that men “have shown that they have a natural instinct to protect the human race.”\n\n“Many times, I believe, women would choose not to have an abortion if men would demonstrate a moral sense of responsibility,” he said.\n\nMore than 140 Democrats from eight of the roughly dozen states with the most restrictive abortion laws voted in favor of the bans.\n\nThe national Democratic Party’s stance on abortion is clear. “Like the majority of Americans, Democrats believe every woman should be able to access high-quality reproductive health care services, including safe and legal abortion,” its party platform states. “We oppose and will fight to overturn federal and state laws that create barriers to women’s reproductive health and rights…”\n\nBut that is not always the case for individual Democratic state legislators.\n\nIn Arkansas, four of the state’s 29 Democrats voted in 2019 to pass the trigger ban that criminalized abortion under nearly all circumstances. They were all men. That same year, 14 male and five female Democrats in Kentucky voted for a similar state ban, representing nearly 40% of all Democrats in the state legislature at the time. And in Mississippi, nine male Democratic lawmakers voted in 2018 to pass the 15-week abortion ban that ultimately led to the overturning of Roe v. Wade. The laws received almost unanimous support from Republicans, except for a single no vote in Arkansas.\n\nA 2022 bill strengthening Louisiana’s trigger ban, meanwhile, was passed with the help of 10 male and two female Democratic lawmakers and signed into law by Democratic Gov. John Bel Edwards. “I am pro-life and have never hidden from that fact,” Edwards said in a statement in June, noting that he signed the bill despite his objection to the lack of exceptions for rape and incest victims. A spokesperson for Edwards told CNN that the governor intends to work with lawmakers to hopefully pass an exception for victims of rape and incest and noted that the bill he signed “sought to clarify” a ban passed in 2006 before he became governor.\n\n\"I am pro-life and have never hidden from that fact,\" said Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, who is a Democrat. Matthew Hinton/AP\n\nFormer Kentucky Democratic state representative and gubernatorial candidate Rocky Adkins said in a 2019 radio interview that in addition to his personal beliefs, his votes represent the views of his constituents in a “very conservative district.” Bruce Maloch, who no longer serves in the state legislature, is one of the Arkansas Democrats who voted in favor of the state’s trigger ban. He was described as a “a deer-hunting, abortion-opposing local Baptist deacon” in a 2020 local newspaper column lamenting the Republican attack ads against him. Maloch and Adkins did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment.\n\nAlso in Kentucky, former state Rep. Joe Graviss told a local newspaper in 2020 that he had tried to emphasize his “pro-life” beliefs throughout his campaign for state Senate but still lost. Graviss declined to discuss his anti-abortion votes with CNN, saying the issue is a “very personal” one for him, but also said he is frustrated with how local Democrats are painted as being the same as national Democrats, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which is not always the case. “You have people putting up big signs in their fields on major parkways saying if you vote for a Democrat you’re going to hell,” he said. “You have pastors telling their congregations who to vote for and putting the list tacked on church front doors with damning repercussions if they don’t vote that way.”\n\nFormer Kentucky representative Joe Graviss said he is frustrated with how local Democrats are painted as being the same as national Democrats. Nikki Boliaux/USA Today Network\n\nIn all, men represented more than 80% of the Democratic votes in state legislatures in favor of the bans.\n\nCNN’s analysis of state Democrats echoes how gender has played a role in Congress as well. An analysis of abortion-related voting in the House of Representatives between 1993 and 2018 published last year by two Georgetown researchers found that Democratic men were more likely to vote in favor of bills restricting abortion than their female counterparts, which the researchers attributed to how female Democrats are often elected in more liberal districts.\n\nCurrently, the only two Democratic members of Congress to publicly oppose abortion are: Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, which was noted in a recent column about the “end of pro-life Democrats” at the federal level. Republican women in the House, meanwhile, have historically been more likely than Republican men to oppose anti-abortion legislation, the Georgetown researchers noted, but that gender gap has disappeared in recent years as more moderate candidates were replaced by “strongly pro-life women from the South and Midwest.”\n\nAt the same time, experts say framing abortion as a women’s issue may prevent men from taking up the abortion-rights side of the cause, whether as advocates or lawmakers — saying anti-abortion activists have strategically capitalized on the power men wield in politics and business. “Let’s be real: there’s a WHOLE lot of men whose lives, careers, and families have benefited from an abortion,” US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, tweeted in the wake of Roe’s reversal. “Men, we need you right now. You can get through in rooms others can’t. Your power matters.” Some abortion rights advocates also note that gender-based framing of the issue leaves out transgender and nonbinary people who could be affected.\n\nZiad Munson, a sociology professor at Lehigh University who specializes in the politics of abortion, said that “politicians often have easily identifiable political reasons for their stance on abortion,” saying that some Democrats may be voting for anti-abortion legislation more to maintain their seat in a conservative district than because it is a deeply-held personal belief.\n\nMunson noted that the finding that Democratic state lawmakers have been more likely to cross party lines shows how abortion became much more of a core issue for the Republican Party, while Democrats have allowed “for more diversity of views for a longer period of time.” This has been particularly true in the South, he said, where Democrats have been historically more conservative.\n\nThat may be changing, however, as lawmakers adapt to a shifting political landscape. Munson said it will be telling to see how Democrats vote as Republicans push for even stricter bans in a post-Roe v. Wade world.\n\nPeople protest in front of the U.S. Supreme Court after the overturning of the landmark 50-year-old Roe v. Wade case. Brandon Bell/Getty Images\n\nIn Congress, Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who previously described himself as a “pro-life” Democrat, recently voted with his party on a bill that would have codified the federal right to abortion — though it did not receive enough votes to proceed. In a statement, Casey said he was motivated by reports that Republicans would attempt to pass a federal six-week abortion ban — an extreme restriction that he said he had never supported during his time in public office. Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, said in a June statement that he was “deeply disappointed” in the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe and that he supported exceptions for rape and incest, but he still voted against the bill, saying on CNN that he believed the congressional proposal went beyond codifying Roe and would expand abortion rights, which he could not support.\n\nFormer Tennessee state Rep. John DeBerry, meanwhile, had served as a Democrat for more than 20 years but was stripped from the primary ballot by the state Democratic party in 2020. The move came after DeBerry, who later ran as an independent, was targeted by attack ads from the political arm of Planned Parenthood, and party representatives reportedly said at the time that his votes for anti-abortion and school voucher bills, among others, didn’t align with the party’s values.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Tennessee's political arm took out attack ads against Democrat John DeBerry after he voted in favor of strict anti-abortion legislation. Angela Weiss/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“Life has mattered my entire career,” he said in a 2020 interview with Christianity Today. “My principles have not changed, and I am not changing my principles because I have a D behind my name.”\n\nAnd back in Texas, longtime Democratic state Rep. Ryan Guillen announced in November 2021 he would be officially switching his affiliation from Democrat to Republican. Like Lucio in the Senate, Guillen had voted in favor of both the state’s trigger ban and controversial six-week ban enforced through civil litigation. “Rep. Guillen has been a friend for many years,” the state Republican Party chairman said in a statement. “I am proud to welcome him to the Republican Party.” Guillen did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDays earlier, Lucio had announced he would not seek reelection after more than 30 years in the state legislature.

So what we are seeing here is people playing on that fear of that graying generation that votes with regularity and feels as though something is slipping away. Nadine Smith, executive director, Equality Florida\n\nMore fundamentally, these red state moves are remaking the American civil liberties landscape at breathtaking speed – and with little national attention to their cumulative effect. Taken together, these moves amount to a stark reversal of what many legal scholars call the “rights revolution” beginning in the 1960s, in which Congress and especially the Supreme Court expanded the number of rights available to all Americans nationwide and struck down state laws that constricted those rights on issues from racial segregation to abortion and same-sex marriage. In many ways, the red states are attempting to tilt the nation back toward a pre-1960s model, when the basic civil rights and civil liberties available to Americans diverged far more depending on where they lived.\n\nFurther, with GOP senators wielding the filibuster and the Republican-appointed majority on the Supreme Court both providing powerful air cover for this red state ground offensive, Democrats and groups focused on defending civil rights, abortion rights and LGBTQ rights, among other issues, have not yet found any effective means of slowing the conservative onslaught. Even as the nation grows more racially, religiously and culturally diverse than ever, that means roughly half the states are on track to impose rules across this broad array of cultural flashpoints that primarily reflect the demands of one shrinking group: conservative and often older White Christians.\n\n“You have an emerging generation that is multiracial, multicultural, where no single ethnic or racial group is the majority, and it has struck an existential fear within those who are used to controlling everything, from the boardroom to the White House,” says Nadine Smith, executive director of Equality Florida, an LGBTQ advocacy group battling against the “don’t say gay” proposals from Florida Republicans that would severely restrict how teachers can talk about sexual orientation or gender identity in the classroom. “So what we are seeing here is people playing on that fear of that graying generation that votes with regularity and feels as though something is slipping away.”\n\nAnti-abortion activists protest outside of a Planned Parenthood clinic on January 20, 2022, in Washington. Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nConservatives praise the widening divergence among the states on this broad array of issues as a vindication of the belief among the nation’s founders that states should have great leeway to set their own courses – a belief embodied in the 10th Amendment to the Constitution.\n\n“This is going to be a new test of federalism,” Jessica Anderson, executive director of Heritage Action, a conservative group that has promoted some of the conservative state initiatives, told me in a 2021 interview. “But I think it’s a good thing, and it’s largely how the founders envisioned this.”\n\nA wide array of groups that promote civil rights and liberties, however, see the red state moves as a fundamental assault on constitutional rights that should be available nationwide to all Americans.\n\n“We are absolutely seeing what feels like two countries – opposed on so many fundamental questions,” Deborah Archer, a professor at the New York University Law School and president of the American Civil Liberties Union, told me in an email. “That’s the reality we are facing with abortion rights – pregnant people with fundamentally different protection of their Constitutional rights based on geography. That’s the reality we may face with voting rights – Black voters with fundamentally different rights based on geography. That’s the reality we are facing with the censorship of discussions about race in the classroom – children getting wildly different opportunities to learn about the history and reality of racism and racial inequality based on geography.”\n\nThe one undisputed point: On a panoramic range of volatile issues revolving around cultural values and racial equity, Republican-controlled states are advancing the most aggressive conservative agenda in memory. In a comment echoed to me by analysts in other states, political scientist Richard Murray, a senior researcher at the Hobby School of Public Affairs at the University of Houston, described last year’s Texas state legislative session as “the most extreme session in modern Texas history. I’ve been here since 1966 and nothing was comparable in all of those years.”\n\nFronts in the fight\n\nThe red state offensive is advancing across a wide range of fronts, including:\n\nAbortion: Anticipating that the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority later this year will strike down Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision establishing a nationwide right to abortion, GOP-controlled states are approving a raft of new restrictions on the procedure. Seven states in 2021 passed laws retrenching access to abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute; that list included total bans that Texas and Oklahoma approved to go into effect if the high court allows. Texas also passed its separate law banning abortion after the detection of a fetal heartbeat, usually around six weeks of pregnancy, and empowering citizens to sue anyone involved in providing one; five GOP-appointed Supreme Court justices, over the vehement objections of Chief Justice John Roberts and the three Democratic appointees, have refused to block implementation of that law while lower courts debate its constitutionality.\n\nIn all, Guttmacher calculated, states approved 108 abortion restrictions of some sort in 2021 (such as constraints on access to abortion medication). The group says that’s by far the most that have been approved in any single year since Roe. And the wave has not yet crested: Just this month, GOP-controlled legislatures in Florida, West Virginia and Arizona, anticipating that the GOP Supreme Court majority will overturn Roe, have advanced bills to ban abortion after 15 weeks.\n\nVoting: Laws making it more difficult to vote, and in several cases increasing the opportunity for Republican partisans to exert more influence over election administration and vote tabulation, have been probably the most visible component of the red state push. In 2021, 19 states – including Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Iowa, Montana and Texas – passed a total of 34 laws restricting access to voting, according to tabulations by the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU Law School. The center counts 250 bills to further restrict voting access that have been introduced this year or carried over from last year’s session and another 41 that could erode the integrity of election administration. Meanwhile, the new voter identification requirements in Texas have resulted in the rejection of so many mail ballots that local Democratic officials in Harris County have asked the US Justice Department to intervene.\n\nEducation: Nothing has spread more rapidly across the red states than the laws – dubbed “gag orders” by critics – restricting how public school K-12 teachers can talk about current and historic racial and gender inequities. In 2021, nine Republican-controlled states passed laws establishing such restrictions and four others imposed them through executive branch actions. This year, according to PEN America, a free-speech group founded by prominent authors, 112 similar bills have been introduced in 34 states.\n\nVariations on the theme are multiplying: Virginia’s newly elected Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, for instance, has created a “tip line” that residents can use to complain about teachers discussing supposedly “divisive” concepts. Iowa’s Republican-controlled legislature is considering legislation to install cameras in every classroom so that parents or others can monitor what teachers are saying.\n\nThis push to control what students are taught is also broadening in several ways. On one front, more of the red state bills would impose restrictions not only on K-12 teachers, but also on professors in public colleges and universities; PEN counts 48 such bills pending. Last week, Texas’ Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the leader of the state’s social conservatives, said he will push legislation to both end tenure for new hires at the University of Texas and make it easier to revoke tenure for professors who teach critical race theory, an academic analysis that explores structural racism.\n\nOn another front, Republican-controlled states are pushing beyond race and gender inequities to advance legislation that limits how public schools discuss sexual orientation and gender identity or bars it completely for younger students. The most prominent of these bills – the Florida legislation that critics have dubbed the “don’t say gay” bill – could receive approval from the full state House of Representatives this week, with the enthusiastic support of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis. In all, nine states are considering 15 similar bills, according to PEN America.\n\nOn yet another front, more states and local school districts are banning books, including many by authors who are racial minorities or who identify as LGBTQ: The American Library Association told me in an email that its Office for Intellectual Freedom has received more than 330 reports of attempted book bans from just September through November 2021. Finally, several of the red state education proposals borrow from the new Texas abortion statute and empower private citizens to sue schools or school districts if they object to how teachers discuss the restricted topics.\n\nLGBTQ rights: The Human Rights Campaign, a group that advocates for the LGBTQ community, says 10 states in 2021 adopted 26 bills restricting their rights. One of the most common themes has been legislation prohibiting transgender girls and women from participating in high school and often college-level sports; among the eight states that approved such bans in 2021 were Arkansas, Florida, Montana, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia. In Republican-controlled states, this wave also shows no sign of cresting: South Dakota recently approved its own ban, proposals are advancing in Kentucky and Utah, and the Human Rights Campaign counts 56 sports bans pending across the states.\n\nOn a parallel track, Tennessee last year approved legislation requiring students to use the bathrooms for their genders at birth, and Arkansas’ GOP-controlled legislature overrode a veto from Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson to approve the nation’s first law prohibiting gender-affirming medical care for transgender people below age 18; Tennessee also approved such a ban. Texas’ GOP Attorney General Ken Paxton issued an opinion last Friday that such treatments constituted “child abuse” under Texas law.\n\nThe left with their defund the police, the mask mandate in schools and all that kind of stuff opened the door. People got tired of it. They got sick of it, and they are fighting back. They are not sitting back and just saying no. They are organizing and … they are pushing back aggressively. They feel it’s been in their face, so [if it’s] ‘good for the goose, good for the gander.’ Bill Miller, lobbyist and political consultant in Texas\n\nProtest rights: In the aftermath of 2020’s massive Black Lives Matter demonstrations, multiple Republican-controlled states – including Florida, Iowa, Oklahoma, Tennessee and Texas – have approved laws stiffening penalties on protesters accused of damaging property. In a few cases, red states have also approved laws immunizing drivers who run over protesters if they are caught in demonstrations. The International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, which tracks these proposals, counts more than a dozen that have been approved since 2020, with 17 more pending this year, preponderantly in Republican-controlled states.\n\nGun rights: In sharp contrast to the laws limiting rights across all the arenas discussed above, red states are rushing to loosen restrictions on gun owners. In 2021, five Republican-controlled states, including Montana, Tennessee and Texas, eliminated requirements for gun owners to receive permits or undergo training before being allowed to carry concealed handguns – or in some cases before being allowed to openly carry weapons, according to tracking by Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group. This year the group says seven more Republican-controlled states are moving to eliminate such requirements; three of them (Georgia, Indiana and South Carolina) would allow the open carrying of handguns without any training or permitting.\n\nThe sweep of this challenge has left civil rights and liberties groups gasping. “What is disturbing is how … many of the legal protections are falling at the same time,” says Archer, the ACLU president. “We have seen the protection of our civil rights and civil liberties being chipped away, death by a thousand cuts. Today, we are seeing more protections torn down all at once.”\n\nDemocrats in Washington have found no effective response. The House has passed legislation to reverse many of the state voting restrictions and to codify the national right to abortion, but a Republican Senate filibuster blocked the former last month and is expected to similarly doom the latter next week.\n\nNeither the Biden administration nor congressional Democrats have focused much attention on the other state restrictions (particularly the educational “gag orders”), much less devised an approach to resist them. While the red state offensive has advanced, Democrats have been much more consumed by the critique from party centrists that liberals are pushing excessively “woke” policies on public safety and schooling.\n\nWhy this is happening, and why now\n\nMultiple factors probably explain why Republican-controlled states are simultaneously moving so quickly across so many fronts. Anderson, from Heritage Action, says a key factor is that conservative activists have shifted their attention more to state and local governments. That shift has occurred, she says, both because they realize they have few opportunities to advance their priorities at the national level while Democrats control the White House and Congress and also because the Covid-19 crisis made them realize that local decisions “probably impact their day-to-day [life] more than even federal.”\n\nBill Miller, a lobbyist and political consultant who has worked for both parties in Texas, says the hard push from social conservatives there reflects a long-gestating backlash on the right to the left’s efforts to advance socially liberal causes, such as more explicit discussion of racial issues in the schools.\n\n“The left with their defund the police, the mask mandate in schools and all that kind of stuff opened the door,” he says in a view echoed by Anderson. “People got tired of it. They got sick of it, and they are fighting back. They are not sitting back and just saying no. They are organizing and … they are pushing back aggressively. They feel it’s been in their face, so [if it’s] ‘good for the goose, good for the gander.’ “\n\nOthers see the key factor as the shifting internal dynamics of the Republican coalition. Particularly in the Trump era, the GOP has become more dominant among the White voters who are the most uneasy about cultural and demographic change. Those voters, energized by Trump, are creating enormous demand in the party for hardline policies on race and culture.\n\nThere is definitely a difference between action and words. Lamenting the state of affairs in the Republican Party at a cocktail reception is not the necessary action that we need. … These folks are hoping they will wake up from this bad dream, but the better medicine is for them to pinch themselves that they are not dreaming. Democratic Texas state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer\n\nThe widespread gerrymandering of state legislative disticts, experts say, has magnified the influence of those voters because it means that almost all GOP lawmakers are running in staunchly conservative districts where they face more risk of losing primaries to opponents on their right than they do of losing general elections to opponents on their left. Murray, the Texas political scientist, says Republican primaries there typically attract only about one-fourth as many voters as the party wins in presidential general elections and those who do turn out “are disproportionately the cultural warriors.”\n\nOther institutional factors have propelled the rapid dispersion of these ideas across red states. Conservative groups like the American Legislative Exchange Council and Heritage Action energetically encourage Republican legislators to adopt many of these proposals; Heritage, for instance, recently issued a strategy memo urging red state legislatures “to embrace the culture war” over the teaching of race and sexual orientation as a means of building support for vouchers that would provide parents public funds to send their kids to private schools, a perennial goal on the right.\n\nThe increasing reliance of right-leaning voters on explicitly conservative media sources that relentlessly stoke cultural and racial grievance, from Fox to talk radio, also provides a powerful transmission belt.\n\n“The nationalization of media, aided by social media and the internet, is part of the story,” says Jake Grumbach, a political scientist at the University of Washington and author of an upcoming book on the polarization of state policy. “This kind of environment means that agendas can be set, with similar talking points and framing, across states very quickly.”\n\nAnother factor has been the indications from the Republican majority on the Supreme Court that it is unlikely to resist many of these red state initiatives. The red states “feel completely emboldened by the Supreme Court,” says Jessica Post, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, which focuses on state legislative races. In particular, she believes, the court’s “lack of action on the Texas case” authorizing private lawsuits against abortions “lit a wildfire of socially conservative legislation.”\n\nAlso critical, many analysts say, is the erosion of resistance from business groups. Under pressure from employees and consumers, business groups often pushed back forcefully during the early stages of this wave – for instance, with boycotts of North Carolina after Republicans there passed the original “bathroom bill” for transgender individuals in 2016.\n\nBut apart from modest public criticism of some of the voting laws, business has mostly stood to the side amid this new spasm of socially conservative legislation – even, critics note, when the bills directly contradict their public claims to support LGBTQ rights or racial equity. The journalist and activist Judd Legum, for instance, has documented that multiple companies that publicly proclaim their support for LGBTQ rights are heavily contributing to the Florida Republican legislators pushing the “don’t say gay” bill.\n\n“There is definitely a difference between action and words,” says Democratic Texas state Rep. Trey Martinez Fischer. “Lamenting the state of affairs in the Republican Party at a cocktail reception is not the necessary action that we need. … These folks are hoping they will wake up from this bad dream, but the better medicine is for them to pinch themselves that they are not dreaming.”\n\nRepublicans in these states also may have been emboldened because Democrats, after making gains in 2018, failed to flip any of the state legislative chambers they targeted in 2020. Now Republicans have been able to fortify their legislative majorities in many states with strong gerrymanders, while Democrats face the headwind of diminished approval ratings for President Joe Biden even among the suburban voters who powered their state-level wins during the Trump years.\n\nLike many red state GOP strategists, Austin-based Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak says, “I do not expect to see a suburban revolt due to the legislature’s [social issue] priorities.” He predicts that Republicans will actually gain in those areas “due to parental anger at school and Covid overreach.”\n\nBut perhaps the most powerful reason for this surge of culturally conservative legislation is the force and immediacy of the wave it seeks to counter. The evidence of irreversible demographic and cultural change continues to accumulate: The 2020 census, for the first time, recorded that kids of color now constitute a majority of the nation’s under-18 population; Gallup recently reported that a stunning one-fifth of Generation Z (as well as about 1 in 10 millennials) identifies as LGBTQ; and the latest figures from the Public Religion Research Institute show that White Christians, long the nation’s majority, now compose only a little more than two-fifths of the population.\n\nAll of that, critics argue, has created a sense of urgency for GOP state legislators responding to voters in their coalition uneasy about the “more diverse” future “that is around the corner,” as Martinez Fischer puts it. An America in which no single group makes up a majority “is arriving, and so there’s only two paths,” says Smith of Equality Florida. “One is division, chaos, suppression, censorship, surveillance and anti-immigrant sentiment. The alternative is a [way] forward, where regardless of race, gender or sexual orientation, there is a path here for everyone.”\n\nThe striking implication of the GOP’s ongoing revolution from below is that the coming decade may see the nation’s 50 states diverge between those two paths more than they have at any point since the Supreme Court and Congress began nationalizing more civil rights and liberties over half a century ago.", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/02/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2022/02/28/hb-1134-indiana-senate-kills-crt-critical-race-theory-inspired-legislation/9323738002/", "title": "HB 1134: Indiana Senate kills CRT-inspired legislation", "text": "The Indiana Senate killed controversial House Bill 1134, which would have banned several \"divisive concepts\" and given more power over curriculum and classroom activities to parents, Monday night after several hours of closed-door discussions in the Republican caucus.\n\nEven though Republicans have a supermajority in the General Assembly, Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray, R-Martinsville, said he didn't have the votes to support the bill that was inspired by nearly a year of debate about \"critical race theory\" in the state's public schools.\n\nMore:What you need to know about controversial 2022 education bills in Indiana\n\nThey were largely divided into two camps after a Senate committee watered it down in the face of opposition.\n\n\"We had some members of our caucus who felt like it didn't go far enough,\" he said. \"We had some members of our caucus that felt like it was too much of a burden on education and just not good policy that we wanted to move forward.\"\n\nThe bill, which would have limited what teachers could say in the classroom about race, sex and religion had been staunchly opposed by educators, school leaders, civil rights groups, Black community organizations and leaders in the faith community.\n\nFor subscribers:'Nail in the coffin': Hoosier teachers say CRT-inspired bill will drive them from classrooms\n\nThe bill was inspired by the opposition nationwide of primarily white, suburban parents to what was called \"critical race theory\" but was more often about social emotional learning and diversity, equity and inclusion work.\n\nThe bill would have given parents greater access to the lessons their children were being taught and more power to oppose material they found troubling.\n\nBray said he supported the legislation personally and had hoped to get it passed.\n\nIt was passed by the House last month, 60-37, along largely party lines but the version of the bill that the Senate was considering Monday had been significantly gutted. The list of \"divisive concepts\" shrank from eight items to three and provisions to allow parents to sue schools over things educators said in the classroom were stripped out.\n\nThose who opposed the bill said it was a solution to a problem that doesn't exist in Indiana and risked driving teachers — a critical profession already in short supply — out of the field.\n\nIt had been largely opposed by the Black community, which worried that the bill would further limit representation of Black and other people of color in school curricula and result in an incomplete and inaccurate teaching of the country's difficult history.\n\n\"This is a good day for the state of Indiana,\" said Garry Holland, education chair of the Indianapolis NAACP, \"not to accept that which would cause disenfranchisement of children and teachers.\"\n\nThe Indiana State Teachers Association, which has led a weeks-long effort to oppose the measure, celebrated its demise in a statement released Monday night.\n\n\"Over the past several weeks, ISTA members and public education advocates have shared their stories and voiced their concerns about stifling teachers’ ability to teach and students' ability to receive an honest education,\" said ISTA President Keith Gambill. \"Hoosier parents and educators all want our students to succeed, and we’ll continue to be partners in standing up for what’s right for their future.\"\n\nA similar bill was killed by the Senate earlier this session after Sen.

But unlike his stump speeches, Trump did not vow \"retribution,\" or repeat the baseless allegations of massive 2020 election fraud, call Jan. 6 defendants \"hostages,\" denigrate prosecutors handling his felony cases or demean his GOP rival, Nikki Haley, with a derogatory nickname.\n\nInstead, he extolled the trade treaties, tax cuts and foreign policy achievements, such as the Middle East Abraham Accords, of his single-term presidency. If given \"four more years,\" as some in the crowd packed into the Mar-a-Lago ballroom chanted, Trump promised to deliver U.S. energy independence, slash inflation and restore U.S. prestige abroad.\n\n\"You'd only have success and that's what's going to ultimately unify this country, and unify this party,\" he said. \"We have a great Republican Party with tremendous talent and we want to have unity.

And so whether you're a Republican voter, independent voter, Democrat voter, securing our border is a number one issue in our country.\"\n\nHe added: \"So I think it's important to tell the American people what you're going to do, not to try to placate people, don't try to obfuscate.

We've got to address the whole country's needs, but what are the things I can zero in on in individual communities that I visited?\"\n\nKo Robins, also with the Polish-Americans for Donald Trump, was joyous as Oklahoma, Alabama and Massachusetts were called for Trump.\n\n\"We're very excited.

What is the contrast with Biden? \"I think's it's going to be a continuation of what we've actually been talking about for the last several months.

Insert issue and you know we have a mile to walk on.\" On whether Democrats have an advantage because the Biden campaign is more coordinated with the Democratic National Committee? \"What they have an advantage in a couple weeks on the calendar we take away basically as soon as we start talking message, as soon as we start talking about those issues that they don't want to deal with.\" What is your priority in the Republican National Committee? \"Basically it's going to be election integrity, first and foremost, it's about putting together real ground game operations that are built around the early states, ensuring that fundraising is actually where it has to be and to [former RNC chairman] Ronna [McDaniel]'s credit, her last six weeks at the RNC she raised $11.5 million bucks so she's leaving us with a really good head start.\" Delegate math when does Trump clinch? \"12th, maybe 19th… at the latest\" of March. \"That's the key thing, clinching the nomination before he clinched it as the incumbent president\" in 2020.\n\n— Zac Anderson\n\nRapper who recorded 'Mayor of Magaville' calling it for Trump\n\nRapper Forgiato Blow, whose works include \"Mayor of Magaville\" and a Target boycott video, said he expects Hispanic voters to carry Trump to victory in 2024.\n\n\"I think a lot of people are waking up,\" he said. \"I think Trump is gonna go for the Hispanics, that's who's gonna win the vote this year. I think Trump needs to get that Hispanic vote, he's already getting it.\"\n\n— Stephany Matat\n\nPresident of PBC-based Trump fan club confident of Trump 'Super Tuesday' sweep, and no pivot\n\nThe mood at Mar-a-Lago is upbeat, festive and effusive as North Carolina and Virginia primaries have been called for Trump.\n\nA local in the crowd is Larry Snowden, president of the Trump fan group Club 47. He said he is expecting a \"big night\" for the former president.\n\n\"I think he'll take all the states. It'll be a big night for him,\" Snowden said.\n\nAs for the \"pivot\" question, Snowden says no thanks.\n\n\"I've known the man quite a while. I've been following him since 2015. I don't want him to change his message, and I don't think he will,\" he said. \"I'm one of these let Trump be Trump people. As long as Trump says, what he himself feels, he does better.\"\n\nThen Snowden added: \"I hope he stays with what he feels like saying, because that's why he's so popular with the conservative people.\"\n\n— Stephany Matat\n\nWhat are protest votes against Trump and Biden?\n\nOn \"what to watch\" on Super Tuesday ... protest votes.\n\nAlthough President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump have seemingly been destined for a rematch, polls show broad swaths of Americans still do not want to see another contest between them.\n\nSome of that dissatisfaction has materialized in previous primaries.\n\nIn New Hampshire, Republican challenger Nikki Haley won 43.3% of the vote, although the Trump camp insisted that the result was distorted because New Hampshire conducts an open primary. Haley also won just shy of 40% of the vote in her home state of South Carolina. In Michigan, she won just over a quarter of the votes.\n\nIn Michigan, Democratic voters upset with Biden cast \"uncommitted\" votes, which totaled 13.2% of ballots cast in that party's primary. In New Hampshire, rival Democrat Dean captured 19.6% of the votes cast.\n\n— Antonio Fins\n\n'Super Tuesday' by the numbers, and why it's a super delegate haul\n\nPolls are closing soon and most voters have already cast ballots. So let's talk about what's at stake for Donald Trump and Nikki Haley tonight.\n\nTo win the nomination, a Republican presidential candidate must win 1,215 delegates, which is a majority of the 2,429 delegates that will formally elect the nominee at the GOP convention in Milwaukee in July.\n\nRight now, Trump has 243 candidates and Haley lags well behind with just 43.3% of the vote.\n\nThere are 865 delegates up for grabs in Tuesday's 13 Republican primaries and two caucuses.\n\nIf the former president were to win delegates at the ratio he has in the first handful of primaries and caucuses, then it would put him within reach of sealing the nomination, perhaps during the March 19 Florida primary.\n\nThat's why it's \"Super Tuesday.\"\n\n— Antonio Fins\n\nIt's 'Super Tuesday.' What's an independent to do?\n\nPrimary elections are political party nominating events. So what happens to independent voters? Jeremy Gruber, senior vice president of Open Primaries Inc. said Tuesday that many of them get left out.\n\nGruber said closed Super Tuesday presidential primaries in four states — Alaska, California, Oklahoma and Utah — will deny 6.2 million no-party and other voters a chance to choose a candidate for the 2024 general election.\n\n\"While the Democratic parties in these states allow independent voters to participate in their primaries in these states, independents are not permitted to vote in the Republican primaries — which feature the only competitive national contest in 2024, between Trump and Haley,\" Gruber wrote.\n\nNow, 11 other states will allow independents a voice via a ballot.\n\nGruber points out that if, say, those voters were to break for Haley \"it could have some important lessons for how they might break in November.\" He said independents overwhelmingly backed Trump in 2016 before returning to Biden in even larger numbers four years ago.\n\n\"They are not a fixed voting block by any means,\" Gruber said. \"And it certainly doesn’t mean that a vote for Haley is necessarily a vote for Biden.\"\n\nHe said the \"real question\" on Super Tuesday and beyond is how both the Biden and Trump camps are going to woo independents in the next eight months.\n\n\"Because independents will be the margin of victory between the two candidates,\" he said. \"There are over 4 million independents in Florida alone. So far, neither candidate has seriously reached out to them.\"\n\nRather than courting them, however, Gruber is critical of Republicans he said \"are actively working to restrict independents voting in primaries in states like Tennessee, Texas and Alabama. They just lost a court case trying to close the primaries in Colorado.\"\n\nAnd Democrats?\n\nGruber said they are roadblocking candidates.\n\n\"Florida Democrats shut Dean Phillips and any other Democrats off the primary ballot,\" he said. \"The party has actively worked to keep other candidates from running at all. They’ve left independents (and their own voters) with no choices in the primary.\"\n\nGruber said all of this has left many independent voters frustrated, and left out.\n\n\"Independents don’t like this state of affairs. They're tired of the partisanship. They vote for candidates, not parties,\" he said. \"They are willing to become second-class citizens in many states as a way to protest our second-rate election system that gives power and authority to smaller and smaller bands of partisans at the expense of the people. Right now neither party has made a strong play for independents-they will be the real wild card this November.\"\n\n— Antonio Fins\n\nU.S. Sen. Rick Scott says Trump should stick to core beliefs\n\nU.S. Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, who met with former President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago on Monday evening, said the reason why Trump's ahead in the polls is because of Trump's core beliefs and his message to voters.\n\nScott thinks Trump is going to continue to talk about the core beliefs that won him the White House the first time, such as maintaining border security, economic issues and keeping the country out of international wars.\n\n\"I don't think anybody should want to run against him,\" Scott said. \"I think that he's gonna continue talking about the things that Americans care about. That's why he's where he is.\"\n\n— Stephany Matat\n\nMore:Rick Scott 'seriously considering' running for Senate leader, discusses it with Trump\n\nTrump poised to sweep 'Super Tuesday' but poll raises some warning signals\n\nFormer President Donald Trump is poised to sweep the \"Super Tuesday\" electoral contests but a poll issued Monday revealed some warning signs signaled by voters in those very states.\n\nThe survey of voters in the \"Super Tuesday\" states showed Trump trailing President Joe Biden by a narrow margin in which the incumbent is up 47% to 45% among those who said they intend to cast a vote, with a 1.7 percentage point margin of error.\n\nThe poll's scope is limited as it surveyed electorates in only the March 5 primaries that are taking place in mostly solid blue and red states, including California, Massachusetts, Alabama and Oklahoma. But they also include states that have been battlegrounds in recent elections, including Colorado, Maine and Virginia.\n\nFor the full story on the poll, go here.\n\nFact-checking campaign ads for you\n\nCampaign ads have flooded social media leading up to Super Tuesday as the remaining presidential candidates attempt to win over primary voters in 15 states and one territory.\n\nThese ads have spread widely — to more than a million screens in some cases — but many include false or misleading descriptions of past actions and policy proposals. Here’s a rundown of recent ads debunked by the USA TODAY Fact-Check Team:\n\nWhat states are in Super Tuesday?\n\nMore:Trump hails ruling on Colorado ballot, turns attention to Supreme Court immunity case\n\nWith 1,215 delegates needed to win the nomination, former President Donald Trump leads challenger Nikki Haley 273-43 for the GOP presidential nomination.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, Republicans will hold nominating contests in 15 states and Democrats in 15 states and one territory.\n\nThe states holding primary elections on Tuesday include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nOne territory, American Samoa, will also hold a primary election.\n\nIowa's Democratic Party will also release the results of its mail-in voting on March 5.\n\nWhy is it called Super Tuesday?\n\nSuper Tuesday is the primary election day that decides the bulk of delegates for candidates in their respective parties.\n\nThe name “Super Tuesday” historical has been used to reference primary days when a significant number of states hold their primary elections, according to the National Constitution Center.\n\nIn 1984, the modern \"Super Tuesday\" began when March became the month to “frontload” the primaries.\n\nFAU poll on immigration clashes with political narratives\n\nA poll by Florida Atlantic University and Mainstreet Research found some surprising viewpoints on the hot topic of immigration and border security in America.\n\nNamely, a majority of respondents in the poll released in February revealed they liked the immigrant living next door, but were split on foreigners' contributions to \"American culture.\" And while states like Florida and Texas are taking border enforcement measures into their own hands, the survey showed a citizenry not \"trusting\" state officials to act on immigration, and somewhat leery about federal authorities, too.\n\nThe results reveal more complex views at a time when immigration is surging as, arguably, the dominant topic of the 2024 presidential election. Last week, U.S. officials updated their tally of the number of unauthorized people who have entered the country under the Biden administration to 7.3 million, a figure greater than many U.S. states.\n\n— Stephany Matat\n\nPalm Beach County Democratic Party leader suspended\n\nAfter more than a year of divisive conflicts between Palm Beach County Democratic leaders and key volunteers, state party chief Nikki Fried has suspended Mindy Koch from her position as chair of the local party's ruling board.\n\nThe suspension marks the first time a state party leader has initiated the process for removing an elected county party chair from the helm. As of Monday afternoon, Fried wrote in a statement, Vice Chair Sean Rourk is in charge of the Palm Beach County party's governing board, the Democratic Executive Committee, pending the election of a new leader.\n\nState Democratic Party officials issued Koch a compliance notice in early February after the local party, under her leadership, failed to meet deadlines in 2023 for submitting important document, including campaign plans, a membership list, meeting minutes and a budget. The deadline for turning in the documents, and bring the party into compliance, was Sunday afternoon.\n\n— Stephany Matat\n\nWhy Trump criminal court calendar could see just one trial before election\n\nRather than splitting time between campaigning and appearing in federal court this coming week, Donald Trump will be celebrating his widely expected victories in the \"Super Tuesday\" Republican presidential nominating elections.\n\nInitially, it looked like Trump would be summoned to appear at the Elijah Barrett Prettyman Federal Courthouse in Washington, D.C., for the start of his trial on four felony counts rooted in what prosecutors allege was the 45th president's attempt to stay in power after losing the 2020 election.\n\nBut that trial has been delayed. For that matter, the legal proceedings related to two other sets of criminal charges against Trump, who has declared his innocence and railed at the cases he says are \"election interference,\" also are stalled.\n\nWhich raises the question: Will Trump's court challenges be resolved in 2024?

However, it did issue a warning about \"unity\" within the Republican Party.\n\n\"Today, in state after state, there remains a large block of Republican primary voters who are expressing deep concerns about Donald Trump. That is not the unity our party needs for success. \" said Haley national spokesperson Olivia Perez-Cubas. \"Addressing those voters’ concerns will make the Republican Party and America better.\"\n\nHaley is on track to lose all but one state, Vermont, on Super Tuesday. The string of losses, and Trump's mounting delegate lead, put serious question marks over Haley's path forward in the Republican primary.\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nDemocratic Rep. Adam Schiff and Republican Steve Garvey move forward in California Senate race\n\nRep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., and Republican former baseball star Steve Garvey are advancing in the pivotal California Senate race.\n\nThe election to fill the state's U.S. Senate seat vacated by the late Dianne Feinstein has been one of the most closely watched elections in the country.\n\nCalifornia is one of just a few states in the nation to hold what is commonly called a \"jungle\" primary, where registered voters, regardless of their political party affiliation, can cast their vote for whichever candidate they prefer. That’s why a Republican and a Democrat are moving forward to November’s general election in the state.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley and Kathryn Palmer\n\nIs Vermont an open primary?\n\nNikki Haley has defeated Donald Trump in one Super Tuesday state so far: Vermont.\n\nVermont does not have party registration, so registered voters can choose to vote in any party's (Republican, Democrat and Progressive) presidential primary election. However, voters cannot vote in more than one primary in each election cycle.\n\nWhile some votes are still being tallied in the Green Mountain State, Vermont's election guidelines meant that Democratic voters and anti-Trump Republicans could rally around Haley.\n\n− Megan Stewart and Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden wins California Democratic primary\n\nPresident Joe Biden took another step toward the Democratic nomination with a win out west in California’s Democratic primary.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar\n\nDonald Trump wins Alaska’s Republican caucuses\n\nWith almost 40% of the expected vote reported, Trump had a resounding lead over Haley.\n\nShe wasn’t winning more than one-quarter of the vote in any district, and in the 12 districts that reported at least 99% of their expected vote in that first release, she was doing no better than one-fifth of the vote.\n\n– Associated Press\n\nTexas Rep.

Williamson’s campaign focused on forgiving student debt and confronting the climate crisis.\n\nThe “Peace Alliance” founder rejoined the race on Wednesday after she announced plans to suspend her campaign last month. Williamson said she rethought her decision after questioning Biden’s ability to beat Trump in the general election calling the former president a “fascist standing at the door.”\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nJoe Biden racks up Vermont’s delegates\n\nJoe Biden won Vermont’s primary on Tuesday night defeating his Democratic challengers including Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nDemocrats revamp their campaign strategy to take on Trump\n\nDemocrats are preparing to face off against Donald Trump this fall, even as Nikki Haley remains in the race.\n\nIn Michigan, the Democratic Party was shocked by Trump’s narrow 11,000-vote win in 2016. They pledged not to let it happen again and revamped their campaign strategy to engage voters year-round.\n\nThey have swept the last three elections, including flipping the state for Biden in 2020. But it remains to be seen whether the strategy will work again this fall: Trump is ahead in recent state polls.\n\n− Riley Beggin\n\nJoe Biden declared victory in Virginia primary\n\nJoe Biden has won the Democratic primary in Virginia, racking up delegates in the state that borders the nation’s capital.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHow many delegates does Joe Biden have?\n\nJoe Biden heads into Super Tuesday as the clear frontrunner in the Democratic presidential primary.\n\nBiden has 206 delegates headed into Super Tuesday, with a whopping 1,420 Democratic delegates up for grabs across tonight's elections. He also officially won Iowa's Democratic Caucuses on Thursday.\n\nBiden needs to secure 1,968 delegates to win the Democratic nomination.\n\n− Cy Neff\n\nAlabama voters head to the polls two weeks after IVF ruling\n\nAs Alabama voters head to the polls, the repercussions of the state's Supreme Court decision are reverberating across the country. Two weeks ago, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos used in in vitro fertilization are considered children and are entitled to protections under the state’s wrongful death laws.\n\nThe blowback was immediate: The decision kicked off a frenzy among patients and doctors grappling with its implications for people attempting to conceive, often after years of struggling to have children or other complications in family planning. Democrats immediately began messaging on the ruling as further evidence of a GOP-led effort to restrict reproductive rights.\n\nThe Senate Republican campaign arm urged Senate candidates to \"clearly and concisely reject efforts by the government\" to restrict IVF. Candidates followed suit, as did most Republican lawmakers in Congress.\n\nBut when Democrats in the Senate put them to the test by asking them to greenlight a bill that would protect IVF at the federal level, many Republican senators said it’s an issue best left up to the states.− Riley Beggin\n\nJoe Biden wins Iowa's Democratic Caucus\n\nJoe Biden won Iowa's Democratic caucus, clinching a quick victory to kick off Super Tuesday's results.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nChris Christie, Ryan Binkley, Asa Hutchinson: Which candidates have dropped out of the 2024 race?\n\nOn the Republican side, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have dropped out of the presidential election.\n\nDonald Trump and Nikki Haley are still competing against each other for the Republican nomination\n\nOn the Democratic side, President Joe Biden, Rep.

But she has repeatedly denied that she wants to run for national office.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen do polls close on Super Tuesday?\n\nHere's a look at when polls will close states across the country holding elections on Super Tuesday. Some areas may close polls earlier or later than these times, so check with your local election officials before casting your ballot.\n\nAlabama: 7 p.m. CST\n\nAlaska: 8 p.m. AKST\n\nArkansas: 7:30 p.m. CST\n\nCalifornia 8 p.m. PST\n\nColorado: 7 p.m. MST\n\nIowa (No live voting.

As for voters who submitted their ballots by mail, roughly 19,000 ballots have been counted across North Carolina.\n\nWhile 49,000 mail-in ballots were requested, Bell said the actual number of submitted mail-in ballots can change if voters decide to vote in person on election day.\n\n— Molly Wilhelm, Phillip M. Bailey\n\nSuper Tuesday critique: Donald Trump attacks Fox commentators ahead of election night\n\nTrump took some time off from Super Tuesday preparation to criticize a pair of Fox News commentators.\n\nHard to say what exactly set off Trump, but he claimed on his Truth Social platform that Marc Thiessen \"was wrong about me in 2016, and in 2020 I got more votes than any sitting President in history.\"\n\nTrump, who otherwise used Truth Social to endorse other Republican candidates running on Super Tuesday, also looped former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove into his media critique.\n\n\"Put on people who understand what is going on in politics,\" Trump said. \"And while you’re at it, GET RID OF KARL ROVE!!!\"\n\n− David Jackson\n\nFact checking campaign ads for you\n\nCampaign ads have flooded social media leading up to Super Tuesday as the remaining presidential candidates attempt to win over primary voters in 15 states and one territory.\n\nThese ads have spread widely – to more than a million screens in some cases – but many include false or misleading descriptions of past actions and policy proposals. Here’s a rundown of recent ads debunked by the USA TODAY Fact-Check Team:\n\n– Eric Litke\n\nWhen will Super Tuesday results come in?\n\nIt depends on the state. Most polls are closing by 8 p.m. local time, but states across time zones are holding elections on Tuesday, from Maine to Alaska and California.\n\nCheck back here as the USA TODAY Network keeps you updated on races across the country.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHow many delegates are up for grabs on Super Tuesday?\n\nThere are 865 Republican delegates up for grabs on Super Tuesday and 1,420 Democratic delegates.\n\nThe Trump campaign suggested in a memo last month that the former president will likely lock in the nomination on March 12, just one week after Super Tuesday, with 1,223 delegates. In a worst case scenario, the campaign estimates he will become the designated nominee no later than March 19.\n\nA candidate must secure the majority of delegates, 1,215, to secure the Republican nomination.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWill new election laws impact the outcome in North Carolina's primary?\n\nA trove of new election laws – including a ban on ballot drop boxes, new limits for mail-in ballot returns and required proof of voter ID at polls – will be tested in North Carolina on Super Tuesday.\n\nThe key swing state’s legislature was one of 14 states that passed additional restrictions last year. Some experts and advocates fear the laws could impact turnout on Super Tuesday, a test for the November general election.\n\n– Savannah Kuchar and Chris Kenning\n\nHow many states vote on Super Tuesday?\n\nThe states holding primary elections on March 5 include: Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nOne territory, American Samoa, will also hold a primary election.\n\nIowa's Democratic Party will also release the results of its mail-in voting on Super Tuesday.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nCalifornia Senate race: Barbara Lee, Adam Schiff and other Democrats compete\n\nTuesday will also determine which two candidates in the heated California Senate race will advance to the general election. California has a top-two primary system, meaning the two candidates who receive the most votes, regardless of party affiliation, will land on the ballot in November.\n\nWhile Californians will choose from 27 candidates on Tuesday, the likely frontrunners are among three Democrats – California Reps. Adam Schiff, Katie Porter and Barbara Lee – and one Republican, Steve Garvey, a former baseball player for the Los Angeles Dodgers. The candidates are running to fill the seat vacated by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who died last year.\n\nPolling from the Institute of Governmental Studies at the University of California, Berkeley, last week found Garvey in a two-point lead over Schiff coming in at 27%. Schiff polled at 25% followed by Porter and Lee.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat is a caucus?\n\nSome states hold primaries, while others opt for a caucus. While a primary election is run by state and local governments, a caucus is run by political parties. A traditional primary election resembles the general election, with voting taking place via private ballot.\n\nA caucus, however, involves voters dividing themselves into groups based on the candidate they prefer, and arguing for others to join them. At the end of the caucus, the number of members in each group determines how many delegates that candidate gets.\n\nUp for grabs in each caucus and primary is a certain number of delegates. The delegates are sent to each party's national convention, and the candidate with the majority secures the nomination.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nJoe Biden competes in Super Tuesday ahead of the State of the Union\n\nJoe Biden is competing in more than a dozen Super Tuesday states before he delivers his 2024 State of the Union address to lawmakers and Americans across the country on Thursday.\n\nThe president is expected to address the issues dividing the nation, ranging from inflation to abortion rights and the U.S. southern border. You can read more about the history of the presidential address here.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAlabama voters were sent wrong information ahead of election\n\nA representative from the Montgomery County Board of Registrars confirmed Tuesday that a portion of Montgomery voters got the wrong voting information ahead of the election.\n\nRegistrar Mark Anderson said on Super Tuesday that a mapping issue led to voters in the 2nd Congressional District being told that they were in a different district.\n\nThe Southern Poverty Law Center reported that at least 5,604 voters received information that they were in the 7th Congressional District, instead of the newly established, majority-Black 2nd District. Of the 5,604 voters, 4,513 of them are Black, SPLC reported.\n\nThe SPLC became aware of the issue over the weekend. Some Montgomery County voters received postcards with the incorrect congressional district.\n\n– Alex Gladden\n\nTrump says he’s not worried about raising money for legal cases\n\nIn addition to running a presidential campaign, Trump is spending his recent days trying to figure out how to pay more than $500 million in civil damages for bank fraud and defamation.\n\nIn his Super Tuesday interview on Fox News, Trump said he will be able to raise the money - but he didn’t say how.\n\n“I don’t worry about anything,” Trump said. “No, I don't worry about the money. I don't worry about money.”\n\n-David Jackson\n\nWhat states did Trump, Biden win on previous Super Tuesdays?\n\nIn the 2020 presidential election, 14 states held primaries on Super Tuesday.\n\nTrump, the incumbent nominee running for his second term, carried all 13 of the Super Tuesday states (Virginia cancelled its GOP primary). Biden won by slightly smaller margins, winning delegates in 11 states with four going to then-candidate Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nWhen Trump launched his first presidential campaign in 2016, 11 states held primaries on Super Tuesday. The former president competed in a crowded field of Republicans but ultimately won in seven of the eleven states. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas was declared the winner in three states and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio won one state.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWill Nikki Haley suspend her campaign?\n\nThe former South Carolina governor has repeatedly said she has no plans to drop out of the 2024 race for the White House. But Tuesday has the potential to deliver one of the heaviest blows to her campaign, and speculation has grown about her next steps.\n\nWould she join the long list of Republicans who have dropped out of the race and backed Trump as nominee? Or will Haley, seen by many as a moderate alternative to a Biden-Trump rematch, launch a third-party run?\n\nHaley continued to dodge the first question, defiantly telling Fox News Monday afternoon that they should ask Trump whether he would support another Republican nominee instead.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nWhat will Donald Trump do after Super Tuesday?\n\nSince announcing his campaign in 2022, the former president has looked like a shoo-in for the Republican presidential nomination.\n\nAnd while Super Tuesday can’t clinch the spot for him – a nominee needs 1,215 delegates, and Trump will still be a handful short even if he sweeps the country – Tuesday could very well boost him closer to the finish line.\n\nBut despite his popularity with his conservative base, Trump would also likely need to tap into support from moderates and independents in a general election. Trump appeared to be starting that shift after his first primary election victory in January’s Iowa Caucuses.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar\n\nFacebook down on Super Tuesday\n\nFacebook users may have encountered the social media site not working properly on the morning of Super Tuesday.\n\nAround 9 a.m. ET, hundreds of thousands of users reported Facebook being down during one of the biggest election days of the year, according to Downdetector.\n\nMany users were reporting being logged out of Facebook accounts with no ability to log back in. It's unclear when Facebook will be back online for some users as polls begin opening for primary voters.\n\n-- Jonathan Limehouse\n\nStein: ‘Grab your photo ID’ North Carolina\n\nNorth Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein had some sage advice for voters flocking to the polls on Tuesday: bring a photo ID card.\n\nThat’s because the swing state has a litany of new laws that will be tested for the first time on Super Tuesday as Tar Heel State voters make a choice in one of the most closely watched gubernatorial contests this year.\n\nAmong them is a 2018 voter identification law that had been delayed by lawsuits. Another rule change also required mail-in ballots to include a copy of the voter’s photo ID.\n\nIn 2023, Republican state legislators went further by establishing a rule that any mail-in ballot received after the election wouldn’t be counted which Democratic opponents slammed because it kills the previous three-day grace period that allowed ballots to be counted as long as they were postmarked by Election Day.\n\nVoting rights groups have warned such laws will be hard to navigate for some, and they are keeping an eye out for trouble.\n\nStein, who is favored to win the Democratic nomination for governor, has spoken against the new laws and resisted them in his capacity as attorney general. He is likely to face Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who has spoken in favor of such laws as needed to protect election integrity.\n\n— Phillip M. Bailey\n\nWhat to watch in North Carolina’s governor’s race\n\nNorth Carolina will serve as the battleground for a marquee gubernatorial race: a likely faceoff between a Southern Democrat and a GOP candidate who is popular with Donald Trump's base.\n\nAs millions are flocking to the polls for Super Tuesday, primary voters in North Carolina have a sharp contrast in the two party's leading contenders to fill Cooper's seat: Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein and Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson.\n\nOnce a reliable Republican stronghold − long associated with the southern fried conservatism of the late Sen. Jesse Helms − the Tar Heel State has become more competitive largely because of diverse population growth.\n\n- Savannah Kuchar and Phillip M. Bailey\n\nNorth Carolina primary to set the stage for 2024 battleground\n\nPresidential candidates have been focusing their attention on North Carolina in the leadup to Super Tuesday, setting the groundwork for what analysts expect will be a hyper-competitive general election matchup.\n\nNorth Carolina hasn’t voted for a Democratic president since Barack Obama flipped the state in 2008. But it represented Donald Trump’s narrowest margin of victory in the 2020 election when he won it by just 1.34 percentage points over Joe Biden.\n\nBiden’s campaign is already setting its sights on an expected rematch, earlier this year installing a team of campaign staffers on the ground and committing Biden and other surrogates to appearing in the state.\n\nDemocrats dispatched Vice President Kamala Harris to Durham ahead of Super Tuesday to announce a $32 million investment from the American Rescue Plan Act, and Biden was in the state in January announcing a major investment in broadband internet infrastructure.\n\nOn the Republican side, Trump campaigned in Greensboro March 2 while his primary competitor Nikki Haley rallied supporters in Charlotte and Raleigh.\n\nPolling places are open in North Carolina until 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time.\n\n—Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nWhy is today called Super Tuesday?\n\nSuper Tuesday is the primary election day that decides the bulk of delegates for candidates in their respective parties.\n\nThe name “Super Tuesday” historical has been used to reference primary days when a significant number of states hold their primary elections, according to the National Constitution Center.\n\nIn 1984, the modern \"Super Tuesday\" began when March became the month to “frontload” the primaries.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nDonald Trump to hold rally Saturday in Georgia\n\nThe Trump campaign is starting to outline its post-Super Tuesday schedule, and it includes a weekend rally in a politically and legally significant state: Georgia.\n\nThe Saturday event takes place in Rome, Ga.\n\nTrump held a similar rally in nearby Dalton, Ga., on Jan. 4, 2021 - two days before the attempted insurrection by Trump supporters that tried to block Congress' certification of the Electoral College vote that elected Biden.\n\nUsing that rally in part to protest the 2020 election, Trump basically urged Vice President Mike Pence and other Republicans to toss Biden electoral votes and re-elect him instead.\n\n\"People will remember the people who don’t support us,\" Trump said on that occasion.\n\nTrump now faces criminal trials in Georgia and in Washington, D.C., over efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nIowa Poll: Trump dominates Biden in 2024 lead-up\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump would nearly double his margin of victory in Iowa over incumbent Democratic President Joe Biden if a rematch of their 2020 contest were held now, a new Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa Poll shows.\n\nIn an early test of the expected matchup, Trump leads Biden by 15 percentage points among likely voters, 48% to 33%. Another 15% of poll respondents would vote for “someone else,” 1% would not vote and 2% are not sure.\n\nIn 2020, Trump defeated Biden in Iowa by about 8 percentage points.\n\n- Brianne Pfannenstiel\n\nWhat states are involved on Super Tuesday?\n\nThe states holding primary elections on Tuesday include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nOne territory, American Samoa, will also hold a primary election.\n\nIowa's Democratic Party will also release the results of its mail-in voting on March 5.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nTrump calls for Republican unity - while blasting Haley\n\nTrump began his Super Tuesday with a phone interview on Fox News and predicted Republican unity in the fall election - though he had few good things to say about Haley and her supporters.\n\n\"There's no path for her to win,\" Trump said on \"Fox & Friends,\" adding that her continuing candidacy is only \"hurting the Republican Party.\"\n\nStill, Trump said that \"our party has to come together because we have to beat the Democrats.\"\n\nAccording to exit polls, many Haley supporters say they will not back Trump in the general election; that could create a drag that will undercut Trump's chances of defeating Biden.\n\n--David Jackson\n\nTaylor Swift encourages fans to vote on Super Tuesday\n\nTaylor Swift encouraged fans to vote on Super Tuesday but did not make a presidential endorsement.\n\n\"Today, March 5, is the Presidential Primary in Tennessee and 16 other states and territories,\" Swift wrote in her Instagram story. \"I wanted to remind you guys to vote the people who most represent YOU into power. If you haven't already, make a plan to vote today.\"\n\n\"Whether you're in Tennessee or somewhere else in the US,\" Swift continued, \"check your polling places and times at vote.org.\"\n\n- Bryan West\n\nDo Democrats vote on Super Tuesday?\n\nYes – Democrats also vote on Super Tuesday.\n\nThe Democratic primary is not as consequential as the Republican primary because President Joe Biden is the incumbent candidate running for his second term and the likely Democratic nominee for the party in a much less contentious race for the nomination.\n\nWhile Biden does face two Democratic challengers – Dean Phillips and Marianne WIlliamson – both have yet to receive any delegates during state primaries held previously. Biden has 206 delegates prior to Super Tuesday polls closing.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhat races are at stake on Super Tuesday – other than the presidential election?\n\nIt’s not just the presidential primaries that matter on Super Tuesday. Other competitive election are slated to happen in the states voting on March 5.\n\nCalifornia, for instance, is seeing a fierce intra-party primary battle between three major Democrats for a solidly blue open Senate seat in the liberal state. California voters will also consider a ballot measure known as Proposition 1, which would address the state's mental health system and homelessness crisis.\n\nNorth Carolinians will also vote in a gubernatorial primary on Tuesday, setting up what's expected to be a high-pressure race in the fall. North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein has emerged as the Democratic frontrunner, while North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is expected to lead Republicans.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCandidates need to reach 1,968 delegates to win the Democratic nomination.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, 1,420 delegates are up for grabs, nearly three quarters of the delegates needed to become the party nominee.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nWhich Super Tuesday states have open primaries?\n\nMost primaries fall into one of five categories: closed, partially closed, open to unaffiliated voters, partially open and open, according to the National Conference on State Legislatures. The critical distinction among the categories is whether voters who are not registered party members can participate in a party’s primary.\n\nOpen primaries allow voters to choose which party’s ballot to vote without having to disclose or register with that respective party. This gives voters the opportunity to vote across party lines. Six Super Tuesday states will hold open primaries: Alabama, Arkansas, Minnesota, Texas, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nFive other states - Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, North Carolina and Tennessee – will be open to unaffiliated voters on Super Tuesday, meaning voters who are not registered to a specific party can participate in a party’s primary of their choosing.\n\n- Kathryn Palmer and Rachel Looker", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/02/24/south-carolina-republican-primary-live-updates-haley-trump/72675865007/", "title": "Trump wins 2024 South Carolina Republican presidential primary", "text": "COLUMBIA, S.C. - Former President Donald Trump rolled to victory Saturday in the South Carolina Republican primary, easily defeating former Gov. Nikki Haley in her home state and moving ever close to the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.\n\nThe Associated Press and television networks called the race for Trump shortly after the South Carolina polls closed at 7 p.m.\n\nTrump, who also won convention delegate contests in Iowa and New Hampshire, is on track to win the nomination, despite the prospect of up to four criminal trials in the months ahead.\n\nWinning the South Carolina primary is a particularly good sign for Trump. Most of the Republicans who have won the Palmetto State's primary have gone on to win the party's nomination, a list that includes Ronald Reagan, George W.

In a speech after the results, she said she is staying in the fight.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe next primary is Tuesday in Michigan.\n\nTrump quickly declares victory, claims Republicans are united\n\nTrump raced to his watch party podium shortly after the polls closed to accept victory in South Carolina.\n\n\"An even bigger win than we anticipated,\" Trump said, though the final numbers won't be clear until later in the evening.\n\n\"This is a fantastic evening,\" he added. \"It's an early evening.\"\n\nTrump talked mostly about his agenda, citing immigration in particular - but he did not mention Haley by name.\n\nInstead, he said \"I have never seen the Republican Party so unified.\"\n\nHe also told his supporters to prepare for future primaries, starting with Michigan on Tuesday.\n\nSince the night of the New Hampshire primary, Trump has complained about how quickly Haley came out to tout her performance in that state.\n\n--David Jackson\n\nHaley vows to stay in the race\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley pledged to stay in the race, saying she worried that former President Donald Trump could not beat President Joe Biden.\n\n\"America will come apart if we make the wrong choices.

I'm not giving up this fight.\"\n\nLindsey Graham gets booed at Trump victory party\n\nSome Trump backers in South Carolina still don't like Sen. Lindsey Graham - even when he speaks at a Trump victory party.\n\nMany booed Graham after Trump called the veteran senator to the podium.\n\nTrump joked about Graham's problems with some conservatives, saying he was \"further left\" than some other Republicans; but he added that \"I love him; he's a good man.\")\n\nGraham ignored his negative reception, telling the Trump crowd that \"South Carolina created the biggest political comeback in American history.\"\n\nA fierce critic of Trump during the 2016 primaries, Graham became one of his staunchest defenders during his presidency - but many Trump fans have not forgotten.\n\n--David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley to address supporters Saturday night\n\nOver at the Haley election night party in downtown Charleston, supporters of the former South Carolina governor, waved signs in support of the candidate in a half-empty ballroom as Trump was projected onto a large screen.\n\nThe campaign was airing CNN - on mute - as Trump delivered his victory speech. Instead, it played through Haley's rally playlist as he spoke. Haley's event was just beginning when the race was called for Trump at 7pm EDT. The candidate was not due to speak until 8pm.\n\n— Francesca Chambers\n\nTrump's South Carolina surrogates predict a big night\n\nDonald Trump's Palmetto State surrogates aren't exactly declaring victory - but they are getting close to doing so.\n\nProminent South Carolina supporters such as Sen. Lindsey Graham and Gov. Henry McMaster are circulating among reporters at the increasingly loud Trump watch party, saying things like exit polls are looking very good for their candidate.\n\nSouth Carolina officials were reluctant to criticize Haley, but said it will soon be time for the Republican Party - including their former governor - to get behind Trump.\n\nAs a crowd of Trump backers gathered in an exhibition building at the South Carolina fairgrounds, McMaster reminded a gaggle of reporters that the Republican who wins South Carolina usually wins the Republican nomination.\n\n\"The South Carolina primary is historical,\" McMaster said.\n\n--David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley blasts Trump for backing daughter-in-law as RNC chair\n\nHaley criticized Trump on Saturday for endorsing his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, to co-lead the Republican National Committee, citing comments she has made in support of using party funds to pay of the ex-presidents mounting legal bills.\n\nWhen asked about who she would nominate to run the RNC if current chair Ronna McDaniel’s steps down, as anticipated, Haley remarked “It wouldn’t be a family member of a candidate.”\n\nHer comments come after Lara Trump earlier this week insinuated that the RNC should use its money to help pay for her fathers-in-law's legal bills. The ex-president is four separate trials pertaining to his efforts to overturn his election loss and has more than a half-a-billion dollars in civil judgements against him.\n\n“I would hope that the people in the RNC know that they have a responsibility – a responsibility to put in people in the RNC who are going to look out for the best interests of all of the Republican Party, not just one person,” Haley added.\n\n--Karissa Waddick\n\nTrump at CPAC: 'Success will be our revenge'\n\nA year after calling for \"retribution\" against political opponents, former President Donald Trump told the same conservative group he now wants a new form of \"revenge.\"\n\n\"Success will be our revenge,\" Trump said in delivering a version of his stump speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference near Washington, D.C.\n\nIt was at CPAC last year that Trump told delegates \"I am your retribution\" against various opponents.\n\nIn this CPAC speech, Trump also described himself as a \"proud political dissident,\" as he protested the 91 indictments and four criminal cases pending against him.\n\nEarlier this week, Trump compared himself to real Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, the opposition leader who died this month in a Russian prison.\n\nThat comparison drew ridicule from Haley, who is opposing Trump in today's South Carolina primary.\n\n\"It's all about him,\" Haley told Fox News on Wednesday. \"It’s been the problem with Donald Trump. He is obsessed with himself.\"\n\n--David Jackson\n\nAll eyes on South Carolina, but Nikki Haley to stick around at least through Super Tuesday\n\nResults out of South Carolina's Republican primary today hold high stakes for former U.N. ambassador and South Carolinian Nikki Haley, but regardless of results she has pledged to stick around for at least another 10 days.\n\nHaley has pledged to stay in the race through Super Tuesday, March 5, when an avalanche of delegates will be awarded from voting across 15 states and the territory of American Samoa. Along with acting as a litmus test for Haley’s ability to round up support in her home state, South Carolina’s primary will set the stage going into Super Tuesday and provide a burst of momentum to the winning campaign. The states holding primary elections on March 5 include Alabama, Alaska, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.\n\nAfter South Carolina Feb. 24, Michigan’s primary is up next Feb. 27, before Super Tuesday the following week.\n\nFormer president Donald Trump is expected to grab the GOP nomination once again this year, after amassing big wins in previous primaries and caucuses in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.\n\n-- Kathryn Palmer\n\nTrump says Black voters relate to criminal prosecutions\n\nFormer president Donald Trump compared his legal battles to the injustices Black Americans face in the legal system at an event sponsored by the Black Conservative Federation Friday.\n\nAt the event, Trump suggested − inaccurately − that he is popular with African American voters. He said his 91 criminal indictments and mug shot were part of the reason.\n\n\"A lot of people said that’s why the Black people like me, because they have been hurt so badly and discriminated against, and they actually viewed me as I’m being discriminated against,\" he told the crowd, of which about two-thirds were Black Americans and one third were white people.\n\nHaley blasted Trump for his comments on primary day, calling them “disgusting.”\n\n“That's what happens when he goes off the teleprompter,” she told reporters after casting her vote in the primary. “That’s the chaos that comes with Donald Trump.”\n\n− David Jackson\n\nHow much support from Black voters does Trump have?\n\nTrump suggested at an event sponsored by the Black Conservative Federation Friday that he is popular with Black voters.\n\nBut a USA TODAY Suffolk poll published on Jan. 1 showed Trump with the support of only a small sliver of Black voters - 12%.\n\nHis support among Black Americans has not increased substantially from his margins the 2020 election. In the modern presidential election era, Black voters have overwhelmingly supported Democratic candidates. In 2020, 87% of Black voters supported Biden, according to the Roper center.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump's VP shortlist: GOP hopefuls audition for number two spot\n\nThough Trump hasn’t yet won the Republican nomination, that hasn’t stopped political observers and his fiercest supporters from guessing who the former president could choose as his running mate.\n\nTrump told Fox News last month that he’s not in a rush to choose someone and that his decision won’t have “any impact at all” in the 2024 election. But some Republicans have appeared to be jockeying for the spot.\n\nAt the 2024 CPAC conference, potential vice president picks including Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and Arizona Senate race candidate Kari Lake each took turns praising the former president.\n\nSen. Tim Scott, who has also been floated as a potential pick, has vigorously campaigned for the former president despite Haley appointing him to the Senate in 2012 when she was governor of South Carolina.\n\nTrump called Scott the “greatest surrogate” he’s ever seen at a rally in South Carolina Friday.\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nTrump supporter at CPAC: Pardon Jan. 6 rioters\n\nA prominent supporter of Trump warmed up the crowd at the Conservative Political Action Conference by calling for clemency for the rioters of Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\"The next honest president should provide pardons and commutations for the January 6’ers,\" said Tom Fitton, president of the conservative group Judicial Watch.\n\nThe attack was an unsuccessful attempt to stop the electoral vote count that elected President Joe Biden.\n\nCPAC delegates cheered Fitton's call. Trump has discussed the possibility of pardons for J6 rioters.\n\n-David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley speaks after voting\n\nOutside her polling place on Kiawah Island, S.C. Haley told reporters she was laser focused on turning out the vote in South Carolina and Michigan, which holds its primary on Feb. 27 and making it through a weeklong push leading into Super Tuesday.\n\n\"That's as far as I've thought, in terms of going forward. We've placed ad buys, we've gone and put out the public schedule of where we're going to be, and so we're going to keep on going,\" Haley said.\n\n− Francesca Chambers\n\nWhat did Trump say about Nikki Haley's husband?\n\nThe primary comes two weeks after Trump's extraordinary attack on Haley's husband Michael.\n\nDuring a rally in Conway, S.C., Trump mocked Michael Haley's absence from the campaign trail− never mind that he is a service member who is deployed overseas.\n\n\"Where’s your husband?\" Trump said at one point. \"Oh, he’s away ... He’s away ... What happened to her husband? What happened to her husband?! Where is he?! ... He’s gone! He knew! He knew!\"\n\nIn the days since, Haley has described Trump's comments as \"disgusting,\" and an attack on all military personnel.\n\nWhile South Carolina is very much a pro-military state, the Trump attack seems to have had little impact; he still holds big leads in pre-primary polls.\n\nThe same day that Trump mocked him, Michael Haley himself weighed in with a social media post. It contained a meme that read: “The difference between humans and animals? Animals would never allow the dumbest ones to lead the pack.”\n\n− David Jackson\n\nNikki Haley votes in her home polling place on Kiawah Island, S.C.\n\nFor Haley this primary contest is deeply personal. It was the state she once governed and the one she calls home.\n\nAccompanied by her mother and surrounded by family members, Haley arrived at her polling place on Kiawah Island, S.C. Haley addressed reporters outside after casting her vote and said she was blessed to be surrounded by family and to \"have this moment.\"\n\nHaley is first woman of color to be a major candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. Watching her mother, who was born in India, cast a ballot for her daughter for President of the United States, \"tells us everything we need to know about how blessed we are to be in this country,\" Haley said.\n\nFor the last four weeks, Haley has been trying to fire up her supporters and turn out general election voters who don't typically vote in GOP primaries. Haley has committed to staying in the race regardless of Saturday's outcome, but it will be a lot harder if she loses.\n\n− Francesca Chambers and Megan Smith\n\nPart of Nikki Haley's plan for the South Carolina Republican primary: Democrats\n\nAs she tries to come back against Trump, Haley is urging South Carolina Democrats and independents to turn out for her in Saturday's primary.\n\n\"This is an open primary,\" Haley told Fox News this week. \"Basically it means anybody can vote in a primary as long as you didn't vote in the Democrat primary on February 3rd in South Carolina.\"\n\nTrump has mocked the notion, saying Democrats shouldn't be allowed in Republican primaries, especially in a conservative state like South Carolina.\n\nDemocratic leaders have also discouraged party members from helping Haley.\n\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison, a South Carolinian, told reporters this month that Haley did nothing for Democrats during her years as governor.\n\nSaid Harrison to Haley: “You didn’t do anything for us, so we aren’t gonna bail you out.\"\n\nBut as of Saturday, some voters might not be listening to the Democratic Party's marching orders.\n\nHannah James, 18, of Travelers Rest, at the City Hall precinct, said she was a left-leaning Democrat who voted for Haley.\n\n\"I decided that if it came down to having a Republican president, I'd rather have Haley over Trump,\" James said.\n\n− David Jackson and Terry Benjamin\n\nDonald Trump Jr. - and senior - go after Mitch McConnell in South Carolina\n\nTrump and his surrogates − including Donald Trump, Jr. − have spent most of the South Carolina campaign talking about issues beyond the primary, including their dispute with Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nDuring an appearance in North Charleston, S.C., the younger Trump mocked McConnell's health issues, describing the Trump antagonist as \"Mitch the Glitch,\" and referring to his near-catatonic episodes.\n\n\"Can we find someone who doesn't freeze up?\" Trump Jr. said. \"It's like Windows 92. Buffering, buffering, buffering.\"\n\nHis attack followed a comment Donald Trump Sr. made this week about his compatibility with McConnell.\n\n\"I don’t know that I can work with him,” Trump said Tuesday during a Fox News town hall.\n\nMcConnell, meanwhile, has said little about Trump's re-emergence as the party's presidential nominee.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nWill voters choose Nikki Haley or Donald Trump?\n\nJorge Lara, 43, of Greer, S.C. was one of the first people in line to vote at 7:30 a.m. at Riverside High School and chose Haley as his candidate.\n\nLara, who originally grew up in Cuba, said it was his first time voting in any primary and will vote against Trump. He believes \"our democracy may be in danger.\"\n\n\"I come from a country where it was a dictatorship,\" Lara said. \"I see Trump's leanings and cozying up to dictatorships and kind of accepting the Russian behavior, betraying our allies. This is very important for me. Today's not so much about a vote for Nikki Haley, or for any particular politician, it is a vote against Trump.\"\n\nKlay Peterson, 72, of Roebuck, S.C. said he was voting for Trump because of his handling of the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"The border is number one. Having been in law enforcement for over 40 years, I’m concerned with safety and crime in our country,\" Peterson said. \"We don’t know what their intentions are and I’m worried we’ll have to pay that price.\"\n\n− Terry Benjamin and Joanna Johnson, Greenville News\n\nThe stakes for Haley in South Carolina: Survival\n\nUnless the polls in South Carolina are very wrong, Trump will defeat Haley in her home state − a very unusual occurrence for candidates that make it to the top of the ticket.\n\nIn all but one primary since 1980, the Republican winner in South Carolina has gone on to be the party’s nominee.\n\nBack in 2016, as Republican candidates chased the front-running Trump, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich both won their home state primaries.\n\nFlorida Sen. Marco Rubio, however, lost his home state primary to Trump, and quickly withdrew from the race.\n\nHaley, the former governor of South Carolina, says she is staying in the race regardless of what happens Saturday - but it will be a lot harder if she loses.\n\n− David Jackson and AP\n\nTrump returns to CPAC a year after threatening 'retribution'\n\nAlthough it's primary day in South Carolina, Donald Trump travels to the Washington, D.C., area on Saturday for a reprise of one of his most infamous speeches.\n\nIt was at the Conservative Political Action Conference last year that Trump vowed \"retribution\" against his political opponents, and urged his voters to join him.\n\n“In 2016, I declared, ‘I am your voice,\" Trump told CPAC delegates a year ago. \"Today, I add: I am your warrior. I am your justice. And for those who have been wronged and betrayed, I am your retribution.”\n\nThis year's CPAC speech is scheduled for the early afternoon at National Harbor, Md.\n\nTrump then heads to Columbia, S.C., for a primary watch party on Saturday night.\n\n− David Jackson\n\nWhen do polls close in South Carolina?\n\nPolls for South Carolina’s Republican presidential primary will close at 7 p.m. ET.\n\nThe state also allowed early voting for the election. Registered voters were eligible to submit an early ballot by Thursday, Feb. 22. Absentee ballots must have been submitted and received by the county voter registration office by Feb. 3.\n\nThe state has an open primary, which allows registered voters of any party – Republicans, Democrats or independents – to participate in the Republican contest. Anyone who participated in the state’s Democratic presidential primary, however, are barred from also voting in the GOP election.\n\n− Karissa Waddick\n\nIs Joe Biden competing in South Carolina?\n\nPresident Joe Biden competed in the South Carolina Democratic primary, which took place on Saturday, Feb. 3. Biden won with roughly 92% of the vote in a landslide victory over his longshot challengers, self-help author Marianne Williamson and House Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn. Williamson and Phillips each received about 2% support.\n\nThe next major Democratic primary takes place in Michigan on Tuesday, Feb. 27. It is on the same day as the Michigan Republican primary.\n\n− Karissa Waddick\n\nWhere do Nikki Haley, Donald Trump stand in Republican polls?\n\nTrump has notched victories in every major nominating contest so far and is leading in most state and national polls. A RealClearPolitics average of South Carolina polls shows the former president ahead of Haley in the state 62% - 37%, a margin of roughly 25 points.\n\nHaley has said that she needs to perform better in her home state than she did in New Hampshire, where she garnered 43% of the vote.\n\n\"I don’t think it necessarily has to be a win, but it certainly has to be better than what I did in New Hampshire, and it certainly has to be close,\" Haley said of her South Carolina prospects during an interview with NBC.\n\nHaley has pledged to remain in the GOP primary race until March 5, the date known as Super Tuesday when voters in more than a dozen states head to the polls.\n\n− Karissa Waddick", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/13/donald-trump-hawaii-republican-presidential-caucuses/72947852007/", "title": "Hawaii Republican presidential caucuses: Trump emerges victorious", "text": "KAILUA, Hawaii — Former President Donald Trump emerged victorious in Hawaii's Republican presidential caucuses, further cementing his path to reelection after securing the presumptive GOP nomination late Tuesday.\n\nWith 98% of precincts reporting, Trump leads all other candidates with 97% of the vote.

Tracking ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − Former President Donald Trump is within arm's reach of clinching the Republican Party's 2024 nomination, and Tuesday's primaries may push him over the delegate threshold needed to become the GOP nominee.\n\nAfter landslide victories on Super Tuesday and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley's exit from the race, Trump's path to the nomination looks even clearer. The former president needs 140 more delegates to become the GOP's presumptive pick.\n\nAnd President Joe Biden isn't far behind him as he seeks the Democratic nomination.\n\nFour states are holding Republican primaries on Tuesday, with an opportunity for Trump to pick up enough delegates to secure his place at the Republican convention this summer. Three states, as well as the Northern Mariana Islands, are holding Democratic contests, which total enough delegates to score Biden the Democratic nomination as well.\n\nHere's what the path could look like for both candidates to win their respective party's nomination:\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHow many delegates does it take to win a party's nomination?\n\nThere are a total of 2,429 delegates available to win the Republican nomination. A candidate must secure the majority of delegates, 1,215, to become the GOP nominee.\n\nIf no candidate wins the majority of delegates during the primary and caucus season, then delegates at the national nominating convention will vote amongst themselves to make the Republican pick.\n\nFor the Democratic Party, there are a total of 4,672 delegates. The Democratic nominee must win 1,968 delegates to represent the party on the ballot in November.\n\nHow many delegates does Donald Trump have? How many delegates does Joe Biden have?\n\nBiden currently has 1,866 delegates, coming up 102 delegates short of what's needed to become the presumptive Democratic nominee.\n\nTrump has a larger threshold to cross to win the GOP nomination. He has gained 1,075 delegates so far, and he needs 140 more to secure the GOP nomination.\n\nWill there be a presumptive nominee Tuesday?\n\nIt's very possible.\n\nGeorgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and Washington are holding their Republican primaries Tuesday with 161 delegates up for grabs. If Trump wins over 85% of these available delegates, which is likely given Haley suspended her campaign, he will become the presumptive nominee for Republicans.\n\nThe Trump campaign suggested in a memo last month that the former president will likely lock in necessary support during Tuesday's March 12 primaries. They predicted he'll have a total of 1,223 delegates after Tuesday.\n\nIn a worst case scenario, the campaign estimates he will become the designated nominee no later than March 19.\n\nFor Biden, winning the 247 delegates from Tuesday's primary states of Georgia, Mississippi and Washington and the territory of the Northern Mariana Islands would be more than enough to essentially become the Democratic primary winner.\n\nBecause Biden lacks any major challengers, it's likely he will win these delegates in a landslide, along with the 13 delegates from groups of Democrats living abroad.\n\nWhen are the Republican and Democratic conventions?\n\nEven if Biden and Trump win the delegates necessary to become their party's nominees, they still have to be formally nominated at their party's convention over the summer.\n\nThe Republican National Convention will be held in Milwaukee, Wisconsin from July 15 to July 18. The Democratic National Convention will be in Chicago from Aug. 19 to Aug. 22.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/04/how-the-2024-michigan-gop-presidential-primary-will-work/71756428007/", "title": "It won't be like last time: 2024 Michigan GOP presidential primary ...", "text": "Time was, a voter could rely on Michigan's presidential primaries being pretty cut and dried: Both major parties, same date, pick your ballot, vote.\n\nAnd that was only three years ago.\n\nNext year, however, it's going to be more complicated, especially for Republican voters, who are going to see Michigan's role in the national nomination evolve into a two-step primary/convention process spaced out over at least five days.\n\nWe're going to explain how that process will work below. But first, it's important to know a few things. First, we're only talking about Michigan's part in deciding the major party nominees for president, not those for other offices like U.S. senator or congressperson, with those primaries still on the first Tuesday in August.\n\nSecond, this is happening courtesy of the Democratic National Committee, and President Joe Biden, who decided to revamp a calendar they believed gave too much sway to Iowa and New Hampshire, which traditionally have gone first. In doing so, they (and ultimately the state Legislature and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer) moved Michigan's primary up to the fourth Tuesday in February, which in next year's case is Feb. 27.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nSweet! Michigan goes fourth nationally and a week before the slew of Super Tuesday states. (And that doesn't count the fact that New Hampshire is violating new Democratic rules that moved it back in the calendar and won't see Biden campaigning there as a consequence). So it could, theoretically, give the state a lot more clout politically, especially if Democrats keep the same calendar in the future.\n\nBut that day violates the Republican National Committee's (RNC) rules — still very much in effect — that say the only presidential contests before the beginning of March are supposed to be those in Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. And it wasn't going to change them just to please a Democratic president or members of his party who have long argued that Iowa and New Hampshire were not representative enough of the rest of the country to give them such prominence.\n\nSo Michigan Republicans have spent months working with the RNC to 1) keep all their delegates to the national nominating convention in Milwaukee next summer, many of which they would lose by simply awarding those delegates to whomever wins the primary Feb. 27, and 2) have that Feb. 27 public primary count for something.\n\nAnd they did, but it does require some explanation. Here it is, courtesy of the RNC and one of its Michigan members, National Committeeman Dr. Rob Steele.\n\nThe primary will look like any other but ultimately decide only a portion of delegates\n\nThis requires a little explanation up front. If you're new to the world of presidential nominating contests, they are essentially about deciding how many delegates a candidate will receive from a given state to cast their votes for him or her at the national nominating conventions held each presidential election year during the summer.\n\nSince we're talking about Republicans here, they have 2,470 delegates to be selected nationally, spread across the states, with a candidate needing 1,236 to become the nominee. (This comes from the Green Papers, an online site that methodically tracks the ins and outs of the nominating and voting process; Democrats, by the way, have 4,541 delegates, with 2,271 needed to nominate.)\n\nMichigan Republicans will, barring some change, award 55 delegates in all. And, if all goes according to plan, they shouldn't lose a single delegate either, even with a portion being awarded in proportion to the results of a primary held before March.\n\nJust like any other recent primary year, registered voters in Michigan wanting to vote for a presidential candidate from the Republican or Democratic field in 2024 will get that party's ballot and do so (either through early voting, requesting and returning an absentee ballot, or in person at their polling places on primary day, you can check out all of those options here or by communicating with your local clerk).\n\nBut not all of the Republican's 55 delegates will be awarded according to that popular vote. Instead, 16 so-called at-large delegates (meaning they're not being doled out to the candidates according to congressional districts, which will come into play later) will be awarded.\n\nAnd here's how.\n\nAny Republican candidate who gets 12.5% of the primary popular vote gets two delegates, with an additional delegate for each additional 6.25%. There is no winner-take-all, though any remaining delegates once the vote is split up go to whoever was the overall winner.\n\nSo, say, candidate X gets 40% of the Republican primary vote, candidate Y gets 30%, candidate Z gets 20% and the remaining 10% is split between two other candidates, neither of whom reaches the threshold to get any delegates. In this example, X initially gets 6 delegates, Y gets 4 and Z gets 3. That leaves three unallocated that also go to X as the plurality winner, leaving him or her with 9.\n\nThis appears to be key, however: Formally, the results of the Feb. 27 Republican primary are what the RNC calls \"non-binding,\" meaning they don't count toward anything — at least not as of Feb. 27. Instead, to get around that March rule, the allocation of those 16 delegates won't officially take place until after March 1, when the state committee will meet — at the same time they meet to certify the results from part two of this process (which we're about to get to) — and adopt a resolution spelling out that primary allocation formula.\n\nThen comes the state nominating convention\n\nFor Michigan Democrats, that's about it — their primary vote will sort out which candidates get 117 of their 140 delegates, with the rest being unpledged delegates we used to refer to as \"super-delegates.\" (In the primary, Democratic presidential candidates need at least 15% of the primary vote to receive any delegates, 40 of whom are awarded statewide and the rest split according to the winners in Michigan's 13 congressional districts.)\n\nRepublican candidates, however, have to go through another step in the process: a state convention to be held on Saturday, March 2.\n\nThere — presumably at one as-yet-unnamed site, though it could be at several if the state Republican Party were to decide otherwise — the remaining 39 delegates are to be awarded according to a vote of convention participants (who are also called delegates but that's confusing). Those participants will be selected in each of the state's 13 congressional districts. (Those convention participants will be selected at county GOP meetings across the state on Feb. 15.)\n\nIn essence, the nominating convention will consist of 13 separate conventions, one for each congressional district, with the presidential candidates (or perhaps their surrogates) going around and campaigning before each group takes a vote. Each gets three delegates to award, adding up to 39 in all.\n\nIf a candidate gets a majority of the congressional district participants' votes, he or she gets all three delegates. If no one gets a majority, then the candidate with the highest tally gets two and whoever comes in next gets one.\n\nIn the end, said Steele, Michigan Republicans were able to work out an arrangement that not only avoids a penalty — they would have lost all but 12 delegates had they simply awarded them according to the outcome of the Feb. 27 primary — it also means that Michigan takes on additional significance.\n\n\"For the Republican candidates Michigan becomes more important than usual,\" he said. \"We are the first state after the usual early four and a week prior to Super Tuesday. This allows those that do well in Michigan to campaign for a week on their strength as a top-tier candidate and suggest (to) Super Tuesday voters forget about those finishing lower.\"\n\nOf course, it is a process that also gives additional weight to the decision made by party insiders or others who win the right to be participants at that state convention, rather than it being more purely an outcome of the public primary vote itself. But it's also true that, since Democrats made the decision on their own to change the calendar — and Republicans were never likely to alienate Iowa and New Hampshire by simply agreeing to that — they didn't give the GOP much of a choice.\n\nContact Todd Spangler at tspangler@freepress.com.

I campaigned for two days,” Haley said during an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash. “Our goal has been to try and reach as many people as we can, but we know he's got the advantage.”\n\nWhile Haley said she wanted to remain “competitive” in Michigan, she did not reveal what benchmarks her campaign is hoping to reach.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nWhen is Super Tuesday?\n\nSuper Tuesday is on Tue, Mar 5, 2024. Elections will be held in 16 states and one U.S. territory, and the date has often had the power to reshape presidential campaigns.\n\nPresidential primary races will take place in states like California, Alabama, Iowa and North Carolina. Meanwhile, caucuses will be held in Utah and American Samoa.

Since then, both Karamo and Hoekstra have both claimed to be the chair of the state party.\n\nTuesday’s decision could provide important clarity about the state's forthcoming GOP convention where the majority of the party's delegates to the Republican National Convention will officially be elected. Hoekstra has scheduled a March 2 convention in Grand Rapids, while Karamo had scheduled one in Detroit on the same date.\n\n– Paul Egan\n\nLara Trump officially announces her RNC candidacy\n\nAs Donald Trump awaited results in Michigan, his daughter-in-law officially announced her candidacy for Republican National Committee co-chair.\n\n\"I promise you that I will be laser-focused on election integrity, voter turn out, and ensuring every dollar spent goes towards winning!\" Lara Trump said on the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nLara Trump, who has her father-in-law's backing, has sent campaign letters to all 168 RNC members ahead of their meeting next week.\n\nThe elder Trump has also endorsed Michael Whatley, the current state chair of the North Carolina Republican Party, to replace Ronna McDaniel as national RNC chair.\n\nMcDaniel said this week that she plans to announce her resignation at a March 8 RNC meeting in Houston.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRepublican Ryan Binkley drops out of the 2024 presidential race and endorses Donald Trump\n\nRepublican candidate for president and pastor Ryan Binkley announced the suspension of his campaign Tuesday morning.\n\nBinkley joined the race in April 2023, but he never gained traction in the once-crowded Republican field, finishing behind candidates who had already dropped out in early primary states like New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n\nBinkley endorsed former president Donald Trump as he exited the race.\n\n“Throughout my campaign, I have seen our party struggle to find a place for a new vision while weighing the corrupt allegations and indictments against President Trump,” he wrote in a post on X. “He will need everyone’s support, and he will have mine moving forward.”\n\n– Margie Cullen\n\nMichigan's Republican primary is only part of the battle for delegates\n\nDonald Trump is a huge favorite over Nikki Haley in the Michigan Republican primary, but that contest will award less than a third of the state's presidential delegates. The rest will be awarded at a Republican convention on Saturday.\n\nMichigan Republicans adopted a hybrid system because of a new state law that moved up the state's primary date. The national Republican Party wanted most states to pick delegates after March 1, so the Michigan GOP came up with its two-step system.\n\nTonight's primary will award 16 of the state party's convention delegates; the rest will be subject to the convention on Saturday. Trump has a chance to win all of the delegates.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nRashida Tlaib said she was ‘proud’ to vote uncommitted in Democratic primary\n\nRep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., said she was \"proud\" to vote \"uncommitted\" in the Michigan primary, a kind-of protest against Joe Biden’s wide-reaching support for Israel as the Israel-Hamas war rages on.\n\nProgressive activists have been encouraging voters for weeks to use their vote in the election to pressure the Biden administration to demand a cease-fire in the war.\n\nShe sent out a robocall earlier in the day urging members of the with the progressive political group Our Revolution to use their vote to pressure the Biden administration to demand a cease-fire in the war.\n\n– Karissa Waddick\n\nDean Phillips signals defeat hours before polls close\n\nHours before polls closed in the Wolverine State, Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., all but admitted defeat to Joe Biden in Michigan’s Democratic presidential primary.\n\nPhillips announced his long-shot campaign to unseat Biden last October, but he hasn’t seen a substantial amount of voter support since. Last week, he floated the idea of a “unity ticket” with Nikki Haley, whose campaign said she is still focused on winning the GOP nomination.\n\n“Joe Biden should receive 90% of the vote today in Michigan, no surprise when a party pro-actively prevents competition and the majority of primary voters are the party faithful,” Phillips wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nPhillips also encouraged voters to participate in their state's primary elections.\n\n“If more Americans voted in primaries, the exhausted majority could quickly restore common sense to a country that needs it,” he wrote. “Be a voter and be the change!”\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nDonald Trump will phone in remarks to Michigan\n\nDonald Trump stayed off the campaign trail Tuesday, and he isn't going to Michigan to celebrate his expected primary victory.\n\nInstead, Trump is scheduled to phone in remarks to a Republican watch party in Grand Rapids.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWho is on the ballot in Michigan's primary?\n\nOn the Democratic side, Joe Biden is facing off against U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., and author Marianne Williamson. Williamson earlier this month suspended her presidential bid, saying that her campaign and supporters still \"articulated deeper, more authentic truths than those regularly acknowledged by the political establishment.\"\n\nOn the Republican side, Donald Trump is facing off against Nikki Haley and a group of Republicans who have since dropped out of the presidential race, such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nWhether voters are supporting Democratic or Republican White House candidates, they can also choose an \"uncommitted option\" instead of a specific name.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhere do Nikki Haley, Donald Trump stand in Republican polls?\n\nDonald Trump’s chances of clinching the GOP nomination are widening after his recent string of wins in New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. And the ex-president is leading in most polls.\n\nIn a Real Clear Politics average of national polls, Trump garnered 77.3% support nationally. Nikki Haley received a mere 15.1% support.\n\nDespite her low polling numbers, Haley has pledged to stay in the race until Super Tuesday on March 5, when 16 states head to the polls. Over a third of the 2,429 delegates in the GOP race will be awarded based on the results of elections on that day.\n\n− Karissa Waddick\n\nWho gets to vote in Michigan's primary?\n\nMichigan allows same-day voter registration. Voters in Michigan must have lived in their registered municipality for at least 30 days before the election, be at least 18 years old, be a U.S. Citizen, and not currently serving a prison or jail sentence. Formerly incarcerated felons can vote.\n\nVoters can cast their ballot in one primary of their choosing, even if they are registered under another party.\n\n– Cy Neff", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/state/2024/03/05/super-tuesday-texas-primary-election-2024-live-updates-travis-county-bastrop-hays-williamson/72807965007/", "title": "Texas primary election 2024 live updates: Get the latest results", "text": "Polls are now closed for the Texas primary elections.

Kronda Thimesch, R-Lewisville, by 298 of 21,604 votes. The race marks a significant victory in the attorney general’s revenge tour against Republican House incumbents who voted to impeach him over charges of corruption and bribery. Ultimately, the Senate cleared Paxton of wrongdoing largely along party lines.\n\nLittle had previously served as Thimesch's campaign treasurer until he joined Paxton's legal team in the lead-up to the impeach trial in the Senate.\n\n— Bayliss Wagner\n\n12:30 a.m.: Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan unable to secure reelection, heads to runoff\n\nHouse Speaker Dade Phelan was unable to secure his reelection to his Southeast Texas district Tuesday night and will head into a runoff election against a GOP primary challenger backed by former President Donald Trump and Attorney General Ken Paxton, according to unofficial results and both candidates.\n\nDavid Covey, an oil and gas industry consultant and a marquee candidate for Paxton's revenge tour against House Republicans who voted to impeach him last year, came out on top in the three-person race, with Phelan securing the second spot to make it to the May 28 runoff after neither candidate received a majority of the vote.\n\n— Hogan Gore\n\n11:30 p.m.: Walker with narrow lead over incumbent Devine for Supreme Court seat\n\nThe gap between scandal-plagued incumbent Texas Supreme Court Justice John Devine and his Republican challenger, Judge Brian Walker, has narrowed to just 0.6% with 65% of the total estimated vote counted.\n\n“It's looking like we're going to win this race!\" Walker wrote to the American-Statesman. \"All glory to God!”\n\nDevine did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n— Bayliss Wagner\n\n10:40 p.m.: Dade Phelan trails challenger by 1% in neck-and-neck race as votes keep trickling in\n\nAs election results continue to be reported in Southeast Texas, GOP primary challenger David Covey has an ever so slight lead against incumbent House Speaker Dade Phelan in the state House District 21 race.\n\nPhelan is trailing Covey by 1 percentage point, according to the latest election results updated around 10:40 p.m.\n\nCurrently, Phelan has received 12,426 votes to Covey's 12,707, according to the latest results.\n\nAfter taking his first lead of the night at 10:20 p.m. and losing it 20 minutes later, Phelan could likely be headed to a runoff with Covey in the three-person race.

Greg Abbott in his push to unseat those who voted against a school voucher program last year.\n\nIn recent days, former President Donald Trump and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick also endorsed Bradley.\n\nThe bipartisan vote against the voucher bill effectively killed the package and any change of passage for the controversial school choice program, which would use public dollars to pay for students' private school.\n\nAbbott then endorsed Darby's challenger Bradley, spending more than $670,000 in the last month to boost Bradley's chances according to campaign finance reports. This race was one of four Abbott spent heavily on to back pro-school choice candidates.\n\n― Hogan Gore\n\n9 p.m. update: Phelan trails challenger as early votes come in\n\nIn the political battle of his life, Texas House Speaker Dade Phelan trails GOP primary challenger David Covey by more than 300 votes as election results continue trickling in.\n\nCovey has thus far received 9,967 votes, or 46%, compared with Phelan's 9,629, or 44.48%.\n\nHouse District 21 along the Gulf Coast in Southeast Texas has seen a barrage of Covey endorsements ahead of election day, including receiving support from former President Donald Trump and Attorney General Ken Paxton.\n\nPaxton, following his impeachment by the House and subsequent acquittal in the Senate last year, has been on the attack against Phelan for months leading into Super Tuesday.\n\n― Hogan Gore\n\n8:10 p.m.: Cruz wins Texas Republican Senate primary\n\nIncumbent Sen.

Eleventh-hour accusations against candidates are not uncommon in tight races on election day.\n\nSocial media posts sharing an article from the news site The Free Press, founded by Bari Weiss, who also posted the story on X, formerly Twitter, have said that crime in Austin has “soared under a progressive district attorney.”\n\nThe story cites and links to an article by the real estate website HomeSnacks with an Austin crime analysis for 2023 that shows the rate is higher in Austin than in the country and Texas.\n\nHowever, data from the Austin Police Department shows that most total crime numbers have gone down during Travis County District Attorney José Garza’s tenure.\n\nThe total number of crimes against persons in Austin has gone down every year in the city since 2020. Crimes against persons are generally violent crimes, such as homicides, assaults and rapes.\n\nCrimes against property, such as robberies and auto thefts, have also gone down every year since 2020.\n\nHowever, crimes against society, which include things such as drug violations, gambling and prostitution, have gone up and down since 2020.\n\nHomicides in Austin have risen since 2020 and have not gone down to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nThis has largely followed a nationwide trend since 2020, when murder went up across the country.

How to cast your ballot in the Austin-area on Super Tuesday\n\nWelcome to Super Tuesday. Here's what you need to know.\n\nSuper Tuesday is officially here. Texas Democratic and Republican voters will pick their nominees for president, a U.S. Senate seat, 15 state Senate offices, all 150 state House seats, and an array of federal, state and local candidates seeking places on the general election ballot in November.\n\nDemocratic President Joe Biden and former Republican President Donald Trump are considered prohibitive favorites for a rematch this fall, and Texas, along with 13 other states participating in the Super Tuesday primaries, could help cement that matchup.\n\nIn Texas, the most closely watched statewide primary race is on the Democratic side as nine candidates battle for the right to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who faces only token opposition for renomination. Most polls have shown U.S. Rep. Colin Allred of Dallas comfortably in the lead and state Sen. Roland Gutierrez of San Antonio running second but well ahead of the rest of the field.\n\nMore:Texas Democrats hope to unseat Ted Cruz, but which candidate is best poised for the fight?\n\nIf no candidate captures a majority, the top two vote-getters in the primary will advance to a runoff.\n\nThree places on the Texas Supreme Court and on the Court of Criminal Appeals are also being contested in both primaries.

According to political data analyst Derek Ryan, about 148,000 more people voted early in the 2024 Republican primary than in 2020, when Trump was running for a second term.\n\nOn the Democratic side, early voting turnout this year was about 60% of that of 2020, according to Ryan's analysis. But four years ago, the race for the Democratic presidential nomination was not yet secured by Biden before the Texas primary.\n\nThe polls will be open from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesday.

Nikki Haley faced an embarrassing result in Nevada's GOP primary on Tuesday, with Silver State voters technically selecting none of the candidates on the ballot to win the Republican race.\n\nHere's what that means: Nevada allowed voters to back a specific candidate or effectively pick none of the White House hopefuls. That option received more support than Haley in the Republican primary.

We’re full steam ahead in South Carolina and beyond.”\n\nNevertheless, a win for Haley could have given her campaign momentum heading into the pivotal primary in her home state later this month.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nDonald Trump quickly criticizes Nikki Haley\n\nDonald Trump on Tuesday night immediately knocked Nikki Haley over Nevada's Republican primary results, posting on his Truth Social platform that it was a \"bad night\" for his one-time United Nations ambassador.\n\nNevada Gov.

Brian Sandoval, a Republican, laughed and declined to say who he voted for after casting his ballot. Sandoval, now the president of the University of Nevada, Reno, voted at the university's student union on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nSandoval told USA TODAY that he thinks most of the concern over the dueling primary and caucus has passed, and said he favors anything that gets more people to participate in the political process. Sandoval was first elected Nevada attorney general in 2003, and then after serving as a federal judge won the governorship twice starting in 2010, before term limits forced him to step down.\n\n“Yes, there will be a little bit of confusion but if it encourages more people to get out there and be part of the process I’m all for it,\" Sandoval said.\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nWhat time do Nevada polls close?\n\nPolls for Nevada's state-run Democratic and Republican presidential primaries close at 10 p.m. ET, which is 7 p.m. local time.\n\nHowever, polls will remain open as long as a voter is at least in line by 7 p.m. If the voter has gotten in line by that time, they will still be allowed to vote.\n\n– Margaret Cullen\n\nNikki Haley spends Nevada primary night attacking Donald Trump, Joe Biden\n\nNikki Haley in a post on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, again stressed the age of her fellow candidates, Trump and Biden, on Tuesday.\n\n\"We all know 80 year olds who can run circles around us…and then we know Trump and Biden,\" she shared. \"We need a president who has the focus and stamina to deal with all the challenges facing our country.\"\n\nBiden is 81, and poll after poll has shown voters have concerns about his age. Trump, 77, isn't immune from the criticism either.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhy does Nevada have a primary and a caucus?\n\nIn 2021, the Nevada Legislature approved a change to make way for a presidential preference primary. It was intended to be a simpler way to pick the preferred presidential candidates for the two major parties.\n\nHowever, the Nevada Republican Party balked at the new format and went in another direction. Instead of sending delegates to the GOP National Convention based on primary results, the party will consider only results from its Feb. 8 caucus, which it will host and pay for itself.\n\nThe party says the caucus embodies the election reforms it seeks, such as the use of voter ID, a single election day with no early voting, paper ballots and less influence from super PACs.\n\n– Mark Robison\n\nWho is Hirsh Singh?\n\nHirsh Singh, an engineer and government contractor from New Jersey, is among the names on the Nevada primary ballot along with John Castro, Heath Fulkerson and Donald Kjornes.\n\nAfter multiple unsuccessful runs for office in his home state, he is now vying to be the GOP presidential nominee. In a July video, he described himself as a “lifelong Republican” who wants to fight the “grave threats from the corruption of both big tech and big pharma.”\n\nSingh has participated in several Republican primary races, including for a House seat in 2018, for a Senate seat in 2020 and for governor of New Jersey in 2017 and 2021. He came in third for the nomination during his latest run for governor, losing to eventual nominee Jack Ciattarell.\n\n– Anthony Robledo\n\nChris Christie: Donald Trump could be a \"convicted felon\" by convention time in July\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie on Tuesday said Donald Trump might have a new title if he formally receives the Republican nomination in mid-July: Convicted felon.\n\nChristie on Tuesday told CNN said the appeals court decision denying Trump immunity from prosecution could clear the way for a sweeping election fraud trial in the spring.\n\nA verdict could well come before the Republican convention in Milwaukee opens on July 15.\n\n“My guess is that he’ll be a convicted felon when he gets on the stage to accept the Republican nomination for president,\" Christie said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nSome Republican voters wanted to back Donald Trump in Nevada primary\n\nRepublican Michael Holton, who works in manufacturing, said he begrudgingly voted for \"None of these candidates\" at a South Reno polling site. Holton, 61, said he wished Trump could have participated in the primary so the former president could defeat Haley in a head-to-head competition.\n\nHolton said Haley, a former Trump ambassador to the United Nations, is disloyal in running against her former boss.\n\n\"I'm bummed he's not on the ballot,\" Holton said. \"I feel the caucus will be strong for him but I'm just bummed he's not on the ballot.\"\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nNevada caucus date approaches\n\nThe Nevada caucus is set for Thursday. The GOP will actually award delegates for the race, unlike the primary on Tuesday. Donald Trump is expected to participate, but Nikki Haley won't be an option for caucusgoers.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAre Dean Phillips and Marianne Williamson competing with Joe Biden in Nevada?\n\nRep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., one of Joe Biden's major challengers, will not be on the ballot in Nevada. He didn't meet a qualification deadline, but author Marianne Williamson and other challengers are running on the Democratic side in the Silver State.\n\n− Marina Pitofsky\n\nDonald Trump looks to Thursday's Nevada caucus\n\nDonald Trump hasn't said anything today about the Nevada primary, which isn't surprising. He wants Republicans to ignore the primary and focus instead on Thursday's caucuses, in which he is the only major candidate on the ballot.\n\nDuring a campaign rally in Las Vegas over the weekend, Trump told supporters: \"Don’t worry about the primary, just do the caucus thing.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nNevada voters weigh in on what brought them to the polls\n\nOutside a Reno voting site, Pedro Camargo, 65, said he voted for Biden in the primary, rejecting Trump as \"a bully and a liar,\" and saying he never considered Haley as a choice. He considered which candidate would better protect Social Security and Medicare, while trying to raise the minimum wage.\n\n“I voted for Biden. The other guy wants to be a dictator,\" said Camargo, an Uber driver in Reno. \"I mean, he says he'd be a dictator for a day, but no one believes it would be for a day.\"\n\nPaul Leason, 41, was stationed outside a polling place asking voters to sign his petition to put Robert F. Kennedy Jr. on the general election ballot as a third-party candidate. He opted to skip Tuesday's primary and Thursday's caucus because he thinks Trump and Biden are too old.\n\n“(Kennedy's) just better than the other two,\" said Leason, who was recently inspired to get involved in politics by a podcast he listens to. \"I’d take Trump over Biden though, but everyone’s old. I don’t think any people collecting Social Security should be running for office. It’s just the Boomers don’t want to give up power.”\n\nWhat is a caucus?\n\nWhile a primary election is run by state and local governments, a caucus is run by political parties. A traditional primary election resembles the general election, with voting via private ballot.\n\nA caucus, however, involves voters dividing themselves into groups based on the candidate they prefer and arguing for others to join them. At the end of the caucus, the number of members in each group determines how many delegates that candidate gets.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhy is Donald Trump not on the Nevada primary ballot? Dual contests confuse voters\n\nWashoe County Registrar of Voters Cari-Ann Burgess said there has been ongoing confusion among voters about the difference between the primary and the caucus.\n\n\"We get a lot of 'why isn't President Trump on our ballot?,'\" Burgess said Tuesday morning. \"And the answer is he opted out of participating in the Nevada presidential preference primary. He just decided not to participate in ours, but he's in the caucus.\"\n\nUnder a 2021 state law, Nevada is required to hold presidential primary elections as long as there are at least two candidates for a party's nomination.\n\nBut Republican Party officials ‒ many of whom participated in a 2020 effort to subvert the presidential election results in Trump's favor ‒ decided last year to hold a binding caucus. They also tried unsuccessfully to stop the state from holding the primary.\n\nBurgess said she isn't directly coordinating with the state GOP because her office is non-partisan, so her staff doesn't give out information about the caucuses. Instead, she has been trained to refer all questions to the party directly.\n\nNevada Secretary of State Francisco Aguilar said even his own friends called him up to complain about the dual contests, though his office alerted voters for months about the dueling contests, sending out postcards, posting signs and speaking to the media.\n\nNevada GOP has said previously it considered the primary election to be a waste of taxpayer dollars, and that party business should be funded and conducted by the party itself.\n\n-Trevor Hughes\n\nCalifornia’s atmospheric river brings winter weather warnings to Nevada\n\nThe storm that slammed California with rain this week has also brought heavy snowfall to parts of Nevada. A ski resort near Las Vegas said it had received nearly a foot of snow in 24 hours, and an avalanche occurred Monday leaving several people missing temporarily.\n\nOn this Primary Day, much of Nevada is under either a winter storm warning or a winter weather advisory in effect until at least 4:00 p.m. PST Tuesday.

Mail-ballot voting began Jan. 27 and workers at her office had been opening and preparing the ballots for counting after polls close.\n\nThe temperature as the polls opened at 7 a.m. was 28 degrees with clear skies, a major change from a significant weekend snowstorm days before.\n\n“We’re right on schedule, right on point,” Burgess told USA TODAY.\n\nAfter contentious 2020 and 2022 elections, the registrar’s office is now live streaming the ballot counting, hired a full-time security guard to monitor the counting room and installed a glass-enclosed observation room so people can watch the count without disrupting workers.\n\nAnd despite repeated news coverage, some Republican voters were still angry or confused as to why Trump isn’t appearing on the GOP primary ballot, she said.\n\n– Trevor Hughes\n\nNikki Haley requests Secret Service protection citing ‘multiple issues'\n\nThe only major Republican in Tuesday’s primary, Haley has requested Secret Service protection after saying she's received increased threats, according to reports.\n\n“We’ve had multiple issues,” Haley told the Wall Street Journal Monday. “It’s not going to stop me from doing what I need to do.”\n\nHaley has been the victim of two swatting attempts in recent months.\n\nWhen asked about heightened security at her events last week, Haley told reporters that “when you do something like this, you get threats. It’s just the reality, and that’s OK.\n\nThe Secret Service typically provides protection to “major presidential and vice presidential candidates as identified as such” by the Secretary of Homeland Security in consultation with an advisory committee, according to its website.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi and Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nCan voters register at the polls?\n\nYes, Nevada offers same-day registration.\n\nHowever, to register at the polls or update your voter registration at the polls, you must have a valid Nevada driver’s license or ID card. This rule goes without exception.\n\nIf your Nevada ID has an outdated address, the state does allow you to provide an alternative proof of residence.

In comparison, Haley received 18.8% support, even after rivals such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and others dropped out of the GOP primary.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden declared victory in South Carolina\n\nJoe Biden cruised to an easy victory Saturday in the South Carolina primary, the first official contest of the 2024 Democratic nomination process.\n\nThe Associated Press called the race for Biden about an hour after the polls closed at 7 p.m., even as Biden faced challenges from Rep. Dean Phillips, D-Minn., and author Marianne Williamson.\n\nWhile the president is expected to win the 2024 Democratic nomination, the primary season could give clues as to where Biden stands with his party’s base and whether he has lost supporters since his 2020 White House bid.\n\n– USA TODAY staff", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/03/nikki-haley-donald-trump-washington-dc-primary/72830577007/", "title": "Super Tuesday warm-up: Nikki Haley wins Republican primary in D.C.", "text": "WASHINGTON – Nikki Haley defeated Donald Trump in Sunday's Republican primary in Washington, D.C., her first win in what remains an uphill battle to somehow overtake the former president for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.\n\nHaley, the former governor of South Carolina, claimed all 19 convention delegates and carried more than 62% of the vote among the small pool of district Republicans who participated in the three-day primary.

The former president needs 1,215 delegates to clinch the nomination, and 845 delegates will be available on Super Tuesday.\n\nWhile the Republican presence in Washington, D.C., is very small, the caucuses drew some attention because of alleged threats by the Trump campaign to a particular group of voters: Lobbyists.\n\nPolitico reported that Trump officials warned lobbyists that “if they don’t vote in this Sunday’s primary, they won’t get access should the former president end up back in the White House.”\n\nHaley, whose donors have been threatened with ostracism by the Trump machine, protested the heavy-handed tactics a day before her victory in the nation's capital.\n\nThis election \"is about candidates wanting people to come into their fold, not threatening them, not pushing them out of their club,\" Haley told reporters Saturday. \"Is that what we want as a leader?

County Commissioner Dan Harris says he voted against a move to block the festival because opposition appears to be “anti-Latino” even if it isn’t. Harris says he doesn’t want to be part of that, particularly after the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: A wildlife monitoring group is seeking citizen scientists to help track beluga whales off the state’s coast. The Peninsula Clarion reports the Alaska Beluga Monitoring Partnership is offering volunteers an opportunity to help scientists understand more about Cook Inlet beluga whales. The partnership is a collaboration of several organizations including Beluga Whale Alliance, Defenders of Wildlife and the Alaska Wildlife Alliance. Monitoring events are expected to take place between Aug. 14 and Nov. 15. Planned monitoring locations include Twentymile River and Bird Point near Girdwood, Ship Creek in Anchorage, and the Kenai and Kasilof Rivers. Officials say volunteers will learn about the conservation needs of Cook Inlet beluga whales and receive training on identifying and recording data on beluga distribution and behavior.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Officials have approved placing a “sanctuary city” measure on the ballot, but not without some pushback. KVOA-TV reports the Tucson City Council voted Tuesday night to allow the initiative on the November ballot, which could potentially lead to Arizona’s first-ever “sanctuary city.” Councilmembers were required to vote after the measure got more than the minimum required number of petition signatures. The initiative would add protections for people living in the U.S. illegally. Video shows a woman wearing a “Make America Great Again” hat repeatedly shouting that the initiative defies U.S. immigration law. The footage has since gone viral on social media because of an man in a green polo shirt laughing nearby. #GreenShirtGuy was the No. 1 trending topic on Twitter as of Wednesday morning.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The governor is asking lawmakers to approve $25 million for a new state grant program aimed at increasing access to high-speed internet in rural areas. Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday announced the creation of the Arkansas Rural Connect program, which will provide grants to qualifying communities with at least 500 people to deploy high-speed broadband to residents. Hutchinson, who announced the program at a meeting of the Arkansas Sheriffs’ Association in Rogers, says he’ll ask the Legislative Council to approve $5.7 million for the program this year, and the remainder will need to be appropriated by lawmakers in next year’s legislative session. In May, Hutchinson released a plan to expand rural access to high-speed broadband by 2022.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Actor Danny Trejo played a real-life hero when he helped rescue a baby trapped in an overturned car after two cars collided at an intersection in the Sylmar neighborhood Wednesday. Video aired by KABC-TV shows Trejo at the crash scene. Trejo says he crawled into the wrecked vehicle from one side but couldn’t unbuckle the child’s car seat from that angle. He says another bystander, a young woman, was able to undo the buckle. Together they pulled the baby safely from the wreckage. The Los Angeles Fire Department says three people were taken to a hospital, and there were no life-threatening injuries. The 75-year-old Trejo, an L.A. native, is perhaps best known for playing the character Machete, originally from the “Spy Kids” series.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: State wildlife officials say thousands of tarantulas are expected to start their annual migration through the state soon. The Gazette reports the migration is expected to begin this month through early October. Officials say the Oklahoma brown tarantulas migrate through La Junta, about 176 miles southeast of Denver. Scientists say the majority of the spiders are 10-year-old males looking to mate with females hidden in Colorado’s grasslands. Officials say the peak time to view the migration is mid-September near Comanche National Grassland south of La Junta off U.S. Highway 109. Officials say tarantulas are mostly harmless to humans but have bites that can cause injury or allergic reaction and hairs that can be irritating to the eyes, mouth and nose.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The federal Office for Civil Rights has launched an investigation into the state’s policy allowing transgender high school athletes to compete as the gender with which they identify. The investigation follows a complaint by the families of three girls who say they were discriminated against by having to compete in track against two athletes who were identified as male at birth. They say that violates Title IX, the federal law designed to ensure equal athletic opportunities for females. The Connecticut Association of Schools-Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference says its policy follows a state anti-discrimination law that says students must be treated in school by their gender identification. Transathlete.com says Connecticut is one of 17 states that allow transgender high school athletes to compete without restrictions.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Everyone’s a critic, including Delaware Air National Guard officials who wanted nude images of Adam and Eve depicted in a 50-year-old mural by famed artist Jamie Wyeth to put on some pants. Someone apparently isn’t mooning over the huge, 10-by-30-foot mural that shows the bare buttocks of the Garden of Eden couple. It hangs on a wall of a building at the guard’s 80-acre base at the New Castle County Airport. The mural was created by Wyeth when he served with the Delaware Air National Guard during the Vietnam War. Air National Guard officials have had recent talks about possibly altering or covering up part of the artwork by the well-known painter. Wyeth is the scion of three generations of widely celebrated American artists, including his illustrator grandfather N.C. Wyeth and his late father Andrew Wyeth, one of the best-known painters of the 20th century.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: An internal review of D.C. public schools shows more than 30% of employees have expired background checks. News outlets report Chancellor Lewis Ferebee shared the review’s findings with parents Tuesday and in a letter Wednesday. The district launched the review in June after an employee of a private before- and after-school program allegedly kissed and fondled a 13-year-old student on multiple occasions. The district says it discovered the company didn’t conduct proper background checks. Ferebee says by the end of October, all after-school staff, school staff and central office staff will have active background checks. He also says staff will receive more training on how to spot and respond to sexual misconduct cases.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Gov. Ron DeSantis says the state is expanding its efforts to eradicate invasive pythons in the Everglades and is working with the federal government to get snake hunters to remote areas of Big Cypress National Preserve. DeSantis announced Wednesday that Florida will double its resources for python removal and that the state Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Agriculture have a new agreement to begin hunting pythons in 130,000 acres of state parks. He’s directing the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the South Florida Water Management District to work together to research ways to eliminate pythons and to make a python challenge an annual event instead of once every three years. The challenge awards python hunters who capture the most snakes, which have decimated native species.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMilton: A farmer says his beloved miniature donkey named Sammy was literally scared to death by this year’s Fourth of July fireworks. Now he and an animal rights group want Georgia to ban rockets that go boom. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals wrote to Gov. Brian Kemp, House Speaker David Ralston and others Wednesday asking for a “Sammy’s law” limiting fireworks to the non-explosive, non-aerial varieties. John Bogino tells WGCL-TV that Sammy and his other farm animals are like pets to him. His pet donkey of 22 years died last month, and he says Sammy wasn’t his first animal to die because of fireworks. He says one of his horses fled explosions in late July several years ago and had to be euthanized due to severe injuries.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Scientists have discovered that a growing pond of water inside a crater is being heated by the Kilauea volcano. The U.S. Geological Survey says temperature readings taken last weekend show that the pool of water in Kilauea’s Halemaumau crater, the former home of a popular lava lake, is about 158 degrees Fahrenheit. For the first time in recorded history, the presence of water in the crater was confirmed last week. Since then, scientists have found two other small pools of water nearby. The crater floor collapsed about 2,000 feet, and the lava lake disappeared last summer as Kilauea stopped erupting for the first time in over 30 years. USGS geologist Matt Patrick told the Associated Press it’s hard to determine how deep the magma chamber is beneath the bottom of the crater floor where the water was found.\n\nIdaho\n\nSpokane: A study by the Idaho Department of Fish and Game has found that cougars kill more elk than wolves in the state. The Spokesman-Review reports the study found that wolves accounted for 32% of adult female elk deaths and 28% of elk calf deaths. The study found that cougars accounted for 35% of adult female elk deaths and 45% of elk calf deaths. The study published earlier this year in the Journal of Wildlife Management examined 15 years of data. The study also found that food availability and the severity of winter is the most important factor for elk calf survival. Idaho Department of Fish and Game senior wildlife research biologist Jon Horne says the findings are also likely applicable for Washington, Montana and Canada.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Officials are showcasing one of the most popular attractions of the Illinois State Fair. The butter cow was unveiled Wednesday afternoon at the fairgrounds. The sculpture has been a part of the state fair for almost 100 years. This year’s cow has been sculpted from 800 pounds of recycled butter. The cow stands near the word “Future” to incorporate the theme of the fair, which is “Building Our Future.” The cow is on display at the Dairy Building. Last year, hundreds of pounds of butter were sculpted into a cow by the same Iowa artist, Sarah Pratt. The base had “Land of Lincoln” written on it and included a stovepipe hat, as a nod to Abraham Lincoln. The fair started Thursday and ends Aug. 18.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Rainbow-colored streamers welcomed students back for the first day of classes Thursday at Cathedral High School, a show of support for a gay teacher fired from the Catholic school over the summer. The brightly colored streamers were a silent twist on a long-held Cathedral tradition to decorate “the hill” with toilet paper on the first day of school, but they still spoke volumes. The private high school has been embroiled in a debate over LGBTQ rights since it fired longtime teacher Joshua Payne-Elliott because of his same-sex marriage. Cathedral officials have said they only did so at the order of the Archdiocese of Indianapolis, which began requiring employment contracts with “ministerial language” and morality clauses to be used at its schools four years ago.\n\nIowa\n\nDyersville: They’ve built it. Now they’re coming. Major League Baseball is headed to town in 2020. The Chicago White Sox and New York Yankees announced Thursday that the two teams will play an official big-league game at the “Field of Dreams” movie site Aug. 13, 2020. “It’s definitely exciting,” says Roman Weinberg, the director of operations for Go the Distance Baseball, which owns the Field of Dreams movie site. “There’s nothing more American than the Field of Dreams and America’s pastime.” The 1989 movie centers on the 1919 White Sox and Shoeless Joe Jackson. Jackson, who was banned by MLB along with seven of his teammates for his alleged role in the White Sox throwing the 1919 World Series, inspires a farmer, played by Kevin Costner, to build a baseball field. The site has since become a tourist attraction, with fans from across the globe flocking to the Iowa cornfield to see it.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state plans to impose what some tax experts say would be the nation’s most aggressive policy for collecting taxes on online sales, possibly inviting a legal battle. The Department of Revenue issued a notice last week saying any “remote seller” doing business with Kansas residents must register with the department, collect state and local sales taxes, and forward the revenues to the state, starting Oct. 1. It cites a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year allowing states to collect sales taxes on internet sales. Most states now have policies to collect such taxes, but almost all set minimum annual sales or transaction thresholds to exempt small businesses, according to groups tracking tax laws. Kansas is the first to attempt to collect the taxes without exempting any businesses, they said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Amid major legislative efforts to restrict or end abortion in the state, a new poll commissioned by Planned Parenthood finds a majority of likely voters in the commonwealth believe the procedure should remain available. Asked whether it’s important for women to have “access to all of the reproductive health care options available, including abortion,” 65% said yes, according to the poll. Also, 65% said they’d have doubts about a law that bans abortion, even in cases of rape or incest, should the U.S. Supreme Court overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case legalizing abortion. Just 18% said they believe all abortions should be illegal – though another 37% said abortion should be allowed only in “extreme cases,” such as for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest or to save the life of the woman. And 43% said abortion should be legal with some regulations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nPride: A highway marker honoring blues singer and guitarist Buddy Guy has been recovered, months after it disappeared. News outlets report Pointe Coupee Parish Sheriff’s Office received a tip Wednesday that the sign was at a person’s house in Pride, roughly 30 miles northeast of Baton Rouge. Lt. Craig Dabadie says investigators believe a driver ran off the road and knocked the sign off a pole in May. Someone else picked it up as a souvenir. The sign was posted along Louisiana 1, marking the spot where Guy recorded a music video. The marker honors the Louisiana native’s legacy in music. Rolling Stone magazine listed him at No. 23 on its list of the “100 Greatest Guitarists.” No arrests were made, and the investigation is ongoing.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal program designed to help farmers suffering due to trade disruption is unlikely to assist the state’s wild blueberry growers. Maine is the sole commercial producer of wild blueberries in the United States. The industry has struggled in recent years with falling crop sizes and low prices to farmers. Maine Agriculture Commissioner Amanda Beal has called on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to include the crop in its Market Facilitation Program, which is slated to provide billions to growers negatively impacted by foreign trade retaliation. But the USDA said in a statement that the program is intended for crops that aren’t easily used in school food programs or through food banks. Wild blueberries sometimes fill those needs. The agency says the blueberries remain eligible for other USDA assistance programs.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The news of Toni Morrison’s death led a west Baltimore artist to create his own version of an ancestral shrine. The Baltimore Sun reports that 50-year-old Ernest Shaw Jr. completed a mural of the celebrated artist and Nobel laureate by Tuesday, just a day after Morrison’s death. Shaw says he considers the death of the 88-year-old Morrison to be the acquiring of an ancestor. He says creating the mural was his way of pouring libations, a reference to a ritual used to honor ancestors and deities. He says there’s no death in dying as Morrison has just transitioned to now work with “the other side.” The spontaneous mural dedicated to “TONI M” covers a Graffiti Alley wall behind Motor House and took several hours to complete.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Ever since “Boston Strong” became a rallying cry after the Boston Marathon bombing, the idea of “strong” has become an inescapable part of how this country heals after tragedy. People mourning this past weekend’s mass shootings in Ohio and Texas have rallied around the slogans “Dayton Strong” and “El Paso Strong.” After many tragedies, the mantra has been used in social media posts, memorials, pins, stickers and other mementos. Massachusetts resident Christopher Dobens co-created the blue and yellow “Boston Strong” T-shirts that helped rocket the phrase into the national lexicon. He says the idea was inspired by Lance Armstrong’s Livestrong cancer foundation and the U.S. Army’s “Army Strong” slogan. Dobens says it’s heartbreaking to see so many places have had to adopt the “strong” mantra because of violence.\n\nMichigan\n\nSt. Ignace: State and federal agencies are gearing up for a celebration of Smokey Bear’s 75-year legacy of preventing forest fires. Smokey will join staffers with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Forest Service, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and other partners Friday at Straits State Park in St. Ignace. A family-friendly birthday party is scheduled from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m. It will feature a fire truck open house, displays of wildland fire equipment, fire-prevention games, refreshments and an opportunity to meet the iconic bear. Smokey has shared fire-prevention messages with the signature phrase, “Only you can prevent wildfires.” Debbie Begalle of the Michigan DNR’s Forest Resources Division says the slogan is still relevant. Nine out of 10 wildfires are started by people.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The state Department of Natural Resources has denied requests to reconsider the tailings dam permits that it issued for the planned PolyMet copper-nickel mine. The DNR said Wednesday that opponents did not raise any new issues that materially affect its 2018 decision granting the permits. The Fond du Lac Band of Chippewa and environmental groups asked the DNR to reconsider in light of tailings dam failures elsewhere. DNR Commissioner Sarah Strommen said in a statement that her agency studied the failures but remains confident in the safety of the PolyMet dam. The DNR issued its decision one day after the Minnesota Court of Appeals stayed a different permit for the mine, governing water pollution, pending a court investigation into potential irregularities in how state and federal regulators handled that permit.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Hurricane Katrina left lasting scars on the Hurricane Camille Memorial at the Episcopal Church of the Redeemer. The church reached out to the Biloxi Fire Department, which, in turn, reached out to Lodging and Leisure Investments for help in returning the memorial to its best condition in light of the storm’s upcoming 50th anniversary. Officials tell WLOX-TV restoring the tile mosaic is the greatest challenge in the project. Other work includes power washing and cleaning each name on the memorial’s walls. Camille’s 50th anniversary will include a memorial service at the memorial site at 5 p.m. Aug. 17. Afterward, a program will be held at the Seafood & Maritime Industry Museum at 6 p.m.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Attorney General Eric Schmitt says counting of untested rape kits in the state is nearly complete. Schmitt said Wednesday that 95.6% of law enforcement agencies and 98.5% of hospitals and Veterans Affairs medical facilities have completed their inventory of sexual assault evidence kits. Former Attorney General Josh Hawley began an audit of the backlog in 2017 after the Columbia Missourian reported Missouri had never done a statewide review of untested rape kits. Schmitt began a SAFE Kits Initiative in February and appointed Judge M. Keithley Williams to lead the effort to eliminate the backlog of sexual assault kits. The counting project received funds from the Bureau of Justice Assistance. Rape kits contain DNA samples and other evidence from medical procedures conducted immediately after an attack.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A man charged with assaulting a 13-year-old boy who refused to remove his hat during the national anthem believed he was doing what President Donald Trump wanted him to do, his attorney says. Attorney Lance Jasper told the Missoulian he will seek a mental health evaluation for Curt Brockway, a U.S. Army veteran who became caught up in the heightened animosity and rhetoric gripping the nation and convinced himself he was following the president’s orders. “His commander in chief is telling people that if they kneel, they should be fired, or if they burn a flag, they should be punished,” Jasper said. He said Brockway “certainly didn’t understand it was a crime.” Brockway suffered a traumatic brain injury in a vehicle crash in 2000 that has affected his decision making, and Jasper said he plans to raise that in his client’s defense.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The remains of twins who joined the Navy together have been returned to the city for burial, decades after their deaths on a battleship at Pearl Harbor. The Lincoln Journal Star reports two ceremonies will be held in succession Saturday at Lincoln Memorial Cemetery for Rudolph Blitz and brother Leo Blitz. There will be two flag-covered caskets, two 21-gun salutes, two invocations, two flags presented to their surviving sister, 93-year-old Lincoln resident Betty Pitsch. Her DNA contribution helped bring her older brothers home. The 17-year-old twins left Lincoln High to join the Navy in 1938 and had been stationed at Pearl Harbor for a year and a day before the USS Oklahoma went down during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack by Japan. Their remains were buried at a Honolulu cemetery and later identified after being unearthed in 2015.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A jumbo jetliner that sparked controversy at last year’s Burning Man festival when it got stuck in the desert for nearly a month has returned for this year’s event after organizers agreed to post a bond for the popular art installation. The Bureau of Land Management granted a special permit to the foundation that converted the 747 into a nightclub. Burning Man officials reviewed the Big Imagination Foundation’s plans before it transported the multi-ton aircraft last weekend to the Black Rock Desert, 100 miles north of Reno. Group leaders haven’t disclosed the cost of the performance bond. They get the money back if they comply with the permit. Critics say the plane severely damaged the playa floor last year when it dug holes into the soft alkali dust and got stuck.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has signed a bill to help the state’s dairy farmers. The purpose of the bill is to provide a way to support dairy farmers by buying specially labeled milk for an extra 50 cents per gallon. The measure creates a dairy premium fund that replaces the milk producers’ emergency relief fund. Money remaining in the fund after payment of the premiums would be available to promote the program. It’s anticipated that the premium milk will be available this fall.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nKearny: Two actors from the Netflix series “Orange is the New Black” visited federal immigration detainees at the Hudson County jail Thursday. Vicci Martinez and Emily Tarver met with two female detainees from Jamaica. The actors, whose show tackled issues of immigration detention and family separation in its final season, said they wanted to draw attention to the plight of immigrants in such facilities. The visit was organized by Freedom for Immigrants, an organization that aims to abolish immigration detention and was featured in the final season of the show, and First Friends of New Jersey and New York, a nonprofit that sends volunteers to visit immigrant detainees. After leaving the jail, Tarver recounted the story of the woman she met, a victim of domestic violence who sought help from the police and wound up detained, for four months so far, when her immigration status came into play.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSan Antonio: A federal agency is taking advantage of high water levels in the Rio Grande to help a tiny minnow listed as an endangered species. U.S. Bureau of Reclamation workers recently aided in creating more habitat for the Rio Grande silvery minnow on the Middle Rio Grande, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Reclamation crews worked from January to March to lower and widen the riverbank on the southern end of private property near Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge. They excavated 46,000 cubic yards of dirt to create water channels where minnows could escape the fast-moving river. The tiny fish, listed as endangered in 1994, was once abundant throughout the Rio Grande Basin from Colorado to Texas and into Mexico. It’s now found only in a fraction of its historic habitat as the river system has seen dam building and the straightening of its once meandering channels over the past 150 years.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has approved legislation aimed at bolstering the health and safety standards for all pet dealers operating in the state. The bill signed Thursday calls for separate spaces for pregnant animals and requires all enclosures be cleaned daily and disinfected at least once every two weeks. “Pet dealers must be held to standards that will promote the safety, good health, and overall well-being of the animals in their care,” says a memo attached to the bill. Under the new law, which takes effect in 90 days, pet dealers are required to regularly groom animals to prevent matting and flea and tick infestations and provide animals with diurnal lighting cycles, which mimic natural, 24-hour light patterns. And any for-profit dealer selling, or planning to sell, at least 25 cats or dogs in a year must provide an annual veterinary checkup for each animal.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWake Forest: The city is being recognized for its commitment to preserving monarch butterflies. Wake Forest announced Wednesday that the recognition was awarded by Monarch City USA, a nonprofit organization that promotes the species and recognizes areas that work on recovering butterfly populations. The nonprofit group says that the butterflies rely on milkweed and nectar plants. The butterfly’s population has declined as the plants have dwindled. Wake Forest, northeast of Raleigh, features the plants that attract the butterflies at E. Carroll Joyner Park. The town has installed signs that identify the butterfly habitat and one noting Wake Forest’s designation as a “Monarch City USA.” The nonprofit says it’s the first in the state to receive the designation.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Two environmental groups who say regulators should have intervened in the location of an oil refinery near the state’s top tourist attraction, Theodore Roosevelt National Park, are taking their case to the state Supreme Court. The Public Service Commission last year declined to review whether the refinery could be built just 3 miles from the park in the western Badlands, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Regulators concluded the proposed $800 million Davis Refinery would be too small to warrant review under state law. The Environmental Law and Policy Center and the Dakota Resource Council don’t believe developer Meridian Energy Group is being forthright about the refinery’s size and asked a state judge to force the commission to hold a hearing. South Central District Judge Bruce Romanick refused in May, ruling that the PSC followed state law.\n\nOhio\n\nSpringdale: A long-standing community event is facing backlash on social media. A Facebook post promoting Springdale’s annual Goldfish Swim has garnered more than 3,500 comments, most outraged, since it was posted Aug. 1. The end-of-summer event has been going on for almost 40 years. More than 4,700 people have signed a Change.org petition to stop the event, saying it is “obvious” animal abuse. City officials take 1,000 feeder goldfish and put them in the Springdale Community Center Pool. Children under the age of 12 try to catch the fish with their bare hands, take them home and care for them. “No nets, poles or help from mom and dad. Bring a plastic bucket to take your new pet home,” the post about the event says. The event is scheduled for 2 p.m. Sunday at the Springdale Pool.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Police were justified when they fatally shot a black teenager who was naked and unarmed, an attorney for the city argues in a response to a civil rights lawsuit filed by the teen’s parents. The parents of Isaiah Mark Lewis contend in their federal lawsuit that Sgt. Milo Box and Officer Denton Scherman used excessive force and acted “unnecessarily and unjustly” when they hit their 17-year-old son with a stun gun and then fatally shot him April 29 after he allegedly broke into a home. In a response filed Wednesday on behalf of the city, attorney Taylor Clark denies that the city violated Lewis’ constitutional rights and says: “Lewis was justifiably shot by a service weapon after being ineffectively tasered.” “Edmond also admits that Isaiah Mark Lewis was naked and unarmed when he was shot and that verbal commands were given to Isaiah Mark Lewis prior to the shooting,” Clark wrote. The officers have been on paid administrative leave since the shooting. Taylor declined further comment.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A judge has ruled that the state Fish and Wildlife Commission illegally reversed an earlier decision granting endangered species status to the marbled murrelet, a small seabird that nests in old-growth forests. Environmental groups say Oregon has sought to avoid protections for the bird, allowing clear-cut logging in its habitat. A spokeswoman for the wildlife department said it won’t comment on legal matters. The ruling was by Lane County Circuit Court Judge Lauren Holland in Eugene. Conservation groups said they petitioned the wildlife commission to list the marbled murrelet as endangered, and it voted to do so, concluding the bird was likely to go extinct. But the commission reversed itself without explanation. Holland said the commission was required to explain its reversal and failed to do so.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Philadelphia’s Music Alliance will induct musicians spanning a wide range of genres to its Walk of Fame, including The Philadelphia Orchestra, R&B group The O’Jays and ’80s rock band The Hooters. The class of 2019’s other honorees include Philadelphia socialite and philanthropist Dorrance “Dodo” Hamilton, who died in 2017; disco queen Evelyn “Champagne” King; and Jody Gerson, the current CEO of Universal Music Publishing Group and the first woman to run a major music-publishing company. Longtime rock-radio DJ Pierre Robert is this year’s dual Radio Row Award recipient and Walk of Fame inductee. The announcements were made Wednesday at the Independence Visitor Center. The group will be formally inducted Oct. 22 during a gala at The Bellevue.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Gina Raimondo says the state will begin offering a gender-neutral option for residents to put on their driver’s licenses and birth certificates. Rhode Island will join the ranks of about a dozen other states already offering an option of “X” instead of the standard “M” or “F.” The option is in response to the governor’s conversations with the transgender and LGBTQ community. The Democratic governor says this is “just basic fairness” in order to ensure all residents are being recognized for who they are. The Rhode Island Division of Motor Vehicles and the Department of Health echoed the governor’s remarks. The governor adds that the biggest hurdle has been the implementation of the change. Residents could potentially see the option available within a year.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nAiken: Officials say the U.S. government followed a requirement to remove weapons-grade plutonium from the state. South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson said 1 metric ton of nuclear material has been shipped out of the Savannah River Site near Aiken. The U.S. Energy Department was ordered in 2017 to remove that much plutonium by January. Federal court records said half the plutonium was sent to Nevada. Wilson’s statement Wednesday didn’t say where the other half was shipped. South Carolina sued the federal agency after it halted a plan to turn plutonium once used to make nuclear weapons into fuel for nuclear reactors. The Energy Department owes the state $200 million in fines in part because 11 metric tons of plutonium remain at the site.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nBurke: As this small town recovers from a tornado that destroyed its civic center and caused other extensive damage, some residents are asking why the community’s warning siren wasn’t sounded. The EF-1 tornado with 100 mph winds ripped through Burke on Tuesday night, ripping roofs off buildings and homes, uprooting trees and leaving the school building unusable for the beginning of classes. Two men suffered minor injuries when a garage collapsed. Gov. Kristi Noem visited the community Wednesday and called the damage “unbelievable.” Noem promised the state’s help in the community’s restoration efforts. Burke Mayor Thomas Glover says the siren is sounded when officials get notification of a tornado sighting or that one is imminent. Glover says that did not happen.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Add Glen Campbell to the list of late country music legends with a museum in their honor in the city’s downtown. Clearbrook Hospitality LLC announced plans Thursday to open The Glen Campbell Museum and Rhinestone Stage, a live music venue, at the corner of Broadway and 2nd Avenue. It’s slated to open in early 2020. Campbell died in 2017 at age 81 following an extended battle with Alzheimer’s disease. The 4,000-square-foot venue will feature immersive, interactive displays showcasing different stages of Campbell’s career. He was a studio musician in The Wrecking Crew; the singer of many hit records including “Rhinestone Cowboy” and “Southern Nights”; and a television and film actor. In the evenings, the museum will transform into live music venue The Rhinestone Stage, where national and local acts can perform intimate shows.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state’s annual back-to-school sales tax holiday is coming this weekend. The Texas Comptroller’s Office says the tax break begins Friday and runs through Sunday. Customers can buy most clothing, footwear, school supplies and backpacks – sold for less than $100 – tax free from a Texas store or from an online or catalog seller doing business in the state. The sales tax exemption applies only to qualifying items. The tax break does not include products such as jewelry, handbags, briefcases, luggage, computer bags, umbrellas, wallets and watches. The Texas sales tax holiday weekend started in 1999.\n\nUtah\n\nRiverton: Administrators from more than 60 schools in northern Utah gathered ahead of the first day of classes to assemble “care kits” for students in need. The Deseret News reports administrators from the Jordan School District met Wednesday to pack more than 2,400 kits, which include food, personal hygiene products and backpacks loaded with school supplies. Walmart donated the supplies. Event organizer Peggy Margetts said the kits help students in a discrete way and show students their school cares about their well-being. Students will receive the kits at the start of school. Administrators said they will keep some on hand to use during the year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets says the state’s cheese producers won 44 ribbons at the American Cheese Society’s annual awards competition. Officials say this is Vermont’s best showing yet. The results were announced at the society’s annual conference last week in Richmond, Virginia. Agriculture officials say five Vermont cheeses were finalists for the best in show. A total of 25 Vermont companies submitted cheeses to be judged among the more than 2,000 total entries. Vermont Gov. Phil Scott congratulated the state’s cheesemakers on their “impressive achievement.” He says their “commitment to excellence is helping Vermont grow its economy by creating jobs and further strengthening our great Vermont brand.”\n\nVirginia\n\nBlacksburg: Town officials are cracking down on an unsanctioned Virginia Tech fraternity they say is operating in violation of zoning rules. Blacksburg officials recently determined the house is being used as a base for the rogue frat Omega Alpha Kappa. Zoning Administrator Paul Patterson said frat activities at the house must stop. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports the fraternity is not recognized by the university and was formed by members of Kappa Delta Rho when that chapter was suspended for violating alcohol policies. The fraternity has a history of trash citations and accusations that members made female guests at social events feel uncomfortable. The Roanoke Times reports the university has advised students to avoid the fraternity and seven others for their safety.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A $219 million property-tax levy that would abolish overdue fines in the Seattle Public Library system is heading toward approval. The Seattle Times reports the seven-year levy supporting the library system had 73% of the vote in returns Tuesday. The measure proposed by Mayor Jenny Durkan would authorize additional property taxes and replace a $123 million library levy set to expire at the end of this year. The levy would collect about 12 cents per $1,000 of assessed property value in 2020. The additional library funding would support seismic renovations, new programs for children, more social workers, extended operating hours and the elimination of fines for overdue items. About $167 million would be used to maintain current services.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s Public Port Authority board has decided to consider lease proposals and bids for the Heartland Intermodal Gateway Facility in Prichard. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the board made a motion Wednesday in Charleston to delay a possible public sale. West Virginia Transportation Secretary Byrd White says the board discussed selling it because of a funding shortage. Wayne County Commissioner Jeff Maddox says the county’s economy isn’t the best, but a sale for “pennies on the dollar” would be “a grave error.” The board will further discuss options at its September meeting. The $32 million facility opened in 2015 on 76 acres donated by Norfolk Southern railroad. It’s designed to move containers more efficiently by rail through a double-stack method while offering a cheaper alternative to gas-guzzling trucks.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State prison officials say they illegally released information that could reveal whether inmates are in substance abuse treatment. The Department of Corrections said Thursday that officials responding to an open records request released records June 24 that contained 1,041 inmates’ personal identification numbers and locations. No names were released, but DOC officials say someone could use the numbers and locations to learn whether an inmate is at a substance abuse facility or receiving treatment. The agency says that information is confidential under Wisconsin law. Only two people saw the information, and they’ve since confirmed the data has been destroyed. DOC spokeswoman Molly Vidal didn’t answer emailed questions asking who received the questions and what information they actually wanted.\n\nWyoming\n\nMeeteetse: A ranch where black-footed ferrets were discovered in the 1980s is being preserved. The Nature Conservancy recently announced a conservation easement agreement to restrict the Lazy BV ranch’s 2,300 acres near Meeteetse from being subdivided or developed. The ranch is in the area where the ferrets were discovered in 1981 after they were thought to be extinct. The ferrets were used to start a captive-breeding program that has restored black-footed ferrets in Wyoming, Colorado, Montana and elsewhere in the western U.S. Jim Luchsinger of The Nature Conservancy tells Wyoming Public Radio it had been a dream of the ranch owners to protect the ranch and bring ferrets back. The protected land is also home to greater sage grouse, mule deer, antelope and Yellowstone cutthroat trout.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/05/yukon-salmon-void-south-beach-battle-bloody-sunday-project-news-around-states/119020282/", "title": "Yukon salmon void, South Beach battle: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nSelma: The world knows the names of John Lewis and a few more of the voting rights demonstrators who walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in 1965 only to be attacked by state troopers on a day that came to be called “Bloody Sunday.” A new project aims to identify more of the hundreds of people who were involved in the protest. Auburn University professors Richard Burt and Keith Hebert, working with a group of honors college students, have established a Facebook page where people can look through photographs from March 7, 1965, and identify themselves or others in the black-and-white images. Online since August, the page titled “Help us identify the Selma Bloody Sunday Foot Soldiers” features multiple images of marchers who are labeled with red numerals, and users can add the names of people they recognize in the comments section. Some people already have been identified, and the creators hope more will join them as word spreads about the page, particularly in Selma, where the effort is being promoted. A class at Selma High School is helping as students enlist relatives to help identify marchers. The project “highlights the need for additional historical research and documentation for one of the most famous moments in American history,” Hebert said in a statement released by the university.\n\nAlaska\n\nStevens Village: For the first time in memory, both king and chum salmon on the Yukon River have dwindled to almost nothing, and the state has banned salmon fishing there, even the subsistence harvests on which Alaska Natives rely to fill their freezers and pantries for winter. The remote communities that dot the river and live off its bounty – far from road systems and easy, affordable shopping – are desperate and doubling down on moose and caribou hunts in the waning days of fall. “Nobody has fish in their freezer right now. Nobody,” said Giovanna Stevens, 38, a member of the Stevens Village tribe who grew up harvesting salmon at her family’s fish camp. “We have to fill that void quickly before winter gets here.” Opinions on what led to the catastrophe vary, but those studying it generally agree human-caused climate change is playing a role as the river and the Bering Sea warm, altering the food chain. Many believe commercial trawling operations that scoop up wild salmon along with their intended catch, as well as competition from hatchery-raised salmon in the ocean, have compounded global warming’s effects on one of North America’s longest rivers. Many Alaska Native communities are outraged they are paying the price for generations of practices beyond their control, and many feel state and federal authorities aren’t doing enough to bring Indigenous voices to the table.\n\nArizona\n\nLake Havasu City: The city is playing up its roots with a month of celebratory events marking the 50th anniversary of the dedication of the London Bridge after its piece-by-piece rebuild in the western Arizona resort town along the Colorado River. Scheduled October events include a parade, powerboat racing, theater and musical performances, a costume contest and sports competitions. Lake Havasu City founder Robert McCulloch bought the stone bridge in 1968 for approximately $2 million and had it transported by ship and truck from London in pieces across the Atlantic Ocean and via the Panama Canal and Los Angeles. That process and reconstruction took three years, leading to the October 1971 dedication. The city of London had decided to replace the bridge because it was sinking and unfit to withstand increased automobile traffic. In Lake Havasu City, which has population of about 57,000, the bridge spanning a channel between the shoreline and an island in the river has become a major tourist attraction. Following a Friday ribbon-cutting, the 50th anniversary celebratory events got underway in earnest over the weekend with a candlelit feast and ball Saturday evening, followed by a Sunday morning garden brunch and tea leading into a costume contest, the Today’s News Herald reports.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Arkansas Supreme Court on Thursday said it wouldn’t allow the state to enforce its ban on mask mandates by schools and other government bodies, while lawmakers clashed over efforts to prohibit businesses from requiring employees get COVID-19 vaccines. In a one-page order, justices denied the request by the state to stay the August decision blocking enforcement of Arkansas’ mandate ban. More than 100 school districts and charter schools have approved mask requirements since the ruling against the law. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who signed the law but later said he regretted it, had asked the court to deny the request to stay the ruling. Meanwhile, the GOP-led Senate voted to send eight bills limiting or prohibiting employer vaccine mandates back to a committee following complaints that they were rushed through a day earlier without public comment. The bills proposed include one that would allow employees to be exempted from vaccine mandates if they have philosophical or religious objections or have medical contraindications. Another would allow employees to be exempted from vaccine mandates if they’re tested weekly for the coronavirus or can prove they have antibodies, even though health officials say antibody tests should not be used to assess immunity from COVID-19.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Black women in the state are more likely to die within a year of pregnancy than women of other races, prompting a wave of policy changes this year that culminated Monday with Gov. Gavin Newsom signing a new law aimed at reducing the disparity. The law, among other things, creates a new committee within the Department of Public Health to review maternal deaths throughout the state by interviewing family members and doctors while exploring records and other reports. The law is the the last piece of what’s been nicknamed the “Momnibus” bill – a reference to the legislative term “omnibus” that generally means one bill that combines multiple pieces of legislation on a number of topics. Most of the “Momnibus” changes this year happened in the state budget, which Newsom signed into law over the summer. California now will give lower-income women health insurance for up to one year after pregnancy instead of for only two months. The state’s Medicaid program, a government-funded health insurance plan for the poor, will also now pay for doulas – trained professionals who support mothers before, during and after childbirth. And the state is spending $35 million to help pay for programs that give low-income pregnant women monthly cash payments with no restrictions on how they can spend it.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Denver Zoo has apologized more than a decade after a Black man died after a confrontation with police on zoo grounds. Zoo President Bert Vescolani publicly apologized to Gail Waters on Friday for her son Alonzo Ashley’s July 2011 death, The Denver Post reports. The 29-year-old was visiting the zoo when he reportedly started acting strangely and ran to find a water fountain. A zoo volunteer called for police, who tackled Ashley and shocked him with a stun gun. According to a coroner’s report, Ashley was placed face down on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back and his legs crossed and pressed toward his buttocks. He began convulsing and stopped breathing before paramedics arrived. The coroner ruled Ashley’s death was caused by cardiorespiratory arrest brought on by heat, dehydration and exertion during the struggle. The district attorney’s office cleared the eight officers involved, but the city paid Ashley’s family $295,000 in 2016 to settle a lawsuit. For years, the zoo refused to acknowledge any responsibility. The death led to protests and calls for accountability for staff and volunteers for failing to recognize Ashley was in distress and no danger to the public. Many in the Denver’s Black community boycotted the zoo. On Friday, a water fountain and cooling station were dedicated in Ashley’s honor.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The city’s Civilian Review Board plans to investigate the actions of an officer who punched a man in the head three times during a trespassing arrest and was later cleared of wrongdoing by the police department. Police officials said the use of force by officer Justin Cole during the January arrest was “reasonable and not excessive” as the man fought with officers, and the finding was reviewed by an independent use-of-force expert, Hearst Connecticut Media reports. Richard Crouse, a member of the Civilian Review Board, said the panel has decided to look into the police department’s internal affairs investigation, which cleared two other officers involved in the arrest, and will report its findings to the public. Acting Police Chief Renee Dominguez said the officers were found to have complied with policies and procedures, but the outcome of the call was not ideal. Police responded to an office building Jan. 29 for a harassment complaint made by the man who authorities said struggled with officers and was punched by Cole. Another person at the scene complained the man was disruptive and trespassing, which he denied. Police officials say officers tried to de-escalate the situation for about an hour before arresting the man.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A civil rights organization is calling for the firing and arrest of a police officer seen on video repeatedly slamming a man’s head during an arrest last month at a Southbridge convenience store. During a Monday afternoon press conference, NAACP members said they will also call for the resignation of Wilmington Police Chief Robert J. Tracy and for a federal investigation of the incident. “This is another example of police brutality and police disrespect for the Black community,” Delaware NAACP President Richard Smith said. “The attorney general of the United States really needs to come in and take over the police department or come in and help us with the Wilmington Police Department, New Castle County Police Department and other police departments that abuse us in the Black community.” The officer involved in the incident has not been identified, but Wilmington police have said the three-year member of the force has been placed on administrative duty. The pressure on Wilmington Police Department to be forthright about what happened during the Sept. 21 incident in which a 44-year-old man’s head was repeatedly slammed into plexiglass is increasing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The weekend saw the return of live music with two outdoor festivals in D.C., WUSA-TV reports. On Saturday, dozens of people gathered on front lawns and in front of commercial buildings in the Adams Morgan neighborhood for the popular Porchfest festival. More than 60 local bands participated on makeshift stages throughout the area. Then on Sunday, the third annual Southeast D.C. Porchfest returned to the Penn Branch neighborhood. The seven-hour festival featured dozens of performers and local vendors. A similar event happened earlier this year in Petworth, with bands performing on front porches of volunteer houses down a 3-mile stretch of the neighborhood.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Miami Beach wants to turn down the volume in the South Beach party neighborhood, citing increasingly raucous crowds, public drinking and growing violence, but efforts to curb the carousing have raised complaints about racism, classism and business practices along one of the nation’s most glamorous waterfronts. The 10-block stretch of Ocean Drive known for art deco hotels, restaurants and bars is sandwiched between two areas that cater to more affluent tourists. The tension has been bubbling for years as party crowds grew from a few weekends a year into a year-round presence. The situation worsened during the pandemic as city officials closed the main drag to vehicles and allowed restaurants to offer more outdoor seating, which invited a carnival atmosphere on the street. More than 1,000 people were arrested during this year’s spring break, when the city imposed a rare 8 p.m. curfew. Authorities sent military-style vehicles to disperse predominantly Black crowds with rubber bullets, prompting criticism from Black activists and spawning a parody on “Saturday Night Live.” Last month, the city increased the number of law enforcement officials covering the neighborhood to a record high. Mayor Dan Gelber, who called it a stopgap measure, has proposed rebranding the blocks known as the entertainment district by hosting higher-end concerts and fairs, focusing on family-friendly events, and marketing the city’s often-overlooked museums and symphony. He also wants to limit loud music and halt alcohol sales at 2 a.m.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Four parents are suing the Cobb County school district on behalf of their children, saying its failure to require masks means their students cannot safely attend in-person classes because of their disabilities. The suit filed Friday in federal court in Atlanta says the 107,000-student suburban district is violating federal law, including the Americans with Disabilities Act and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Those laws govern how students with disabilities are treated in public schools. “Rather than using the known and available tools to mitigate the threat of COVID-19 and protect plaintiffs’ access to school services, programs, and activities, the district has acted with deliberate indifference to plaintiffs’ rights to inclusion, health, and education,” the complaint alleges. Last week, when the Southern Poverty Law Center threatened the lawsuit on behalf of the students, Cobb schools told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that “as is the case with any issue, individual student needs are supported on a student-by-student basis, and we actively encourage any student or family to discuss their needs with their local school.” The lawsuit asks that U.S. District Judge Timothy Batten Sr. order the district to follow guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Preventionn on masks, ventilation, physical distancing and contact tracing.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: An invasive plant species that is toxic to cattle and highly flammable has been found on the Big Island. Chromolaena odorata, also known as “devil weed,” was found on the east side of the island earlier this year, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Officials worry the invasive plant, first detected in the state on Oahu in 2011, could harm the cattle industry and fuel future wildfires on the Big Island. Devil weed has small, sticky seeds that can be transported easily, said Franny Brewer, spokeswoman for the Big Island Invasive Species Council. “Right now, we’re actually lucky that it’s just on the east side of the island,” Brewer said. “It usually likes the warmer and drier areas, so if it gets over (to the west side), that could be very bad.” An additional concern for cattle ranchers is an invasive species of insect that is also invading local pastures. Brewer said the two-lined spittlebug is attracted to nutrient-rich grass on which cows graze and can devour a pasture, leaving the land open to the introduction of devil weed. The plant’s leaves contain a substance that is highly flammable, Brewer said, which could increase the threat of increasingly common wildfires in Hawaii.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A partial recount of ballots cast during the 2020 presidential election has validated the accuracy of the results, state officials say, despite manipulation claims by Trump ally and MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell. The Idaho secretary of state’s office said Wednesday that a hand inspection of ballots in Camas and Butte counties found margins of error of less than 1% – far below what Lindell had claimed in saying votes for former President Donald Trump went to President Joe Biden. Lindell has made unsubstantiated claims and floated conspiracy theories about last year’s election in multiple states in an attempt to undermine voter confidence in the outcome. That has extended even to Idaho, where Trump easily won the deep-red state with nearly 64% of the vote. “The office of the Idaho Secretary of State takes free, fair, and accurate elections seriously,” Republican Secretary of State Lawerence Denney said in a statement. “So when we are presented with allegations that come with specific details which we can examine, we want to do so.” The secretary of state’s office said a document questioning Idaho’s vote count appeared on a website with a copyright belonging to Lindell. It claimed votes cast for Trump were electronically switched to Biden in every county. Denney’s office recorded video of both counties’ recount processes.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A new relief fund launched by city officials could give a boost to hundreds of artists and entertainment industry workers who have lost income during the pandemic. The $2.3 million Chicago Creative Worker Assistance Program will benefit members of the arts and entertainment industry with grants ranging from $2,000 to $5,000, the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events announced Thursday. Arts administrators, teaching artists, artisans, curators, independent cultural producers and technicians who lost income over the past 18 months because of coronavirus restrictions will be eligible for the aid, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement that she hopes the funding can provide relief for creatives, as many of them are gig workers whose pandemic unemployment insurance benefits have expired. DCASE Commissioner Mark Kelly said he’s looking forward to the city’s talented artists returning to the spotlight this fall along with the resurrection of entertainment venues, which are gearing up for a busy end of the year. The relief fund’s announcement comes nearly a week after Navy Pier hosted “Chicago LIVE Again!” – a two-day outdoor festival that celebrated the return of live performances.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A longtime Democratic state senator from northwestern Indiana has decided to leave her seat in frustration over iron-fisted Republican control of the Legislature. Sen. Karen Tallian of Ogden Dunes submitted a letter Thursday to Senate leaders that she would be resigning effective Nov. 1, about a year before her term ends. Tallian was sharply critical of Senate Republicans, saying that “after 16 years I’ve had enough.” “The process has become degraded. Every bill is vetted, in secret, by the Republican caucus,” Tallian told The (Northwest Indiana) Times. “So it becomes impossible to have real debate on the floor most of the time because they’ve already decided what gets to be heard and what won’t.” Tallian has been a longtime advocate of legalizing marijuana, an issue that’s been blocked from debate by Republicans who have a 39-11 Senate majority. Tallian raised that issue as she spoke on the Senate floor Friday. “Some time in the future, maybe near, maybe nearer than you think, Indiana will join the rest of the country and address the marijuana question,” Tallian said. “And when you do, think of me.” Democratic precinct committee members in Tallian’s district will select a new senator for the 2022 legislative session.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The city has canceled a contract with a private security company more than two months after reports revealed troubling remarks by its CEO, who referred to local racial justice protests as “terrorism.” The city’s contract with the Conley Group was to end at midnight Monday. City Manager Scott Sanders said in a statement that both parties reached an agreement to end the contract, while an attorney for company CEO Tom Conley said the Conley Group asked the city to end its contract early, citing “high customer demand.” The company was set to see its $250,000 city contract more than double in July, until Conley’s remarks surfaced in a Des Moines Register investigative report. It had been providing security services to the city since early 2020 at locations including City Hall, the Argonne Armory, the municipal services center and the former Dico Superfund site. The city launched an internal investigation in July after Conley sent inflammatory emails to Des Moines officials, including some that made disparaging remarks about George Floyd and members of the central Iowa-based Black Liberation Movement.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Some counties are seeing youth vaccination rates for COVID-19 far below the national average, according to state data released last week. A school pandemic workgroup established by Gov. Laura Kelly received data from the Kansas Department of Health and Environment showing that in about a quarter of the state’s counties, less than 20% of vaccine-eligible children ages 12 to 17 had received at least one dose as of Sept. 24. U.S. regulators in May expanded the use of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine to children as young as 12. The national vaccination rate for youth is 57%, according to a presentation by Marci Nielsen, a special advisor to Kelly. Most of the low-vaccine counties are in western Kansas or other rural areas. By comparison, no Kansas county has less than 20% of its total eligible population fully inoculated, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Johnson, Douglas and Riley counties exceed the national rate for youths, Nielsen said. Decatur County in northwest Kansas reported the lowest rate with 3% of youths receiving a first dose. Parents have commented on social media that they won’t get their kids vaccinated because they value free choice or think kids are less likely to become severely ill, said Derek Chambers, lead pharmacist at Ward Drug in Oberlin.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A deteriorating bridge that was home to thousands of endangered gray bats has been repaired in way that makes the span safer for motorists and wildlife, officials said. A project team from the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet partnered with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to make a habitat-focused design as crews replaced the bridge superstructure with new beams, deck and railing and made repairs to the existing abutment and piers, state officials said in a statement. Repairs on the rural, two-lane span were made in a way that provides more roosting space for the bats. After construction, officials estimated more than 1,000 bats had returned to the bridge. Officials didn’t release the span’s exact location in an effort to prevent interference with the bat habitat. “This bridge project is the first of its kind in Kentucky, using an innovative and collaborative approach to mitigate the effects of much-needed bridge repairs on an important endangered species,” Transportation Cabinet Secretary Jim Gray said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: Southwest Louisiana leaders say the disaster assistance approved by Congress will be too little to solve the lingering housing crisis and other needs caused by Hurricane Laura, which struck the region more than a year ago. Billions of dollars in federal disaster aid were included in legislation passed by Congress on Thursday that also helped avoid a government shutdown. Lake Charles Mayor Nic Hunter said the package has $1.6 billion in disaster block grant aid to split among states for all the 2020 disasters, with southwest Louisiana anticipated to get $600 million for Laura and the follow-up blow of Hurricane Delta. “When you look at other singular hurricanes over the last 20 years and the billions of dollars that have flowed down to those communities, $600 million is crumbs,” he said. Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration has estimated the unmet needs for Hurricanes Laura, Delta and Zeta at roughly $3 billion. Calcasieu Parish Police Jury President Brian Abshire said in a statement that while the parish has waited patiently for federal aid, “Washington politics has diluted the relief bill,” which he called a “feel-good bill” that “makes no one but the federal politicians actually feel good, and it will do very little for Calcasieu Parish.”\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: A Canadian company plans to bring ferry service back to Bar Harbor next year, restoring service between Maine and Nova Scotia. Bay Ferries operated ferry service from Bar Harbor to Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, for more than a decade before moving to Portland and ending service in 2009. Bay Ferries tried to return for the 2019 season but failed to get the ferry terminal renovated and approved in time. Then came the pandemic that scuttled service in 2020 and 2021. Now the company is ready to try again with a high-speed catamaran-style ferry called “The Cat.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Officials say the state will again spray pesticide Permanone 30-30 to control mosquito populations, after EPA testing determined it does not contain dangerous PFAS. The Baltimore Sun reports the Maryland Department of Agriculture temporarily halted use of the pesticide in the state this year “out of an abundance of caution” after testing by an outside lab found 3,500 parts per trillion of one type of PFAS and 630 parts per trillion of another, said MDA spokesman Jason Schellhardt. But testing by EPA scientists at Fort Meade returned a different result. PFAS, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances, are also known as “forever chemicals” because they can linger in the human body for long periods of time. Laboratory tests have shown that accumulated PFAS can cause tumor growth in animals, in addition to problems with kidney, liver and reproductive function. Ruth Berlin, executive director of the Maryland Pesticide Education Network, one of the groups that commissioned the earlier test of Permanone 30-30, said she wasn’t satisfied by the new results from EPA scientists.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A former police union boss in the city has pleaded guilty to collecting more than $16,000 in fraudulent overtime pay while working at the department’s evidence warehouse, federal prosecutors said Monday. Thomas Nee, 64, of Quincy, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit theft concerning programs receiving federal funds and embezzlement from an agency receiving federal funds. A plea hearing has not yet been scheduled. Nee submitted false and fraudulent overtime slips from at least January 2015 through February 2019 and personally collected about $16,642 for overtime hours he did not work, prosecutors said. He’s the 15th former or current officer charged in connection with the investigation into overtime abuse at the police department’s evidence warehouse. Nine officers have so far pleaded guilty. Federal officials say more than $250,000 was embezzled. Nee was a longtime president of the Boston Police Patrolmen’s Association who served until 2014. The embezzlement charge carries a sentence of up to ten years in prison and the conspiracy charge up to five years.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoed several Republican-sponsored election bills, saying they would have perpetuated falsehoods to discredit the 2020 presidential election and made it tougher for people living in large senior facilities and apartment complexes to vote. Two measures would have codified existing practices by limiting access to Michigan’s voter database and keeping electronic pollbooks and voting systems from being connected to the internet on Election Day. The bills implied that outside parties had access to the files and that electronic pollbooks were connected online when neither was the case, the governor wrote to lawmakers. She also blocked a measure that would have expanded the types of buildings that can be polling places to include private conference centers and recreation clubhouses. It included a provision to let municipalities put polling places at senior facilities and apartment complexes with at least 150 residents, as they can now, but only if public buildings like schools were “not reasonably available for use or convenient to use.” Whitmer vetoed the legislation Sunday night at the NAACP Detroit branch’s annual Fight For Freedom Fund Dinner. The bills, she said, “attempt to suppress the vote or perpetuate the ‘Big Lie’ – the calculated disinformation campaign to discredit the 2020 election.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Renville County must conduct an environmental review to determine whether a proposed drainage ditch improvement could harm one of the last free-flowing creeks in the heavily agricultural western county, the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled Monday. The appeals court reversed a decision by the county board, which concluded the study wasn’t necessary. The Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy, which challenged the county’s decision, said the court’s ruling sets a precedent that means any drainage project across the state that affects public water will require an environmental review. The dispute involves proposed improvements to a century-old ditch that empties into the upper reaches of Limbo Creek. Backers say the project would lead to better drainage of farmland. The Renville County Board declined in 2020 to order an environmental assessment worksheet because the creek’s upper reaches didn’t appear on an official inventory of “public waters” kept by the state Department of Natural Resources. But the Court of Appeals ruled that upper Limbo Creek nevertheless meets the state’s definition of public waters, so the review is mandatory. Limbo Creek flows directly into the Minnesota River, which has long been a major contributor of silt and farm chemicals to the Mississippi River.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: The city is planning to spend most of its federal pandemic relief money on parks and recreation, and critics say elected officials are ignoring people who need housing. Starkville is receiving $6.2 million from the American Rescue Plan Act. Aldermen voted Sept. 21 to spend $5.5 million of it for parks and recreation, $500,000 to hire police officers and $200,000 to improve water infrastructure in a subdivision, the Commercial Dispatch reports. Cate Van Hurdle, a representative with the Starkville Strong community action group, said homelessness and evictions are increasing in Starkville. “Because there is no money going to help these people, the city may be forcing people to possibly live in the parks or sleep in those parks,” Van Hurdle said. Federal guidelines say the pandemic recovery money may be spent on things including tourism; water, sewer and broadband infrastructure; assistance to businesses and families disproportionately affected by COVID-19; and premium pay for public employees. Mayor Lynn Spruill developed Starkville’s spending plan with the help of city attorney Chris Latimer, focusing heavily on tourism. While Spruill acknowledged homelessness and other infrastructure needs, she said other sources of money can be used to address those issues.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Pope Francis has joined the chorus of people calling on Gov. Mike Parson to grant clemency to a death row inmate who is set to be executed for killing three people during a 1994 convenience store robbery. In a letter last week, a representative for Pope Francis wrote that the pope “wishes to place before you the simple fact of Mr. Johnson’s humanity and the sacredness of all human life,” referring to Ernest Johnson, who is scheduled to be executed at 6 p.m. Tuesday at the state prison in Bonne Terre, about 50 miles south of St. Louis. Parson, a Republican, has been considering whether to reduce the 61-year-old Johnson’s sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole. Johnson’s attorney, Jeremy Weis, has said executing him would violate the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits executing intellectually disabled people. He said multiple IQ tests and other exams have shown that Johnson has the intellectual capacity of a child. He also was born with fetal alcohol syndrome and in 2008 lost about 20% of his brain tissue to the removal of a benign tumor. Racial justice activists and two Missouri members of congress – Democratic U.S. Reps. Cori Bush of St. Louis and Emmanuel Cleaver of Kansas City – have also called on Parson to show mercy to Johnson, who is Black.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A district judge has denied a request by several parents to halt mask mandates in city schools while a legal challenge of the mandates is underway. The parents sued several Missoula schools in August over their mask requirements, arguing they violated the state’s constitution, which guarantees individuals the right to make their own medical decisions. Missoula District Judge Jason Marks denied the request for a preliminary injunction Friday, saying in his decision that such an injunction could lead to increased spread of COVID-19 and quarantining of children and school staff. The decision came the same day dozens of Montana residents gathered at the state Capitol on Friday to decry mask mandates for schoolchildren. The rally was led by Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen, a Republican. Lawyer Quentin Rhoades, who represents several parents suing Missoula public schools over their mask requirements, said in August that there isn’t sufficient scientific evidence that children wearing masks prevents the spread of the coronavirus for the government to override parents’ rights to make decision about their children’s’ health. But several studies by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found school districts without a universal masking policy in place were more likely to have COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A woman believed by many to be the oldest living American has celebrated her 115th birthday. The Omaha World-Herald reports Thelma Sutcliffe marked her birthday quietly at the facility where she lives in Omaha. Sutcliffe was born Oct. 1, 1906, in Benson, Nebraska, which is now part of Omaha. Her parents owned a farm. At age 17, she married Bill Sutcliffe, who worked for the Postal Service. He died in the early 1970s. The Gerontology Research Group said Sutcliffe became the nation’s oldest living person April 17 when Hester Ford died in North Carolina at age 115. The oldest person in the world is believed to be 118-year-old Kane Tanaka of Japan, who was born Jan. 2, 1903.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: A flurry of laws passed by the Legislature this year took effect Friday, ushering in reforms that Democratic lawmakers who have majorities in the state Senate and Assembly have long campaigned to implement. Five years voters approved legalizing recreational cannabis in Nevada, business owners can now apply for licenses to establish on-site consumption lounges, where adults can smoke, “dab” or eat THC-laced edibles that they buy. Once licensed, the lounges will become the first public places in Nevada where pot products can be consumed recreationally. The state’s emerging cannabis industry has promoted the lounges for their economic development potential and pitched them as a draw for the millions of tourists who visit Las Vegas annually but can’t legally use the products in places like hotels. The permitting system created under the new law prioritizes Black and Latino applicants who have been “adversely affected by provisions of previous laws which criminalized activity relating to cannabis.” A points-based system to score applicants was introduced after data showed the state’s cannabis industry to be disproportionately white and male – a finding that concerned lawmakers and advocates who said it pointed to the racial disparities in how drug offenses were prosecuted.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Granite State filmmakers have explored the life of composer Amy Beach in a newly released documentary, highlighting her success story of the early 1900s as a widely recognized female pianist and composer. Beach was a New Hampshire native who taught herself how to compose symphonies while performing with world-renowned orchestras, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. John Grfoerer, the documentary maker, said that options for Beach were quite limited in the 1900s and that she might otherwise have gone on to appearing in more performances instead of composing. Grfoerer said even though she was denied the proper education to become a trained composer, she found a way to teach herself. The film premiered Friday on the Bank of New Hampshire stage.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: The nation’s most expensive Superfund cleanup to remove cancer-causing pollution from the Passaic River will be expanded to include 9 more miles in Bergen, Passaic and Essex counties under a plan approved Monday by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. But the $1.84 billion project to clean all 17 miles of the lower Passaic is still several years away from launching, officials said Monday. The $441 million expansion plan would excavate 387,000 cubic yards of contaminated river mud and place a barrier over the rest in a stretch of the river from North Arlington to the Dundee Dam, which spans the waterway between Clifton and Garfield. The plan comes more than seven years after the EPA unveiled an ambitious $1.4 billion “bank to bank” cleanup of the lower 8 miles of the Passaic from Newark Bay to Belleville where much of the pollution is concentrated. That dredge and cap project has not yet begun. “We know we can’t turn around a century of pollution overnight, but today as part of the solution we’re taking a very important step,” EPA Deputy Administrator Janet McCabe said during a virtual news conference Monday. EPA officials have wanted both projects on the river to be done concurrently to minimize disruptions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: New Mexico State University says less than a third of its students submitted proof of vaccination for COVID-19 by a Thursday deadline to otherwise undergo weekly coronavirus testing or leave the university. While 72.3% of the school’s employees provided proof of vaccination, only 30% of students did, officials said Friday. It’s not clear how many students who didn’t submit proof of vaccination by the deadline plan to submit weekly test results, officials said. “We’re not where we want to be with our vaccinated students,” said Jon Webster, the school’s COVID-19 project manager. “We want to make sure we’re protecting all of our students.” Failure to submit vaccination information or weekly test results can result in student suspension or staff termination, officials said. Students can get inoculated at any point in the semester and cease the weekly required testing once achieving full vaccination, Webster said. “We are seeing new submissions continue to come in, so we expect our final verified total to be significantly higher than what we’re seeing today and to continue to rise over the next several weeks as some students and employees receive their second dose and update their cards,” Webster said. Several students said Friday that they were unaware of the mandate’s details.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A statue honoring George Floyd in Union Square Park was vandalized Sunday, police said. According to police, a video showed an unidentified man on a skateboard throwing paint on the statue about 10 a.m. then fleeing. Sunday’s act wasn’t the first example of vandalism to the statue memorializing Floyd, whose killing at the hands of police in Minneapolis last year galvanized a racial justice movement across the country. The statue was unveiled on Juneteenth on Flatbush Avenue, in Brooklyn, and was vandalized five days later with black paint and marked with an alleged logo of a white supremacist group. Members of the group that installed the statue cleaned it, and local residents and one of Floyd’s brothers gathered in July as it was prepared to move to Manhattan. Meanwhile, city officials have suspended nine firefighters without pay in connection with a string of racist messages and memes they shared on their phones, including ones mocking Floyd’s death, The New York Times reports. A spokesperson called the suspensions the most severe punishments ever handed down in the history of the Fire Department of the City of New York, according to the paper. Black firefighters told the Times they believed the suspensions fell far short of deep-rooted problems in the department, where leaders have acknowledged that racism, sexism and harassment have been tolerated.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nSmithfield: A school board has passed a policy barring critical race theory in its classrooms after county commissioners threatened to withhold nearly $8 million in funding. The Johnston County school board on Friday unanimously approved an updated policy on how history and racism will be taught, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Under the new policy, teachers could be disciplined or fired if they teach that American historical figures weren’t heroes, undermine the U.S. Constitution in lessons or describe racism as a permanent part of American life. The all-Republican Johnston County Board of Commissioners was withholding $7.9 million until the school board passed a policy keeping critical race theory out of local classrooms. A revised code of ethics policy includes new wording such as “the United States foundational documents shall not be undermined,” and “all people who contributed to American Society will be recognized and presented as reformists, innovators and heroes to our culture.” April Lee, president of the Johnston County Association of Educators and an eighth grade social studies teacher, said the school system is “selling our souls to the devil for $7.9 million” and called the new policy “basically extortion.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Progress is being made on making the state Capitol more accessible to those who are physically disabled. State leaders have approved constructing new bathrooms and making other renovations to better accommodate wheelchairs. Over the next year, a meeting room will be made into three larger family restrooms that will be handicap accessible. “Just thinking about what it’s like to walk around here if I were visiting the Capitol with little kids, there are not accommodating spaces to take kids to the bathroom, other than to take them all into the women’s restroom or whatever,” said Sen. Erin Oban, D-Bismarck, KFYR-TV reports. There will also be wider doors installed for some meeting rooms. Contractors will be hired in the coming months, and construction will start shortly thereafter.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio State University has now tallied more than 2,800 instances of alleged, decades-old sexual misconduct by the late team doctor Richard Strauss, according to its latest campus crime data. The school says more than 170 total instances of rape and more than 2,600 instances of fondling attributed to Strauss came to light between 2018 and 2020, much of that through a law firm investigation for the university and lawsuits filed against OSU. The crime statistics are disclosed under the federal Clery Act, and incidents are counted in the year they’re reported, not the year they occurred. The 2020 data in the report adds dozens of instances of rape and about 470 instances of fondling attributed to Strauss. Hundreds of men allege he abused them at campus athletic facilities, a student health center, his home and or an off-campus clinic, and some of those men reported multiple instances. They say the school failed to stop Strauss despite students raising concerns during his 20 years at the university. Ohio State has apologized, and it announced settlements with 185 plaintiffs totaling nearly $47 million and with dozens more people for amounts not yet disclosed. A judge recently dismissed some of the biggest unsettled lawsuits, citing legal time limits. Plaintiffs in those plan to appeal. Still other cases are pending.\n\nOklahoma\n\nStillwater: A retired Army colonel is helping the city prepare to host dozens of refugee families from Afghanistan. U.S. Army Col. Mike FitzGerald, a 20-year veteran and current operations manager for Catholic Charities of Eastern Oklahoma, said the first families are expected to start arriving Nov. 1. “These are people that are asking for our help,” he told the Tulsa World. “They are young families with small children. These aren’t the bad guys.” Accommodations are being provided by Oklahoma State University and private landlords, FitzGerald said. “Stillwater is a very welcoming community and home to a lot of international students as part of OSU and has been a very diverse community because of our status as a university town,” Mayor Will Joyce said. “I would expect that any new refugee or other international visitors will find it to be a very welcoming place.” Organizers have also set up a committee structure to help with transportation, adult and children’s education, jobs, household supplies, furniture and groceries. The children may enroll in Stillwater Public Schools, FitzGerald said, and English language classes will be available. The U.S. Department of State is also providing $1,225 per person in a family, and work authorizations are being expedited so family members can find work quickly.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Three neighborhoods will soon be home to the city’s first “safe rest villages.” Commissioner Dan Ryan is leading the effort to construct six city-sanctioned outdoor homeless villages by the end of the year, Oregon Public Broadcasting reports. He announced the downtown, Brentwood-Darlington and Hazelwood locations Thursday, saying the sites are a critical response to the “humanitarian crisis” unfolding on Portland’s streets. While there hasn’t been an official count of the city’s homeless population since 2019, encampments appear to have proliferated during the pandemic. These villages will be outdoor shelters where people experiencing homelessness can safely stay and receive basic services. Showers, beds, bathrooms, and support services including case management and mental health support will be offered. Ryan, who oversees the city-side of the Joint Office of Homeless Services, emphasized that each village will be fenced, with each individual possessing their own “sleeping pod.” Combined, the city expects the three sites to host about 120 people. “We can’t wait for affordable housing to be ready for every houseless person,” Ryan said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Powerful labor leader Johnny “Doc” Dougherty went on trial Monday in a City Hall corruption case that accuses him of keeping a City Council member on the union payroll to push his agenda. Dougherty, 61, who has steered more than $30 million in union funds to political candidates, faces a later extortion trial over other union activities. He expressed confidence that he would clear his name as he arrived for jury selection Monday at the federal courthouse, The Philadelphia Inquirer reports. “I have had zero crimes,” Dougherty said outside the courthouse, making a zero with his hand for emphasis. “So this is a relief. I can’t wait to get in and get this done.” Dougherty had been in the FBI’s sights for years before the 2019 indictment charged him with more than 100 crimes, including keeping City Council member Bobby Henon in a $70,000-a-year union job while he worked full time in the $140,000-a-year City Council post. Dougherty has held a tight grip on construction jobs in the Philadelphia region during more than two decades at the helm of Local 98 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which has nearly 5,000 members. He also leads the city’s Buildings Trades Council, an umbrella group of local unions with 70,000 members.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingstown: Researchers at the University of Rhode Island and their colleagues at Penn State have been awarded a four-year, $1.5 million grant to study the effects of sea level rise and how it may worsen the impact of extreme weather, URI said in a statement. The goal is to help communities, the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service adapt and improve their resilience as the climate continues to change and hurricanes and nor’easters continue to increase in frequency and severity, the statement said. The grant is from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which says the rate of sea level rise is accelerating. Sea level plays a role in flooding, shoreline erosion and other hazards, affecting nearly 40% of the U.S. population. Yet there is a lack of research available when it comes to how the impacts of nor’easters and hurricanes may be amplified as a result. “There are a number of studies that have been done looking at just sea level rise or just extreme weather, but what we’re really lacking in terms of clear understanding is the combined impact of these two phenomena,” said oceanography professor Isaac Ginis, who is leading the study.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Dylann Roof wants an entire appellate court to reconsider a decision to recuse itself from hearing his case, as the appeal of his death sentence and conviction in the 2015 racist slayings of nine members of a Black congregation winds its way through the judicial system. Last week, Roof’s attorneys made that request of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, writing that the judges who opted to sit out his case should reinstate themselves to consider his petition for a new hearing before the court. Without that move, or changing a court rule prohibiting judges visiting from other circuits from considering such requests, Roof’s lawyers wrote that “no judges exist to consider” his rehearing petition, depriving him of “a critical level of appellate review.” All of the judges from the 4th Circuit, which covers South Carolina, have recused themselves from hearing Roof’s case. No explicit reason was given in the court’s notice of that move in May, although one of the judges, Jay Richardson, prosecuted Roof’s case as an assistant U.S. attorney in 2017, when Roof became the first person in the U.S. sentenced to death for a federal hate crime. Authorities have said Roof, then 21, opened fire during the closing prayer of a Bible study at Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, raining down dozens of bullets on those assembled.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Dozens of National Guard members from the state will answer a call from the Pentagon to help at the country’s southern border, with 125 members of the 1742nd Transportation Company being deployed for 9 to 12 months. Gov. Kristi Noem, Sens. John Thune and Mike Round, and Rep. Dusty Johnson were on hand for an activation ceremony Sunday at the University of Sioux Falls Stewart Center, KELO-TV reports. “So they’re going to go down there, try and reinforce the border, bring some order and stability, and obviously do it in a humanitarian and compassionate way,” Thune said. “We want them to know that we have their back,” Johnson said. “We understand that they’re going to be sacrificing a lot; their families are going to be sacrificing a lot over the next year. But we’re going to do the kind of things that we can do in Washington to make sure that they have the proper training, the proper equipment, but also in our communities to make sure their families are taken care of during the difficult time.” In July, Noem sent 50 South Dakota soldiers to the border following Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s request for help.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: In the first case of a new session, U.S. Supreme Court justices heard allegations that the city is essentially stealing groundwater from underneath Mississippi. That argument faced skepticism from members of the court Monday in Mississippi’s effort to get millions in damages for what officials say is Tennessee’s trampling over its sovereignty when it comes to water. At issue is whether Memphis city government, city-owned utility Memphis Light, Gas and Water, and the state of Tennessee have been pumping water in a way that has harmed Mississippi and siphoned off the water that was underneath it in the Claiborne Aquifer, of which the Memphis Sand aquifer is a region. Mississippi argues that, essentially, the water underneath the state belongs to it and no other state despite the fact that the aquifer in question is under eight states, not just Mississippi. It wants its northern neighbor and Memphis to pay millions in damages for past pumping of water – damages, that, if awarded, would be a huge financial liability for the city. Mississippi’s argument is one that it has made for years and that several courts have found lacking. A special master, a term for an official appointed by a court to oversee a case and hear arguments, also disagreed with Mississippi’s take.\n\nTexas\n\nLeague City: Police have arrested a man who was accused of stabbing a restaurant manager with a pocketknife after being told he needed to wear a mask. The stabbing happened in March at a Jack in the Box restaurant in League City, just southeast of Houston. Authorities had issued an arrest warrant for James Schulz Jr. shortly after the stabbing occurred, but he wasn’t taken into custody until last week, police said. At the time, police said Schulz refused to follow the restaurant’s policy requiring him to wear a mask to protect against the spread of the coronavirus. Police said he then attacked the manager. The manager had three stab wounds in the arm and upper torso, police said. He was taken to a hospital, where he was treated and released. Schulz was arrested Wednesday on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and disorderly conduct. Jail records did not list an attorney who could speak on his behalf.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Hundreds of maskless people packed a legislative hearing Monday to urge lawmakers to fight President Joe Biden’s plan to require most workers to get either vaccinated against COVID-19 or regularly tested for the coronavirus that causes it. The vast majority of people who attended the hearing in person criticized Biden’s plan, saying they fear it will infringe on personal freedom and cripple Utah’s economy. Sen. Curt Bramble said about 600 to 700 people attended the hearing in person, with another 200 who attended virtually. Last week, Republican Gov. Spencer Cox threatened to veto any legislation that blocks businesses from mandating employees to get the vaccines. He has said he opposes government mandating vaccines but supports businesses implementing their own mandates. Biden’s Sept. 9 announcement is expected to cover as many as 100 million Americans – private-sector employees as well as health care workers and federal contractors. Some mandates seem to have converted hesitant workers, but employers are still dealing with holdouts. The COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use in the U.S. were tested on tens of thousands of people and have proven to be both safe and effective at dramatically reducing the risk of serious disease and death.\n\nVermont\n\nVergennes: The state’s earliest known Black sheriff and police chief has been commemorated with a historical marker. The marker for Stephen Bates, who served as sheriff and police chief from 1879 until his death in 1907, was unveiled in Vergennes on Sunday at an event attended by at least 100 people, WCAX-TV reports. “Stephen Bates’ life and service represents immense perseverance overcoming enslavement to become a prominent member of the community in Vermont and dedicating his life to serving the people of Vergennes,” Gov. Phil Scott stated in a proclamation deeming Oct. 3, 2021, Sheriff Stephen Bates Day in the state. Bates was born in 1842, was enslaved in Virginia and gained his freedom through serving with Union soldiers during the Civil War, according to the governor’s proclamation. A team of community members and historians have been researching Bates’ life for the past year. “People started to join us from historical areas,” said Alicia Grangent of the Historical Marker Team. “Conversations about who to reach out to started to happen, and people just started to naturally gravitate towards this process.” Team members found and talked with some of Bates’ descendants, including great-grandchildren Larry and Nicholas Schuyler, who attended Sunday’s ceremony.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A medical glove manufacturing facility promising to employ nearly 2,500 people is coming to southwest Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam announced Monday, calling the news the biggest job-creation announcement in the struggling region in a generation. Backed by significant federal spending, the project in Wythe County, 250 miles west of the state capital, is expected to create a number of jobs per capita equivalent to Amazon’s new headquarters in Arlington, according to the governor’s office. Northam called the project a big win for southwest Virginia and said the pandemic and associated supply chain problems had shown the need for more domestic production of personal protective equipment. Two companies, Blue Star Manufacturing and American Glove Innovations, have agreed to form a joint venture and invest $714 million to create both a nitrile butadiene rubber manufacturing facility and a nitrile glove production operation, according to a news release. The facilities are expected to occupy more than 200 acres at an industrial park near the junction of interstates 77 and 81. The project will increase the raw material production and manufacturing of gloves now primarily made in Asia, Northam’s office said.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: An invasive fungus that causes white-nose syndrome in bats continues to spread in the state, after the fungus was detected in late spring near Rimrock Lake. During spring and summer field work this year, scientists with the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife and U.S. Forest Service detected the fungus or disease in Yakima, Chelan and Mason counties, according to a news release. Scientists collected samples in the spring from a bat colony on Forest Service land near Rimrock Lake. Testing confirmed the presence of the fungus that causes white-nose syndrome, the Yakima Herald-Republic reports. The syndrome is harmful to hibernating bats but does not affect humans, livestock or other wildlife. The disease is caused by a fungus that attacks the skin of hibernating bats and damages their wings, making it difficult to fly. Infected bats often leave hibernation too early, which causes them to deplete their fat reserves and become dehydrated or starve to death. Washington is home to 15 bat species that are important predators of night-flying insects. These bats benefit humans by eating insects that can negatively affect forest health, commercial crops and human health.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A popular riverfront festival is returning to the city next year after a decade­long absence. The Charleston Sternwheel Regatta will take place over the Fourth of July weekend next year, Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin said in a news release Friday night. The Regatta was held as an end-of-summer festival from 1971 to 2009. It ran for as long as 10 days and included fireworks, concerts, carnival rides and food vendors. Goodwin said people have asked her to bring the Regatta back since she took office in 2019. “Regatta means so much to so many,” she said. “Because of the overwhelming amount of feedback we received, it was a priority for us to bring back this famed Charleston event.” The statement said a full schedule of events will be announced in the coming months.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State Department of Natural Resources officials on Monday dramatically scaled back the number of wolves hunters can kill during Wisconsin’s fall season in open defiance of its policy board, setting up another clash between liberal-leaning department leaders and conservative board members. Department biologists originally recommended setting the quota at 130 wolves, saying they were uncertain what effects the state’s spring hunt had on the wolf population. The policy board bumped the limit to 300 animals in August, prompting outrage from conservationists and wolf advocates, who have filed two lawsuits seeking to stop the hunt. The DNR announced in a news release Monday that it was unilaterally moving the quota back to 130 animals. Under treaties established in the 1800s, the state’s Chippewa tribes can claim up to half of the quota, but the Chippewa consider wolves sacred and won’t hunt them. The DNR said the tribes have claimed 56 animals, leaving state-licensed hunters 74. The DNR’s defiance left board member Greg Kazmierski flabbergasted. He said state law makes clear that the board directs and supervises the department. “They are not free to just do that,” Kazmierski said. “It’s in violation of the statute that establishes the board. They’ve gone rogue is what they’ve done.”\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: An autopsy has determined that a man whose body was found on the shore of a Yellowstone lake died of hypothermia, park officials said Wednesday. Mark O’Neill, 67, of Chimacum, Washington, had been on a four-night backcountry trip to Shoshone Lake with his brother, Kim Crumbo, 74, of Ogden, Utah. A relative reported them overdue Sept. 19. Searchers found O’Neill’s body Sept. 20 on the lake’s eastern shore. A search for Crumbo on foot and by boat will continue, weather permitting, for several days, park officials said in a statement. A vacant campsite was found on the lake’s south side. What happened remains under investigation, they said. The men were experienced boaters and former National Park Service employees, and Crumbo is a former Navy SEAL who served in Vietnam. Crumbo co-founded the conservation group Grand Canyon Wildlands Council, which later merged with another group to form Wild Arizona.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/indiana/2020/09/09/20-years-later-story-bob-knights-firing-iu-basketball-20-years-later-story-bob-knights-firing-iu-bas/5750680002/", "title": "Bob Knight's firing from IU basketball 20 years later", "text": "BLOOMINGTON – Twenty years ago Thursday, Indiana University fired Bob Knight.\n\nAn institution of higher learning that had, to that point, existed for 180 years, and surely intends to keep on going for another 180 or more, may never again know a more fractious day.\n\nKnight’s firing ended the 29-year tenure of arguably the greatest basketball coach of a generation, a cultural icon whose importance transcended his sport and whose philosophies had come to define for many people what it meant to live in this part of the world.\n\nHow the relationship between Knight, his fans and IU’s administration reached that breaking point remains a matter of debate. Collect 100 alumni in a room and you’ll find a variety of opinions on the circumstances surrounding Knight’s dismissal, and just as many on the man and his legacy.\n\nThis account makes every effort to leave that debate to the wider world. It instead focuses on those fraught, tense, unforgettable days in September 2000. This is the story of Bob Knight’s firing, through the memories of those who lived it.\n\n(Note: This oral history will be presented largely through a series of quotes and recollections from people in some way involved in Bob Knight’s dismissal. It draws from firsthand interviews conducted by IndyStar with former IU players, administrators and others, as well as coverage of the event itself at the time. An attempt to reach Knight through a friend was unsuccessful. Many other key figures in the events surrounding the university’s decision, including former IU coach Mike Davis, numerous former players and former trustees either declined comment for this story, or did not respond to interview requests from IndyStar. Other noteworthy officials involved, including former IU President Myles Brand and other trustees at the time, have since died. Kent Harvey, contacted about a separate story to be packaged to this one, also declined comment, saying he wished to leave the incident in the past. Where applicable, this story will clarify quotes drawn from prior reporting, either by IndyStar or by other news media. All other quotes cited come from first-person accounts given to IndyStar in the last few months.)\n\n***\n\nMyles Brand woke Terry Clapacs with a phone call early on a Sunday morning. Clapacs at that time was chief administrative officer of the university, and it wasn’t uncommon for him to work on weekends. That had been a particularly long one, and IU’s president had a request.\n\nClapacs: “In those days, the president sort of alternated between living in Bryan House (on the Bloomington campus) and living in the Lilly House in Indianapolis. He was at the Lilly House that weekend. He said, ‘I’d like you to come up right away, and have a conversation with the basketball coach. Fairly soon, he’s going to call me, and I’d like you to come up.’”\n\nThe preceding months had been difficult. In March, on the eve of the NCAA tournament, CNN/SI published video supporting an allegation that Knight choked former Hoosier Neil Reed during a 1997 practice. A headline across the top of the March 15, 2000, IndyStar read ‘Ex-player’s allegations turn spotlight on Knight,' as then-editor Tim Franklin assembled a team of reporters to delve into the culture surrounding the program.\n\nIU’s response was swift. At a news conference held at Assembly Hall, multiple players defended their coach, and then-athletic director Clarence Doninger expressed confidence in his own investigation of the initial allegation, raised years earlier.\n\nDoninger in a March 15, 2000, IndyStar article: “I talked with every player and coach, and nobody had anything to say.”\n\nJohn Walda, then president of IU’s board of trustees, told IndyStar he didn’t “put much stock” in old allegations.\n\nBut the board nevertheless commissioned an investigation into Knight’s conduct. Headed by Walda and then-trustee Fred Eichhorn, that investigation started March 23 and ran seven weeks. Walda and Eichhorn interviewed 29 people, including IU staff, current players and former players, affirming some alleged misconduct while disproving some as well.\n\nIt did confirm the Neil Reed incident.\n\nThe previous weekend had been Mother’s Day, and commencement at IUPUI. That Saturday night, Brand called Clapacs, and asked him to drive to Knight’s house in Bloomington. There, Clapacs and Knight spoke for some time.\n\nClapacs: “Coach Knight had been a good friend. I considered him a good friend. Myles asked me to go out to his house on that Saturday night and say that a lot of this was coming to a head, and there was a lot of pressure about his future at Indiana University. That was coming from trustees as individuals. Not a board-of-trustees official push, but obviously you’ve got nine people that have opinions. So, I went out to (Knight's) house that Saturday night, and we talked for a long, long time.\n\n“The result of that was, we called Myles. It was almost midnight. We said could we come over to Bryan House. He said, 'Sure.' We went to Bryan House, coach and his wife. It was from that meeting then — it started around midnight, lasted until about 2 in the morning — that this whole concept of zero-tolerance policy was put in place. Coach agreed to it, made changes. It was back and forth. We finally got to a place where he felt he was comfortable with it. The next morning, then, at our meeting with the trustees in Indianapolis, Myles was very much in coach Knight’s corner. He said, ‘I think we’ve got something here that will work.’”\n\nThe following Monday, Brand and the trustees revealed the results of the investigation, and measures taken because of it. Knight would serve a three-game suspension during the coming season, and have $30,000 withheld from his salary. A commission would be established to develop an athletic department-wide code of conduct. Brand told reporters he informed Knight he had the full backing of his trustees to dismiss Knight at that time.\n\nClapacs: “It was always recognized by the board of trustees and by the president, Myles Brand, that any decision about coach Knight was solely the responsibility of president Brand.”\n\nBrand elected instead to go forward with a policy now famous (or infamous, depending upon your point of view) in the long history of IU basketball.\n\nBrand, in a May 15, 2000, news statement: “This is a zero-tolerance policy. If coach Knight had not agreed to all these steps, I would have recommended to the trustees that he be terminated now, and I believe the trustees would have concurred with that recommendation.”\n\n***\n\nThe first week of September 2000 meant football returned to Bloomington. Philip Rivers’ North Carolina State team was in town for Cam Cameron’s fourth season opener as head coach at IU. More than 31,000 people attended a 41-38 Wolfpack win.\n\nKent Harvey, then an IU freshman, apparently planned to be one of them when he turned up at Assembly Hall on Thursday of that week, Sept. 7. Harvey was among a group reportedly at the arena to pick up football tickets, when it encountered Knight.\n\nHarvey, speaking to the Indiana Daily Student in September 2000: “My intentions were to say, ‘Hi, Mr. Knight.’ It came out wrong. I said ‘Knight.’ The whole incident happened because I forgot to say ‘mister.’”\n\nThe story has been told different ways in the years since. What’s agreed upon is that Harvey greeted Knight, then Knight stopped Harvey to chastise him for a perceived lack of respect.\n\nFrom there, stories diverged. Harvey’s brother said Knight grabbed Kent Harvey forcefully by his arm and loudly cursed, demanding more respect. Speaking in his defense during a news conference that Friday, Knight described the episode differently.\n\nKnight, in a Sept. 9, 2000, IndyStar article: \"I looked at him and said, ‘Son, my name isn’t Knight for you. It’s Mr. Knight or coach Knight.'\"\n\nBoth Knight and assistant coach Mike Davis, who reportedly witnessed the incident, disputed Harvey’s account of the incident, particularly with regard to the nature of physical contact between the pair. In that same news conference, Davis called Harvey’s story “the biggest lie I ever heard in my life.”\n\nKnight, in a Sept. 9, 2000, IndyStar article: “I would have to be an absolute moron, with the things that have been laid down on me, to grab a kid in public and curse a kid in public. That is absolutely, totally untrue.”\n\nThe story spread, fueled in part by Mark Shaw, a one-time Bloomington radio host and Knight critic. Shaw was also Harvey’s stepfather.\n\nHe contacted IndyStar the next day to report the incident.\n\nShaw, in a Sept. 9, 2000, IndyStar article: “I don’t care if we’re talking about Bob Knight, the president or some guy on the street, that kind of conduct is not tolerated. My stepson was shocked and intimidated by coach Knight.”\n\nIU tasked its police department with investigating the incident.\n\nClapacs: “The incident in the Assembly Hall was, I thought, a lot to do about nothing. I didn’t think it amounted to much. And I certainly didn’t think it was a violation of the zero-tolerance policy. But because there was so much interest in all this — the police department was part of my portfolio in those days — we had the IU Police Department look into the matter.”\n\nA report was expected the following Monday.\n\nClapacs: “The preliminary information I had from the police was that it was nothing. Really, nothing.”\n\n***\n\nBut the story gathered force as it reached the media. Reporters and news vans descended on Bloomington. What once looked like a normal football weekend turned into something more.\n\nFormer Hoosier and current IU assistant Mike Roberts: “We used to all park our cars in that yellow circle drive (in front of the south entrance to Assembly Hall). They never towed us. You’d park there and all the sudden there would be all the media trucks. … When I tell you it was crazy, there wasn’t social media, but imagine being a kid and you get out of a meeting and there’s 45 TV trucks out there.”\n\nFormer Hoosier Jared Jeffries: “Never in a million years would you ever expect for coach to be let go, especially the way he was. I just remember when we kind of got the news that there had been another incident. Once we got the news that there had been another incident, we also thought there was no way Myles Brand would be able to let coach go.”\n\nPlayers weren’t shy in the press that weekend, voicing their support for their coach. Sophomore forward Jeff Newton, who also reportedly witnessed the incident, said he never heard Knight swear.\n\nSenior forward/center Kirk Haston, in a Sept. 10, 2000, IndyStar article: “Give this kid and his stepdad their 15 minutes of fame and then let them go back into the woodwork. People are trying to bait (Knight). It has just gotten worse. They all want to be the one to get Knight fired.”\n\nPlayers began to sense the perilous nature of Knight’s position during a meeting with Brand and Doninger at halftime Saturday.\n\nRoberts: “I just remember by Friday media being around, coach not being at workouts, and then it was kind of like, 'What’s going on?' We knew it was really serious when they had a meeting with us at halftime of the football game on that Saturday.”\n\nIU’s campus had begun to polarize, many students rallying behind Knight. IU’s administration, Clapacs said, planned to wait until Monday, and the delivery of the police department’s final report, to make a final decision.\n\nBut Saturday, Brand also gathered the board of trustees together in a now-famous closed-door meeting. David Uchiyama, then an Indiana Daily Student reporter, was offered a job at the Chattanooga Times Free Press upon graduation for his coverage of one of the most talked-about gatherings of the board in its history.\n\nUchiyama: “It wasn’t the story (Knight) got fired. It was the pair of stories I did about the board of trustees and Myles Brand skirting sunshine laws. It was the stories about meetings at Brand’s house — if it wasn’t at Brand’s house it was at a trustee’s house — and Brand would go from one room to the other.\n\n“They weren’t in the same room and so they weren’t ‘breaking the law’ because it didn’t constitute a quorum.”\n\nBecause Brand kept the trustees in smaller groups to avoid a quorum, the meeting could take place behind closed doors without breaking the law. The university would later face a lawsuit over that decision, one university counsel Dottie Frapwell defended it in the press.\n\nFrapwell, speaking to the Herald-Times in October 2000: “People were in town and Myles was sharing information. We did not want a quorum there. That’s true.”\n\nWhatever the board's mind, or Brand's, an IndyStar headline the next day dripped with uncertainty: ‘IU players not optimistic after meeting with Brand.’\n\nJunior forward Tom Geyer, in a Sept. 11, 2000, IndyStar article: “I just didn’t leave with the feeling that coach’s job is real secure.”\n\nOn Sunday morning, Clapacs’ phone rang early. Brand was on the other end.\n\n***\n\nBrand had called not just Clapacs, but also Frapwell, then head of the office of university counsel. Separately, they drove to Brand’s home in Indianapolis.\n\nAccording to IndyStar reporting, Brand had had a conversation the previous Friday evening with Knight. Knight planned to leave for a fishing trip, and Brand asked him to postpone. Knight declined.\n\nFrom a Sept. 11, 2000, IndyStar article: \"Brand told The Star he cannot pinpoint when he decided Knight had to go. But a case of 'gross insubordination' on Friday night didn't help.\n\n\"Brand and Knight were in a conversation about 10:30 p.m., discussing last week's incident, when the coach said he planned to leave Saturday morning for a Canadian fishing trip. Late Sunday, Knight returned to Indiana.\n\n\"Brand asked him several times to postpone the trip because of the ongoing circumstances that had the campus a whirl and to stay in Bloomington.\n\n\"Knight refused.\"\n\nClapacs: “Myles then said to me and to Dottie, ‘A third time, as president of Indiana University, and you as the basketball coach, I’m asking you to be here in my office on Monday morning. (Knight) said, ‘No, I’m not going to do that.’ Myles said, ‘Then I have no choice but to dismiss you from your coaching responsibilities at IU.’\"\n\nThe next 48 hours were chaotic.\n\nBrand hastily arranged for a news conference in Indianapolis. Media left the Colts’ home opener at the RCA Dome en masse. Everyone headed up West Street to IUPUI.\n\nUchiyama: “I was in the RCA Dome covering Colts-Raiders. The message was, ‘(Expletive) the game, get your ass (to IUPUI).’”\n\nPlayers found out at a meeting called by head athletic trainer Tim Garl, then began making plans to drive to Indianapolis for the news conference.\n\nJunior guard/forward Kyle Hornsby: “We all wanted to be there to be kind of visual support for coach. At that point, we were a little jolted, to say the least. When, from a personal and team standpoint, one of the reasons you came there is no longer going to be there, everybody was trying to figure out is this really going to happen, and then what’s going to happen to this team and this university from here. Who’s staying and who’s going? Who’s going to be the coach? What’s the coaching staff going to look like? Is there going to be revolt such that they’ll actually not do it? We didn’t know.”\n\nJeffries: “There were so many rumors. All this played out over the course of a week. It wasn’t like now, where it would be in real time, something happens and it’s all on social media, on Twitter, being reported live.\n\n“We have a meeting. Tim Garl called and said, ‘Everybody in the locker room at this time.’ We all get to the locker room, go over it. He’s been fired, and they don’t know what’s going on.”\n\nAt the news conference, Brand laid out his reasons for firing Knight. He cited zero-tolerance, mentioned an alleged incident in which Knight “verbally abused a high-ranking female university official in the presence of other persons” and said Knight had flouted the authority of his superiors.\n\nBrand in the Sept. 10, 2000, news conference: “There was a continued unwillingness by coach Knight to work within the normal chain of command of the IU athletics department. I personally asked coach Knight on May 13 to resume the normal chain of command with Athletics Director Clarence Doninger. He has adamantly refused to do that.”\n\nThe board split almost immediately. In that day’s reporting alone, trustee Peter Obremskey expressed support for Knight, saying, “The straw that broke the camel’s back, I thought, was a pretty weak straw.” Other board members saw things differently.\n\nTrustee Stephen Backer, in a Sept. 11, 2000, IndyStar article: “If he had lived by the guidelines, we would all be living happily ever after.”\n\nThen-trustee Ray Richardson told IndyStar “the votes were there to fire” Knight after the board’s investigation concluded in May. Richardson pointed to an unspecified example Brand put forth of “gross insubordination” from Knight over that weekend in September, saying it “exemplified the problem.”\n\nRichardson in a Sept. 11, 2000, IndyStar article: “The university got all sorts of flak from the national media for giving Bob Knight one last chance, and then he failed us.”\n\nIndiana’s campus community was rocked by the news. There were demonstrations outside Bryan House, the president’s on-campus residence, and outside Assembly Hall. News coverage the next day spoke of police officers in riot gear, and demonstrators burned what appeared to be an effigy of Myles Brand, while Knight made a brief public appearance Sunday night at Assembly Hall.\n\n“There’s nobody that’s ever coached that appreciates the support of students as much as I have,” he told fans outside the arena, before asking them to go home so the police officers standing guard there could too.\n\nUchiyama: “(Knight) delivers something along the lines of, ‘Hey folks, really appreciate your support, thank you,’ whatever his message is. ‘But hey, you see these guys right here,’ referring to the state police, ‘they’re out here and they don’t need to be. They’re out here because you are. If you all go home, they can go home. They can hug their wife and kiss their kids.’\n\n“He waved his hand and they were gone. That tells you the man still held a lot of power.”\n\n***\n\nFellow coaches rallied to Knight. Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, who played for Knight at Army, called Knight’s firing “tragic.” Michigan State coach Tom Izzo told IndyStar at the time, “For guys like me, I admired what he accomplished and what his programs stood for. Did I agree with everything he did? Not always. But I don’t agree with everything I do.”\n\nThen-Kansas coach Roy Williams in a Sept. 11, 2000, IndyStar article: “People can say he’s had 100 chances, but I think he should have 100 more. The great things he has done completely outweigh the other things he gets criticized for.”\n\nIU players met with Knight at his house, and many were also present at Brand’s news conference.\n\nJeffries: “Once we got the news he was going to be fired, it was like mayhem broke out. There were protests on campus. I went to my parents house, and then we had a meeting with coach at his house. It was emotional, man. There were guys saying they were with coach. Whatever he decided to do, wanted them to do, they were going to do it.”\n\nAdministrators moved swiftly to fill IU’s head-coaching position. Brand consulted players over the possibility of a search, but many, if not most, advocated for promoting either Mike Davis or John Treloar, two of Knight’s assistants.\n\nJeffries: \"After they let coach go, and after there were rumors and rumblings that a lot of players weren’t happy, were thinking of transferring and leaving, I sat down with Myles Brand. He said, 'Should we start a coaching search right now?' I was like, 'No.'\"\n\nJunior guard Dane Fife in a Sept. 11, 2000, IndyStar article: “If (Davis and Treloar) are not kept on staff, we may not have a team next year. We may be left with four guys.”\n\nIU floated the possibility of elevating the two men as co-head coaches, before deciding to name Davis interim head coach, with Treloar as his lead assistant.\n\nClapacs: “A lot of the players, I think they were afraid someone from the outside would come in. They were familiar with John and Mike, and they liked that solution very much. They were going to sort of co-coach. Somebody had to be the head coach, and that was Mike, and that was at John Treloar’s suggestion. But they sort of had equal responsibility, and as I recall, we paid them equally that year.”\n\nHornsby: “Every time (transferring) was brought up, I would say the vast majority of us said, ‘That’s crazy, we’re not all leaving.’ It wasn’t that some of us didn’t want to. I think some of us were even so emotional at the time that some of us may have said that. But I think as you sit down and realize, we loved playing with each other, we loved our teammates, we loved the university, and it was a tough situation to be in, but we needed to make the best decisions for us as well.”\n\nThe following Wednesday, Knight spoke to a large crowd at Dunn Meadow, in the heart of IU’s campus. He encouraged attendees to leave Kent Harvey alone, saying, “This thing, believe me, had happened to me long before that situation took place. That kid is not responsible for my not coaching at Indiana, and make sure you understand that.”\n\nKnight also sat down with the Indiana Daily Student, then ESPN’s Jeremy Schaap, for separate interviews after his termination.\n\nUchiyama: “We talked to Knight for four hours. He says, there’s somebody else I think you should talk to. You can ask him any questions you want. Out walks a man in a fine suit wearing an NBA championship ring and is unmistakably Isiah Thomas. We talked to him for about an hour, and we finish up with him, and Knight says, there’s someone else you should talk to, and it’s Digger (Phelps).”\n\nKnight’s sitdown interview with Schaap covered a range of topics, including Knight’s claim that the university’s zero-tolerance policy had never been thoroughly explained to him. He also suggested he had considered an unnamed position elsewhere the previous summer, before deciding to remain at Indiana.\n\nKnight in ESPN interview: “I probably should’ve gone somewhere else. There would be somebody that was a better fit as a basketball coach for this administration and these people. And there would be someplace that would be a better fit for me as a basketball coach than Indiana is right now. …\n\n“I think for my sake, I think it would’ve been far better for me, recognizing as I did long before May, that this just wasn’t a situation for me, that I should’ve just gotten out of the situation.”\n\nSchaap asked Knight in the interview whether he was “embarrassed” by his termination.\n\nKnight in ESPN interview: “Not at all. What I am is proud. I am really proud of what our basketball program turned out at Indiana. I’m not going to single this player out or that player out, because I’ll miss players. But I’m just so proud of the kind of kid we’ve turned out here, and the kind of men these kids have developed into. I’m really proud of the accomplishments that these kids had.”\n\n***\n\nKnight sat out the season before taking the head job at Texas Tech in 2001. He coached there for more than six years, making the NCAA tournament four times.\n\nFor IU basketball, the controversy did not subside right away. But Davis worked hard to shut out distractions as much as possible, building a team spirit that lasted more than just one season.\n\nHornsby: “I remember vividly, the very next day, we had an early-AM practice where we just ran. I think looking back on that, I don’t think he was shy about it, but he just said things are going to be business-as-usual as much as possible. We’re going to work, we’re going to get better, it’s going to be tough, and if you’re not prepared for that, then you can’t be here.”\n\nRoberts: “That team, by the next year, we were really good at blocking out distractions and not listening to outside noise. …\n\n“From April 2000 through that entire year when coach Davis became the permanent head coach in March or April of ’01, it was never just basketball. There was always a lot of outside noise. We were like, ‘Hey man, let’s get to work. Let’s focus on what matters.’”\n\nIU won 21 games in 2000-01, landing a No. 4 seed in the NCAA tournament and securing Davis’ job permanently. The next season, anchored by a veteran core, Jeffries’ Big Ten player-of-the-year performance and a roster hardened by immense adversity, Indiana played all the way to its first appearance in a national championship game in 15 years.\n\nJeffries: “You’ve really got to give coach Davis a lot of credit. Give coach Knight credit for putting together a really good roster. Coach (Knight), even when he talked to me before that year, two weeks into workouts, he was excited. He was going to get really creative.\n\n“He felt like it was one of the best rosters he’d put together in a long time. He was excited about it. Coach Knight saw the talent, and coach Davis saw the talent.”\n\nOff the court, IU’s fan base quarreled passionately. Some alumni swore they’d never come back to the university. Some, driven away by their objection to Knight’s prior behavior, returned. Folklore told of IU fans who began donating to Texas Tech to support their old coach, and Red Raiders apparel began turning up in Bloomington.\n\nEvansville attorney Pat Shoulders, a trustee since 2002, served then as head of IU’s alumni association, putting him in front of thousands of alumni across the country.\n\nShoulders: “I came into the national chair of the IU Alumni Association on Sept. 1, 2000. Ten days later, I came home from work, and there were two television trucks in my front yard wanting me to comment on the dismissal of coach Knight.\n\n“I was as close to an IU ‘official’ of any kind as the news in this town could find.”\n\nShoulders remembers Doninger being booed when he was introduced at football games. Presentations to individual alumni association chapters across the country could get equally tense.\n\nShoulders: “They were always well-attended. I can remember being in the San Francisco/Oakland area, down in Los Angeles. We would have sort of a canned presentation about IU and alums and new developments. We would say, ‘Are there any questions?’ and then you’d feel like diving under the table. All our alums wanted to talk about was coach Knight’s dismissal.”\n\nIt would take years for IU’s fan base to feel truly recovered. In some ways, it might never have.\n\nBrand’s tenure as president lasted just two more years. He left Indiana to lead the NCAA, where he remained as president until his death in 2009.\n\nClapacs: “His whole agenda at Indiana University was over after that decision. He had to move someplace. No matter where he went, the issues of the university were always set aside because people wanted to talk about coach Knight and the firing. Was it the right thing to do? Was it the wrong thing to do? You couldn’t talk about, ‘I want to spend zillions of dollars on research,’ or, ‘I have a new academic program I want to put in place,’ or, ‘We’re going to do something with the hospitals in Indianapolis.’ Everything got back to coach Knight. And his wife had a tough time after that. I thought it was unfair.”\n\nClapacs insists Brand never wanted Knight’s tenure to end as it did.\n\nClapacs: “I can tell you this: Myles Brand did not want to fire Bob Knight. He admired coach Knight. He thought he was a great coach. He knew great coaches sometimes had difficult personalities. But he wanted to make it work. It was a great disappointment for Myles Brand to get to where it eventually did, when the dismissal came. He did not want to do that. I know that. We talked about it. Many times.\n\n“He got a bad rap out of it. He was the villain all of a sudden. A couple years later, I went with Myles — he was at the NCAA then, and he called and he said, 'Will you be my guest to go to the Super Bowl in Detroit, the Steelers and the Seahawks.' He said, 'We’ll fly up and go to the game, be the special guests of CBS.' I said, 'Sure.' So, we go up, go to the Super Bowl. We’re sitting in the stands, and behind us, people started throwing pennies at him. I just thought he had a tough life after that.”\n\nIU has not returned to the perch Knight set the program upon during his 29-year tenure. Davis’ time in charge peaked with the 2002 national title game. He was replaced in 2006 by Kelvin Sampson, whose NCAA indiscretions led to his removal after just two seasons and plunged the program into a years-long rebuild.\n\nTom Crean won a pair of Big Ten titles leading the Hoosiers, in 2013 and 2016, but inconsistent results led to his dismissal in 2017. His successor, Archie Miller, has yet to qualify for the NCAA tournament in three seasons in Bloomington, though it’s likely he would have last spring had COVID-19 not prompted the cancellation of the NCAA tournament.\n\nAfter more than 19 years away, Knight ended his long estrangement from Indiana University when he appeared at halftime of a game against Purdue in February. Flanked by former players Quinn Buckner, Scott May and Steve Green, and his son, Pat, Knight was met with raucous applause by a sold-out Assembly Hall when he appeared on the court he’d once patrolled so successfully — and sometimes, controversially.\n\nThe moment proved healing for many, including some former players. Said former Hoosier Todd Leary simply, “We used to have to choose the Knight family or the IU family, and now we don't have to.”\n\nFollow IndyStar reporter Zach Osterman on Twitter: @ZachOsterman.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/05/29/disney-world-seaworld-petrified-forest-wisconsin-state-fair-news-around-states/111877708/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nDecatur: A high school student who attended a graduation ceremony last week has tested positive for the new coronavirus, a school district announced Wednesday. The student was awaiting test results when they attended Austin High School’s ceremony May 21 in Decatur, school officials said. A member of the student’s family had previously tested positive, Al.com quoted Decatur City Schools Deputy Superintendent Dwight Satterfield as saying. The district had 16 nurses checking students’ temperatures and asking them whether any family members tested positive or had symptoms, but the student and their family did not disclose that information, he added. Graduates were kept 6 feet apart and families were also asked to keep 6 feet between other groups, according to the district. Satterfield said that despite the guidelines, some students still gathered and hugged each other, though he defended the district’s decision to host the ceremony. “I will put what we did at graduation against anyone,” Satterfield said. “There will be people second guessing whether we should have had graduation or not. So be it, that will be a conversation for another day.” Some Alabama schools began hosting in-person graduation ceremonies after the state eliminated rules limiting crowds to 10 people or fewer. Gatherings of any size were allowed starting in mid-May as long as people from different households stayed at least 6 feet apart. Other schools nationwide have canceled or postponed traditional graduation ceremonies to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Prosecutors have accused an Alaska man of violating a federal judge’s order and breaking his quarantine after securing early release from prison amid the coronavirus pandemic. A complaint alleging criminal contempt of court has been filed against Duane Byron Fields. Cindy Franklin, an attorney for Fields, said Wednesday her client is being made a scapegoat after a series of miscommunications. She said Fields was tested for COVID-19 before his release from a federal prison in California that had been hit hard by the virus. The test came back positive the day before he was allowed to travel to Alaska but no one told Fields the result, she said. The system infected him and potentially exposed others and “when they found out up here about those results, their reaction was to attempt to make some kind of scapegoat out of Mr. Fields,” Franklin said. “It’s appalling.” Chloe Martin, spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney in Anchorage, said the office to its knowledge “has not charged contempt by criminal complaint before now. It’s an unusual approach, but given the gravity of Fields’ alleged conduct and the need to protect the public, the U.S. Attorney’s Office felt it was important to move forward with a criminal complaint.” Messages were left for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, which runs the California facility, Federal Correctional Institution Terminal Island. The bureau told the Anchorage Daily News, which first reported the story, that it is investigating. Fields, who was serving time in a drug-related case and has battled cancer, was granted compassionate release earlier this month by Senior U.S. District Judge James K. Singleton Jr. Singleton’s order said the court “may fashion an appropriate sanction” should Fields fail to follow quarantine or social distancing measures or any other condition of release. Alaska requires people arriving in the state to self-quarantine for 14 days to help guard against the virus’ spread. People are to leave their quarantine location only for medical emergencies or care.\n\nArizona\n\nHolbrook: Petrified Forest National Park in northeastern Arizona is reopening some of its facilities and areas that have been closed to the public since March 24 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Park officials said that a phased approach to increase recreational access and other services will have the park road, all trails and wilderness areas reopen Friday, with entry fees collected by credit card. The Painted Desert Visitor Center, the Rainbow Forest Museum, Rainbow Forest Lodge and the Painted Desert Dinner and Gift Shop will reopen in future phases, officials said. Meanwhile, a project to repair and replace three bridges and sections of the park road continues with completion of the project’s second phase scheduled for late June.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A group seeking a constitutional amendment to legalize recreational marijuana in Arkansas has stopped collecting signatures because of the coronavirus pandemic but will refocus its efforts for 2022, a spokeswoman said. Arkansas True Grass wanted an amendment to legalize marijuana use and expunge prior drug convictions on the Nov. 3 ballot. But the pandemic has led to the cancellation of events, making it all but impossible to collect the nearly 90,000 signatures required by the July 3 deadline, according to Briana Boling, the group’s spokeswoman. The group mailed 350 petition forms to canvassers when the outbreak began, but only four were returned, Boling told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. Arkansas True Grass has already started collecting signatures for 2022, she said. Meanwhile, Arkansans for Cannabis Reform continued to gather signatures in pursuit of qualifying in the November election, said group director Melissa Fults. The group has collected more than 20,000 signatures, she said. Fults’ group spent more than $20,000 to hire a canvassing company to assist with signature collection, reports filed with the state Ethics Commission showed. Meanwhile, True Grass reported spending less than $5,000 over the course of two years. A federal judge ruled Monday that Arkansas’ laws requiring petitions be signed in-person were unconstitutional, allowing groups to gather electronic signatures. Voters approved legalizing medical marijuana in 2016.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The sprawling Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles announced measured steps toward reopening churches and resuming celebration of daily Mass for early next month. Archbishop José H. Gomez said in a letter to 288 parishes that they must submit reopening plans under guidelines that include sanitary measures and attendance limits to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. Once a parish plan has been approved a parish can open its church for private personal prayer and begin daily Mass as early as June 3. The earliest Sunday Masses would be on June 7. “During Mass, Communion will be offered only in the form of bread and in the hand, and with priests sanitizing their hands before and after distributing Communion,” an archdiocese statement said. Among other measures, choirs will be replaced by a cantor and accompanist and people should be dismissed after Mass by groups of pews. “As we enter this new moment, it is important to remember that the coronavirus is still out there, it is still contagious, and it is still dangerous,” Gomez said. On Monday, the state released a framework to permit counties to allow in-person worship services. The archdiocese is the nation’s largest, with an estimated 4.3 million Catholics in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Skiing is back in Colorado after a more than two-month closure caused by the new coronavirus, but only a few have been lucky enough to score reservations at the only reopened resort in the state. Arapahoe Basin near the Continental Divide west of Denver opened Wednesday with restrictions and at limited capacity, allowing only 600 skiers and snowboarders on the mountain. Alan Henceroth, the resort’s chief operating officer, told The Denver Post about 4,000 people tried to make online reservations Monday night “and it just crushed the system.” The resort replaced it with a random drawing. Arapahoe Basin, which along with other resorts was forced to close in mid-March, usually attracts 1,000 to 2,000 skiers and riders on weekdays in May and more than 3,000 on weekend days. “We had to reduce numbers because a lot of people want to go skiing,” Henceroth told The Post. “We couldn’t have a crushing, busy day. That just wouldn’t work.” Skiers and snowboarders wearing face coverings lined up 6 feet apart and were spaced out on the lifts Wednesday. Restaurants at the resort remain closed, and the “beach,” a row of parking closest to the lifts, wasn’t holding any of its typical raucous spring parties. Tailgating also is barred in all the parking lots. All but 30 of the daily reservations were set aside for season pass-holders. The resort, which tops out at 13,050 feet above sea level, usually stays open until early June and sometimes into early July, depending on the snowpack. It joined Oregon’s Timberline Lodge and Ski Area and Mt. Bachelor in reopening. The Oregon resorts opened in mid-May after Gov. Kate Brown signed an executive order allowing skiing and snowboarding to resume.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Hartford is planning to reopen its parishes to the public for weekday Masses only beginning June 8, with rules for wearing masks and social distancing to guard against the new coronavirus, church officials said Wednesday. The archdiocese released its guidelines for reopening its more than 120 parishes in Hartford, New Haven and Litchfield counties. Church officials said a date for resuming Sunday services has not been determined. Churches will continue to livestream and post videos of Sunday services. Parishioners will be required to wear masks, with exceptions for young children and those with a legitimate health reason. People also must stay at least 6 feet apart, and services will be limited to 50 people according to Gov. Ned Lamont’s orders. There also will be no passing of offering baskets. Older adults, those with medical conditions and those caring for sick or housebound people are urged not to attend the weekday services. “Coordinated and thoughtful planning is imperative for a church to reopen; otherwise it should not do so,” the new guidelines said. “A pastor must be able to ensure that the parish is prepared to meet the pandemic requirements for public worship.” Lamont said Tuesday he plans to reevaluate his order concerning houses of worship in the next week or so.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:The Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control will reopen campgrounds at Delaware state parks on Monday. This is in response to Gov. John Carney’s removal of the emergency ban on short-term rental units. All state park campsites, cabins, cottages and yurts were closed from March 24 through May 31 because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the department said. The department said it issued refunds for reservations through May 31 and the cancellation policy will remain in effect through June 15. All cabins and cottages will be sanitized by a professional cleaning service between rentals and some amenities will remain closed until further notice, the department said. The department said campers also must wear masks and maintain social distancing. Camping will be available after June 1 at the following state parks: Cape Henlopen, Delaware Seashore, Indian River Marina, Killens Pond, Lums Pond and Trap Pond.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The Youth Baseball Academy, the community outreach arm of the Washington Nationals, has traded bats and gloves for food and essential needs and is making a big difference in Wards 7 and 8 during the coronavirus pandemic by handing out free meals, WUSA-TV reported. “We began to serve meals our selves at the academy and we began distribution of them back in March,” Youth Baseball Academy executive director Jenn Cartland said. The pandemic threw the entire city a curveball, but the pain is worse for the less fortunate areas. Wards 7 and 8 already suffer from a lack of healthy food options. Food shortages during the pandemic made it worse. “The first thing we wanted to do was make sure children had access to fresh healthy meals,” Cartland said. This month, they received a large donation of supermarket goods from Safeway and Ward 7 Councilman Vincent Gray. Now, the staff gives out care packages to the community filled with food, water, even toilet paper.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: SeaWorld and Walt Disney World will reopen in in June and July after months of inactivity because of the coronavirus pandemic, under plans approved Wednesday by a city task force. The proposals will now be sent to Gov. Ron DeSantis for final approval. The plan calls for SeaWorld to open to the public on June 11. Disney plans a tiered reopening, with Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom opening on July 11, followed by Epcot and Hollywood Studios on July 15. Last week, Universal Orlando presented its plan to reopen on June 5. That plan also has been approved by the Orlando task force, which sent its recommendation to the governor. In a statement, Diseny said attendance will be managed through a new system that requires advance reservations for park entry. Disney World plans a smaller, soft openings befpre July 11, but no specifics were provided. SeaWorld is planning an employee appreciation event on June 10 before opening to the public the next day, said Interim CEO Marc Swanson. Both parks said they will require guests and employees to wear face coverings and social distancing will be enforced throughout their properties. Guests and employees also will undergo temperature checks before entering the parks. Disney employees will be required to conduct temperature checks before heading to work, McPhee said. They will also undergo temperature checks at the park, he added. Fever is one of the virus symptoms. Fireworks shows, character meet-and-greets and parades will be suspended to meet social distancing requirements, McPhee said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp said he wants to lift more restrictions on businesses as long as people continue to heed coronavirus guidance from officials and public health experts. The Republican governor’s comments came as state data showed the number of new daily infections trending upward after weeks of decline. “We can’t keep fighting the virus from our living room,” Kemp said, according to video of his remarks posted online by WMAZ-TV. Kemp was touring a temporary medical pod set up at a hospital in Macon. Kemp said that using common sense and following health advice, including social distancing and wearing masks, will allow Georgians to get out of their homes safely and help spur the economy. He said people should patronize businesses that follow health restrictions and sanitation guidelines. A seven-day moving average of confirmed cases provided by the health department showed the number of new daily cases in Georgia declining between April 22 and May 11, then beginning to trend back upward.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Honolulu Liquor Commission and other agencies are investigating two businesses connected to Oahu holiday parties that allegedly violated emergency health regulations stemming from the coronavirus outbreak. The Memorial Day weekend parties at Waimea Bay Beach Park and Kaena Point State Park might also have broken liquor and permitting laws, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Tuesday. A complaint against Candy Ice LLC and No Smoke Entertainment alleged alcoholic drinks were served at the events Saturday and Sunday without permits. Authorities found about 200 people and more than 170 cars at the Kaena Point gathering Sunday night, the state Department of Land and Natural Resources said. A group called Protect Waimea filed the complaint with the liquor commission, the land and natural resources department, police and other agencies. Candy Ice and No Smoke Entertainment do not have liquor licenses and therefore are outside the liquor commission’s regulatory oversight. They have not been fined but could face criminal charges, the agency said. Business registration documents for Candy Ice filed with the Department of Commerce and Consumer Affairs listed a Schofield Barracks address for its agent, Ariana Darcy, who could not immediately be reached. Police and the Honolulu city parks division did not immediately respond to questions.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Idaho’s unemployment rate swung from a record low to a record high in the span of a month, spurred by job losses from the coronavirus pandemic. Idaho Department of Labor officials said April’s unemployment rate reached 11.5%, a nine-point jump in the seasonally adjusted number compared to the record-low 2.5% rate in March. Nearly 103,000 Idaho residents were unemployed last month, according to the department, an 81,000 person increase. Gov. Brad Little issued a statewide stay-at-home order that closed nonessential businesses for Idaho’s 1.75 million residents on March 25 in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus. The state has since begun the process of reopening some businesses, including daycare facilities and restaurants that can offer social distancing in their dining rooms. April’s job losses were spread throughout the state, with the Lewiston, Coeur d’Alene and Pocatello regions seeing job losses between 11% and 15%. The Boise metropolitan area had a 10% job loss. The Idaho Falls area fared best with a loss of 4.3%.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: In a news release on Thursday morning, the office of Cook County Chief Judge Timothy Evans announced that two judges in the courthouse in suburban Bridgeview tested positive for COVID-19. The release did not provide any details about the judges or their conditions. According to the release, an employee of the adult probation department also tested positive, bringing to 39 the number of county court employees who have tested positive. The release also said that another resident of the Juvenile Temporary Detention Center has also tested positive, bringing the number of residents to test positive to 15. The county’s criminal justice system has been hit hard by the pandemic, particularly the county jail, where hundreds of detainees and correctional officers have tested positive and seven detainees and two correctional officers have died. At the Chicago Police Department, 521 sworn officers and 30 civilian employees have tested positive for the virus, and three officers who tested positive have died, according to the most recent department statistics.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Indiana is experiencing more substance use disorders and other mental health issues amid the coronavirus outbreak, the state’s human services chief said Wednesday. Indiana experienced its highest monthly dispensation of the opioid antidote naloxone in April, with 1,306 uses, Jennifer Sullivan, secretary of the Family and Social Services Administration said during a state news briefing. “We’ve never seen naloxone distribution like this before,” Sullivan said. Year to date, nearly 1.5% of all emergency medical runs involve administration of naloxone, or Narcan, compared with less than 1% for the same period last year, she said.. The state announced last week it will use nearly $1 million in federal funds to pay for the distribution of naloxone to first responders, families, friends and others who are likely to be the first on the scene if someone overdoses. The money was made available by a grant from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Naloxone is given when a person is showing signs of opioid overdose. It blocks the toxic effects of the overdose and is often the difference between a patient living and dying.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Tyson Foods announced a plan to temporarily close its Storm Lake pork processing plant late Thursday, hours after the Iowa Department of Public Health confirmed the facility was the site of a coronavirus outbreak that infected more than one-fifth of its workers. Tyson's meat processing facilities in Iowa and elsewhere have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. Previously, the company has had to temporarily close plants in Waterloo, Columbus Junction and Perry, as well as in Dakota City, Nebraska; Logansport, Indiana; and Pasco, Washington, so it could installing additional worker safeguards. In late April, Tyson Chairman John Tyson warned in full-page newspaper ads that \"the food supply chain is breaking.\" In a news release Thursday, the company attributed the closure in Storm Lake in part to \"a delay in COVID-19 testing results and team member absences related to quarantine.\" It said it was ceasing slaughter and would finish processing operations \"over the next two days.\" \"Additional deep cleaning and sanitizing of the entire facility will be conducted before resuming operations later next week,\" the release said. It said Tyson had completed COVID-19 testing of employees and contractors at the plant and promised to share results \"once complete data is available, with health and government officials, team members and other stakeholders as part of our efforts to help communities where we operate better understand the coronavirus and the protective measures that can be taken to help prevent its spread.\"\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: At least eight wrongful death lawsuits have been filed against a nursing home in Kansas City, where 36 people have died from the new coronavirus. The lawsuits alleged the Riverbend Post-Acute Rehabilitation was negligent in its handling of the coronavirus outbreak and did not provide adequate staff or notify families of the outbreak, KCUR reported. Health officials said another 136 patients and staff at the home have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Attorneys representing the nursing home on Tuesday transferred all eight cases from Wyandotte County District Court to federal court in Kansas City. The attorneys invoked a federal law that provides immunity from liability for health care providers during public health emergencies. Rachel Stahle, an attorney representing four of the eight families, said she will seek to have the cases sent back to state court. Riverbend posted a statement on its website last month defending its care, saying staff took reasonable actions with the resources and information that were available at the time. Riverbend officials have declined to discuss the lawsuits.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: After two Kentucky Republicans asked Gov. Andy Beshear to consider a new approach for Lake Cumberland State Resort Park that wouldn’t hurt the area’s tourism dollars in a “crippling” way, the governor announced on Thursday that all state parks can reopen on June 1. In a Wednesday letter from Sen. Max Wise and Rep. Jeff Hoover to Beshear and tourism secretary Mike Berry, the two wrote that Lake Cumberland, which is in South Central Kentucky near Jamestown, relies heavily on tourism revenue. “Many Kentuckians have invested significant amounts of money in developing recreational housing in the area and providing food service for the community,” the two wrote, “particularly during the peak seasons at the park.” Beshear had announced that state resort parks, recreational parks, lodges and cabins that had been closed because of the virus will open June 1 with a few exceptions. So it could be reserved for coronavirus efforts, Lake Cumberland State Resort Park wasn’t included in that plan, along with Lake Barkley, Blue Licks Battlefield and Buckhorn Lake state resort parks.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state’s high school athletic association is investigating 10 schools accused of allowing some sports teams to begin training before the summer start date, which was pushed back to fall in line with coronavirus restrictions. Six New Orleans-area schools, two Lafayette-area schools and two north Louisiana schools were reported to the association for practicing before June 8, The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate quoted Executive Director Eddie Bonine as saying. The association changed the summer start date from May 17 to June 8 to fall in line with Gov. John Bel Edwards’ proposed timeline for the second phase of reopening the state as it moves away from “stay-at-home” measures enacted in March, the news outlet said. The schools were turned in by other schools and parents who said they were told there would be repercussions if their child did not attend the workouts, Bonine said. Some complainants also sent pictures and videos of the alleged practice sessions. The official said the association sent investigators to the schools and drove by between nine and 12 schools in the Baton Rouge-Livingston Parish area this week, but found no activity at the sites. Bonine declined to identify which schools were being reviewed. Schools and coaches that violate the association’s guidelines could be fined $2,500, suspended or placed on probation, officials said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Another 24,500 individuals have filed initial claims for unemployment benefits last week – more than double the number of claims the previous week, the Maine Department of Labor said Thursday. The large number of claims is suspicious, coming off a week in which 11,500 individuals filed claims for assistance, officials said. “We believe these higher numbers are evidence of the organized crime of unemployment impostor fraud, which many states are experiencing,” Commissioner Laura Fortman said. All told, there were a combined 37,000 claims for state unemployment and pandemic assistance for the week ending May 23, topping the previous high of 34,000 claims during the week ending April 4, officials said. To date, the department has canceled about 2,200 unemployment claims because of fraud. The department is investigating another 1,000 cases for potential fraud.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A union chapter that represents workers at Giant Food stores is calling for the grocer to extend hazard pay and maintain coronavirus safety measures. The Baltimore Sun reported Thursday that Giant plans to cancel its 10% “recognition pay” on May 30. The pay has been in place since mid-March. Giant spokeswoman Felis Andrade said that grocery stores are no longer among the only businesses open. She added that the company is transitioning to a new normal. The company said it will offer one-time bonuses on July 1 of $400 for full-time workers and $200 for part-time workers. Two locals of United Food & Commercial Workers said Giant should extend the temporary pay increase until the pandemic ends. They argued that workers took extra risks during the pandemic and continue to do so while no vaccine is available. Jason Chorpenning, president of UFCW Local 27, said that “nothing is getting back to normal.” The union is also calling on Giant to restrict customer traffic to a maximum of 50 customers at any one time.The union estimated that more than 65 workers have died across the country and that more than 9,800 have been infected by the virus.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The case against a Rhode Island man accused of kidnapping and killing a Boston woman has been halted because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to his defense. Louis Coleman’s public defenders requested for the case to return in 45 days during a teleconference with a federal judge Tuesday. “Since the coronavirus pandemic, a lot of our work in the case has stalled,” Jane Peachy, an attorney for Coleman, told District Court Judge M. Page Kelley. “Most importantly, our ability to visit with Mr. Coleman in the jail has been put on hold,” which “hampers our progress significantly. Coleman, who faces the death penalty, was charged with kidnapping Jassy Correia, the mother of a 2-year-old girl, from outside a Boston nightclub where she had been celebrating her 23rd birthday in February 2019. He pleaded not guilty a month later. Federal authorities alleged Coleman was captured on surveillance video carrying her body into his Providence apartment. Coleman was stopped in Delaware days after Correia’s disappearance. Her body was found in the trunk of his car by authorities. Peachy asked that the status conference in the case be continued 45 days to July 7, a request the judge approved. Coleman is charged with kidnapping resulting in death. He has been held without bail.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A Republican legislative leader said Wednesday that Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer “lied” and engaged in a “cover-up” by requesting the removal of a social media post about her husband’s attempt to get his boat in the water during the coronavirus pandemic, only to later acknowledge he did drop her name as a joke. The governor confirmed Tuesday that her husband, Marc Mallory, called a dock company last week before he traveled to their home in the Elk Rapids area, after she had urged people to “think long and hard” about visiting the region. Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey questioned why her staff contacted his office Friday to successfully push Republican Sen. Tom Barrett to delete his Facebook post about Mallory. The post was based on a post by the owner of NorthShore Dock, who said his staff took a call from Mallory asking if his boat could be put in the water before the Memorial Day weekend. When Mallory was told there was no chance, Tad Dowker wrote, Mallory replied, ‘I am the husband to the governor, will this make a difference?’” according to The Detroit News. NorthShore Dock subsequently said on Facebook that Mallory was respectful and understood why the company could not quickly get his boat in the water. “The governor lied. Not only did she lie, but she directed her staff to lie on her behalf in order to cover up her own lies,” Shirkey said in statements from the Senate floor. He said Whitmer’s staff was “emphatic that the story was false and that it should be removed.” Whitmer spokeswoman Tiffany Brown said Shirkey’s comment were “incorrect and unfair, and frankly, he owes the governor an apology. She has been completely honest about the situation and she never directed her staff to mislead anyone or to contact his office.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order Wednesday that formally implements the next phase of his “Stay Safe MN” plan, which will allow restaurants and bars to offer outdoor dining and salons and barber shops to reopen starting next Monday. Those businesses must observe capacity limits and follow other safety restrictions. There’s still no target date for allowing restaurants and bars to serve guests indoors. Walz acknowledged at a news conference that the terms of his order aren’t substantially different from the “cautious, strategic turn of the dial” he announced for these businesses last week. The governor took note of the grim milestone of the U.S. passing 100,000 COVID-19 deaths on Wednesday. He said the peak in Minnesota is “still a ways off” and that how well Minnesotans comply with health guidelines – including social distancing, wearing masks and staying home when sick – will have an impact. Many restaurant owners have complained that allowing outdoor-only dining doesn’t give them enough relief from the shutdown that Walz imposed starting March 17, with exceptions for takeout and delivery service. The governor acknowledged the continuing economic pain, but said long dinners with friends in smaller spaces pose one of the higher risks for spreading the virus.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: A second company has announced its plans to resume cruises on the Mississippi River. American Cruise Lines announced this week that it plans to resume cruises in late June. The 190-passenger American Harmony is scheduled to depart from Memphis, Tennessee, on June 28, and sail to New Orleans, a company spokeswoman said. American Cruise Lines said it would voluntarily sail at 75% capacity. The announcement comes after the American Queen Steamboat Co. revealed that the American Queen would also will resume cruises in late June. That vessel is scheduled to dock in Vicksburg on June 24.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The University of Missouri-Kansas City has announced it will begin bringing back faculty, staff and students to its two campuses in Kansas City starting next week following its shutdown during the coronavirus outbreak. The university said Thursday in a news release that the campuses will open in three phases. The first phase will begin Monday, when a small group of employees engaged in critical operations will be brought back through July 5. The second phase will bring back senior administration and departmental leaders from July 6 through Aug. 2. The final phase would bring back all remaining faculty, staff and students from Aug. 3-24, except for those with individual medical exemptions. Although the university plans to return to in-person classes in August, it will monitor the public health situation closely and follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local guidelines, the release said. “The time has come for us to prepare in earnest to return to campus,” Chancellor Mauli Agrawal said. “We will do so carefully and flexibly, because the health and safety of our community is our highest priority.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Applications for temporary unemployment assistance declined for the seventh straight week last week while Montana reported four more positive COVID-19 cases from more than 1,100 tests run. The state received 3,617 new unemployment applications last week, a decrease of 1.2% from the 3,660 claims that were filed the previous week, the U.S. Employment and Training Administration said Thursday. The applications were an increase of 364% compared to the number of applications submitted in the same week last year. Since March 14, the state has processed 105,494 claims for unemployment, which represents 23.1% of the total workforce in Montana that is eligible for the unemployment insurance program. The numbers don’t include the self-employed and gig workers who were eligible for federal unemployment payments under the coronavirus relief act. As of May 16, 48,919 people in Montana were receiving unemployment benefits, which represents 10.7% of all eligible employees in the state. The unemployment rate was 10.5% a week earlier.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Nebraska will use its $1.1 billion share of federal coronavirus money to help small businesses, local governments, nonprofits and other groups hard-hit by the pandemic, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Wednesday. Ricketts provided a first glimpse of the state’s plan, which focuses heavily on small businesses and unemployment insurance for laid-off workers. Nebraska will receive $1.25 billion under the federal CARES Act, the emergency law passed to help Americans with the pandemic. Of that amount, Omaha’s Douglas County will get $166 million for its own virus-related expenses, reducing the state government’s cut to about $1.1 billion. Ricketts said he intends to hire outside auditors to track the huge influx of money and ensure that it doesn’t get misspent. The law prohibits states from using its share on nonvirus expenses or to replace lost tax revenue. Ricketts said he plans to set aside $330 million for small businesses, defined as having five to 49 employees, and small livestock producers. Business and producers can each apply for up to $12,000 in state grant money. Ricketts said many of those companies didn’t have the connections or resources to seek previous rounds of federal aid before the application deadlines passed.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Washoe County Health District plans to offer drive-thru testing next week for people with no COVID-19 symptoms. Testing will be available mornings on a first-come, first-served basis Monday through June 6 at the Reno Livestock Events Center. Health District chief Kevin Dick said about 900 tests a day can be taken using nasal swabs. He acknowledged that testing can produce false negatives, but said it should provide information about how widespread the coronavirus is in the Reno-Sparks area.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The attorney general’s office will not take action against a New Hampshire racetrack that violated the state’s order prohibiting large gatherings during the coronavirus pandemic. Riverside Speedway in Groveton held races with spectators on Saturday despite being warned by police, the attorney general’s office said. After being told the state was prepared to take legal action, Riverside owner Michael Humphrey announced Wednesday the season has been postponed until further notice. Attorney General Gordon MacDonald said Thursday that no further action was necessary. “The objective of the Governor’s Orders is to protect the public health. Mr. Humphrey’s decision advances that important objective,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPoint Pleasant Beach: Another Jersey Shore town is planning to reopen its boardwalk. Point Pleasant Beach said it plans to make the move Friday and will also start lifting parking restrictions. But the rides, amusements and games along the boardwalk will remain closed, and restaurants will be open for takeout only. Officials last month limited much of the town’s parking to residents. But private and public lots will be allowed to reopen Friday, and remaining restrictions will be lifted June 5.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: New Mexico’s state court system plans in mid-June to resume starting jury trials that had been suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic. The suspension to be lifted under an order issued Thursday by the state Supreme Court’s chief justice has been in place since March. The order said the 21 judicial districts can resume starting jury trials beginning June 15 through July 15 but that districts must first submit plans to maintain physical distancing of people in courtrooms and jury selection rooms and use of protective barriers in courthouses. Chief Justice Judith Nakamura’s order said courts will rigorously follow practices developed by public health authorities and that courthouses will be reopened “in a safe and gradual manner that is based on the local circumstances and available resources in each judicial district.” New Mexico’s courts have already required that people entering court buildings wear a protective face covering and have limited the number of people in locations within courthouses.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state Senate and Assembly on Wednesday voted to extend the deadline for residents who were sexually abused as children to file legal claims, citing the upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The original deadline for those making claims under the Child Victims Act was Aug. 14th; the legislation would extend it a year, to the same date in 2021. The 2019 act lifted statute of limitations even for allegations that were decades old, for a filing period of one year. But with the shutdown and disruption caused by the virus, advocates and survivors had been pressing for an extension. The legislation now goes to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who earlier this month had extended the deadline by five months, to January. A spokesman said it would be reviewed. The state Senate passed the legislation by a vote of 60-0, and the Assembly by a vote of 135-9.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Legislators are wading into Gov. Roy Cooper’s business reopening decisions, as the state Senate voted Thursday to let bars serve customers again despite his recent executive order keeping them closed because of COVID-19. With support from members of both parties, the legislation approved overwhelmingly that would essentially overturn Cooper’s decision on bars, which the Democratic governor said was based on data and science. Republicans and some business owners have questioned his orders, calling them uneven and devastating to the state economy. Currently, bars must be shuttered through late June, but Cooper allowed restaurants last week to reopen partially their indoor dining areas. But senators said all of these businesses needed a stronger economic lifeline to avoid permanent closure and rehire workers they had to lay off when restrictions began in mid-March. More than 956,000 individuals have filed unemployment claims since then and the state’s unemployment rate soared above 12% last month. The measure still would have to be approved by the House before it goes to Cooper, who has veto power. The margin of the Senate vote suggests that Cooper would have work to do to prevent an override. Gyms and adult entertainment businesses have sued Cooper, seeking to ease portions of his executive orders keeping them closed. A federal judge this month blocked enforcement of a previous ordering prevented indoor church services of more than 10 people.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Another person has died from COVID-19 in North Dakota, bringing the total number of deaths to 57, state health officials said Thursday. The state Health Department said the victim was a Cass County man in his 80s with underlying health conditions. The Department of Health said another 42 people have tested positive for the new coronavirus since Wednesday, bringing the total number of cases to 2,481. Cass County, which remains the epicenter of the state’s coronavirus outbreak, had 36 additional cases. The county, which contains Fargo, has had a total of 1,632 cases. Health officials said 65,773 people statewide so far have tested negative for the virus. Thirty-five people are hospitalized with the virus, down five from Wednesday.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Outdoor visits will be allowed at assisted living facilities as well as facilities for people with developmental disabilities, beginning June 8. Social distancing and other safety restrictions will apply. Gov. Mike DeWine said the limited visitation will be watched closely as his administration considers when to reopen nursing homes to visitors. He said officials are balancing safety against damage done by prolonged periods without seeing family. The latest data showed outbreaks in nursing homes are continuing to pop up in some counties while the deaths have leveled off in others. Ottawa County reported a week ago just one death since the pandemic began and this week added nine more. Monroe County also had a recent rise in deaths, bringing its total to 12. The number of nursing home deaths in Franklin County has tripled during the past three weeks, rising to 150 – the most in the state.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Four Oklahoma tribes are being awarded a total of nearly $1.2 million to fight the new coronavirus. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services through the Health Resources and Services Administration on Thursday announced the awards. They include $300,000 to both the Cherokee Nation and the Cheyenne and Arapho Tribes, more than $299,000 to the Quapaw Tribe of Oklahoma and more than $295,000 to the Chickasaw Nation. The funding can be used by the tribes to acquire personal protective equipment; pay for overtime and hazardous duties; building infrastructure; increase testing and the isolation of suspected COVID-19 patients; purchase mobile clinics or vehicles for transporting COVID-19 patients; and provide educational resources to help slow the spread of the virus.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Multnomah County said it hopes to begin reopening in about two weeks, but a mysterious coronavirus outbreak could hinder those plans. The Oregon Health Authority said it is working with county health authorities to investigate “an increase in COVID-19 cases tied to an outbreak at specific locations of a business that operates in the Tri-county region and the Willamette Valley.” Pressed for specifics and for the name of the involved business, the health authority said it is keeping that company’s identity secret – but did not say why, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. “At this time, there is no indication that the outbreak at these locations poses any significant risk to surrounding communities,” the health authority said. Multnomah County had an unusual 41-case spike in new coronavirus cases Wednesday. It’s not clear whether those new cases are connected to the workplace outbreak the health authority cited. The county said Wednesday that it hopes to reopen June 12.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Professional sports can resume in Pennsylvania where the governor’s stay-at-home order to stem the spread of the coronavirus is no longer in force, but without spectators, Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration said. Those teams and competitors will be allowed to practice or play in counties where Wolf’s “yellow” or “green” designation applies in his stoplight-colored three-phase reopening plan. To resume, a team or a league must develop a coronavirus safety plan that has been approved by the state Department of Health and it must include testing or screening and monitoring of all “on-venue” players and personnel, the administration said. Fans or spectators cannot be permitted inside or outside the sporting venue property, the administration said. Major League Baseball, the NHL and the NBA have been on hiatus since mid-March and the NFL has been holding its organized team activities “virtually,” though the reopening means players could potentially participate in person when mandatory minicamps are held next month.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority does not plan to immediately resume express bus service to state beaches this summer because of the coronavirus pandemic, an agency spokeswoman said Thursday.RIPTA usually offers summer express service on weekends and holidays from Providence, Central Falls, Woonsocket and other cities to South County state beaches. All state beaches closed because of the pandemic are scheduled to reopen Monday, but with limited parking and other restrictions. There are no plans to resume beach service immediately and it might not resume this summer, RIPTA told The Providence Journal. “We are in close contact with the Department of Health and the Department of Environmental Management, and we plan to reinstate that additional service as soon as it is safe to do so,” agency spokeswoman Barbara Polichetti said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The committee assigned by Gov. Henry McMaster to plan to reopen the state after the initial spread of the coronavirus and figure out how to spend $1.9 billion in federal money is preparing to give its final report. The Accelerate SC committee meets Thursday afternoon in its traditional social distancing format with all seats at least 6 feet apart, microphones sanitized after every speaker and hand sanitizer and masks at every place. As the reopening committee winds down its work, South Carolina’s response is far from over. Many members worry the economy could continue to struggle because consumers feel the risk to their health is too great to return to tourist attractions or restaurants or they are saving because of the economic crisis. McMaster formed the Accelerate SC committee five weeks ago. It has provided recommendations on how to get restaurants, barber shops and other businesses reopened. It is looking at the best ways schools can teach students in the fall. And it worked on the best way to get protective equipment to people now and stockpile it for a future pandemic.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:When the city announced it was keeping its public pools closed for the year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, officials with the Sioux Falls Swim Team scrambled to find other accommodations to keep its 200 swimmers in the water this summer. Unlike Sioux Falls, Brandon or Dell Rapids, the city of Lennox has opted to open swimming facilities and has agreed to allow the Sioux Falls swimmers to use them outside of regular operating hours for practice purposes. The way practices are conducted won't be the same as prepandemic. Kyle Margheim, a coach with the swim team, said some changes will have to be made. Usually, there would be 60 swimmers in the water at once, but continued social distancing will probably drop that number to 12 or 13. Use of locker rooms will be suspended for the time being.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A judge expects to rule June 4 on whether to order a temporary injunction to let all voters cast ballots by mail in the August primary because of the coronavirus pandemic. Davidson County Chancellor Ellen Hobbs Lyle set the deadline during a video conference hearing Thursday that she rescheduled for June 3. The lawsuit argues universal vote by mail eliminates risk of catching COVID-19 at the polls or unknowingly spreading it. State officials said they “cannot feasibly implement” a quick shift to let all voters cast their ballots by mail in the 2020 elections. Lyle will weigh whether to order the temporary injunction of more than a dozen excuses to qualify to vote absentee in Tennessee in the August primary. Those range from being sick to being 60 or older. The hearing will include discussion on two similar state court lawsuits that seek vote by mail for all in the August and November elections: One filed by Memphis-based voting rights group #UpTheVote901 and several voters, and another led by the American Civil Liberties Union of Tennessee. The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the Campaign Legal Center have also sued in federal court seeking absentee voting for all voters this year.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Joe Biden will close out Texas Democrats’ virtual convention next month that was moved online over fears of the new coronavirus. The announcement Thursday rounds out an unusual slate of big names that Texas Democrats have rounded up for their state convention. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts will also speak at the weeklong event via video. Democrats are redoubling efforts in Texas this year after gaining ground in the nation’s largest red state in 2018. A major target for them is the Texas House, where Democrats need to flip just nine seats to reclaim a majority for the first time in nearly 20 years. The Texas Democratic Party convention begins Monday. Biden is also speaking via video at other state Democratic conventions. Since abruptly canceling a March 10 rally in Cleveland at the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee has waged much of his campaign from his home in Delaware.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: More people have now applied for unemployment in Utah during the coronavirus pandemic than the previous three years combined, though the number of new claims are decreasing as the state economy reopens, officials said Thursday. Nearly 5,500 more people applied for unemployment last week, a 12% drop from the week before. Since business shutdowns aimed at halting the spread of the virus began in mid-March, the state has processed nearly 165,000 claims, or about about 11% of the eligible workforce. “We have now received the same amount of claims in the last ten weeks that were filed over the previous three years,” said Kevin Burt, Unemployment Insurance Division director for the Utah Department of Workforce Services, in a statement. Still, there are other signals workers are getting back on the job. Almost 10,000 people ended their unemployment claim on May 16, an increase from the week before, officials said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Department of Corrections said Thursday it has completed testing of inmates and staff at the Rutland prison for the virus that causes COVID-19 and no cases were detected. The department announced the results of the tests of 117 inmates and 87 staff members of the Marble Valley Regional Correctional Facility.Vermont now has completed testing of all inmates and staff at four of the state’s six correctional facilities. Additional tests are planned. Earlier in the course of the pandemic, 45 inmates from the Northwest State Correctional Facility in St. Albans tested positive for the virus. Most of the infected inmates were moved to a special surge site set up at the St. Johnsbury corrections complex until they recovered and could be moved back to St. Albans. Those inmates are now considered to be “in recovery″ after two negative tests for the COVID-19 virus.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Warnings have been issued to more than 100 businesses in Virginia about price gouging during the COVID-19 pandemic, the state’s attorney general said. Attorney General Mark Herring has sent at least 114 warning letters in light of complaints on products which include toilet paper, hand sanitizer and paper towels, among other things, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. Herring said at the end of March, the first month of Virginia’s state of emergency, that his office had sent 42 letters to businesses in response to price gouging complaints. Spokeswoman Charlotte Gomer said that as of Tuesday, Herring’s office had received more than 500 price gouging complaints from across Virginia. Gomer said Virginia’s Post-Disaster Anti-Price Gouging Act, which prohibits businesses from charging “unconscionable prices” for “necessary goods and services” during a crisis, also requires that the complaints be kept confidential, meaning the attorney general’s office is not publicly identifying the businesses it has warned.\n\nWashington\n\nVancouver: The CEO of a fruit processor connected to 85 coronavirus cases said his company could have done more to protect employees. Firestone Pacific Foods CEO Josh Hinerfeld said Wednesday the company began implementing new safety policies and educating employees about the disease in March, but that it struggled to implement and enforce physical distancing measures on the production line and in a break room, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. “We could have done better,” Hinerfeld said. “Through this process, we learned that we didn’t do enough. I sure hope through our experience, which obviously has been very painful for many, that others will learn from it.” Firestone suspended production and closed its office May 18 because of the outbreak. Washington state health officials have also suspended Clark County’s application to move to phase two of its reopening. Hinerfeld said that the company implemented daily health screenings for employees starting March 20 and required employees to wear masks on April 29. But, he said, some employees were still working in close proximity on the production line and it was difficult to enforce mask rule when employees went on break. The company set up a canopy outside in May to give workers more space during breaks. Hinerfeld said the company would work in collaboration with the county to determine when it could reopen, but was hopeful that the facility could resume operations as early as this week.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice said he wants widespread coronavirus testing at all of the state’s correctional facilities as cases continue to rise inside a rural prison. At least 102 inmates and eight staffers at the Huttonsville Correctional Center in Randolph County have tested positive for the virus, according to state records. About 360 tests are still pending. Justice, a Republican, did not give a timeline on when testing at all of the state’s lockups would begin, but he said it should happen as quickly as possible. Corrections department data show few inmates have been tested outside of the Huttonsville facility. The Huttonsville Correctional Center had the state’s first inmate coronavirus case, after a 62-year-old prisoner tested positive last week. Justice said he ordered testing throughout the facility after screenings had been limited to the area where the initial cases were located. Betsy Jividen, corrections department commissioner, said jails and prisons have been following federal safety guidelines. She said cases will likely continue to rise as courts resume normal hearings and more people enter the criminal justice system.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison:For the first time since 1945 and just the sixth time in 169 years, the Wisconsin State Fair has been canceled. The venerable event held every August outside of Milwaukee was called off Thursday because of the coronavirus pandemic, the latest in a long line of cancellations of major events in Wisconsin and nationwide. The cancellation marks only the second time the fair was called off for a reason other than a war. The announcement was expected as fairs in other states, including neighboring Minnesota, have also been called off. Wisconsin organizers said that even though they had hoped to somehow pull off the event in the face of the pandemic, it just couldn’t be safely done. The fair board gave chairman John Yingling the power on Tuesday to decide whether to proceed with the event. There is no state prohibition on large gatherings, after the Wisconsin Supreme Court invalidated Gov. Tony Evers’ “safer at home” order two weeks ago, but the safety challenges of putting on an event that draws more than a million people over 11 days was too much to overcome, Yingling said. The decision to cancel has Evers’ support, the fair said in announcing the decision. Tickets purchased for the fair this year will be valid for the 2021 fair, assuming that happens as scheduled. Refunds will also be offered through the end of June. The state fair began in Janesville in 1851 and since 1892 it has been staged in West Allis. The last time it was canceled was the last year of World War II. It was also not staged three years during the Civil War and in 1893, when the World’s Columbian Exposition was held in Chicago.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: The northern half of Yellowstone National Park remains closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, but Memorial Day weekend traffic in the park's southern half was similar to last year. Yellowstone has been open since May 18 through its two Wyoming entrances. Yellowstone's other three gates in Montana remain closed to park tourists and will open no sooner than Monday. A snowstorm forced the Wyoming entrances to close Saturday. After that, park officials said Memorial Day weekend traffic for those gates was similar to last year. Almost 4,700 vehicles entered through the two Wyoming gates last Sunday and Monday. Last year, about 4,800 vehicles entered through the Wyoming gates on Sunday and Monday of Memorial Day weekend. More than two-thirds of visitors typically enter the park through the Montana gates.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/29"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/14/sport/mlb-bruce-sutter-obit-spt/index.html", "title": "Bruce Sutter, baseball Hall of Fame closer and pioneer of split-finger ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nBaseball Hall of Fame reliever Bruce Sutter, who saved his career while popularizing the split-finger fastball, has died at the age of 69, Major League Baseball announced Friday.\n\nMLB commissioner Rob Manfred called Sutter’s 12-year career in which he led the National League five times in saves an “incredible baseball success story.”\n\n“Bruce ascended from being a non-drafted free agent to the heights of Baseball by pioneering the split-fingered fastball. That pitch not only led him to the Major Leagues, but also made him a Cy Young Award winner with the Cubs and a World Series Champion with the 1982 Cardinals,” Manfred said. “Bruce was the first pitcher to reach the Hall of Fame without starting a game, and he was one of the key figures who foreshadowed how the use of relievers would evolve.”\n\nAccording to the National Baseball Hall of Fame, Sutter was a “struggling minor league pitcher with an injured arm” when Cubs minor league pitching coach Fred Martin taught him the split-finger fastball – in which the thumb pushes the ball out from between wide-spread fingers – in the spring of 1973.\n\n“Fortunately for me, it clicked right away,” Sutter said at his National Baseball Hall of Fame induction in 2006.\n\nThe deceiving pitch looks like a fastball before quickly diving as it arrives at home plate.\n\nSutter made his major league debut with the Chicago Cubs in 1976. He would win the 1979 National League Cy Young Award when he saved a league-record-tying 37 games.\n\nHe was traded to the St. Louis Cardinals before the 1981 season, where he featured as the team’s closer and notably recorded the final out in Game 7 of the 1982 World Series to clinch the title for the Cardinals.\n\nBetween 1979 and 1984, Sutter led the league in saves each year except 1983, and he recorded 300 career saves, which ranked third at the time of his 1989 retirement. He ended his career with the Atlanta Braves where he battled arm injuries.\n\n“He had the best makeup of any closer I’ve ever seen,” St. Louis manager Whitey Herzog said of Sutter, according to the Hall of Fame. “He just cut the percentages down for me from 27 outs a game to 21.”\n\nBruce Sutter changed the game with his split-fingered fastball. His legacy will be preserved forever in Cooperstown.https://t.co/CReC6l614O pic.twitter.com/KtSCFdUHK6 — National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum ⚾ (@baseballhall) October 14, 2022\n\nWhen Sutter was inducted into the Hall of Fame, he was the fourth reliever to be enshrined.\n\n“When I played, I never needed the spotlight, nor did I want it,” he said during his induction speech. “I simply wanted to play baseball and be respected by my teammates and the opposing players.\n\nBruce Sutter waves to the crowd during the 2018 home opener game between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Arizona Diamondbacks on April 05, 2018 at Bush Stadium.

It’s about the many people who have helped me along the way.”\n\nCardinals owner Bill DeWitt Jr. sent his condolences to the Sutter family on behalf of the organization.\n\n“Bruce was a fan favorite during his years in St. Louis and in the years to follow, and he will always be remembered for his 1982 World Series-clinching save and signature split-fingered pitch,” DeWitt said. “He was a true pioneer in the game, changing the role of the late-inning reliever.”", "authors": ["Homero De La Fuente Steve Almasy", "Homero De La Fuente", "Steve Almasy"], "publish_date": "2022/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2022/02/26/innings-festival-2022-tempe-highs-lows-review/6944623001/", "title": "Innings Festival 2022: Live updates from Tempe Beach Park", "text": "Spring training is still on pause, but Innings Festival is back at Tempe Beach Park this weekend.\n\nThe two-day festival, Feb. 26-27, features an exciting lineup of bands (including headliners Foo Fighters and Tame Impala) along with appearances from Major League baseball greats.\n\nDave Grohl brought the opening day to an electrifying close with Foo Fighters, reminding us why he's become the standard-bearer of a certain rock aesthetic that wears its love of classic rock and vintage metal like a crusty Slayer shirt.\n\nSunday's highlights are set to range from Tame Impala to War on Drugs, whose leader tells us they've been \"firing on all cylinders,\" and Black Pumas, who earned a Best New Artist Grammy nomination.\n\nMore Innings:Six acts you may not know you need to see at Innings.\n\nWe'll be updating this blog all weekend long with photographs and highlights of the music festival on the shore of Tempe Town Lake.\n\nTame Impala helped bring this couple together\n\nSome people think “nostalgia” when they think about Tame Impala.\n\nThat’s what Phoenix residents Eric and Jasmine Swier think about the band. They can’t wait for the headliner to hit the Innings Festival stage Sunday night.\n\nIt’s their first time seeing the band live but it’s a long time coming.\n\nIt’s the couple’s fourth time at Innings Festival, but this year they came for the band which brought them together nine years ago. The couple fell in love while serving with the Peace Corps in Zambia.\n\nWhen Eric left the United States to serve, all he had for music was an 8 gigabyte blue iPod shuffle. He could only download 100 songs. Tame Impala made the cut.\n\nEric and Jasmine came for the whole day, and were counting down the minutes until Tame Impala is on stage. In the meantime, they were vibing to the Black Pumas, a soul-pop band based in Austin, Texas.\n\n“That’s the beauty of this festival,” Eric Swier said. “You come for one person and you find a dozen more.”\n\n— Sofia Krusmark\n\nBlack Pumas earned a prominent place on the lineup\n\nHaving seen Black Pumas work their soulful magic on the crowd that came to see them at the Rhythm Room, a Phoenix blues joint with a modest capacity of 275, in 2019, it was great to see them draw a crowd of several thousand to the second stage.\n\nThey were the last act of the day to grace that stage. And they quickly made it clear that they had more than earned that placement on the bill.\n\nEric Burton is a deeply soulful singer and a truly charismatic frontman, two great qualities to have at your disposal in a psychedelic soul band. And their rhythm section grooves with real authority.\n\nHighlights ranged from “I’m Ready,” a Pumas original funky enough to pull off a lyric as evocative as “If you want it now we can make love to Marvin Gaye for the first time,” to a deeply emotional reading of “Oct 33” and the gospel-tinged “Colors” that featured an incendiary lead guitar break. And they threw in a really nice cover of “Sugar Man” by Rodriguez.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\n8:45 p.m. Sunday: The War on Drugs still firing on all cylinders\n\nIt could be argued that The War on Drugs were never meant to be experienced within minutes of watching an audience tossing inflatable dolls through the air to Matt and Kim.\n\nBut in a way, that may have worked to their advantage, in that it heightened the sensation that this was music operating on a level most acts playing Innings Fest weren’t even trying to achieve.\n\nThat this was something altogether more sublime.\n\nAdam Granduciel wasn’t kidding when he told us they’d been “firing on all cylinders” since reassembling to work up live arrangements of the songs on last year’s brilliant “I Don’t Live Here Anymore” before their first tour back since the pandemic hit.\n\nWhat they arrived at was an atmospheric wall of sound, often blurring the lines between the individual instruments, which underscored the haunted nature of the songs themselves.\n\nThere were moments that rocked, but even then, a haze hung over the proceedings, allowing the listener to get lost in the dream, as they say.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\n8:45 p.m. Sunday: Matt and Kim brought their club vibe to Tempe Beach Park\n\nNo one seemed more clearly driven to a state of near euphoria by the experience of playing Innings Fest than Matt and Kim.\n\nNot even Dave Grohl at his most ecstatic.\n\nBounding on stage to the first of many hip-hop samples — Fatman Scoop “Be Faithful” maybe? — they threw themselves directly into “Hey Now” with youthful abandon.\n\nBefore the song was over, Kim was standing on her kick drum, grinning ear to ear.\n\nThen, when the song was through, she came out from behind the kit and held her arm out.\n\n“Wait can I just show you guys?” she asked. “I’m shaking. That’s how nervous I was. I’m shaking. I’m so happy to be here.”\n\nTheir set was a pure distillation of joy devoid of inhibitions, good taste or concern for community standards.\n\nMatt played the intro to Van Halen’s “Jump” on his keyboards long enough to make it feel like they might really do it.\n\nKim exposed her breasts and shook them for the cameras.\n\nCompared to the marital aids she used to smack her floor tom during \"Get It,” that was pretty tame.\n\nToward the end of the set, their roadies tossed inflatable dolls to the crowd and the audience took it from there.\n\nIt was, in short, a wild night at the club as played out in a giant field.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\n8:30 p.m. Sunday: The War on Drugs let the crowd chill out for a bit Sunday evening\n\nPeople usually cheer at the end of songs.\n\nBut they also close their eyes and swayed as The War on Drugs guitarist Adam Granduciel soothed the crowd's energy with his guitar riffs — crisp, clean and yet seemingly relaxed. A few couples lingered in the back of the crowd and swayed to the music.\n\nThe vibe of the music fit the fashions on display in the crowd as well. Two men walked by in sequined gold and silver blazers, a few girls flaunted their '90s sunglasses with vintage flared jeans and several sported neon headbands. The eclectic but relaxed look fits the music.\n\n— Sofia Krusmark\n\n7:30 p.m. Sunday: Matt and Kim found a young, and festively dressed, fan\n\nI wasn't sure how well people in the audience knew the indie electronic duo Matt and Kim.\n\nTurns out, their number one fans were dressed in a strawberry suit, a banana onesie and a hot dog onesie. The three led the crowd from their spot at the front.\n\nIllinois resident Derek Burch flew out with his girlfriend Emalie Thornton and her 6-year-old daughter, Parker Turner, who was dressed like the strawberry. The family was in its most festive decor.\n\n\"We just wore what we had in the closet,\" Thornton said, laughing.\n\nBurch, who introduced the band to Turner and Thornton, has seen Matt and Kim 15 times. This was the child's first Matt and Kim concert and the band members (Matt Johnson and Kim Schifino) even offered to have \"the strawberry\" surf the crowd.\n\nTurner loved the idea.\n\n— Sofia Krusmark\n\n6:30 p.m. Sunday: All of the performers aren't on stage at Innings Fest\n\nFitz and the Tantrums like to perform — but their fans might sing even louder than them.\n\nSongs like \"Out of My League\" and \"HandClap\" left fans singing entire verses and choruses while the band jumped up and down, shook tambourines and rode on the screams of the crowd.\n\nUp close, fans scream in your ears. And from far away, you can hear the band drop their voices from the mics and pass the song to the crowd.\n\nOne crowd member, Stacy, beat the younger fans out for a spot right in front of the stage. She's been a fan of the band for the last 13 years. The way she grooved to the song \"Money Grabber\" was proof of her fandom. She was the only one within earshot who knew all the words.\n\n\"You just gotta live when you're in your 50s,\" Stacy said, as she bounced up and down to the music.\n\n— Sofia Krusmark\n\n4 p.m. Sunday: Low Cut Connie brought big fun to its second-stage set\n\nLow Cut Connie’s Adam Weiner was in many ways the weekend’s most cartoonish presence and in many ways its most sincere, often blurring the lines between the two extremes in a wildly entertaining second-stage performance.\n\nWeiner offset his piano-pounding wild man shtick at the helm of a spirited soul-punk revue with heartfelt monologues about making it through these troubled times together and remembering those who didn’t, often punctuating the gospel he was throwing down with “baby” or “babies.”\n\nAs in “Low Cut Connie loves you, baby.”\n\nAfter asking “Do you want to see me take off all my clothes right now right on top of this piano,” he climbed on top of that piano and tore his tank top in half.\n\nHe also pounded out a solo on that oft-abused piano with the bottom of a mic stand.\n\nAs much as Weiner tends to dominate the spotlight, that set wouldn’t have been nearly as unhinged if the other members of his band hadn’t been every bit as committed to taking it over the top as he was.\n\nHighlights ranged from a cover of Prince’s “America” to “Shake it Little Tina,” a song he dedicated to “my hero,” Tina Turner.\n\nIt was like a rock ‘n’ revival tent, Weiner talking about the musicians we’ve these past two years and saying, “I feel like it’s our job to keep the spirit alive.”\n\nAnd that’s exactly what their set was all about, especially “Revolution Rock n Roll,” a song that warned, If you don’t preserve it, then you don’t deserve it.”\n\nCan he get a hallelujah?\n\n— Ed Masley\n\n2 p.m. Sunday: Hometown act Sydney Sprague gets things started Sunday\n\nWelcoming festival goers back to Innings Fest on Sunday as the first act of the day was something of a warmup gig for hometown hero Sydney Sprague.\n\nShe’s leaving Monday to open a co-headlining tour by fellow Innings act Dashboard Confessional and fellow local act Jimmy Eat World.\n\nAnd she definitely made the most of the challenging opportunity that the opening act on a festival faces, welcoming early arrivals to her set with the explosive whisper-to-a-scream dynamics of “I Refuse to Die,” her band fleshed out by kindred spirit Danielle Durack on guest harmonies.\n\nIt was the first of several highlights pulled from last year’s “Maybe I Will See You at the End of the World,\" the debut that landed her spots on things like Innings Fest and a Jimmy Eat World tour, from “Staircase Failure” to the melancholy title track.\n\nTwo songs in, she introduced herself and pointed out that she’s from Phoenix.\n\n“So I’m really stoked to be here,” she added. “It’s really convenient.”\n\nIn addition to songs from her debut, she shared a new song with a chorus of “My mind goes terrible places” and “a cover that as far as I can tell is definitely about baseball,” Fall Out Boy’s “Sugar We’re Goin Down.”\n\n— Ed Masley\n\nSt. Vincent was stunning Saturday night\n\nSt. Vincent brought a wildly theatrical art-funk revue to the main stage at Innings Fest, with Annie Clark leading her bandmates in a set that put the focus squarely on her two most recent efforts, last year’s “Daddy’s Home,” which topped our year-end album list, and “MASSEDUCTION.”\n\nIt was sexy, cerebral, exciting and fun, with several walk-ons by a waitress, who at one point brought a phone onstage for Clark to answer.\n\nThe performance began with a trio of backup singers — Stevvi Alexander, Nayanna Holley and Danielle Withers — making their entrance to the sound of Jason Falkner’s wah-guitar and a bass-driven funk groove before Clark emerged to set the tone with the robotic art-funk of “Digital Witness.”\n\nClark has assembled an amazing touring band, from Falkner to bassist Justin Meldal-Johnsen, drummer Mark Guiliana and keyboard player Rachel Eckroth, who spent a good part of her formative years in Phoenix.\n\nIt was brilliantly staged and/or choreographed. And Clark is an increasingly commanding presence who’s only gotten more provocative and playful with each passing tour.\n\nFor all the effort they put into staging, though, the set felt very much alive, at times recalling Prince or Dave Bowie in the way it pushed the sonic envelope without relinquishing the groove.\n\nThe songs that featured Clark and Falkner squaring off on dueling lead guitars run through effects that made them sound as otherworldly as something off of Bowie’s “Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps)” album were especially exhilarating.\n\nAfter making their way through such obvious highlights as “Birth in Reserve,” a “Sugarboy” that came to a cacophonous conclusion, the killer funk of “Pay Your Way in Pain” and the slamming power chords of “Cheerleader,” they ended with “The Melting of the Sun,” slowing it down to dramatic effect before going a cappella with handclaps.\n\nIt’s pretty safe to assume it was all a bit much for some Foo Fighters fans in attendance. But Clark remains one of the more intriguing artists of her generation and this set more than lived up to her reputation as must-see artist.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\n9 p.m. Saturday: Caamp singer didn't let getting hit by a car stop the show\n\nAt a certain point, a grinning Taylor Meier felt compelled to ask the crowd, “You want to know what happened, don’t you?”\n\nHe was several songs deep into his second-stage performance at the helm of Caamp by that point, after all, and hadn’t played guitar all night, what with his right arm being in a sling.\n\n“Well,” Maier said, “I got hit by a car last night. Spent a few hours in the ER, but we’re good and we’re here. Let’s go.”\n\nAnd with that, he led his bandmates in a heartfelt “By and By.”\n\nMaier being in a sling meant Evan Westfall had to play guitar all night and couldn’t do his banjo parts.\n\nSo everything was kind of sparse and weird and different. But that just made it feel like you were seeing something no one would’ve seen if someone hadn’t hit him with a car.\n\nIt made it special.\n\nMaier clearly saw the humor in the situation. “I feel like Ricky Bobby up here,” he joked. “I don’t know what to do with my hands.”\n\nHowever awkward Maier felt, it didn’t stop him from delivering with the lyrics with characteristic conviction. He’s got what you might call a lived-in voice, lapsing into a Dylanesque wheeze as it does on occasion.\n\nBefore the set was through, he took a moment to clarify that he hadn’t been drunkenly wandering the streets when he was hit.\n\n“Dude smoked me on the sidewalk,” he said with a grin.\n\nAs they were nearing the end of a set whose many highlights ranged from “No Sleep” to “Send the Fisherman” and “Peach Fuzz,” Maier said, “I feel like I’m singing karaoke to 8,000 people. It’s kinda cool 'cause I know all the words, but I kinda wish I had a guitar in my hand.”\n\n— Ed Masley\n\n8:20 p.m. Saturday: Recycle a cup and win a prize?\n\nSomeone walked past seemingly holding a massive slinky.\n\nUpon further inspection, it turned out that he was carrying a stack of orange plastic cups. It had grown so long that gravity made it arc down toward the ground. He plucked another cup from a recycling bin and added it to his cup-slinky.\n\nWhy? Well, he’s trying to win a prize. What prize? It’s anyone’s guess because the website that the QR code directs to does not say.\n\nSee, there are bins around the grounds — powered by TURN’s capture and reuse system — which collect the cups that vendors use for drinks. Festivalgoers can register their wristband, scan it on the lid of the bin and drop their cup inside for a chance to win. Unfortunately, the QR code on these cup return signs does not elaborate on what a recycled cup can earn you.\n\nThe odds of winning are supposedly 20 to 1, so it looks like this guy and his 30-some cups might hit a home run today.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\n7 p.m. Saturday: Pro trip: Arrive early, and don’t forget your phone\n\nAs the Innings Festival entrance came into sight, I passed by a person using some choice expletives to describe the line.\n\nIt was unclear which line she was describing. There was one queue going down the block for will call across the street as well as several snaking lines heading into Tempe Beach Park. The latter proved to be an avoidable, disorganized mess of human beings crowding into one area.\n\nThe relief upon finally making it inside the festival was short-lived for one family. As I wandered toward the Home Plate stage, one horrified kid turned to his parents.\n\n“Where’s my phone?” he asked.\n\nAfter confirming that it wasn’t inside his or his brother’s pockets, the resigned family split up, with one parent taking him back the way they came.\n\nI’m not optimistic that they’ll make it back in time for St. Vincent to take the stage.\n\n— KiMi Robinson\n\n5:30 p.m. Saturday: Black Pistol Fire moves up to the main stage\n\nBlack Pistol Fire emerged as a crowd-pleasing highlight of opening day, as anyone who saw them work their unhinged brand of blues-punk magic on an unsuspecting crowd in an electrifying second-stage performance in 2019 had to know they would. They’ve graduated to the main stage in the intervening years without losing the spark that made them burn so brightly in the first place.\n\nThey exploded on impact with “Pick Your Poison” and before the song was through, guitar-playing vocalist Kevin McKeown had left the stage and was communing with the audience down front. He dropped to his knees and flipped over while soloing on the stage during “Speak of the Devil,” eliciting howls of approval from the audience.\n\nAnd he brought the set to a raucous conclusion with the reckless abandon and furious shredding of “Bully” while crowd surfing.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\n5:30 p.m. Saturday: 2022 Innings Festival makes a new fan\n\nFirst-time Innings Festival attendee Stephen Navin from Utah doesn’t usually go to festivals, but he would definitely come back to this one he says.\n\n“There is nice separation between stages and you aren’t confined to one spot,” Navin said. “You can move depending on who you want to see perform. There’s even space to move around,” he said as he kicked a hacky sack to his friend. Navin and his friends traveled from Utah and they are particularly excited to see Caamp. Their group of friends secured a spot near the front of the Right Field stage.\n\nPassing the time with fun activities while waiting for acts to perform isn’t uncommon at the Innings Festival. There are people throwing frisbees, playing on the large scale Connect Four and taking snapshots with the cool Innings Festival Photo Booth that has a view of the Home Plate stage.\n\n— Shanti Lerner\n\n4:30 p.m. Saturday: Strong set with a nod to Diamondbacks great Randy Johnson\n\nAs great as Girlhouse was to witness, the first act on opening day that seemed hellbent on working his way up the ladder to one of those headlining sets at a future Innings Fest engagement was Del Water Gap, the solo project of songwriter S. Holden Jaffe, who made the most his afternoon second-stage set.\n\nAn animated frontman in high-waisted trousers and heart-shaped sunglasses, Jaffe comes blessed with a show-stopping voice – a soulful instrument with real power and range that he used to brilliant effect in a crowd-pleasing set whose highlights ranged from “Hurting Kind” to “High Tops” and “I Hope You Understand.”\n\nIt doesn’t hurt that Jaffe has a brilliant onstage foil in guitarist Nick Cianci, whose leads were just flashy enough grab the spotlight but scrappy enough to give the songs more of an edge than they would otherwise have had. He also dressed for the occasion in a bright red Arizona T-shirt.\n\nJaffe also showed the home team fans some extra love.\n\n“This festival is special to me because I grew up loving baseball and the first game I saw was the Diamondbacks,” he revealed.\n\nThen he tossed in the first of two references to Randy Johnson and his mustache.\n\nThe second time, as they were winding down their set, he said, “Is Randy Johnson here? Oh my God, it’s him! You shaved your mustache.”\n\n— Ed Masley\n\n4:30 p.m. Saturday: Nothing like the loyalty of good friends\n\nBrothers Michael and Matt Musso and Alex Street were certainly getting attention amongst the sea of people as they held up signs promoting their friends’ Austin-based band, Briscoe. Their sign with big letters, invited concert goers to come see the Briscoe play tomorrow at 1:30 p.m. at the festival's Home Plate stage. The Musso brothers and Street traveled all the way from Austin to Phoenix to support their longtime friends, Truett Heintzelman and Philip Lupton, the duo that makes up the band.\n\nWhen asked why they were holding signs and calling other festival goers to see Briscoe, “This is pure loyalty,” Street said.\n\n“We are doing door-to-door advertising here,” Michael Musso said. “It's exciting to see our friends at this kind of venue.”\n\n— Shanti Lerner\n\n4 p.m. Saturday: Mainstage audience gets to know Girlhouse\n\nLauren Luiz of Girlhouse did a great job of making the first main-stage set of the opening day at Inning Fest feel like a slow night at Modified Arts (or any small all-ages arts space).\n\nAfter setting the tone for a powerful set of understated, minimalist chamber pop with a nakedly honest rendition of “Happy Now,” she welcomed the crowd.\n\n“Our band’s name is Girlhouse,” Luiz said. “We don’t expect you to know that at all. So no pressure. But let’s get to know each other.”\n\nIt would’ve been hard not to feel you were getting to know her as the set progressed, from the vulnerable feelings she expressed so well in richly detailed lyrics to her frequent attempts to strengthen that connection with her clearly nervous banter.\n\nShe prefaced the Innings-compatible “Ballcap Szn” with “I hope you guys get a nice little break from all the chaos in the world that’s always happening at all times.” Or words to that effect.\n\nAnd when it came time to unleash their haunting reinvention of Counting Crows’ “A Long December,” it came with a warning.\n\n“This is a cover that I always (expletive) up,” she said “And I’m gonna try not to cry when I do.”\n\nIf there was any crying, it was for the way they tapped into raw emotion of those lyrics.\n\n— Ed Masley\n\n3:30 p.m. Saturday: Festival fashion is fun and functional\n\nNothing says express yourself like festival fashion. At Innings Fest Saturday afternoon, festival goers are dressed in boho and hippie chic outfits colored by bandanas, flowers, and funky sunglasses. There is also no shortage of baseball jerseys of people's favorite teams from the Giants to the Red Sox and the Cardinals.\n\nTo take a little heat off from the bright sun, big sun hats and cowboy hats stick out among the crowd. Clear backpacks, purses, and fanny packs are also in style. There’s also a guy walking around in a banana suit so keep your eyes peeled in case you want to catch a photo with him.\n\n— Shanti Lerner\n\n3:30 p.m. Saturday: Music fans are staking out a spot to catch their favorites\n\nThe stages and the drink vendors are conveniently located adjacent to one another. On one side of the park, festival goers have easy access to beverages and still got a glimpse of the band Black Pistol Fire as they played a cover of Childish Gambino’s \"Redbone.\" While some fans walk back and forth to quench their thirst, others lounge on blankets under the hot sun while crowds are still trickling in to catch the late afternoon acts like Caamp and Billy Strings. One fan shouted to her friend “I only came for Billy Strings, he’s a god on the guitar.”\n\n— Shanti Lerner", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/02/sport/jsu-basketball-takeoff-shot-houston-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "JSU head coach Deion Sanders to prohibit players from leaving ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nJackson State University head football coach Deion Sanders has told his players they can’t leave their hotel in Houston, Texas, this upcoming weekend in the wake of rapper Takeoff’s fatal shooting in the city.\n\nThe undefeated Tigers (8-0) face Texas Southern in Houston on Saturday and in a video shared by Sanders on social media, the JSU coach told his players: “Takeoff was right murdered in a dice game in Houston – where we’re going.

There is a buzz about Baiz that can’t be faked, a feeling of community grounded in food, where Middle Eastern, Arabic and North African cultures come together. Al-Hana, the diminutive restaurant squeezed into a corner of Baiz, remains one of the city’s best spots to sample Arabic cuisine, a bustling place to catch a bite while taking a break from shopping for groceries. Breads are tender and steaming, topped with seasoned beef, spinach and cheese or a simple sprinkling of za’atar. Familiar mezze like baba ghannouj and hummus have an atypical richness (along with a proper helping of olive oil). Rotisserie-seared shawarma is juicy and gorgeously seasoned, piled atop rice or wrapped up with garlicky toum and pickled vegetables. Al-Hana might lack the polished efficiency of its contemporaries, but its pure flavor and energy cannot be denied.\n\nDetails: 523 N. 20th St., Phoenix.

If there’s one thing my readers seem to feel they lack, it’s meat-and-potatoes fare with a little Old-World charm. It’s here, but it can be a little hard to find, and All Pierogi kitchen is a standout. A no-frills Ukrainian mom-and-pop joint run by friendly folks, this is the go-to spot for pierogi, cabbage rolls and sausage. It’s distressing how many restaurants around town prepare this kind of food with the grace and dexterity of a drunken elephant, but that only makes it easier to appreciate a place that gets it right. Pierogi, whether boiled or pan-fried, are tender and flavorful; meat fillings have just the right texture and consistency; and sauces taste fresh and well-seasoned. Add a little soup, some vegetable salads, reasonable prices and you have some of the best Old-World cuisine in town.\n\nDetails: 1245 W. Baseline Road, Mesa.

Zhor Saad practically runs the restaurant by herself, which means dinner is outstanding, but it’s going to take a while. Unceremoniously tucked into a market and clothing store, Alzohour is a place where diners can drown in the sultry scent of Moroccan fare that’s equal parts bold and lusty. Arabic classics of variable quality round out the offerings, but the meat of the menu is in dishes like a silky, perfumed lamb tagine, meat dripping off the bone, heavy with saffron and spice. Couscous billows with steam, saturated with vegetables and topped with tender meats. Bastilla — a nutty ground chicken pie wrapped in crisp phyllo and dusted with cinnamon and sugar — is a mind-bending blend of savory and sweet. On the purely sweet end of the spectrum, Saad’s kunafeh is next level, almost custardy with a deep golden, crisp crust and a heavy dose of pistachio. Not all will appreciate the market-chic environment, but none of that matters when your host prepares everything with a warm heart and you’re lost in a saffron-scented cloud.\n\nDetails: 7814 N. 27th Ave., Phoenix.

When the Calabrian native tired of trying to please the white tablecloth crowd, he opened Andreoli, a casual neighborhood grocery with a few tables that serves some of the best traditional Italian fare in town. This culinary curmudgeon with an uncompromising vision is as likely to be in the front of house sipping espresso and watching soccer as he is to be in the back of house running the kitchen. His work is a devastating combination of simplicity, technique and killer ingredients that exposes the purveyors of oafish red sauce concoctions and pretentious, overworked modern Italian for the charlatans they are. Grab a loaf of craggy bread, order a perfect pasta or grilled seafood from the white board, snag some sticky cornetti marmelatta or crisp, layered sfogliatelle from the pastry case and consider yourself lucky that such a skilled Italian traditionalist calls Scottsdale home.\n\nDetails: 8880 E.

Sparingly decorated and showing its age, this strip-mall stalwart makes its impact on the plate; and a dual-menu system makes it the ideal place to ease neophytes into more traditional fare. The black-rimmed American menu features juicy pot stickers, crisp orange beef and sizzling pepper beef. But drift over to the red-rimmed traditional menu and the skies open. Meltaway duck is wrapped in a crisp taro crust; West Lake soup suspends gossamer threads of egg in a silky broth; braised tofu bubbles in a clay pot with sweet shrimp. And whole fish pulled live from the tank is buried in scallions and ginger and splashed with a bit of soy and shaoxing. Keep exploring, and when you’re ready for the stuffed duck feet, they’ll be waiting for you.\n\nDetails: 9880 S. Rural Road, Tempe. MAP IT! 480-705-7486. Search \"Asian Hong Kong\" on Facebook.\n\nAtlas Bistro\n\nTodd Sawyer’s restaurant is a chameleon. Quiet and unassuming, hidden in a strip mall on the fringes of the Old Town spotlight, it changes its colors through the years as chefs come and go. It’s also one of the most reliably excellent restaurants in the Valley — a BYOB, to boot — that has never been better than it is under the auspices of chef Cory Oppold. The stark antithesis of flashy downtown Scottsdale just a few blocks to the north, Atlas Bistro piggybacks on AZ Wine Company, an intimate room with minimal decor and sound-deadening walls. While the setting is modest, the plates are filled with pyrotechnics, showy but thoughtful multi-component affairs that nimbly merge disparate flavors and techniques to compelling effect. Think slivers of tender beef tongue pastrami with a honey mustard emulsion; kombu-marinated black cod with yerba mate béarnaise; or a goat cheese mousse spiked with Jidori chicken skin crisps and poached cranberries. Wine geeks love the capable bottle service and, as a bonus, Oppold’s vegetarian creations are some of the best in town.\n\nDetails: 2515 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

The Osmic family first opened Balkan Bakery a decade ago, and while a short list of common baked goods and sweets are solid offerings, it’s the Bosnian specialties that make Balkan Bakery a destination. Aldijana prepares the cevapi, seasoning and stuffing the little sausages in preparation for the grill, where they take on a crisp char. Her brother, Jasenko, handles the stuffed breads, stretching a thin layer of dough over the prep table, stuffing and rolling it into a tube and, with a quick flick of his wrist, curling it into a tight swirl the size of a lunch plate. Stuffed with meat (burek), cheese (sirnica) or spinach (zeljanica), it’s divine, contrasting a light, crisp shell with a steaming, tender, layered interior.\n\nDetails: 1107 E. Bell Road, Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-996-4598, facebook.com/BalkanBakery.\n\nBar Pesce\n\nBeginnings don’t come much humbler than a counter at the Steven Paul Salon, but Cullen Campbell’s evolution from goofy genius behind one of the Valley’s all-time zaniest guerilla operations into one of its most vibrant, alluring and sure-handed chefs is a testament to his culinary acumen. At Bar Pesce — the recently refreshed moniker for what used to be Crudo — Italy may be the inspiration, but this born-and-bred Southerner is after something a little more lusty, weaving crudi, composed cheese plates and succulent meats from smoke and olive oil and acid. Uni is dressed with shaved shallot and avocado, while bottarga and i’itoi onions give sweet raw yellowtail a salty, spicy sting. Burrata is amped up with an unctuous pancetta vinaigrette; and ricotta is simply paired with walnuts and desert honey. Meltaway semolina gnocchi drown in a succulent lamb neck sugo, while lamb belly gently braises in milk and mirepoix. Even when Campbell’s flavors are light, they’re distilled down to a knee-buckling, vivid intensity. And the modest prices on the prix fixe aren’t a mistake — not only is this one of the best restaurants in town, it’s also one of the best bargains.\n\nDetails: 3603 E. Indian School Road, Phoenix.

Not to knock Sonora, but Mexico is a big country and most of its cuisine is still brutally underrepresented in Phoenix. Barrio Café gives the central and southern Mexican states a local voice. Cochinita pibil — pork steamed in achiote and sour orange — sneaks up from Yucatan. Puebla’s symbol of national pride, chiles en nogada, are stuffed with a chunky, fruit-laced picadillo and drenched in almond cream. The moles of Oaxaca — from a dark and smoky mole negro to the herbal, pungent pipian verde — are gorgeously complex. The kitchen throws caution to the wind, more concerned with dropping flavor bomb after flavor bomb than dotting the I’s and crossing the T’s. Fun-loving, sometimes irreverent servers are the antithesis of the standard-issue scripted corporate dullards.\n\nDetails: 2814 N. 16th St., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-636-0240, barriocafe.com.\n\nBarrio Cafe Gran Reserva\n\nIf Barrio Café is where Silvana Salcido Esparza slings unbridled, brash flavor, Gran Reserva is where she takes that burst of energy and focuses it to pinpoint intensity. Tucked into a tiny wedge of a dining room with a wraparound view of Grand Avenue, Gran Reserva is Barrio Café’s elegant cousin, draped in white tablecloths and colorful trompe l’oeil. An a la carte menu rehashes many of Barrio Café’s greatest hits, but Gran Reserva’s mission is revealed in the menu de degustación, where Mexican fare reaches levels of refinement not seen elsewhere in the Valley. Sous vide duck meets sultry cranberry mole; suckling pig confit is treated with chile de arbol demiglace; and a cap of lime foam and queso Oaxaqueño sits half melted, wrapped in fragrant hoja santa with a touch of chile and peanut oil. The best part? At less than $50, the degustación menu is priced for the people, and a bevy of vegan dishes make Gran Reserva a viable option for anyone.\n\nDetails: 1301 W. Grand Ave., Phoenix.

He achieved the dream of a local restaurant group with enough concepts to make some coin but not so many that he had to sacrifice his integrity. But Binkley shut it all down for one reason: He isn’t a restaurateur and he desperately missed the kitchen. Now, the celebrated chef with obsessive focus and puckish tendencies has turned a Phoenix bungalow into his personal culinary playground — and everyone is invited. Fine dining has never been so welcoming, like a private dinner party that starts with a series of modernist amuses on the veranda; moves into the bar for snacks like grilled soppressata chips and confit duck wings; and ends in the dining room with coddled goose eggs, sweet pea agnolotti and whole roasted lamb. There is no fourth wall here (literally). Roll up your sleeves, step into the open kitchen and lend a hand. There’s plenty of joy to go around.\n\nDetails: 2320 E. Osborn Road, Phoenix.

But its sneaky, under the radar bar bites deserve their fair share of attention, too. Bob Tam’s menu — an irreverent foil for Ross Simon’s encyclopedic cocktail list — isn’t meant to be taken too seriously, but Tam’s puckish Asian fusion creations reveal his deep understanding of the underlying cuisines. The Angry Panda wraps crisp peanuts, chiles and dried anchovies in cool lettuce leaves with fresh herbs. Seoul fried chicken gets a sweet and spicy lift from watermelon kimchi with a dab of sesame ranch. Chinese buns are filled with deeply caramelized chunks of pork belly, a throwback to Tam’s days at San Francisco’s Betelnut. The Dragon Dumpling Burger is a juicy beef and pork concoction that channels the spirit of xiaolongbao into a burger slathered with mayo and Sichuan pickles, complete with dipping sauce. Best part? It all goes well with booze.\n\nDetails: Luhrs Building, 1 W. Jefferson St., Phoenix.

Under the auspices of celebrity chef Michael Mina and executive chef Sara Garrant, the flagship restaurant at Fairmont Scottsdale Princess sports a contemporary elegance and refinement. If you’re looking for a dry-aged tomahawk rib eye, they’ve got you covered. But the offerings also drift into esoterica, such as a butter-poached Snake River Farms rib eye cap that’s so tender and sweet it’s almost like a different animal altogether. If you really want to go big, the roster is deep with domestic and imported premium beef that runs up to $45 per ounce. Excellent sauces abound and sides show a penchant for Asian flavors, like mushrooms plied with white soy and mirin; or a dynamite short rib fried rice with kimchi and chunks of sweet Chinese sausage. It has the luxury prices to match, but, put simply, Bourbon Steak is operating at a higher plane than the rest of the pack.\n\nDetails: Fairmont Scottsdale Princess, 7575 E. Princess Drive.

But the Pua family came to the rescue in 2015 and still stands tall as the lone ambassador for Malaysian cuisine. Thankfully, it’s a charming, casual little spot with an extensive menu filled with dishes unobtainable anywhere else in town. Batter-dipped chicken wings are fried to a shattering crisp and served with two spicy-sweet sambals — the “mama” and the “papa.” Roti canai pairs thick, oily flatbread with a rich coconut-based curry sauce for dipping and slurping. Laksa — the iconic Malaysian soup that takes many forms — is done here as a rich and fragrant coconut and lemongrass broth with noodles, seafood and bean sprouts. Sweet, steamed Hainan chicken is paired with rich, oil-splashed rice. And char kway teow — a universal crowd-pleaser — is a warm and steaming stir-fry of thick rice noodles in a sweet and comforting soy-based sauce.\n\nDetails: 1845 E. Broadway Road, Tempe.

Jamaican food is hole-in-the-wall, mom-and-pop fare, a quarter of fiery jerk chicken or slippery stewed oxtails ladled into a to-go container with rice, beans and plantains, right? But island cuisine can bring an air of refinement just like any other, and here’s the proof. Jamaican-born rum savant Dwayne Allen takes a deep dive into his spirit of choice, slinging educational flights and stellar cocktails in the dark and cozy Rum Bar. Meanwhile, the immensely talented Danielle Leoni has adopted the flavor and fire of her husband’s homeland, leading a kitchen that puts Jamaican fare in a context rarely seen in the States. Scallops seared in cast iron get a splash of Appleton rum for a sweet, rich glaze, while vinegary sauteed shrimp explode with cayenne and habanero. Pan-fried escovitch fish is buried under a pile of sultry vegetables. And Leoni’s house jerk — whatever it seasons — pulls no punches, an uncompromising blend of vinegar, spices, chiles and herbs that is as flavorful as it is incendiary.\n\nDetails: 108 E.

Vince Mellody is playing that part at one of the Valley’s more quirky and delicious recent openings. Housed in a decidedly chill Coronado bungalow without a hint of pretention or ego, Bri (rhymes with pie) slings an ever-changing collection of small, creative plates, most of them forged in a South African-style grill over live coals. The room is comfortable and Mellody’s food is on point. But Bri’s greatest asset, perhaps, is a menu that’s almost pointedly out of lockstep with its contemporaries. Frico caldo, Italian pan-fried cheese and potato cakes, sport a gorgeous lacy crisp and a dollop of tomato relish. Tender, charred pork ribs are laced with fermented black beans and crisped shallots, while slow-roasted duck breast gets a topping of crisp chile sauce. A pureed Persian salad called bademjan employs eggplant to devastating effect, charred jet-black to lend a little bitterness and a ton of depth.\n\nDetails: 2221 N. Seventh St., Phoenix.

Truth is, Buddyz makes a better deep dish than most of the joints back home, and I include the big, beloved goons like Lou Malnati’s, Giordano’s and Gino’s East. All of which is to say that somebody has to sing the praises of this place. A recent expansion effort has brought Buddyz out of the pastures of Queen Creek, which is a good thing; it was flying under the radar for too long and there’s nobody who doesn’t need this in their life. A thick, crunchy crust gets a none-too-subtle (but not overwhelming) puddle of melty cheese and a crown of bright, chunky tomato sauce, seasoned just so and spruced up with the requisite punch of dried herbs. Equal parts dinner and architecture, it’s a gooey, hedonistic mess. Deep dish isn’t pizza? It’s a casserole, you say? Call it whatever you want, tough guy. Now shut up, eat it and then tell me to my face that it didn’t taste good.\n\nDetails: 18423 E. San Tan Blvd., Queen Creek. MAP IT! 480-822-1225.

Sun Johnson, who was born and raised in Korea, teamed up with Nick Rocha to open a Korean restaurant that’s a rarity in the Valley. Why? It doesn’t act as though Korean cuisine is exclusively about grilled meat. Forget the tabletop grill. Ga Hyang doesn’t have them — it doesn’t need them. Start with duk boki, a mix of chewy rice cakes and tender fish cakes, swimming in a bath of pure onion and chile fire. Follow with haemul pajeon, a thick, crisp pancake stuffed with sweet scallions and seafood of all manner. When it’s a furnace outside, take refuge in mul naeng myun, slippery noodles with beef brisket and slivers of crisp, fresh fruit in a mustard-spiked beef broth that is literally iced over. Or warm yourself with a pure, milky sul long tang, slow-simmered from beef bones. The best thing here comes free of charge. Johnson’s banchan — the collection of pickled, marinated and fermented little dishes that accompany the meal — run circles around every other Korean restaurant in town. Nobody even comes close.\n\nDetails: 4362 W. Olive Ave., Glendale. MAP IT! 623-937-8550.

That’s no less true of the original Carolina’s near downtown Phoenix, where some dishes are better than others. But what Carolina’s does right is very, very right, and a diverse crowd that seems to represent the entire city comes down every day to take part in it. If we’re being honest, Carolina’s is a decrepit hole in the wall with little more than folding tables and chairs and a couple of soda machines. But what comes out of the kitchen is nothing less than the soul of Phoenix. Carolina’s was making giant flour tortillas decades before California decided it was cool, and they’re still some of the best — made to order and hot enough to burn your tongue. They make some fabulous, soupy burros, wrapped around stewed green or red chile, though the less iconic Oaxaca Special — with beans, cheese and chorizo — may be my favorite. Better yet, go ahead and get a machaca chimichanga. Here, it’s light and crisp, almost like pastry, and they might be the best argument for the form around.\n\nDetails: 1202 E. Mohave St., Phoenix.

Shouldn’t we have gotten over this by now? I say a lusty celebration of all things fragrant and funky is the cure, and Casa Filipina is where we’re going to throw the party. The poster child for laid-back international fare, Casa Filipina is a cozy mom-and-pop shop that joins a bakery and restaurant. The former fills multiple cases with wild and colorful sweets; the latter fills a menu with homestyle classics of Filipino cuisine. The uninitiated can ease into things with papery-crisp, cigar-shaped lumpia — Filipino spring rolls — or tortang talong, a gentle, comforting omelet stuffed with eggplant and pork. Speaking of pork, swineophiles will lose their minds over the crisp pata, a massive pork hock fried to a golden crisp; or the lechon kawali — chunks of crispy pork with a liver-enriched, sweet-and-sour sauce. When you’re ready, the funky, peanutty intensity of the kare kare or the dinuguan — a gorgeously thick, black vinegar and pork blood-enriched stew — will be waiting for you.\n\nDetails: 3531 W.

Cantonese, Sichuan, Hunan, sure, but who had even heard of Dongbei, nestled up to Korea in the far northeast reaches of the country? For many, Sunny Zhao and Lulu Zhou’s dumpling-dispensing destination was the first glimpse into a world of Chinese cuisine that stretched far beyond Americanized versions of midcentury standbys. Out with the rice, in with the wheat, formed into nubby chilled noodles dressed with tingling oil, baked into bread stuffed with leeks and rolled into the wrappers for Chou’s signature beef pies. The size of a hamburger patty with the juice of a soup dumpling and a sizzling, crunchy crust, they’re not to be missed. The winter gets cold in northwestern China, and Chou’s packs the kind of hearty soups and stews meant to insulate you from the cold and generate some heat. Not that we need more heat in Phoenix, but it’s a fascinating subset of Chinese cuisine to explore.\n\nDetails: 910 N. Alma School Road, Chandler, 480-821-2888. MAP IT! Also, 1250 E.

Sure, this is casual fare served from behind a fish counter, but its diminutive footprint belies the oversize impact it’s having on the local scene. Jon Heflin and Hogan Jamison truck in stellar seafood from San Diego three times a week, and the few staples they can’t catch or trade themselves are flown in from excellent sources. What isn’t sold in the case or distributed to local restaurants goes to chef Juan Zamora, who has crafted a compact but robust list of bowls, salads and sandwiches with everyday character and a hint of refinement. Cool mounds of cubed fish are joined by shishito peppers, slivered watermelon radish or pickled beech mushrooms. A delicately composed tostada or bruschetta might light up the specials board. Wednesday’s green chile tuna melt with fresh confit tuna and kimchi chimichurri has developed a fan club. There’s a reason the line is out the door and you can’t swing a stick in the place without hitting at least three chefs who are grabbing lunch on the way to work.\n\nDetails: 8015 E.

Formerly the right-hand man of Binkley’s culinary operation, Gauthier recently took over Carefree’s Café Bink and converted it into Confluence, a new spot that has the Valley’s fine-dining geeks all atwitter. In appearance, this is still a casual restaurant, little changed from the Café Bink days. But while the plates show Binkley’s influence on Gauthier’s work, this wild, creative fare is worlds apart from the bistro classics that previously anchored the space. A roasted peach dusted with cocoa and drizzled with honey plays against a creamy, funky Epoisses cheese fondue. A gloriously salty pork broth with simmered cockscomb works its way into the fibers of a slab of smoked pork belly, lightened with shiso and edamame. Fish dishes are tight. Golden pan-seared red snapper contrasts earthy lentils with sweet grapes and a light broth set ablaze with Calabrian chile. Halibut sits in a lush corn crema with little nibbles of Spanish chorizo and crispy garlic chips. Just a few months old, Confluence is doing some seriously exciting things and may be the sleeper hit of 2018.\n\nDetails: 36889 N. Tom Darlington Drive, Carefree.

Having parted ways with Helio Basin Brewing Co., Stanger teamed up with Sean Traynor to open a neighborhood restaurant/watering hole in suddenly red-hot south Tempe. The joint is no-frills, casual and a little raucous with a young drinking crowd. Cocktails, appropriately light and summery in the early going, have made for a nifty collection of refreshing concoctions. Stanger’s food, meanwhile, already is equal parts sharp and fascinating. Corn dumplings that resemble hush puppies sit in a thin, onion-rich Parmesan cream that’s good enough to be served on its own as a chilled soup. Forget the veggie burgers — Stanger builds a “burger” from celeriac and roasted vegetables that’s more satisfying than most meat substitutes. Medallions of beef swim in a Cheddar-scented beef jus; and the Belgian hare, with root vegetable pipian and a bit of apricot, is dynamite. Whatever you do, don’t skip the pie.\n\nDetails: 1006 E. Warner Road, Tempe. MAP IT! 480-629-4270, cottonandcopperaz.com.\n\nCrepe Bar\n\nJeff Kraus is a madman in the best possible way. It took a bit of a culinary kook to open a restaurant based around creative crepes in south Tempe long before south Tempe suddenly became cool. And thank heavens Kraus has no fear, because six years later, Crepe Bar still thrives, its namesake serving as a foundation to pitch a technicolor panoply of Kraus’ wild concoctions. His crepes might sport pork belly in a sweet espresso-maple glaze, drizzled with chile aioli under a soft, runny egg. They might be rolled and crisped like dosa, to be shattered and dipped in hummus with crispy chickpeas. They could be turned into chips to make crepe chilaquiles or smothered with jerk sausage and Fontina. They could be plied with lemon curd and hibiscus jelly, maple butter with bruleed bananas and pecans; or formed from buckwheat with Sonoran honey. Not to knock tradition, but creations like these are an expression of pure culinary joy — the intersection of a wild imagination and obsessive attention to detail with the humble crepe as the hook.\n\nDetails: 7520 S.

There is also the fact that Rich Hinojosa’s creations — whatever you wish to call them — are flat-out delicious. In Crujiente’s case, consider the taco a template, where tortillas serve as the flavorful foundation for meticulously crafted small plates that draw from Hinojosa’s heritage, his fine-dining pedigree and a wide palette of international flavors. A gorgeous slip of Texas wagyu is dressed with puckery pickled shimeji mushrooms, cilantro mojo and a dab of karashi mustard. A steaming wedge of crisp tempura-fried avocado pairs with black beans and pickled onions and chiles. Fish, tender and juicy or deftly fried, is perfectly seasoned and dressed. And the tacos Crujientes, piled into a craggy, crisp shell, exemplify the Mexican-American crossover dishes of Hinojosa’s San Antonio upbringing.\n\nDetails: 3961 E. Camelback Road, Phoenix.

What can I say? David Najor serves a flipping-good dog at the Tempe original (the downtown Phoenix location is independently owned). This is a decadent coney we’re talking about: A gently spiced, natural-casing dog with a killer snap — made for Najor by a Michigan sausage maker — drowning in meaty sauce, onions and a squirt of yellow mustard. Fries are spot-on, too, freshly cut and fried with a little crisp and a steaming, tender core. The burgers are just as good. Tiny golf-ball-size wads of meat are smashed on the griddle and cooked to a juicy, sizzling crisp, then layered with cheese and stacked tall. They’ll happily make them larger or smaller, but three to five of these skinny patties is the sweet spot, in my book. Grab a Faygo and a bag of chips and you’re good to go. Sure, it’s just burgers and dogs. But burgers and dogs are rarely so correct.\n\nDetails: 930 W. Broadway Road, Tempe.

A boutique hotel is in the works for the corner where Don & Charlie’s now stands, and pending city approval, Don Carson stands poised to enjoy a well-deserved retirement. But at the very least, this Chicago-style tavern with enough sports memorabilia to fill a museum will have one final sendoff during spring training. This is the kind of fare that appeals to the baseball crowd: chopped liver with crunchy bagel chips; scampi “Chicago style” (that’s shrimp DeJonghe for those in the know); baby back ribs sauced and charred to a smoky crisp; and a meat locker full of steaks, including a killer prime rib eye with a deep, blackened crust. This is well-prepared, easy-to-enjoy food served in a comfy old Barcalounger of a restaurant, and she’ll be dearly missed.\n\nDetails: 7501 E. Camelback Road, Scottsdale.

Justin Park’s food is meant to be consumed with alcohol, plain and simple, and it’s riotously fun. Tteok kochi — chewy little rice cake nubbins basted with gochujang, broiled to a sticky crisp and dusted with crushed peanuts — is the ultimate bar snack, as far as I’m concerned. The fire chicken is a rare spicy dish that lives up to its name, swimming in a screaming hot chile gravy beneath a blanket of melted mozzarella. Crispy chunks of fried chicken abound, whether doused in a sweet and spicy Korean red sauce, served with slivered onions and a creamy dressing or offered as padak — topped with a mountain of shredded scallions and a sweet soy-mustard dip. And the seafood pancake is an unusual take thereon, loose and eggy on the top with a delicately crisped bottom. Come for the food, stay for the booze and karaoke, then order a second round of snacks.\n\nDetails: 1954 S. Dobson Road, Mesa.

On recent visits to the Phoenix icon’s namesake steakhouse, I’ve had immolated chops, sauteed spinach that’s mostly unseasoned cream and salads composed of limp, wilting spring mix. And yet I find myself unable to leave Durant’s off my list. Not because I’m afraid to slay a sacred cow — there are enough popular omissions here to jam my inbox with angry reader emails for months — but because goldarnit, I just can’t help but love the place. Durant’s is as much a museum as it is a restaurant, a rare relic of a bygone era filled with red leather banquettes, patterned velvet walls and worn wooden bars. Meanwhile, servers are there when you need them, gone when you don’t, and they hit that perfect note of graceful deference with just a faint, sardonic wink. Restaurants like Durant’s simply don’t exist anymore, except when they do, apparently. I can’t look past what a rare and special place it is, no matter how badly the kitchen overcooks my steak. No, the food isn’t especially good. But I’ll be there, if they’ll still have me, sitting at the bar with a shrimp cocktail and a very large martini.\n\nDetails: 2611 N. Central Ave., Phoenix.

Sonoran hot dogs abound, particularly late at night, when the air starts to cool and the temporary street stands set up shop. One crucial quality separates good from the great: toasting. The worst Sonoran dog with a freshly griddled bun will be better than most of those with a steamed bun, but El Caprichoso doesn’t force us to choose. This is the quintessential Arizona street dog — a cheap, low-quality sausage wrapped in crisp bacon with a grocery list of Mexican toppings and a sweet bun griddled to a deep, gorgeous gold. A folding table, a pop-up tent, some fluorescent light and 100-degree temps at 2 a.m. and you have an Arizona rite of passage.\n\nDetails: 2826 N. 35th Ave., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-561-3723, facebook.com/sonorandogs.\n\nEl Horseshoe Restaurant\n\nPhoenix is replete with dusty, downscale, hole-in-the-wall Sonoran restaurants, but there’s something special about Horseshoe that I just can’t shake. Serving breakfast and lunch to a pickup-truck crowd, Rosa Avitia’s Mexican diner is a casual charmer. There’s something unassuming and honest in her minimal chilaquiles, stale tortillas toasted in oil, doused with fresh salsa and topped with melted mozzarella cheese and a dusting of cotija. A dead-simple birria pairs tender goat with thick corn tortillas, a basic broth that only comes alive when doctored to your taste. But the killer app, so to speak, is the machaca. At so many restaurants, it’s rehydrated sludge with the flavor of acrid pot roast. Here, it’s simple dried beef, pounded and cooked with just a splash of liquid, still dense and chewy — almost jerky-like — and perfect with eggs. The cebada, an horchata-like drink made with barley, is still too sweet, but it’s more flavorful and less overly sweet than most. Served in a giant red plastic cup, it somehow makes the whole meal feel correct.\n\nDetails: 2140 W. Buckeye Road, Phoenix.

It’s been more than a year since Eugenia Theodosopoulos closed the Tempe location of Essence Bakery Café, and if fans of the original are still a little raw, it isn’t hard to see why. She is an enormously skilled baker who brought her French training to the desert and — this is no easy task — learned to adapt her techniques to our environment. Her delicate macarons are what set the Pinterest crowd on fire. But there are stellar baked goods aplenty, like perfect croissants, crisp baguettes, fruit Danish and seasonal specials like buche de noel. More substantial fare is also a delight. Theodosopoulos makes an excellent turnover studded with crumbled sausage and Gruyere and — to nobody’s surprise — a killer quiche. Come lunchtime, a béchamel-drenched croque monsieur with a bit of jalapeño buzz or a silky chicken pot pie are both winners. And she sneaks in a little bit of her heritage in the form of a gloriously light spanakopita.\n\nDetails: 3830 W. Indian School Road, Phoenix.

This is the kind of place that restaurateurs will tell you isn’t supposed to succeed on the left half of the map. And yet there it is: A tiny independent serving straight-up traditional Italian classics, made with exceptional care and steadfastly refusing to drift into red sauce territory to please the masses. Fabio Ceschetti’s decision to abandon Scottsdale in favor of Peoria has paid him in spades, and it wasn’t a complex equation. This is the soul of casual Italian dining, serving wood-fired pizza and paste fatte in casa, such as lasagna plied with meaty ragu and smooth besciamella or airy gnocchi simply dressed in a silky, Gorgonzola-laced cream. Pizzas are spot-on, a gentle balance of chew and crisp and deeply developed flavor, topped with just a few perfect ingredients. Small, family-run spots that do so little but do it so well are the backbone of Italy’s restaurant culture, and the perfect antidote to a barrage of chains that overpromise and underdeliver.\n\nDetails: 8275 W.

There are endless reasons to love FnB, a quirky, cozy space that embodies its proprietors’ penchant for marching to their own beat. There’s Charleen Badman’s preternatural ability to coax vegetables into revealing their truest nature; her talent for sizzling premium proteins on the grill; and Pavle Milic’s zeal for Arizona wines and spirits. But perhaps more than all of that, their work has put a bold stamp on the Valley’s emergence as a maturing, sophisticated culinary scene that can run with the big boys without feeling the need to mimic them. Potted smoked trout rillettes join rustic bread and a rainbow of pickled vegetables. Creamy Peruvian aji amarilllo is wrapped in a crisp spring roll shell. And the Gilfeather rutabaga is a witty play on a classic baked potato, plied with ginger creme fraiche and chives. The way Badman ropes in diverse international influences while expressing Arizona’s underappreciated agricultural bounty is unparalleled. If one restaurant best exemplifies the blossoming of our cuisine over the past decade, it’s FnB.\n\nDetails: 7125 E. Fifth Ave., Scottsdale.

He followed his daughter to New York, and it seemed that his charming destination for classic Italian fare might be lost forever. But in 2012, he returned to Old Town and opened up a time portal on Scottsdale Road, leading straight into a bygone era of white tablecloths, soft music, servers who know when not to talk and Italian fare that sports a little class while satisfying on a deep, visceral level. Photos of Marlon Brando and Sophia Loren line the walls; a pungent swipe of fresh garlic lines the bruschetta; and a crisp, perfectly seasoned crust lines the exterior of the orecchie elefante, Fazzuoli’s take on a juicy, thick-cut veal chop Milanese. Franco’s gently tiptoes the line between Italian and American, embracing some of the New World’s meatier, saucier habits without drifting into full-blown red sauce territory. This is classic cuisine done right, a bit of old-school elegance and a nod to the days when we used the word “continental” without some of the era’s clunky heft. And if anything starts to feel a touch too rich, a taste of Fazzuoli’s sweet, airy merenghata will take care of that... subito.\n\nDetails: 4327 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

It’s even more unfortunate the one dish that has achieved widespread attention — fry bread— isn’t rooted in indigenous people’s centuries of history and culture. Rather, fry bread was a food of necessity prepared with government rations during a time when that same government was evicting them from the land that had sustained their culture. Still, here’s a dish that has become an emblem — both good and bad. The Fry Bread House, recognized by the James Beard Foundation as one of America’s Classics, makes by far the most delicious version I’ve tried in Phoenix. The first taste of Fry Bread House’s steaming, resilient bread with a gorgeous golden crisp is an “Aha!” moment, whether it’s piled with beans and meaty chile or dusted with cinnamon or powdered sugar and drizzled with honey.\n\nDetails: 4545 N. Seventh Ave., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-351-2345, facebook.com/frybreadhouse.\n\nGallo Blanco\n\nIt isn’t every day a dearly departed favorite comes back from the dead. When Gallo Blanco left the Clarendon Hotel, chef Doug Robson promised the white rooster would rise again. It took a few years, but the new Gallo Blanco is worth the wait. Robson’s casual, stylish spot in the Garfield district is leading a new wave of contemporary Arizona Mexican fare that’s smartly conceived, crisply executed, made with top-notch ingredients and a bargain for the price. Thick tortillas cradle taco fillings that get a quick sizzle in a wok. Salads composed with pristine produce boast a textural pop that gives them uncommon appeal. Quick-cured fish dishes like coctel de mariscos and ceviche de pescado are light and vibrant. And drippy, hedonistic affairs like the egg-soaked naco torta or the envuelto — pork al pastor suspended in gooey, griddled cheese — are completely irresistible. Toss in JT Taber’s breezy cocktails and it’s hard to want for more in a casual Mexican restaurant. If this is the wave of the future, we’re in for a good ride.\n\nDetails: 928 E. Pierce St., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-327-0880, galloblancocafe.com.\n\nGhost Ranch\n\nAaron Chamberlin’s latest is here, and it looks like a keeper. Just as Asian fusion was newly reborn as a subtler, more sophisticated version of its schlocky ‘90s self, Chamberlin and his chefs, Rene Andrade and Roberto Centeno, are doing the same with the Southwest fare of yore, making it lighter, fresher and more thoughtful. A couple of months into its run, Ghost Ranch is making a mark. A stylish New Mexico-inspired room designed by Gennaro Garcia proves an airy and colorful home to dishes that reference the history of Southwest cuisine while bucking its more dated conventions. Pumpkin soup is smooth and lush, its richness derived from caramelization rather than abundance of cream. Enchiladas are fried to a crisp and lightly dressed rather than smothered in an earthy, smoky sauce made with Chimayo chiles. The chile relleno is roasted rather than fried, stuffed with intense mushroom duxelles and topped with a nest of crispy leeks. And in a true nod to the times, one of the strongest dishes on the menu is the plato vegano, a gorgeous and hearty collection of roasted vegetables with a splash of coconut milk and a chipotle cashew cream.\n\nDetails: 1006 E.

But the soft-spoken Kantak is so much more than a salad slinger. The Gladly, his sophomore effort, is on point, a casual and stylish American restaurant that isn’t afraid to have fun. Sassy, hearty and just a little wonky enough with the fundamentals to satisfy, The Gladly slings a mean chicken liver pate with pistachio and sage mustard. Plus, a gorgeous duck meatloaf enriched with foie gets a smoked cherry demi-glace. Larded scallops are plied with a cola gastrique; and coffee-rubbed short ribs are eye-opening in more than one sense of the term. What’s more, Donald Hawk’s raw bar — offering straight-up chilled seafood alongside creations like his signature ahi crudo with brown-butter vinaigrette and raising relish — is the icing on an already formidable cake.\n\nDetails: 2201 E.

Glai Baan is the best Thai restaurant in Phoenix. Cat Bunnag’s achingly charming little bungalow took a while to find its footing (though accurate at the time, I wish I could have that review back). But in 2018, it’s consistently spitting fire. With the ease of a seaside beach house and the warmth of a neighborhood bar, Glai Baan is a time-slowing destination that combines a mellow room with explosive dishes. That doesn’t always mean chile heat (nor should it). Coconut-marinated pork skewers are tender and sweet; deep-fried son-in-law eggs are dressed with a tart, punchy sauce; and mackerel fried rice is a steamy, comforting affair with a distinctive fermented richness. But when the fire arrives, it’s on. Funky salted crab papaya salad is dense with bird chiles. Kapro gai kai dao perks up minced chicken and a lacy egg with basil and no shortage of chiles. And a complex panang curry has some heat, but not at the expense of layer after fragrant layer of fresh, intense flavor. We were long overdue for a place like this.\n\nDetails: 2333 E.

Right up until that part of me was stuffed in a sack and tossed in a river by the part of me that can’t recall having more juicy, succulent, perfectly grilled meats anywhere else in town. I surrender. Yes, Green Corner looks like an antiseptic neighborhood counter-service joint, but just try to keep me away from the kifta kabob, scented with sumac and cinnamon, tender and meaty and dripping with sizzling lamb fat. You’ve seen this menu a hundred times before, and standards like baba ghannoug, hummus and kibbeh are all solid, if less than stellar. But anything off the phalanx of rotisseries or the kitchen’s grill is something to target, whether it be charred shawarma, plump chicken thighs or lamb chops seared on the grill. The truth is, most of the Valley’s widely revered Middle Eastern restaurants don’t season and cook their meats nearly as well as Green Corner.\n\nDetails: 1038 W. Southern Ave., Mesa, 480-835-2313.

Here, you’ll find a mix of classic maki and nigiri built on a solid foundation of excellent seafood and rice alongside Hashimoto’s more brash, contemporary creations. Among them: the Hana Egg, a soft-boiled, tempura-fried egg paired with a zippy mentaiko sauce; and grilled lamb marinated with miso and pomegranate juice. This is a family that can bring the wow factor if you want it. But the unsung heroes of the menu are Hana’s classic Japanese comfort dishes, whose charms are rooted in culinary tradition. Chicken karaage is perfectly seasoned, crisp and juicy. Bento boxes feature popular items like teriyaki and tonkatsu, but they’re anchored with simple simmered vegetables. Chilled soba noodles come with ethereal tempura and an icy, crystal-clear tsuyu dip; and ramen is firm to the tooth and bathed in lush, flavorful broths. The gleaming raw fish and colorful oyster shooters may win Instagram, but while plenty of neighborhood sushi joints can feed your eyes, few can feed your soul like Hana.\n\nDetails: 5524 N.

The new, contemporary resort is less the swingin’ hot spot of its ‘60s heyday and more a luxe oasis that’s built as a picture frame for nearby Camelback Mountain. At Hearth ’61, chefs Charles Wylie, Richard Garcia and Alfred Muro walk the tightrope of producing inventive cuisine while adhering to the constraints of being the resort’s primary restaurant, and the restaurant is finding its stride. A swanky and lively room complete with a water feature is the proper home for a spicy, rough-hewn ahi tartare dressed with crisp, fresh vegetables or roasted prawns with andouille-flecked polenta. Soups like a squash puree or a lobster bisque have a silky feel and bold intensity; and a side of ancient grain risotto is a nutty delight. Hefty short rib agnolotti splashed with horseradish cream are like an Italian-Polish crossover dish; and simple roasted meats are beautifully prepared. But I’m still stuck on the swordfish steak, a juicy specimen set ablaze by an herbal, green harissa.\n\nDetails: Mountain Shadows Resort, 5445 E. Lincoln Drive, Paradise Valley.

The cure for this epidemic of meaty myopia rests in places like Hodori. An ancient stalwart of the Valley’s Korean restaurant scene, Hodori continues to stand tall as one of its best and most welcoming. Kimchi jun with a gentle sourness and prominent burn sizzles; and bosam — steamed pork with spicy fermented accompaniments and cabbage to wrap — is a decadent platter that could feed a few dozen. Soups and stews are the thing, whether they include delicate tofu swimming in a sea of soondubu fire or milky dogani tang, an ox knee and brisket elixir with a gentle, restorative countenance. And don’t worry. If you insist on meatifying, the kitchen does a very respectable job with standards like juicy chok kalbi and daeji bulgogi in a fire-laced marinade.\n\nDetails: 1116 S.

A Western-trained chef who spent a year working in Japan, Hebert has developed a very personal style of ramen that might get under the skin of the tonkotsu fanboys, but it’s hard to see that as a bad thing. It isn’t that he hasn’t done his homework. He’s a student of the cuisine who made his name blending French and Japanese flavors and techniques in upscale environs. But like so many shops in Japan that are playing with convention, Hebert’s humble ramen bar uses the framework as a means of self-expression. What he’s expressing is one of the best bowls of noodles in town. The goma is the signature item, a sesame-spiked pork broth with a nutty countenance. But the gently smoky shoyu and the chile-spiked seafood ramen are also personal favorites. Spiked with some unconventional ingredients and possessed of non-traditional tweaks, they’re solidly grounded in careful technique.\n\nDetails: 15689 N. Hayden Road, Scottsdale.

Some do it better than others and a few are quite good, but the rote collection of pho, bun and broken rice dishes has achieved the formulaic predictability of a fast-food chain. At Mekong Plaza, the sit-down restaurants in the front may be more popular, but the food court in the back is where you’ll find the action. Hue Gourmet features the flavors of central Vietnam, and if your experience with Vietnamese food is limited to your neighborhood pho joint, this will be a game-changer. Chewy, thick tapioca noodles and chunks of crab comprise the viscous, briny banh canh cua. Mi quang marries turmeric-spiced noodles with shrimp, pork, vegetables and crisp sesame crackers. Banh beo, glutinous rice coins, are dotted with dried shrimp and served with a lip-puckering sauce. The bun bo hue is the genuine article — a fiery, funky lemongrass soup thick with beef and pork, rather than the doctored pho you’ll find elsewhere in town. And speaking of pho, don’t bother: They don’t make it, and you won’t miss it.\n\nDetails: Mekong Plaza, 66 S. Dobson Road, Mesa.

Yeah, Chelsea’s Kitchen makes the Arcadia moms swoon; Buck & Rider’s parking lot is jam-packed at all hours with silver and black SUVs; and La Grande Orange has practically achieved historical landmark status at this point. But I love Ingo’s sun-dappled patio and circular dining bar. I love those tart, mustardy deviled eggs and shattered potato chips with yogurt and searing hot sauce. I love the crispy fried sandwiches, both chicken and fish. I love the barbecue and bacon-laden Paris Texas burger. I love the Farmer’s Daughter burger, with tart sauerkraut and funky fol epi. And I love that I can eat one of those burgers and not feel like I just consumed half a cow. The thing is, Lynn is a student of careful design and he runs a tight ship. When you’re talking about a neighborhood burger stand, that makes it just a little special.\n\nDetails: 4502 N. 40th St., Phoenix.

Though I’m a hopeless fanboy, by all public accounts, Jean-Georges Vongerichten has barely set foot in Arizona since J&G opened. But to overlook it on that basis would be a grand disservice to Jacques Qualin, who has taken the international super chef’s vision and made J&G Steakhouse his own. Yes, the steaks are excellent, and if you’re the saucy type, they’re accompanied by the best in town. But to my mind, that’s the least interesting part of the menu. I geek out on piping-hot Dungeness crab fritters with cool Asian pear and a sweet sauce laden with black pepper. I swoon over chilled crab and avocado with a smooth and creamy cocktail sauce tarted up with brandy. I marvel at ruby-red, sweet-and-sour beet risotto with a puckery lemon foam. I salivate over seared beef cheeks with a buttery habanero hot sauce. And I chill with baked Alaska, like a creamy bruleed hedgehog, cool pineapple sorbet waiting within. I have a Vongerichten trading card pinned up in my cubicle. But to me, this is Qualin’s restaurant.\n\nDetails: The Phoenician, 6000 E. Camelback Road, Phoenix.

That’s the kind of stridently unpretentious hole-in-the-wall barbecue dive that fulfills all our romantic storybook notions of what American smoked meat should be. James Lewis didn’t even have a restaurant to call home until 2017, before which he sold barbecue from a guerilla street operation parked under a bridge. But now with a south Phoenix storefront of his own, it’s far easier to sample his ruby ribs with tender chew, juicy and succulent smoked chicken and a barky, chaotic tangle of pulled pork that’s the best I’ve tried in the Valley. His understated, Zen-like sauce is a supplement, not a distraction, and a killer cup of peppery stewed greens headlines unusually good sides. The secret? The ebullient Lewis will insist it’s what the “JL” in JL Smokehouse stands for: “Just Love.”\n\nDetails: 1712 E. Broadway Road, Phoenix.

The atmosphere is essentially nonexistent and the line can be long and slow. But none of that matters when you’re presented with a smooth, elastic round of yam fufu, bathed in a spiced tomato soup brimming with goat meat. This is west African cuisine — hewing closest to Ghanaian — built on seasoned starches, meats and thick, sultry stews. The chicken stew is deep and ruddy with the rich sweetness of reduced tomatoes, while the bean stew is round and robust with beans that have perfect bite. Jollof rice arrives with tender chicken and slippery sweet plantains. Waakye — Ghana’s take on rice and beans — goes equally well with stewed goat or a mound of seasoned spinach. And the peanut soup defies the sweet conventions to which Americans are accustomed, striking a deliciously deep, earthy note.\n\nDetails: 325 W. Elliot Road, Tempe.

Under the direction of chef Ryan Swanson, Kai is as good as ever, and maybe better. From the room to the service to the plates, here’s a rare restaurant that exudes refinement at every turn, weaving a palette of indigenous ingredients into a striking collection of dishes. A soup of pureed squash takes on the sultry scent of mesquite-charred hahl with hits of sweet i’itoi onion and tart red berry dust. A mélange of pickled veggies join cactus shoots, planted in rye soil and bathed in saguaro mist, creating a wild to behold and wilder to eat vegetable forest. And meaty buffalo tenderloin joins asparagus-scented cholla buds and tepary beans, sweetened by saguaro syrup. Kai has one foot in the past, but it’s looking to the future. Here’s hoping fine dining of this caliber continues to have one.\n\nDetails: Sheraton Grand at Wild Horse Pass, 5594 W. Wild Horse Pass Blvd., Gila River Reservation.

Iridescent exterior paint job aside, Las 15 Salsas looks like any old neighborhood taco joint, conjuring visions of greasy gorditas and immolated carne asada. What it contains, however, is an explosive menu of regional Mexican specialties, from crisp, bean-smeared tlayudas to thick, steaming molotes. The heart and soul of the menu is an assortment of moles — all five of them. Hernandez serves the familiar rich and ruddy mole coloradito and the popular chocolate-spiked mole negro, bursting with the complexity of burned chiles. But she also slings a vibrant, herb-dense mole verde; a smooth and lightly sweet mole Amarillo; and the even harder to find mole estofado, which plays like a Mexican-Mediterranean mashup. Bring some friends and try them all. Object lessons don’t get much more delicious than this.\n\nDetails: 722 W. Hatcher Road, Phoenix.

Maybe we got a little carried away with the notion that our pizza needed a seal of approval from overseas. But it speaks to Justin Piazza’s care and attention to detail that his pizzerias are one of only two restaurant groups in the Valley to get the official benediction from Napoli. What Piazza prepares, both in his Glendale and downtown Phoenix locations, is a faithful rendition of the classic — flour, water, olive oil and salt crafted into a chewy, flavorful dough with a blistered cornicone and a paucity of quality toppings. None of which is to downplay the antipasti, paste and more heavily laden pizzas, but the menu’s raison d’être is anything with the initials “D.O.C.” at the end.\n\nDetails: 5803 W.

Our local fare is represented by a range of Mexican restaurants, some more closely resembling the traditional fare of northern Mexico and some — like La Piñata — more heavily influenced by American conventions. This joyously colorful retro AZ-Mex stalwart is where you go for ladlefuls of tingling chile sauce, gobs of sour cream and oodles of melty yellow cheese, a breed of naturally occurring fusion fare all its own. Cheese crisps are a model for the genre, but even more decadent is the Mary Lou — a stoner mashup of a dish that folds an entire cheese crisp around a core of molten red or green chile. Enchiladas are soft and tender, filled with flavorful meats and completely smothered in a ruddy, spicy bog of chile sauce. Crunchy tacos and flautas are piled with chopped tomato and icy crisp shredded lettuce. Even though I’m an unadorned chimichanga evangelist, here’s the place where letting them smother that crisp shell in a bucket of sauce feels like the only way to go.\n\nDetails: 5521 N.

MAP IT! 602-279-1763, lapinatarestaurantaz.com.\n\nLamp Wood Oven Pizzeria\n\nChris Bianco inspired a generation of Arizona pizza makers and, simply put, Matt Pilato is one of the best. In a town bursting at the seams with wood-fired pizza, Pilato has focused an obsessive attention to detail on local conventions to create a signature style that’s descended from Bianco, but entirely his own. Oft overlooked due to its distance from the city’s core, Lamp serves a pizza that’s modestly topped, roundly flavored and crisper than most. Pizza menus that stretch into double-digit offerings tend to get diluted, but every one of Pilato’s 28 creations is well-balanced and carefully thought-out. The Scientist offsets a plethora of salumi with dense, meaty Castelvetrano olives. The Gepetto takes a sweet and pungent route, pairing Pilato’s boozy house sausage with caramelized onions and blue cheese. And though it’s one of Phoenix’s prime specimens, the pizza isn’t even the best thing on the menu. That title belongs to the mignulata, a type of Sicilian bread that sports a tender, layered core stuffed with pungent onions, sausage and pecorino enveloped in a crackling crisp crust.\n\nDetails: 8900 E.

Jones had been around the block, cheffing his way through a series of Valley gigs before hitting his stride with a lunch-counter version of The Larder + The Delta. Now, finally with his own space and kitchen, he’s turning up the heat. His modern Southern fare with a little local flair and a dash of Chicago soul is electric, and now it’s unchained. The Low Country perlou has gotten a king-size upgrade, its Carolina Gold rice now piled with clams, mussels and colossal prawns. A Two Wash Ranch chicken strikes a pose, one talon in the air, resting on a panzanella built on cucumber, Arizona melon, cornbread and plenty of sweetened vinegar. But perhaps nothing exemplifies Jones’ work more than his hoppin’ John. Some call it sacrilege, but pulling out the pork to put the focus on the sizzling rice, red peas and herbs is like seeing the flavors through a microscope for the first time. The Larder + The Delta was already one of the Valley’s most exciting spots. Now we get to see what Jones can really do.\n\nDetails: Portland on The Park, 200 W. Portland St., Phoenix.

This is as informal as it gets. Grab a ticket, mark off a few selections, poke your head into the kitchen and try to flag down somebody to take your order. Wedge yourself into a tiny table, and in a matter of moments you’ll be feasting on pani puri, diminutive spheroid crisps ready to be stuffed with potato and chickpeas and a splash of tamarind chutney. Papri — small, thin wafers — are smothered with yogurt, a mix of fragrant chutneys and sev, a flurry of tiny, crisp noodles. The bada paav — a fried potato burger, for lack of a more elegant description — is hearty, playfully spiced and served up on a no-frills sesame burger bun. And a panoply of sultry curries and stewed vegetables stand at the ready for sipping and dipping. Plates are small and the prices are smaller, making it easy for those unfamiliar with chaat to dive in and explore.\n\nDetails: 1813 E. Baseline Road, Tempe.

Though the Valley was awash in barbecue joints before Scott Holmes hit the scene, a couple of exceptions aside, they ranged from serviceable to shameful. But even the standouts couldn’t touch the product Little Miss BBQ put out from day one: A trayful of succulent smoked meat that turns dedicated carnivores into blubbering fools willing to stand in line for hours in 115-degree heat. Holmes has achieved a quantum leap in Valley barbecue, and now, everybody else — some respectably so — is playing catch-up. It has become an arms race, folks, but Holmes still holds the ultimate doomsday device: A peppery smoked brisket that oozes fat with a gentle nudge, flakes into silky bliss on the roof of your mouth and packs a smoky wallop. Taking nothing away from Holmes’ ribs, house-made sausage and killer grits and beans, the fatty brisket is the dish that pushed Phoenix barbeque to the next level.\n\nDetails: 4301 E.

It’s easy to quip that Phoenix is still green, an immature city without a strong sense of history and time. Then you descend the narrow staircase for a special dinner in the timber-supported basement at The Hermosa Inn where Megargee (reputedly) sold bootleg hooch and hosted illicit gambling, and it’s a stark reminder that the history is here if you’re willing to look. Lon’s at The Hermosa is bursting with rustic charm, not to mention the beauty of one of the best dining terraces in town, and Jeremy Pacheco is so perfect for the place he came to work here twice — returning after a stint in Las Vegas because he couldn’t stay away. This is contemporary dining, but there’s a lingering hint of cowboy cuisine in Pacheco’s menu, from a smoky tortilla soup with pulled chicken to a confit duck crepe with spiced mole to gorgeous pecan-roasted lamb. If Mangalitsa is on the menu, don’t miss it. Pacheco knows his swine.\n\nDetails: Hermosa Inn, 5532 N. Palo Cristi Road, Paradise Valley.

Peruvian is such a fascinating cuisine, blending Spanish, Japanese, African, Italian, Chinese and indigenous influences into a complex jigsaw puzzle where you can still see the seams but the pieces fit perfectly. The Valley’s Peruvian restaurants all have their specialties, but I find myself returning to Los Andes for dishes like fiery ceviche plied with sweet potato and onions and spiked with pisco. Causa — cool mashed potatoes tarted up with lime and yellow chiles and layered with shrimp or chicken salad — has a light, fresh pop. And skewers of grilled beef heart bring the smoky, meaty spice. Lomo saltado, always a crowd-pleaser, is a hearty stir-fry of beef and potatoes. Graham makes my favorite aji de gallina in town — a bizarre and utterly comforting dish of chile-spiked stewed chicken in a creamy morass of potatoes, Parmesan and ground walnuts.\n\nDetails: 6025 N. 27th Ave., Phoenix.

Really, this is all I want in a Puerto Rican restaurant. Now with a little room to maneuver (their previous space could seat eight if everybody held their breath), it’s a little easier to bring a crowd and work your way through a list of Puerto Rican classics, still charmingly unpretentious, served in baskets and Styrofoam trays. Pasteles — pork-laced tamales steamed in banana leaves — have a smooth texture and herbal fragrance. For mains, starch lays down the baseline in the form of rice and pigeon peas or beans with squash; and they pair with luscious meats like roasted pork with a citrus marinade or gloriously tender baked chicken. Plantains are abundant: As crisp tostones, sweetly caramelized amarillos or substituting as bread for the jibarito, which is a steak sandwich laden with cheese, vegetables and garlicky mayo. And the Mofongo is outstanding, a mash of plantains, pork and enough garlic to make you think they buy it by the truckload.\n\nDetails: 1916 W. Baseline Road, Mesa. MAP IT! 480-223-8217, facebook.com/milliescafeaz.\n\nMora Italian\n\nMaybe the most wildly anticipated opening in recent memory, Mora Italian — predictably — has come to rest somewhere between the life-changing culinary experience Scott Conant’s fans were expecting and the overrated faceplant the celebrity schadenfreude crowd was hoping for. Which is to say, this is an exciting place that’s sometimes more solid than sensational, but it can hit some screaming highs when it’s firing on all cylinders. Mora is busy and loud and where you want to be when you want to be seen, managing to stand out even on a strip as brash and brazen as Seventh Street’s new restaurant row. Antipasti like a crisp fritto misto or creamy carbonara suppli hit the mark. But the polenta bosciaola — pairing rich polenta with an intense brew of seasonal mushrooms — is a flat-out stunner. Pastas like the black campanelle — a smart and spicy spin on clam pasta — and meltaway lobster gnudi are strong, and grilled meats and fish can hit similar highs. But the best dish on the menu may still be Conant’s signature pasta al pomodoro, as simple and perfect as they come.\n\nDetails: 5651 N. Seventh St., Phoenix. MAP IT! 602-795-9943, moraitalian.com.\n\nMowry & Cotton\n\nIt’s tough to stifle a chuckle when the “casual” restaurant at one of the swankiest resorts in town cites Arizona’s dusty, Wild West history as the inspiration for a spare-no-expense space that’s gorgeously appointed in crisp leather and smooth sanded wood. But while Tandy Peterson’s menu displays a sneaky level of refinement commensurate with The Phoenician’s usual luxury, it’s applied to dishes that evoke a kind of rustic sass. Mowry & Cotton’s stunning oven is a far cry from a campfire, but char and smoke permeate her creations. Robust, earthy flatbreads take atypical toppings like mushrooms with apricots and horseradish. Smoked yogurt and mustard greens dress barbecued beets; and crisp roasted potatoes are plied with fiery chorizo and hot sauce. A whole bass turned inside out and roasted to a juicy crisp makes for delectable do-it-yourself tacos. And grilled pheasant — deeply lacquered with an anchovy wash and buried beneath broccolini, almonds, citrus and cherries — is a remarkable dish.\n\nDetails: The Phoenician, 6000 E.

Hartman slings what might be the best brisket in town not made by a guy named Holmes. He does it with a Southern Pride smoker, which usually raises the floor and lowers the ceiling. I say “usually” because Hartman plays an instrument designed for volume like a virtuoso, coaxing a surprising level of subtlety out of meat that’s more gently seasoned than some of the widely popular styles — everyday rather than occasion barbecue, if you will. Of course, brisket isn’t the be-all and end-all. His ribs, pulled pork and hot links join some solid sides to make for one of the most consistently excellent barbecue options in town. Sauces are numerous and thoughtfully concocted, but they’re best used sparingly. The place is called “Naked” for a reason.\n\nDetails: 2340 W. Bell Road, Phoenix, 602-439-4227. MAP IT!

Among the best of the newcomers is Nishikawa Ramen, which recently opened a second Valley location. Nishikawa serves solid gyoza and surprisingly excellent takoyaki, crisp and creamy with a nice nugget of octopus in the center. But the ramen is the thing here, and pork broth is Nishikawa’s medium. It’s a creamy and rich tonkotsu with a luscious, clean scent, and it serves as the base for six bowls, all of which are quite good. The straight tonkotsu with skinny Hakata-style noodles is lush, with tender pork chashu and a bump of pungent fish powder. Nishikawa’s miso ramen substitutes a more substantial kinky noodle along with the requisite corn, while the curry ramen is a nice change of pace. The signature bowl, however, is Nishikawa’s best. Laced with black garlic oil and fried onion, the Nishikawa Black lends a nice allium pungency and sweetness to an already exquisite broth.\n\nDetails: 1901 E. Ray Road, Chandler.

In a rare victory for quality and care, Raducha is now rightly recognized as one of the Valley’s most important bread makers, and his “modern wood-fired deli,” Noble Eatery, carries that ethos through to the lunch counter. Tender ciabatta is stuffed with fresh mozzarella and slivered finocchiona. Robust toast is smeared with creamy ricotta and topped with roasted mushrooms. The wheaty crust of a diminutive pizza is topped with potatoes and a whiff of rosemary. The tuna salad, gently dressed with olive oil and premium vinegar, is still a showstopper. At a time when most “feel-good” eating is factory-farmed bird food, we need more of this breed of rugged culinary honesty.\n\nDetails: 4525 N. 24th St., Phoenix.

Nobuo Fukuda serves dazzling food that’s smart and precise. But the way he has so naturally married the techniques and ethos of his native Japan to the soul and flavors of Arizona is what makes his work unique. In a historic building subtly adorned with Japanese accents, his contemporary izakaya gracefully marries East and West, pairing tako with tomato and mozzarella, hamachi with grapefruit and avocado, tuna with roasted beets, and saikyo miso with foie gras. Moreover, Fukuda goes as humble as crisp tonkatsu sandwiched between slices of shokupan at lunch, and as refined as a delicate chawanmushi duo — cold and hot — served by appointment at the four-seat counter as part of his omakase. If you glimpse beneath the surface, Nobuo at Teeter House is as much about Arizona as it is about Japan. Seeing desert flavors and products focused through a Japanese lens is nothing short of revelatory.\n\nDetails: Heritage Square, 622 E. Adams St., Phoenix.

Noca was defined by Wexler’s obsessive food-geek palate. Nocawich is no different, slinging a short list of sandwiches and salads composed from stellar ingredients like Biellese salumi, Snake River Farms beef, Russ & Daughters lox and H&H bagels. The Italian Stallion layers killer giardiniera with slivers of fine salumi; and the Clubber Lang, with house roast beef and spicy provolone, conveys all the punch of its namesake. Wexler’s patty melt is a refined take on the genre made with Gruyere and a slick bordelaise; and his “What the cluck?” is probably the best fried chicken sandwich in town, with seasoned fries carefully engineered to a precise crunch. A breakfast burrito spiked with chimichurri crema and crispy potatoes is a game changer. Deep in Arizona State University territory with a menu almost entirely priced in the $8 to $12 range, it’s priced for a student’s budget. Let’s hope they appreciate what a gem they have there.\n\nDetails: 777 S. College Ave., Tempe. MAP IT! 480-758-5322, nocawich.com.\n\nOcotillo\n\nThis place fascinates on a number of levels. Approaching Ocotillo is like entering the quad of a culinary campus — a smartly designed compound that combines restaurant, event space, coffee shop, public park and biergarten all into one. It’s a study in urban oasis, connecting space, food and community. But from a culinary standpoint, Ocotillo is remarkable in the way it takes the spirit of the tiny restaurants that have shaped contemporary Arizona cuisine and finds a way to deliver that upstart ethos on a large scale. Snappy vegetable dishes like smoked beets with ricotta and pistachios or a whole head of cauliflower roasted to a deep, nutty brown with an aleppo vinaigrette and fresh herbs showcase fine produce. Robust pasta dishes like pappardelle in a rich ragu join meaty mains like mesquite grilled chicken, loaded with local honey, dates, citrus and chiles. This is the desert expressed on a plate in a restaurant that isn’t a sneaky, in-the-know hot spot. Put another way, Ocotillo is proof of concept that this new wave of Arizona cuisine needn’t be reserved for the fooderati.\n\nDetails: 3243 N. Third St., Phoenix.

Of course, communities need community gathering spots, and Old Town Sarajevo is one of Phoenix’s most prominent, serving Bosnian cuisine since 2001. A casual café gives way to a country village-themed dining room with a short list of hearty fare. Meaty cabbage rolls are splashed with a tomato-laced broth; bean soup is thick and earthy; and pastries stuffed with meat, spinach or cheese are tender and comforting. The pljeskavica, a monstrous spiced meat patty, is mighty fine. But the stars are the cevapi, juicy little veal sausages stuffed into a steaming bread called lepinja with a cloudlike crumb and a crisp, oily crust. The cevapi are as comforting as they are succulent — served with chopped raw onion, kajmak (a close cousin of sour cream called) and ajvar, a sweet and slightly pungent spread made with roasted eggplant and red peppers. The best way to end the meal? Turkish coffee and good conversation.\n\nDetails: 3411 W. Northern Ave., Phoenix.

Ho hum, another little hipster coffee shop with nice-looking pastries and a smattering of breakfast and lunch dishes. But a few bites deep, Ollie Vaughn’s starts to separate itself from the pack. Flaky, buttery almond croissants, lemon poppy-seed cake with a sharply sour glaze and a light, creamy tomato quiche emerge from the pastry case. Ricotta pancakes are gorgeous, light and tender, with fresh fruit compote and real maple syrup. Stellar biscuits can be smothered with sausage gravy or stuffed with eggs, meat and cheese for a build-your-own breakfast sandwich. Green chile pork, in stripped-down fashion, eschews the soupy standard and shoots instead for an understated burn. Hash browns that have a smooth, creamy core with a shattering, golden crisp — above and beneath — are the Olympian ideal of the form. Lunch excels as well, with a “Cuban” sandwich that features the green chile pork and an almost pungent tuna salad with the sweet-spicy punch of jalapeño marmalade. And to nobody’s surprise, Ollie’s coffee game is strong.\n\nDetails: 1526 E. McDowell Road, Phoenix.

But the true depth and breadth of this pillar of the Chinese culinary pantheon is poorly understood in the West, and better revealed at Original Cuisine than anywhere else in the Valley. A new wave of contemporary Sichuan cuisine — rooted in tradition but pushing creative boundaries — has washed over California and finally reached Arizona, where it rests in a well-tended whitewashed box of a restaurant in Mesa’s Asian market district. You can get the saline sting of fuqi feipian; the chile-laced tingle of Chongqing chicken; and a ginger- and garlic-packed mapo dofu, to be sure. But you can also get tender meatballs and slivers of winter melon in a simple, silky broth; moan-inducing slices of slippery pork belly dipped in a pungent sauce; and pickled Sichuan “kimchi” that’s gently tart and almost effervescent. The menu isn’t quite the murderer’s row that it was when the restaurant first launched, but this is still next-level Sichuan fare in a town that desperately needed it.\n\nDetails: 1853 W. Broadway Road, Mesa.

Now, with the new Gallo Blanco’s simplified menu, Otro stands in starker contrast. They’re both rooted in the same earth, but like the difference between Gallo’s corn tortillas and Otro’s flour tortillas, they explore some of the same themes in different ways. Both have killer breakfasts and sharp salads in common, but Otro maintains the more contemporary taco style, plying succulent pork belly with a sweet glaze and tomatillo relish; or chicken with mushrooms, poblanos and aji amarillo. Mains cast a wider net, letting Robson explore his Vietnamese heritage a bit with fresh spring rolls or caldo de pollo — chicken pho in disguise on a Mexican menu. Spanish and New Mexican influences play stronger as well. And if you’ve been skipping the burgers because who gets burgers at a Mexican restaurant, you’ve been making a huge mistake. They’re some of the best in town.\n\nDetails: 6035 N. Seventh St., Phoenix.

It would be easy to say a chef like Urciuoli belongs in the kitchen of a fine-dining restaurant, but he’s after something bigger. Pa’La is culinary populism at work, a declaration of war on the notion that premium ingredients and refined presentations should be reserved for the well-heeled. At Pa’La, a spartan counter-service joint in a blue-collar neighborhood, Urciuoli serves simple tapas composed of perfect ingredients. The Italian native pairs imported mozzarella and burrata with roasted vegetables. He bakes bread to order and fills it with roasted wood-grilled skate wing and sizzled Spanish sausage. And he tops his Ramon Navarro bowl — a blend of ancient grains, beans, nuts and seeds dressed with premium oils and vinegars — with whatever smoky, charred seafood strikes his fancy that day. Put these dishes on fine china instead of paper plates, add a ritzy room and service staff, and he could charge quadruple the price. But that would be missing the point, wouldn’t it?\n\nDetails: 2107 N. 24th St., Phoenix.

Restaurateur Aric Mei — also involved in the forthcoming Los Olivos Farm project — has become something of an urban farming evangelist. So nearly a decade into its run, The Parlor has gone from neighborhood Italian restaurant to a working lab where Mei tries to practice what he preaches. On the surface, this is any old casual, contemporary Italian joint, slinging pizza, pasta and salads. But something as simple as lightly sweet caponata bruschetta sings, supported by excellent produce and careful balance. Salads based on mixed greens, usually a throwaway, are atypically bright and crisp. Pastas with substantial bite are generously dressed with rich ragus. And the pizzas, a light and chewy variety, are smartly dressed. Sausage is fine, but sausage with grilled radicchio and sage is compelling. A pizza puttanesca laden with tender, spicy seafood is a delight. And when summer rolls around, the sweet pop of roasted corn and chiles with a touch of spicy crema is impossible to resist.\n\nDetails: 1916 E. Camelback Road, Phoenix.

Husband-and-wife team Walleye Lai and Tina Truong started by selling exotic fruit from the back of a van before moving the operation to Winglee Market, a partnership with a California poultry farm that specializes in breeds of chickens popular with Asian chefs. These stellar birds make the Truongs’ lightly seasoned chicken pho some of the best in town. But there’s a lot more to Pho Winglee, the market’s next-door companion restaurant. Fried chicken wings are piping hot, paper-crisp and encased in a salty-sweet fish sauce lacquer. Grilled meats served with broken rice are tender and juicy. Rice vermicelli is topped with perfect spring rolls; shrimp paste wrapped in lacy crisp tofu skin and sweet, smoky slivers of pork. Pho Winglee isn’t substantially different from other Vietnamese spots that dot the landscape. But it’s fresher, crisper and more flavorful than the rest.\n\nDetails: 111 S. Dobson Road, Mesa.

It’s tempting to tell the whippersnappers to remember their history. Sure, it’s everywhere now, but this kind of pizza didn’t exist in this town before Bianco. I want to respect differences of opinion, while digging into one of Bianco’s pies, but I find it hard to accept that the anti-hype is anything but pure contrarianism. This is outstanding pizza with a depth of flavor built on heritage grains and a crisp and craggy character forged in the wood oven, simply topped with vibrant ingredients expressed at their peak. What’s more, at the Town & Country location, the pasta may be even better. Bianco is as much an ethos as a name, one that reveres local agriculture, seeks to extract the most from every ingredient and is constantly seeking honesty, both from the dishes themselves and the people who make them. It’s all right there on the plate.\n\nDetails: Heritage Square, 623 E. Adams St., Phoenix, 602-258-8300. MAP IT!

But it has evolved into something more — a local restaurant group that has harnessed popular Italian fare and elevated its integrity without sacrificing its broad appeal. Restaurateur Stefano Fabbri runs a boisterous, contemporary establishment. His collection of wood-fired pizzas and fresh pastas is a delectable, never-ending work in progress that pushes diners just a little bit further with each successive year. VPN-certified (that’s food geek speak for “hardcore traditional”) Neapolitan pizzas, such as the margherita and bufala verace, do a fine job of conveying the style’s chewy countenance, bubbling cornicone and straightforward adornment. But less conventional items like the charred, paper-thin, Rimini-style pizzas and the cheese-stuffed focaccia di Recco can steal the show from the main event, and Pomo slings a mean lasagna to boot.\n\nDetails: 8977 N.

More to the point, Dustin Christofolo is helping purge the antiquated notions of desert cuisine from our systems, replacing them with something gorgeously delicate and refined, and grown — to a large extent — right on the property’s farm. The charming farmhouse and some of the most serene, romantic outdoor dining around would make this a popular destination even if the kitchen were in shambles. Thankfully, it’s quite the opposite. Christofolo shares creations that border on ethereal, such as uni removed from its usual umami bomb context and offset instead by light, pickled kohlrabi, grapefruit and meringue. His beef carpaccio, on crisp bread spoons with tempura-fried herbs and a light blue cheese aioli, borders on precious. Even a tangle of sausage-studded cappellacci is lightened with cauliflower, spigarello and a whiff of tarragon. The rest of the world may see the surrounding country as a harsh, if beautiful, wasteland. But here is food that gives a stage to the fruits of the desert more rarely seen and appreciated.\n\nDetails: The Farm at South Mountain, 6106 S. 32nd St., Phoenix.

She opened this Scottsdale institution nearly 25 years ago, but unlike so many moldering relics of the era that now feel clumsy and dated, Rancho Pinot is as fresh and relevant as any newcomer to the scene. Filled with California- and Italian-influenced classics you can ease into like a worn leather chair, the menu’s focus on pure flavor, unfussy presentations and classic comforts is at once timeless and squarely on trend. A round of house-pulled burrata is a rich and creamy morsel, whether paired with a stone fruit relish or swimming in a roasted tomato broth. Grilled quail are succulent and sweet; and delicate gnocchi are nestled into a rich lamb ragu. But Nonni’s Sunday chicken, simply braised with mushrooms and white wine and paired with crisp polenta, exemplifies Rancho Pinot’s appeal. Restaurants new and old struggle to show this kind of grace and maturity in their food, but Robertson, as always, makes it look easy.\n\nDetails: 6208 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

Fortunately, it’s an enviable one. Reathrey Sekong is the kind of charming and tasty spot that food geeks dream of opening. Mother-and-son team Lakhana and Yuth In serve a list of Khmer specialties even more colorful and vibrant than the surroundings, which is saying something given the room’s neon paint job. Pleah, a Cambodian salad made here with marinated raw beef, is a light and pungent affair, cool and plied with fresh herbs. Soups are superb, in particular a lemongrass-scented number with coconut and a touch of tangy tamarind to lend a bracing sourness. The Phnom Penh noodle soup, fortified with pork liver and intestines, is offally good (sorry). For those less inclined toward organ eatery, the lok lak beef is tender stir-fried beef in a French-influenced sauce. But my favorite might be the humble cha kreung, simple chicken stir-fried with a seasoning paste pounded so fresh you can pick out the individual flavors of lemongrass, ginger, galangal, lime leaf, turmeric, shallot, garlic, chiles... every single component.\n\nDetails: 1312 E.

Alejandro Bonilla’s family is indigenous to the region, and he shares them from a modest, cozy storefront joint in west Mesa. Restaurant Huauchinangos slings some of the usual fare you’ll find at any local Mexican restaurant, but what makes Huauchinangos distinctive is dishes like the molotes, 3-inch masa torpedoes stuffed with potato and chorizo, fried to a golden crisp and drenched with tomatillo salsa. The quesadillas are folded over fillings like chicken tinga or mushrooms and cheese, then fried to a delicate crisp, tender to the touch and molten at their core. Bonilla’s “huauchitlacoyos” — a portmanteau of Huauchinango and tlacoyos — are piled with cactus and smoky salsa mora and excellent paired with salty, seared cesina. And chicken is usually a winner, whether it’s Bonilla’s family recipe for mole, a swirling mix of spices, chiles and nuts; or served con cacahuate — smothered with a sauce made of crispy chopped peanuts with the intense, fruity sting of dried chiltepin chiles.\n\nDetails: 1620 E.

Thankfully, at Roka Akor, that’s not a bad thing. This swanky joint with a Scottsdale nightlife vibe is in a part of town where it could have easily coasted on image alone. But there is compelling work being done here with ultra-superior ingredients, including some of the city’s best nigiri sushi, a compact list made with slabs of premium fish, delicate rice and real wasabi. Creative sashimi are also strong, like butterfish tataki wrapped around crisp white asparagus with a touch of herb and yuzu. The miso-marinated black cod is a refined take on the izakaya staple. And I’m more than a little enamored of their slabs of tender sweet potato with a hefty dose of binchotan-induced char and a ginger-laced glaze. But you most likely came for the steaks, and they’re excellent, whether a charred rib eye with a soy vinaigrette, juicy skirt steaks with an herbal shiso chimichurri or imported Japanese beef that inhabits “if you have to ask” territory. Heck, even the beef and kimchi gyoza are sharp, a compelling take on a dish that’s usually a throwaway, even when it isn’t frozen.\n\nDetails: 7299 N. Scottsdale Road, Scottsdale.

In a charming, refurbished space built from the bones of a historic Chinese market, Bianco has teamed with Nadia Holguin and Armando Hernandez of Tacos Chiwas to open what could be best described as an Italian-influenced Chihuahuan diner. In practice, that means flaky cabeza empanadas with an earthy garbanzo bean dip; cheesy entomatadas bathed in the essence of summer tomatoes; chile colorado with the desert’s smoky, fiery sting; and “quesadillas” that look like pizzas, taste like Mexico and resemble precisely no other quesadilla you’ve ever tasted. Best part? Killer ingredients at Denny’s prices. Holguin is the backbone here, and with the sourcing and support provided by Bianco and Hernandez, this is the kind of simple, bold new Arizona cuisine that’s getting Mexican chefs out of the depths of the kitchen and into the spotlight, where they belong.\n\nDetails: 1505 E.

A bit of American brashness meets European sensibilities while drawing in flavors from around the world. Scallop ceviche enriched with uni panna cotta bathes in a smoky, dashi rich broth. A gorgeous grilled langoustine tops Thai-inspired sausage with the gentle sourness of fermented rice. Risotto prepared with phytoplankton is a deep-green chlorophyll bomb.

Then it exploded | CNN ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nThe latest Powerball lottery jackpot topped $2 billion, making it the largest lotto prize ever.\n\nBut in 1987 when Lotto America, the precursor to Powerball, was introduced, organizers prohibited jackpots of more than $80 million.\n\n“There were concerns about what you could do with that money — like buy a small country or something,” Ed Stanek, director of Lotto America, said at the time.\n\nLottery frenzy had taken hold in the 1980s as more states introduced lotteries to collect revenue for education and social programs, but some smaller states’ jackpots couldn’t keep up with more populated states.\n\nOregon, for example, was losing players to Washington and California, which offered jackpots of up to $20 million.\n\nSo officials in Rhode Island, Oregon, Missouri, Iowa, Kansas, West Virginia and Washington, D.C. joined together to create Lotto America as a way to pool money and offer larger prizes. They also hoped the bigger pots would entice first-time players.\n\n”Our motivation is to offer Oregonians a chance to play in games they could play in one of the big states,” then-Oregon Lottery director James Davey said.\n\nThe interstate lottery was modeled after those in Canada and the US Virgin Islands.\n\nOfficials hoped Lotto America would offer average weekly jackpots of $3 million to $5 million, with the possibility of higher prizes after a year or two. Expenses for running the drawings and profits from ticket sales were split among the jurisdictions in proportion to each state or district’s ticket sales.\n\n”This is a whole new ballgame” Lotto America spokesman Jack Ratigan said at the time.\n\nBecoming Powerball\n\nLotto America initially offered players a chance to choose seven numbers from a field of 40 for a minimum bet of $1.\n\nPlayers whose numbers matched those selected in a weekly drawing would win a jackpot determined by the total number of tickets sold.\n\nThe odds of winning the top prize were about 1 in 19 million, compared with odds of about 1 in 8 million in most state lottery games, officials said.\n\nAn Iowa farmer who had gone bankrupt was the first Lotto America winner in 1988. He said he would use the $3 million prize to save his family’s farm.\n\nA year later, Lotto America changed to selecting six numbers from a field of 54. That year, it offered a $20 million jackpot and in 1991, the pot hit $50 million.\n\nBy 1992, Lotto America had grown to include fifteen states.\n\nThe game was re-branded as Powerball in an effort to give players a better chance to win smaller prizes.\n\n“What we are hearing is that people like the big prize but they want a better chance of winning smaller prizes,” said Oregon Lottery director James Davey.\n\nPowerball soon offered a $100 million jackpot.\n\nDuring the 1990s, however, players started to get “jackpot fatigue” and Powerball required larger and larger prizes to sustain interest, said Jonathan D. Cohen, author of “For a Dollar and a Dream: State Lotteries in Modern America.” Meanwhile, instant scratch-off games grew in popularity and became the primary form of lottery play.\n\nIn 2010, in an effort to gain more players and increase the size of the jackpots, Powerball and Mega Millions, the two largest multi-state lotteries, agreed to allow retailers to cross-sell both games for the first time.\n\nA year later, the price of a Powerball ticket increased from $1 to $2 and initial jackpots doubled. The game is now available in 45 states, Washington D.C., Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands.\n\nThese changes have pushed Powerball jackpots way up. The five largest Powerball pots have all come in the last six years. The odds of winning the top prize now stand at 1 in 292 million.\n\nLotteries are regressive, meaning lower-income groups spend more of their budgets on lottery games than higher-income groups.\n\nPowerball tends to be the least regressive lottery game, Cohen said, because wealthier people tend to buy tickets when jackpots soar.\n\nBut for most of the year, “there’s a slow burn of disproportionately poorer people putting money into smaller prizes.”", "authors": ["Nathaniel Meyersohn"], "publish_date": "2022/11/07"}]}

The teen ingested the caffeine from a large Diet Mountain Dew, a cafe latte from McDonald’s and an energy drink over the course of about two hours, Watts said.\n\nWhile many may worry their caffeine consumption could put them at risk, the average person who drinks a cup or two of coffee has nothing to worry about.\n\nRead: Too much caffeine caused S.C. teen's death\n\nHere’s a look at what can happen if you drink too much coffee:\n\nHow much caffeine can I drink a day?\n\n\"Most people can safely take in about 400 milligrams of caffeine daily or about 4 cups of coffee,\" according to Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nBut the limit varies from person to person, Maggie Sweeney, a postdoctoral research fellow at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine's department of psychiatry.\n\n\"For adults it would be uncommon to experience effects of caffeine intoxication at less than 250 milligrams of caffeine (or 2.5 cups of coffee),\" she said. \"...It would typically be more than 12 ounces, but much more common to have the negative effects with greater than 500 milligrams of caffeine.\"\n\nGlatter notes that children should limit caffeine consumption, and caffeine and alcohol should not be mixed.\n\n\"Mixing caffeine with alcohol is a dangerous practice because it may lead to higher levels of alcohol consumption as the person often believes and feels they are more alert,\" he said. \"The risk of alcohol poisoning increases as people consume more alcohol because they feel the caffeine will keep them awake and alert.\"\n\nMore coverage:\n\nWhat would happen if you didn’t brush your teeth for a year?\n\nWhat happens if you don't sleep for 24 hours? You're basically drunk\n\nWhat would happen if you were hit by a penny falling from a skyscraper?\n\nWhat side-effects come from drinking too much caffeine?\n\nGlatter said the most common symptoms of excessive caffeine intake are palpitations, dizziness, elevated blood pressure, nervousness and anxiety.\n\n\"Some people also may develop diarrhea and feel like their stomach is upset as their caffeine intake increases,\" he said. \"Not being able to sleep is another obvious symptom of consuming excess caffeine.\"\n\nEveryone is different, and some may experience side effects after a cup of coffee, while others may be able to drink five cups with no issue, according to Sweeney.\n\n\"It highly varies from person to person as to how much caffeine will affect them,\" Sweeney said. \"It can be due to speed in which our bodies process caffeine or how caffeine leaves the body – a metabolic difference.\"\n\nIf you are susceptible to caffeine, even a cup may cause some jitters or symptoms like nervousness or trouble sleeping, according to Sweeney. Likewise, those who increase the amount of caffeine they normally consume may also be more sensitive to coffee's negative side effects.\n\nSweeney notes that people might also have rambling thoughts or speech if they have consumed too much coffee.\n\nHow much coffee would it take to kill someone?\n\nIt would take a lot of K-cups, but it also varies depending on your weight.\n\n\"It would likely take anywhere from 50-100 cups of coffee to result in a lethal dose of caffeine,\" Glatter said. \"That said, pure powdered caffeine can be lethal if a teaspoon of it is consumed at once.

Here's how much you should drink — and ...", "text": "Whether it's an iced coffee on a summer morning, a hot cup before work or a warm latte on a snowy day, there is no doubt that Americans love coffee – or at least its caffeine.\n\nWe use it to wake up, stay focused and get work done.\n\nBut two age-old questions about the world's most widely used psychoactive substance linger: How much coffee is too much? And is it actually good for your health?\n\nStudies around the world have attempted to address coffee's health effects to varying results. One study will say coffee is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, while a health professional will say it can lead to higher risk of the condition.\n\nWhen it comes to a drink downed by roughly two-thirds of American adults each day, answers to such simple questions are surprisingly elusive.\n\nFirst, go easy on cream and sugar\n\nAs long as you limit cream and sugar, coffee isn't fattening like other caffeine-based substances such as energy drinks and soda. The calorie content in a plain cup of brewed coffee is next to nothing, and there's no fat either.\n\nBut not everyone drinks their coffee black, as any Starbucks menu suggests.\n\nLoading up a coffee with too much cream or sugar can drown out some of the positive health associations it provides.\n\n“We know that sugar has adverse effects,” Penny Kris-Etherton, a nutrition professor at Penn State University, told the American Heart Association.\n\n“Even if you add sugar and don’t exceed your calorie needs, you’re still negating some of the benefits because sugar is a negative food ingredient.”\n\nDoes coffee cause cancer?:California says those ominous warning signs about coffee being linked to cancer can be taken down\n\nHow much coffee is too much?\n\nThere's ongoing dissent in the health community about how much coffee one should drink.\n\nAmong recent studies, The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition concluded in March that six eight-ounce cups or more per day can increase risk of cardiovascular disease by 22%. The study examined nearly 350,000 individuals.\n\nSimilarly, a 2013 study by University of South Carolina researchers found men and women under the age of 55 who consume an average of more than 28 cups per week (four per day) were more closely associated with death over the course of the 32-year-long study.\n\nWhat a typical home costs in your state:Can you guess which is the most expensive?\n\nBut other research has found that even extremely high coffee intake may be safe. One study partially funded by the British Heart Foundation said you can safely drink 25 cups of coffee per day. It should be noted, however, that the study examined only about 8,000 people around the United Kingdom.\n\nMultiple studies have found that a daily coffee intake of four cups is a safe amount. Even federal dietary guidelines suggest three to five eight-ounce cups of coffee per day (providing up to 400 milligrams of caffeine) can be a part of a healthy diet.\n\nDr. Steven Nissen, Chief Academic Officer of the Heart and Vascular Institute at the Cleveland Clinic, told USA TODAY there isn't a specific daily limit that would apply to everyone, but drinking more than four to five cups provides for more caffeine than he would recommend.\n\n\"Keep in mind that the biological half-life of caffeine is seven to nine hours. So, if you have a bunch of coffee in the morning, it'll be gone by bedtime. But, if you drink it all day long and you really load up, you may have insomnia, which really is an issue,\" said Nissen.\n\nNot all people react to caffeine in the same way, so if you are feeling some of the negative symptoms of the substance, like insomnia or anxiety, don't be afraid to scale back or cut off your coffee intake.\n\nBut is coffee good for you?\n\nMany studies, like the ones cited above, suggest that up to four cups of coffee is a safe amount, but is it actually beneficial for you?\n\nSeveral studies associate normal coffee consumption with health benefits, but they don't prove causation.\n\nAccording to the previously mentioned AJCN study, people who don't drink coffee have a 11% higher chance of cardiovascular disease than those who consume one to two cups per day. The study found decaf drinkers had a 7% higher chance of developing cardiovascular disease as well.\n\nA study from the National Institutes of Health published similar findings: those who drank at least three cups of coffee daily had a 10 percent lower risk of death. The review examined over 400,000 men and women ages 50 to 71.\n\nAdditionally, two studies in the Annals of Internal Medicine supported the idea that a few cups of coffee is linked to a longer life.\n\nOne study examining over 185,000 Americans reported an 18% decreased chance of death compared to non-drinkers. The other study, comprised of more than 520,000 people across Europe, also found that people who drink several cups per day had a lower risk of death than non-drinkers.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that these studies are simply observing trends between coffee consumption and health; they don't determine if coffee actually leads to health benefits.\n\nAlong those lines, Nissen staunchly opposed the notion that coffee actively decreases risk for cardiovascular disease.\n\n\"I don't buy it for a moment,\" he said. \"These are what are called observational studies, they're not optimized control trials. They're poor in quality. They're not reliable. I would not drink caffeine to lower your risk of heart disease.\"\n\nNissen views coffee as somewhat of a neutral substance – it won't actively benefit your health, but a safe amount of it is not necessarily bad for you either.\n\n\"My advice to patients is if you like coffee and you want to drink it, it's probably safe. Unless, of course, you have heart rhythm problems, where you can see some increased risk of palpitations,\" Nissen said.\n\n\"With that exception, I don't think there's any evidence for harm, but I don't think there's any evidence for benefit.\"\n\nSpecialty types of coffee, however, like French press coffee, boiled Scandinavian brew and espresso, possess a powerful cholesterol-booster and can raise cholesterol levels by 6 to 8 percent.\n\nWhat about for children and teens?\n\nOf course, caffeine is not limited to adults, and caffeine intake for those 18 and under should be more closely monitored, as you might expect.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics suggests kids aged 12 to 18 limit caffeine use to 100 milligrams per day — about one cup of coffee, one to two cups of tea or two to three sodas.\n\nAre you guilty of these? 3 spending habits that are ruining your chances at retirement\n\nThough few and far between, there are nightmare stories involving teens and caffeine.\n\nDavis Allen Cripe, a 16-year-old high schooler from South Carolina, died in 2017 from a caffeine overdose when he drank a large Diet Mountain Dew, a cafe latte from McDonald’s and an energy drink all within about two hours.\n\nAs for those 12 and under, there is no definitive amount that can be considered safe for all ages.\n\nKeeping a close eye on the caffeine intake of younger ones can help prevent some of the negative side-effects, like anxiety, diarrhea and dehydration.\n\nFollow Jay Cannon on Twitter: @JayTCannon", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/13/health/coffee-children-wellness/index.html", "title": "It's not OK to let kids drink coffee — so why do we do it? | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nWe have become a coffee-crazed culture. Yet with all the studies coming out on how a cup of joe can reduce the risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke, dementia and some cancers, what’s the harm?\n\nIt’s even trickled down to children.\n\nDespite years of warnings from pediatricians and other health professionals that coffee and other caffeinated beverages such as sodas and sports drinks can be harmful to youth, parents are allowing their little ones — even toddlers — to drink those beverages.\n\nA 2015 study of Boston moms found that 14% of those surveyed allowed their 2-year-olds to drink between 1 and 4 ounces of coffee a day (a half a cup of coffee is 4 ounces). The study also found that 2.5% of moms gave coffee to their 1-year-olds.\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no caffeinated coffee, tea, soda, sports drinks or other products for children under 12, while adolescents between 12 and 18 should limit their intake to less than 100 milligrams per day — about the size of an old-fashioned cup of coffee. A 16-ounce “grande” of Starbucks popular Blonde Roast coffee contains 360 milligrams, while the same size of its Pike Place Roast is 310 milligrams.\n\nCoffee comes in all sorts of sizes, flavors and levels of caffeine. Adobe Stock\n\nIt’s not just coffee. A bottle of sports drink can contain nearly 250 milligrams of caffeine depending on the brand, according to a Consumer Reports investigation. A cup of tea can have up to 47 milligrams, while a diet soda can have 46.\n\nChocolate has some caffeine, too, with the amount rising as the chocolate darkens in color. A handful of chocolate-covered coffee beans can have 336 milligrams of caffeine, according to the US Department of Agriculture.\n\nYou can even buy caffeine chewing gum, mints, gummy bears and energy bars — and let’s not forget coffee ice cream.\n\nWhat age can you drink coffee?\n\nBecause children are usually smaller in body size, it takes less caffeine to impair their functioning. An insignificant amount for an adult could be overwhelming for a small child. Too much caffeine can raise heart rates and blood pressure, contribute to acid reflux, and cause anxiety and sleep disturbances in children. In high doses, caffeine can be dangerous.\n\n“Kids show up in the emergency room with irregular heartbeat or what we call tachycardia or rapid heartbeat,” said pediatrician Dr. Mark Corkins. “Some people think it’s cool to give toddlers a soda pop.”\n\nThe limits are based mostly based on body size, and those limits increase when a child has grown large enough to metabolize caffeine more readily. However, if children are small for their age, or have migraines, heart problems or seizures, they may be even more sensitive, according to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.\n\nWith all this bad news, why are parents letting kids drink coffee?\n\nIt starts when small children begin to ask for caffeinated drinks such as coffee “because they see the parents and older siblings drinking it — it’s a ‘grown-up’ thing to drink,” said Corkins, division chief of pediatric gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center in Memphis, via email.\n\nAnd because parents perceive it as harmless — and it likely is in tiny amounts — they will let their children take a sip or two, Corkins said. “However, once the parents start, it becomes a slippery slope and easier to let the kids drink what they want than fight with them.”\n\nCoffee toppings and add-ons can affect nutrition\n\nThere’s another issue: the impact of coffee, tea, soda and sports drinks on a balanced diet.\n\n“My other problem with kids drinking coffee is that it’s of little nutritional value, and it’s replacing something that should be nutritionally complete, such as milk and water,” Corkins said. “Milk is packed with calcium and vitamin D, and water is a nutrient. We’re like 60% water, basically an ocean.”\n\nThen there are the add-ons. Gone are the days when coffee simply came with a lump of sugar and cream. Coffee shops on nearly every corner now offer dozens of ways to spice and fatten up your drink of choice.\n\n“These drinks are basically a dessert,” Corkins said. “They have the foam and the shots of flavored syrups, with whipped topping and then the sprinkles on top. Presentation is better than some of the desserts I’ve seen.”\n\nExtra sugars and heavy creams add fat and calories, while sugar-free versions can expose a children to artificial sweeteners.\n\nWhat’s the bottom line? “Avoid caffeine! Why do your kids need it?” Corkins said.\n\n“Caffeine is a stimulant that increases alertness. If your child feels like he or she needs caffeine to get through the day, it would be better to work with a pediatrician to identify the root cause of what is creating the fatigue in the first place.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/04/09/coffee-mania/2069335/", "title": "Coffee grinds fuel for the nation", "text": "By Karen Fernau, The Arizona Republic\n\nAbout 83 percent of adults drink coffee\n\nCoffee shops about community as well as drink\n\nSingle-serve coffee makers more popular\n\nPHOENIX -- Event planner Gabriel Zahoney begins his work day with 20 ounces of a dark roasted brew at a downtown Phoenix coffee shop.\n\nThe 38-year-old, who in less than a decade graduated from instant to full-bodied European coffee, never deviates. \"I start every day with a cup,\" Zahoney said.\n\nSo do an increasing number of Americans. About 83 percent of adults drink coffee in the U.S., the world's biggest consumer of the beverage, up from 78 percent a year earlier, according to the National Coffee Association's 2013 online survey. That's an average of three cups a day per person, or 587 million cups. The only weak spot: volatile young drinkers, who last year drank less coffee.\n\n\"You could say this nation runs on two dark liquids — petroleum and coffee,\" said Bob Thompson, a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University who once taught a course on Starbucks and the coffee phenomenon.\n\n\"Thousands of people are lubricated and made mobile by coffee every single day.\"\n\nCoffee has become more than just a shot of caffeine. It's a $30 billion-a-year national industry, a foodie fixation, an affordable luxury, a boost of disease-fighting antioxidants, a versatile ingredient, an intoxicating aroma and a beverage that brings people together.\n\nIndustry experts credit a handful of diverse factors driving coffee's escalating popularity. The most cited is the growth in hot-selling home-brewing gadgets, with single-serve coffee makers leading the pack. Other strong factors: gourmet offerings, coffeehouses with hip appeal and health benefits.\n\n\"Coffee has become important to us on so many levels and there's no signs its cachet is going away any time soon,\" said Joe DeRupo, National Coffee Association president. \"It's part beverage, another part pop culture.\"\n\nAccording to the recent NCA survey, consumption of gourmet coffee remains strong and steady, with nearly one-third of U.S. adults drinking a gourmet coffee each day. At the same time, those drinking traditional coffee dropped from 56 percent in 2012 to 49 percent this year.\n\nGourmet includes gussied-up coffees such as lattes and espresso, along with custom blends of exotic beans. Today, more coffee brands than ever before are parlaying taste, price and even snob appeal to attract customers.\n\n\"We've gone from drinking mass-produced coffee to specialty coffee. People today are more educated about coffee than ever before. They know where it's grown and how it's roasted,\" said Matt Poole, owner of Giant Coffee, a downtown Phoenix shop that pours single-origin coffee roasted in San Francisco.\n\n\"They want coffee to taste exactly how they like it.\"\n\nThe coffeehouse, often called a third space between the home and office, also plays a role. Along with quality beans and skilled baristas, coffee shops — from small independent spots to mega chains like Starbucks — offer a place to meet friends, conduct meetings, work on the computer or read.\n\n\"The coffee shop is the town square of today,\" said Poole, who also owns Matt's Big Breakfast in downtown Phoenix. \"The expression 'let's meet for coffee' is more about getting together than actually drinking coffee. Coffee houses are providing that place to meet.\"\n\nBaristas at home\n\nAt the same time, a record number of Americans are bringing the coffee shop home. Sur la Table, a chain of 100 stores nationwide, reports double-digit increases in the sales last year of its 600-plus coffee products, from espresso makers, filters, grinders to the latest must-have gadget — single-cup brewers.\n\nThe single-serve format, which involves machines designed to brew one cup at a time, continues to grow. The study showed that 13 percent of the U.S. population drank coffee made in a single-cup brewer the previous day, up from 10 percent in 2012.\n\nMintel, a Chicago-based market-research firm, reports that the single-cup coffee market has exploded from $103 million in sales in 2007 to $11.8 billion in 2012.\n\n\"The interest in coffee makers has been increasing, increasing and increasing as people look to replicate the coffee shop experience at home,\" said Martie Sullivan, owner of Sweet Basil Gourmetmare and Cooking School in Scottsdale, Ariz.\n\nIn addition, experts credit coffee's new-found image as healthy for driving up sales. Coffee, caffeinated or decaffeinated, may help extend the lives of people who drink it daily, according to researchers at the National Cancer Institute.\n\nMen who drank two to three cups a day had a 10 percent chance of outliving those who drank no coffee, while women had a 13 percent advantage, according to the 2012 study.\n\nOther research suggests coffee lowers the risk of diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and diabetes.\n\n\"I don't think it's just a coincidence that consumption increased during a time when research refuted the old health myths and proved that coffee was in fact good for you,\" DeRupo said.\n\nChanging demographics\n\nWhile steady growth of consumption continues, the demographics of coffee drinkers constantly changes.\n\nNCA tracked Hispanic-American drinkers for the last two years, and now ties increases in overall coffee consumption to them: 74 percent of Hispanic-Americans drink coffee daily, a full 12 percentage points ahead of non-Hispanics.\n\n\"We're doing a better job of including the Hispanic-American coffee-drinking habits into the survey, and we credit this with part of the overall gain,\" DeRupo said.\n\nBut the younger generation is drinking less.\n\nAmong those ages 18 to 24, 41 percent said they drank coffee daily, down from 50 percent in 2012. Young adults also greatly reduced their daily intake of non-gourmet traditional coffee, dropping to 17 percent from 27 percent last year, the study showed.\n\nExperts, however, are hesitant to label the decrease a trend. Coffee drinking among youths has been volatile, bouncing up and down annually, for the last decade.\n\nDespite changing drinking habits, coffee consumption is expected to continue climbing.\n\n\"We usually flip over new foods, not something that has been around for centuries,\" Thompson said. \"But today coffee's got everything going for it, plus a jolt of caffeine that's hard to beat.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/04/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/09/02/how-much-coffee-healthy-three-cups-reduce-heart-attack-risk/5668047001/", "title": "How much coffee is healthy?

The study, yet to be peer-reviewed, was selected for presentation by the ESC program committee.\n\nCoffee has long been thought to have health benefits with low to moderate consumption of coffee possibly supplying energy, alertness and increased concentration, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Previous peer-reviewed research has also suggested drinking coffee may reduce the risk of stroke, heart disease, heart failure, Type 2 diabetes and certain cancers, as well as death from those diseases and other causes.\n\nThe findings are not surprising given previous research into moderate coffee drinking's possible health benefits, Rob van Dam, professor of exercise and nutrition sciences at George Washington University told USA TODAY. \"Overall, the picture is quite positive for coffee consumption, particularly if you drink it without too much cream or sugar, of course.\"\n\nMore health benefits of coffee:Drinking 3 to 4 cups of coffee a day reduces risk of liver cancer, study suggests\n\nThat's good news because nearly 60% of all Americans drink coffee daily, with per capita consumption at nearly two cups per day.\n\nCoffee drinkers had lower risk of stroke and death\n\nThis new study involved 468,629 participants of the UK BioBank database; none had signs of heart disease at the start of the study. Participants' average age was 56.2 years and more than half, 55.8%, were women.\n\nCompared to non-coffee drinkers, drinking up to three cups of coffee daily was associated with 21% lower risk of stroke, 17% lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease, and 12% lower risk of all cause death, the researchers said.\n\nA comparison of heart MRIs revealed coffee drinkers \"had healthier sized and better functioning hearts,\" Simon said. \"This was consistent with reversing the detrimental effects of aging on the heart.”\n\nFurther studies are needed to explain the health benefit, she said, but “this is the largest study to systematically assess the cardiovascular effects of regular coffee consumption in a population without diagnosed heart disease.\"\n\nThe findings could provide \"more details potentially … about what types of coffee and what dose is optimal and perhaps what mechanisms are involved in relation to changes to the heart,\" van Dam said.\n\nBut too much coffee can cause health problems\n\nCoffee is not a magic beverage. For some, too much coffee can induce anxiety, jitteriness and insomnia. A daily average of no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine is recommended, according to public health experts at Harvard and Johns Hopkins University.\n\n“Up to 5 cups of coffee each day can typically be considered safe according to studies and dietary guidelines,\" said Seth Martin, a cardiologist and associate professor at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\nDoes coffee help you lose weight?:Here's the truth behind coffee myths\n\nHave a Keurig or Nespresso?:Most coffee makers are crawling with germs and growing mold, experts say. Here's why\n\nWhen it comes to caffeine, coffee and coffee drinks can differ widely. A grande Starbucks coffee could have 260 to 360 milligrams depending on the roast – typically a darker roast has less caffeine – while a large Dunkin' Coffee has 270 mg, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest's caffeine chart. A Starbucks grande latte or cappuccino has 150 mg; a Dunkin' medium latte or cappuccino has 166. Most varieties of Keurig K-Cups make an 8 oz.- cup with 75 to 150 mg. In comparison, 1 Lipton Black Tea bag yields 55 mg.\n\nBefore you start downing more joe, you should know some research has suggested drinking too much coffee, four to six cups daily, can increase health risks.\n\nSo drink up, but don't overdo it. Oh, and remember cream and sugar can result in additional calories that may offset the potential health benefit. \"When it comes to added ingredients such as creamer and sugar, it's best to minimize them, or if you can, skip them altogether and enjoy coffee in its purest form,\" Martin said.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on Twitter: @MikeSnider.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2021/11/24/fact-check-unlikely-if-not-impossible-overdose-brewed-coffee/8678981002/", "title": "Fact check: Unlikely, if not impossible, to overdose on brewed coffee", "text": "The claim: Drinking 42 cups of coffee in one sitting would be lethal\n\nCaffeine is the world's most popular psychoactive drug, with American adults consuming 1.87 cups per day on average in 2020. But unlike other drugs, serious overdoses of caffeine are extremely rare. Why is that? And how much is too much?\n\nA meme circulating on social media purports to have one answer. A tweet that has gone viral in widely-shared screenshots says that it would take 42 cups of coffee – that's about two and a half gallons – to induce a fatal overdose.\n\n“If you drank 42 cups of coffee in one sitting, the caffeine overdose would kill you,” the tweet in the screenshot, from the Twitter account @Fact, says.\n\n“So 41 is the limit,” reads one humorous reply\n\nSeveral Facebook users have shared the meme, including one whose Nov. 14 post garnered over 1,100 reactions. The @Fact account has tweeted the claim several times, including in January and June 2021.\n\nAn administrator for the @Fact page told USA TODAY that their source was a New York Times article from 2011 that said it would require consuming at least 42 cups of strong coffee in one sitting to consume the minimum lethal dose of 5,000 mg of caffeine.\n\nHowever, the article also said that \"it would be very hard, probably impossible, to ingest enough caffeine to kill yourself by drinking ordinary coffee.\" According to our research, this is accurate.\n\nSpecial access for subscribers! Click here to sign up for our fact-check text chat\n\n\"I don't think you could possibly drink 42 cups of coffee fast enough for it to kill you,\" Jennifer L. Temple, director of the Nutrition and Health Research Lab at the University of Buffalo, told USA TODAY in a phone interview.\n\nHowever, that's not to say it's impossible to overdose on 42 cups of coffee or an equivalent amount of caffeine. While typical-strength coffee is unlikely to kill a person, large quantities of highly caffeinated coffee or other products can be dangerous in much lower amounts.\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to users who shared the claim for comment.\n\nNearly impossible to overdose on regular brewed coffee\n\nNot only would the caffeine in 42 cups of typical brewed coffee fall below the FDA's current estimate of a lethal dose of caffeine, it wouldn't be absorbed all at once, a caffeine researcher told USA TODAY.\n\nThe FDA estimates a lethal dose of caffeine is between 10,000 and 14,000 mg, though smaller amounts can be life-threatening in children and sensitive individuals, such as people with underlying heart conditions.\n\nBasing our calculation on a standard eight-ounce cup of brewed coffee containing 100 mg of caffeine per cup, 42 cups would have around 4,200 mg of caffeine, less than half of the lethal amount.\n\nAnd the time it takes to drink that amount of coffee would allow the body to metabolize some of the stimulant, Temple said.\n\nFact check: No, decaffeinated coffee is not made from dirt\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean it's impossible to overdose on coffee in general. Our calculation is based on standard-strength coffee, which contains between 80 mg and 100 mg of caffeine, but some brands of coffee are much stronger. For example, Death Wish coffee contains almost 500 mg per cup, according to Caffeine Informer.\n\nPossible to overdose on less caffeine, especially when highly concentrated\n\nWhile typical-strength coffee forces you to spread out your caffeine consumption, giving you time to take stock of its effect and metabolize the stimulant, highly concentrated products can overwhelm your body and put you at risk of an overdose at far lower amounts than is in 42 cups, experts say.\n\nIf consumed all at once or in a short time period, 4,200 mg of caffeine is a toxic and potentially fatal dose.\n\n“If somebody were to say, ‘4200 milligrams of caffeine (at once) will kill you,’ I would say, ‘Yeah, there's a good chance,'\" Temple said.\n\nThe FDA estimates a toxic dose to be around 1,200 mg of caffeine, which is equivalent to just 0.15 tablespoons of pure caffeine. In some people, consuming this amount rapidly can lead to serious events such as seizures, tachycardia and arrhythmia.\n\nIn addition, people have differing levels of sensitivity to caffeine based on weight, tolerance, speed of consumption and underlying conditions such heart conditions, Temple said.\n\nThe product you're consuming also makes a difference. For example, many energy drinks also contain another stimulant called taurine that may amplify the effects of caffeine, Forbes reported.\n\nTemple said she would advise people who are taking highly concentrated caffeine products like caffeine pills and energy shots to slow down consumption to prevent negative effects.\n\n\"Don’t start taking more and more and more and more because you don't feel the effects of the caffeine immediately,\" she said, \"because then, you could potentially overdose.\"\n\nAs USA TODAY reported, a South Carolina teenager died of a \"caffeine-induced cardiac event\" in 2017 after consuming a large Diet Mountain Dew, a McDonald’s latte and an energy drink in roughly two hours. Reuters estimated the teen consumed under 500 mg of caffeine.\n\nFact check:Black Lives Matter supporters don't get a free Frappuccino at Starbucks\n\nThe way that drinking a beverage slows down consumption, as well as the overwhelmingly negative effects of caffeine overconsumption, generally prevents overdoses, Temple said.\n\n“The way that most people consume caffeine is generally safe because once they start feeling the non-lethal negative effects, they'll stop consuming it,” she said. “People don’t like to feel shaky and jittery and nauseous.”\n\nAround 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, which is equivalent to 4-5 cups of coffee, is not generally associated with negative health effects, the FDA says.\n\nOur rating: Missing context\n\nBased on our research, we rate the claim that drinking 42 cups of coffee in one sitting would be lethal as MISSING CONTEXT, because without additional information it could be misleading. The post contains no units of measure, and there's wide variation in the caffeine content of different brands of coffee. However, it's extremely unlikely, if not impossible, to suffer a fatal overdose by drinking 42 cups of standard brewed coffee, which would contain around 4,200 mg of caffeine in total. On the other hand, consuming far lower amounts of caffeine in powdered or highly concentrated form, including highly caffeinated coffee, could put a person at risk of an overdose.\n\nOur fact-check sources:\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

Experts explain | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor some people, coffee jump-starts their bowel movements in addition to their energy.\n\nDespite the drink’s popularity, there isn’t a lot of research on why coffee sends many people running to the bathroom within minutes of consuming it.\n\n“In some cases, as with coffee and bowel movements, there likely just hasn’t been the medical demand to merit serious investigation,” Dr. Kyle Staller, director of the Gastrointestinal Motility Laboratory at Massachusetts General Hospital, said via email.\n\n“It may also be a case of obviousness, meaning it doesn’t take multiple studies to know that coffee induces bowel movements when it’s such a part of many people’s daily lives.”\n\nCoffee's effect on colon activity might have more to do with special compounds than just caffeine. Alberto Mier/CNN\n\nThere just might be something special about coffee, and the research that exists proves “that patients are right,” said Staller, also an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. Some small studies have shown that drinking coffee was more effective than warm water at inducing bowel movements – that’s saying something since “water is an integral part of normal digestion with large amounts being released and reabsorbed by your digestive tract every day,” he said.\n\nThis of course doesn’t mean that adequate water intake isn’t essential for your overall health. “About 60% of your body is made of water,” Jerlyn Jones, a registered dietitian nutritionist and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, said via email.\n\nAnd whether the coffee’s caffeinated or decaffeinated doesn’t seem to matter in all studies, according to other research – suggesting that, in some cases, coffee compounds besides caffeine might be responsible for sudden bowel movements.\n\nThe identities of these compounds and how they might interact with the digestive tract are still largely unknown, but here’s what researchers have discovered so far.\n\nCoffee might cause colon contractions\n\nThe colon experiences three types of contractions that work together to mix, knead and ultimately eject poop. The occurrence, timing and frequency of these contractions are influenced by muscular, neural and chemical factors.\n\nCoffee might stimulate this colonic motor activity within minutes of consuming it, based on the limited available research, Staller said. Twelve healthy people experienced this activity during a 1998 study when they agreed to have a sensor probe inserted into their colons. Over a 10-hour period the next day, the participants consumed warm coffee, decaf coffee, water or a meal in random order. Both types of coffee and a meal caused more colon contractions and pressure, compared with water. Caffeinated coffee was 60% more effective than water at stimulating colonic motor activity and 23% more impactful than decaf.\n\nMultiple participants of another study said drinking coffee gave them the urge to poop, then went through a similar test. Their colon activity increased within four minutes of drinking unsweetened black coffee, an effect that lasted at least 30 minutes.\n\nThose results likely mean that coffee isn’t directly contacting the colon’s lining but rather affecting it through a “gastrocolic mechanism,” Staller said – meaning coffee contacting “the stomach lining triggers either a nervous system or hormonal response that causes the colon to start contracting,” he said. “Colon contractions move stool in the colon toward the rectum and voila – you have the urge to have a bowel movement.”\n\nMelanoidins – compounds formed during coffee roasting – have dietary fiber, which helps digestion and prevents constipation, Jones said.\n\nIt might affect hormones and stomach acid\n\nCoffee appears to also stimulate release of the hormone gastrin, Staller said, which enables production of gastric acid (stomach acid). Gastric acid helps digest food and might urge colonic activity. Researchers discovered in 1986 that drinking caffeinated or decaf coffee affected gastrin levels quickly and significantly.\n\nAfter fasting overnight, men in a small 2009 study received either a meal and black coffee, or just a meal. Drinking coffee significantly sped up the time it took for food to leave the stomach and enter the small intestine after the mealtimes.\n\n“Some compounds in coffee may also interact with the opioid receptors in the GI tract,” which affect bowel function, Staller added.\n\nDairy and digestive health\n\nIf you’re lactose intolerant yet still enjoy dairy creamer with a side of coffee, the creamer could be the culprit behind any sudden urges to poop.\n\n“One way to find out what is making you go to the bathroom is to drink coffee without dairy creamer or milk and track your symptoms for a few days,” Jones said.\n\nWhile research does suggest some digestive benefits of drinking coffee, should your regular morning coffee be what you use to stay regular? If you’re constipated, drinking coffee to help move things along isn’t unreasonable, Staller said.\n\n“But don’t rely on it to move your bowels,” Jones said. “Speak to your medical doctor if you are having problems going to the bathroom regularly.”\n\nJones recommended slowly increasing your dietary fiber intake “with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts and seeds.” “The average American adult consumes only 12 to 14 grams of fiber a day and the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends 25 to 30 grams of fiber a day for adults.”\n\nPeople prone to having loose or urgent bowel movements “may want to consider that coffee can be a trigger for those unpleasant events as well,” Staller said.", "authors": ["Kristen Rogers"], "publish_date": "2022/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/04/health/alcohol-brain-shrinkage-wellness/index.html", "title": "Just one drink per day can shrink your brain, study says | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nJust one pint of beer or average glass of wine a day may begin to shrink the overall volume of the brain, a new study has found, and the damage worsens as the number of daily drinks rises.\n\nOn average, people at age 50 who drank a pint of beer or 6-ounce glass of wine (two alcohol units) a day in the last month had brains that appeared two years older than those who only drank a half of a beer (one unit), according to the study, which published Friday in the journal Nature.\n\nThe brains of people that age who said they drank three alcohol units a day had reductions in both white and gray matter that looked as if they had added 3.5 years to the ages of their brains.\n\nOne alcohol unit is 10 milliliters or 8 grams of pure alcohol. That means 25 milliliters or a single shot of liquor is one unit; a 16-ounce can of beer or cider is two units; and a standard 6-ounce glass of wine (175 milliliters) is two units.\n\nThe brains of nondrinkers who began consuming an average of one alcohol unit a day showed the equivalent of a half a year of aging, according to the study.\n\nIn comparison, drinking four alcohol units a day aged a person’s brain by more than 10 years.\n\n“It’s not linear. It gets worse the more you drink,” first author Remi Daviet, an assistant professor of marketing in the Wisconsin School of Business at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said in a statement.\n\n“A problem in this study is that they only have information on people’s drinking habits for the one year prior to the (brain) imaging,” said alcohol researcher Emmanuela Gakidou, a professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington.\n\n“I think this is a major limitation of the study as it’s likely that the cumulative consumption of alcohol throughout one’s lifetime is associated with the brain, not just the level of consumption right before the images were taken,” she added.\n\n“The relationship between alcohol and health is complex, and our understanding of that relationship is evolving over time. Based on this study, I would not really draw any definitive conclusions, but I would say that the authors have identified areas for further research.”\n\nBenefits of alcohol?\n\nDoctors used to believe that moderate amounts of alcohol could provide a health benefit, especially to the heart and the brain, but recent research has called that assumption into question. A number of studies have found no amount of drinking to be healthy, and the World Heart Federation recently published a policy brief saying there is “no level of alcohol consumption that is safe for health.”\n\n“Small amounts of alcohol are associated with health benefits for some conditions, such as ischemic heart disease and diabetes, but harmful for others, such as road traffic accidents and breast cancer,” Gakidou said, adding there are others, such as a stroke, where the outcome isn’t clear.\n\n“There isn’t really a simple answer for a given individual,” she said. “Based on what we do know at this time, whether small amounts of alcohol are beneficial or harmful for an individual depends on that person’s health status and their risk profile. … Are they more prone to heart disease or cancer?”\n\nBrain scans and large study size\n\nThe report analyzed data from more than 36,000 people who took part in the UK Biobank study, which houses in-depth genetic and health information on more than 500,000 middle-aged adults living in the United Kingdom.\n\nPeople in the study had provided information on the number of drinks they had each week in the previous year and had undergone an MRI brain scan. Researchers compared their scans with images of typical aging brains and then controlled for such variables as age, sex, smoking status, socioeconomic status, genetic ancestry and overall head size.\n\n“The fact that we have such a large sample size allows us to find subtle patterns, even between drinking the equivalent of half a beer and one beer a day,” coauthor Gideon Nave, an assistant professor of marketing at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, said in a statement.\n\n“Having this dataset is like having a microscope or a telescope with a more powerful lens,” Nave said. “You get a better resolution and start seeing patterns and associations you couldn’t before.”\n\nHe told CNN that is why this study was able to find a more distinct pattern of association between drinking and brain volume than past studies. However, he added, the results are just that – an association – as the study could not prove cause and effect.\n\n“Our study is by far the largest investigation of the topic,” Nave said. “It uses a general population sample, and it controls for more confounds than before. As such, it provides overwhelmingly more evidence than any previous investigations and gets us closer to settling the debate.”\n\nHowever, the study left a number of questions unanswered, such as a person’s cognitive engagement, Gakidou said.\n\n“I believe that there is sufficient evidence that suggests that brain function decays faster among those that are not engaged in intellectually stimulating activities, either through work or hobbies,” she said.\n\n“My main criticism is that the authors are overinterpreting the findings of their study and drawing conclusions that are not necessarily supported by what is presented in the paper.

Those who drank energy drinks daily slept about a half hour less each night, compared to those who didn't drink energy drinks or had them only occasionally, the researchers report in the current issue of the BMJ Open medical journal.\n\nThose who regularly drank energy drinks also took longer to fall asleep and daily energy drink consumers were more likely to have insomnia than those who drank the drinks occasionally or not at all, according to the study conducted by researchers at sites including the Norwegian Institute of Public Health and the University of Oslo, Norway.\n\n“The results from the current study show that there is a robust association between the frequency of (energy drink)consumption and the different sleep parameters,\" wrote the researchers led by Siri Kaldenbach of the Department of Paediatric and Adolescent Medicine at Innlandet Hospital Trust in Lillehammer, Norway.\n\nSleep findings:Scientists find consistent sleep a major health indicator over sleep duration\n\nCan I have too much caffeine?\n\nThe FDA has set a recommended safe amount of caffeine – which doesn't lead to negative or dangerous effects – for adults of about 400 milligrams a day, the equivalent to four or five 8-ounce cups of coffee. An 8-ounce cup of coffee may have 80 to 100 mgs of caffeine.\n\nFor those who are younger, pediatricians suggest those under 12 not have any caffeine and that children and teens not drink energy drinks. For those aged 12 to 18, experts suggest limiting daily caffeine intake to at most 100 mg, that found in two 12-ounce cans of cola.\n\nThe Norwegian researchers defined energy drinks as non-alcoholic beverages with an average caffeine content of 150 milligrams per litre – the equivalent to 150 mg in 33 ounces. The drinks also may include sugar, vitamins, minerals and amino acids.\n\nMany popular energy drinks have higher levels. 5-hour Energy shots may have 200-300 milligrams of caffeine in varying sizes from (1.9 ounces-up), while Starbucks Triple Shot Energy drinks can contain 225 mg of caffeine per 15 ounces. One 8.4 fl. oz. can of Red Bull Energy Drink has 80 mg of caffeine. Monster Energy Drinks have different levels of caffeine, with some containing 140 mg and others up to 300 mg per 16-ounce serving.\n\nLast year, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., called on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to investigate PRIME energy drinks because of high caffeine levels (200 mg of caffeine per 12 ounces) and the products' marketing to children. The company claimed it clearly advertises the drink as for those 18-up and that another of its drinks, PRIME Hydration, has no caffeine.\n\nSleep findings:What is revenge bedtime procrastination. The science behind why you are sacrificing sleep\n\nStudy finds sleep side effects of energy drinks with caffeine\n\nCaffeine can provide an energy boost and improved concentration, but too much can lead to side effects, detrimental side effects, especially in the high doses commonly found in energy drinks. Among the side effects: anxiety, insomnia, and heart problems, according to the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.\n\nThe researchers in Norway sought to investigate what aspects of sleep might be affected in students, a category of consumers who had increasingly been drawn to energy drinks. They based the research on information from more than 53,200 college and university students, aged 18-35, in the country's Students’ Health and Well-being Study.\n\nThe students were asked how often they drank energy drinks – daily, weekly (once; 2-3 times; 4-6 times), monthly (1-3 times), and seldom or never – 8% of men and 5.5% of women said they drank them 4-6 times a week, while 5% of men and 3% of women drank them daily, the researchers said.\n\nDaily consumption of energy drinks, researchers said, led to:\n\nLess sleep. Those who drank energy drinks daily were more than twice as likely to say they slept less than 6 hours per night. Even more women (87%) who drank energy drinks daily said they slept less than 6 hours per night. Both men and women who said they drank energy drinks daily slept about 30 minutes less nightly, compared to those who said they drank the drinks occasionally or didn't drink them at all.\n\nThose who drank energy drinks daily were more than twice as likely to say they slept less than 6 hours per night.

Half of women (51%) who consumed energy drinks daily said they had insomnia, compared to 33% of women who seldom or never consumed the drinks reporting insomnia.

Daily energy drink consumers also were more likely to wake up after falling asleep and to take longer to fall asleep, the researchers said.\n\nEven those who had 1 to 3 energy drinks per month were at risk for more sleep problems, the researchers said.\n\nThe researchers cannot draw definitive findings from the study because it relied on participants reporting their activity and, they noted, \"energy drink consumption might be a consequence of poor sleep rather than the other way round.\"However, the findings do suggest consumption of energy drinks \"could be a possible target for interventions,\" the researchers said.\n\nFollow Mike Snider on X and Threads: @mikesnider & mikegsnider.\n\nWhat's everyone talking about?

However, only ground and instant coffee with caffeine reduced the risk for an irregular heartbeat called arrhythmia. Decaffeinated coffee did not lower that risk, according to the study published Wednesday in the European Journal of Preventive Cardiology.\n\nPrior studies have also found moderate amounts of black coffee — between 3 and 5 cups daily — has been shown to lower the risk of heart disease, as well as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, type 2 diabetes, liver disease and prostate cancer.\n\n“This manuscript adds to the body of evidence from observational trials associating moderate coffee consumption with cardioprotection, which looks promising,” said Charlotte Mills, a lecturer in nutritional sciences at the University of Reading in the UK, in a statement.\n\nHowever, this study, like many in the past, was only observational in nature and therefore cannot prove a direct cause and effect, added Mills, who was not involved in the study.\n\n“Does coffee make you healthy or do inherently healthier people consume coffee?” she asked. “Randomized controlled trials are needed to prove the relationship between coffee and cardiovascular health.”\n\nGround, caffeinated coffee lowered risk the most\n\nThe study used data from the UK Biobank, a research database which contained coffee consumption preferences on nearly 450,000 adults who were free of arrhythmia or other cardiovascular disease at the start of the study. They were divided into four groups: those who enjoyed caffeinated ground coffee, those who chose decaffeinated coffee, those who preferred caffeinated instant coffee, and those who did not drink coffee at all.\n\nAfter an average of 12.5 years, researchers looked at medical and death records for reports of arrhythmia, cardiovascular disease, stroke and death. After adjusting for age, diabetes, ethnicity, high blood pressure, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, sex, smoking status, and tea and alcohol consumption, researchers found all types of coffee were linked with a reduction in death from any cause.\n\nThe fact that both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee was beneficial “might suggest that it is not simply the caffeine which could potentially explain any associated reduction in risk,” said Duane Mellor, a registered dietitian and senior teaching fellow at Aston University Medical School in Birmingham in the UK, in a statement. He was not involved in the study.\n\n“Caffeine is the most well-known constituent in coffee, but the beverage contains more than 100 biologically active components,” said Kistler, who holds joint appointments as professor of medicine at the University of Melbourne and Monash University.\n\n“It is likely that the non-caffeinated compounds were responsible for the positive relationships observed between coffee drinking, cardiovascular disease and survival,” Kistler said.\n\nDrinking two to three cups of coffee a day was linked to the largest reduction in early death, compared to people who drank no coffee, according to the statement. Ground coffee consumption lowered the risk of death by 27%, followed by 14% for decaffeinated, and 11% for instant caffeinated coffee.\n\nThe link between coffee and a lowered risk for heart disease and stroke was not as robust: Drinking two to three cups a day of ground coffee lowered risk by 20%, while the same amount of decaf coffee reduced risk by 6% and instant by 9%.\n\nThe data changed when it came to coffee’s impact on irregular heartbeat: Four to five cups a day of caffeinated ground coffee lowered risk by 17% while two to three cups a day of instant coffee reduced the likelihood of arrhythmia by 12%, the statement said.\n\nMore study needed\n\nA limitation of the study was that coffee consumption was self-reported at a single point in time, said Annette Creedon, a nutritional scientist and manager at the British Nutrition Foundation, which is partially funded by food producers, retailers and food service companies.\n\n“This study had a median follow-up period of 12.5 years during which many aspects of the participants diet and lifestyle may have changed,” said Creedon in a statement. She was not part of the research.\n\nIn addition, coffee can produce negative side effects in some people, she added. People with sleep issues or uncontrolled diabetes, for example, should check with a doctor before adding caffeine to their diets.\n\nThese negative side effects “can be particularly relevant to individuals who are sensitive to the effects of caffeine,” Creedon said. “Hence, the findings of this study do not indicate that people should start drinking coffee if they do not already drink it or that they should increase their consumption.”\n\nMost studies are focused on the health benefits of black coffee, and do not take into account the extra sugars, creams, milks and processed additives that many people use in coffee.\n\n“A simple cup of coffee perhaps with a little milk is very different to a large latte flavoured with a syrup and added cream,” Mellor said.\n\nAdding sugars and dairy fats to coffee can reduce their health benefits, experts say. Adobe Stock\n\nIn addition, how coffee is brewed can also affect its benefits for health. Filtered coffee catches a compound called cafestol that exists in the oily part of coffee. Cafestol can increase bad cholesterol or LDL (low-density lipoproteins).\n\nHowever, using a French press, Turkish coffee maker or boiling coffee (as is often done in Scandinavian countries), does not remove cafestol.\n\nAnd, finally, coffee’s benefits do not apply to children – even adolescents should not drink colas, coffees, energy drinks or other beverages with any amount of caffeine, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/09/29"}]}

But the post-strike ceremony didn't lose much from the delay. With deserving (if very predictable) winners, genuinely emotional moments, sweet speeches and inoffensive host Anthony Anderson, the Emmys managed to pull off a respectable broadcast. It came in on time, it wasn't (too) cringey, and we got to see some of the original \"Grey's Anatomy\" cast back together again, among other reunions. All in all, that's a successful night.\n\nFrom nostalgic reunions like \"Grey's\" to sweeps for \"Succession,\" \"The Bear\" and \"Beef\" in. the best drama, comedy and limited series categories, respectively, we captured the highs, lows and in-between moments. And we'll be back in September to do it all over again.\n\n'Succession' sweeps it all! HBO's media drama takes the top prize\n\nWith 27 nominations this year, and 75 in total for its four seasons, \"Succession\" says a final goodbye with the Emmys' top prize for best drama series. \"This is a show about family, but it's also about when partisan news coverage gets intertwined with right-wing politics, and after four seasons I understand that's a problem we have fixed,\" quipped Jesse Armstrong, the show's creator.\n\nThe Roy family had a fantastic night all around, winning six awards (so did winning comedy \"The Bear\"). Kieran Culkin, the adorable, blubbering winner of best actor in a drama for \"Succession,\" just couldn't get his tuxedo buttoned for his acceptance speech and begged his wife for another kid since he won (she said \"maybe,\" so we'll see). His co-star Sarah Snook won for best actress, and remarked how easy it is to act while you're pregnant, because you're \"full of hormones\" (where's the lie?). They may play seething, cynical and scheming media moguls in the HBO series, but in real life, they're the sweetest, most adorable recipients of the night.\n\n'The Bear' tops off best comedy series win with a big kiss\n\nFX's high-pressure, stressful and somehow still a comedy series \"The Bear\" took the top prize of the night in that category. Representing the cast and producers was series co-star and producer Matty Matheson, who gave a shoutout to the restaurant industry and got a big old smooch from his co-star (and supporting actor winner) Ebon Moss-Bachrach. It was nearly as chaotic as a knife-flying episode of \"The Bear.\"\n\nIn Memoriam honors Norman Lear, Matthew Perry\n\nAs Charlie Puth sang a slow, acoustic version of his bittersweet “See You Again,” the Television Academy honored those in the TV industry who died in the past year. The emotional segment started with the legendary producer Norman Lear and ended with “Friends” star Matthew Perry, to the tune of the sitcom’s theme song “I’ll Be There For You.” It was tear-jerking, to say the least.\n\nWe have zero beef with all the 'Beef' wins for Ali Wong, Steven Yeun\n\nSometimes, miraculously, awards shows get it right. It might be boring when one show seems to sweep all the categories, but it was more than deserved when it came to Netflix's \"Beef,\" the unequivocal best show of 2023 and one of the most unique series to debut on TV in the past several years. Actors Ali Wong and Steven Yeun, and director and writer Lee Sung Jin are so deserving, and gave such wonderfully thoughtful and heartfelt speeches. And, of course, it also took best limited series. Wins like these make it worth tuning in to these shows.\n\nGLAAD wins the Governor's Award, highlights the importance of representation\n\n\"Ted Lasso\" star Hannah Waddingham and Colman Domingo were giddy with delight to present the prestigious Governors Award to GLAAD, an LGBTQ media advocacy organization that promotes realistic representation of the community on screen. President and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis begged the Hollywood community to portray transgender people in their stories. \"More people claim to have met a ghost than know a transgender person.\"\n\nElton John is finally an EGOT\n\nHey, that Elton John guy might have a career in TV if he's all done touring his music! The legendary singer and songwriter became a member of the elite EGOT club (those who have received an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony) when his Disney+ speical \"Elton John Live: Farewell from Dodger Stadium\" won for best live variety special. The man himself couldn't be there, but I feel confident the Emmy might have a nice spot on his shelf all ready.\n\n'Grey's Anatomy' cast reunites\n\nPick me. Choose me. Love me. Meet me ... on the Emmys stage? Yes, that's right: \"Grey's Anatomy\" cast members past and present – originals Justin Chambers, Katherine Heigl, Ellen Pompeo, James Pickens Jr. and Chandra Wilson – reunited at this year's Emmy Awards, just shy of 19 years of the show's March 2005 premiere. The cast appeared following a tribute from host Anthony Anderson, who talked up his mother's love for medical dramas. \"Grey's\" – which has earned 39 Emmy nominations and multiple wins – is now the longest-running primetime medical drama in TV history. ―David Oliver\n\nJohn Oliver wins two more Emmys for 'Last Week Tonight'\n\nPerennial Emmy winner John Oliver won two awards, variety talk host and a new category, best scripted variety series, for his HBO series \"Last Week Tonight.\" This year's new category, in which \"Saturday Night Live\" also competed, separated them from late-night talk shows, which lately have taken a back seat at the Emmys. That was all upside for Trevor Noah, whose \"Daily Show\" was able to win in its own category, as he noted in acceptance speech, because Oliver wasn't nominated. Maybe there's hope yet for NBC's \"Late Night With Seth Meyers,\" the best of the late night bunch.\n\n'Cheers,' 'Martin' Lawrence sitcom casts reunite, and it's all a little awkward\n\nIt's the 75th Emmy Awards so you can't blame the producers for being nostalgic. You can blame them for scripting some very awkward, stilted reunions, including the casts of \"Martin\" and \"Cheers\" in recreations of their famous sets. Maybe shorter, actually funny segments would have worked, but when the \"Martin\" cast went on about how they didn't have any Emmys themselves, I started looking for an escape route.\n\nNiecy Nash-Betts wins for Netflix's 'Dahmer' series, and her speech is better than the series\n\nNetflix's Jeffrey Dahmer true-crime drama was abhorrent in almost every way ― except for Nash-Betts, who gave a searing performance that Emmy voters recognized with the best supporting actress in a limited series trophy. But truly the actress's emotional, moving, political and life-affirming speech was a far better piece of art than \"Dahmer.\" And much easier to watch.\n\nChristina Applegate makes rare, emotional appearance\n\nChristina Applegate was met with a standing ovation as she presented the award for best supporting actress in a comedy series. The 52-year-old actress, who was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2021 while filming the third and final season of Netflix's \"Dead to Me,\" made a rare appearance Monday at the awards show. She was a nominee as lead actress in a comedy series for the show. As the crowd stood up and cheered, Applegate joked that they were \"totally shaming\" her by standing up because she uses a cane for support amid her diagnosis. -Naledi Ushe\n\nYes, chef! Ayo Edebiri wins for ‘The Bear’; Quinta Brunson takes the acting Emmy for “Abbott Elementary”\n\nThe first win of the night was emphatically deserved. Edebiri, the young breakout star of FX’s “The Bear” (who took the Emmy for its first season), gave an electric performance in the series -- even presenter Applegate was overjoyed to present the award. Edebiri was overwhelmed and hyperventilating yet gave a graceful speech. “Probably not a dream to emigrate to this country and have your child say, ‘I want to do improv!” she quipped to her parents. Hey, sometimes those improv classes pay off.\n\nNext up: Quinta Brunson won best actress in a comedy for ABC's “Abbott Elementary.” (Fun fact, the two actresses play sisters on “Abbott”.) The legendary Carol Burnett presented Brunson her award, leaving the actress (and writer, who previously won for that work on “Abbott”) in tears. It’s always lovely to see genuine heartfelt moments at an awards show. “I love Abbott Elementary,” Brunson sobbed. Us, too. Us, too.\n\n2024 Emmy awards red carpet photos:See the best shots of Selena Gomez, Issa Rae, Quinta Brunson\n\nAnthony Anderson doesn't embarrass himself in his monologue\n\nAnthony Anderson could have walked across the stage and made a fart noise and it still probably would have been better than Jo Koy’s opening at the Golden Globes last week. But the comedian, who is known more for his scripted work than stand-up monologues, managed a very respectable opener honoring great TV shows from the medium's past (it is the 75th anniversary of the Emmys, after all). With the help from a \"local and ethnically diverse choir,\" Anderson revisited the likes of \"Mister Rogers' Neighborhood,\" \"Good Times,\" \"The Facts of Life\" and \"Miami Vice.\" It was quaint and cute, almost a relief after the Globes disaster last week. You can just ignore the part where he shoehorned his mother into the show.\n\nEmmys red carpet looks\n\nWhat’s a good awards show without a good red carpet?

See the best dressed stars so far. And here's our full red-carpet gallery:\n\nWhy were the Emmys postponed?\n\nThe Emmys are usually a September event, launching the traditional broadcast TV season. But producers were forced to delay the 2023 ceremony due to the dual writers and actors strikes last summer. This marks the lengthiest delay of the Emmys since 2001, when the show was put on hold for seven weeks following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and the related U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. (The Emmys carried on during the early days of COVID in 2020 with a partially virtual show.) But it also means the show falls in the crush of a busy awards season, just eight days after the Goiden Globes and one night after the Critics Choice Awards.\n\nWhat TV shows were eligible for the 75th Emmy Awards this year?\n\nYou have to dig deep back into your memory (like, really deep) to remember all the great TV that premiered from June 1, 2022 to May 31, 2023, the eligibility period for this year's awards. That's right, we're talking the final season HBO's \"Succession,\" Season 3 of Apple's \"Ted Lasso\"; Season 1 of FX's \"The Bear\"; Netflix's \"Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story\" and a host of other series from as long as 19 months ago.\n\nEmmy noms 2024: Who had the most?\n\nWhat shows are vying for the awards on TV's biggest night? Here are the most nominated series this year, including nods for last weekend's Creative Arts ceremonies (let's just say it's good to be on HBO). But among them, in Monday's ceremony \"The Last of Us,\" \"Ted Lasso\" and \"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" were shut out.\n\n\"Succession\" (HBO): 27\n\n\"The Last Of Us\" (HBO): 24\n\n\"The White Lotus\" (HBO): 23\n\n\"Ted Lasso\" (Apple TV+): 21\n\n\"The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\" (Amazon): 14\n\n\"The Bear\" (FX): 13\n\n\"Beef\" (Netflix): 13\n\nHenry Winkler and Kieran Culkin share sweet moment on red carpet\n\nOver on the — er — silver carpet, celebrities arrived seemingly grouped by show. First “The Bear,” then “Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,” “Ted Lasso, “Succession,” and so on.As Henry Winkler made his way over to speak with USA TODAY, he spotted Kieran Culkin doing an interview and swooped in to kiss the side of his face.“I love him!

This culturally authentic and colorful show was performed at elementary schools #1, #6, #8, #10, and both McManus and Soehl middle schools.\n\nThe performances started with a lion and dragon procession from the NJROTC under the direction of Chief Mark Velez. Traditionally, Chinese dragons are viewed as very lucky. Therefore, the dragon dance is seen as bestowing good luck for the New Year upon all who see it.\n\nFollowing the dragon dance, the Linden High School Dance Company performed Chinese umbrella and ribbon dances. Both of these dance styles have deep connections in Chinese history, dating back to as early as the 1st Century BCE. These dances were coordinated and facilitated by Barbara Brady.\n\nThe processions and dances were accompanied by music transcribed and directed by Anthony Spano and performed on taiko drums. Taiko drums are large and played with thick wooden sticks. They make a very recognizable deep, booming sound, which were a perfect addition to the various dance performances.\n\nFrom this performance, students learned about how people across Asia and the Chinese diaspora celebrate the Lunar New Year. At Linden Public Schools, programs like this happen because of the cooperation between language and arts teachers, the NJROTC program, building principles, and the World Language Supervisor, Alphonsina Paternostro.\n\nOld Bridge High School\n\nOld Bridge High School is in the midst of undergoing re-accreditation and will be evaluated by the Middle States Association Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools.\n\nThe process gives the high school a chance to \"step back and look at the day-to-day process and examine what areas we can improve,\" including technology, curriculum, and student activities explained Allison Tuckman, a co-internal coordinator with Susan Chesakis. Both Tuckman and Chesakis teach at the high school's main building.\n\nA team of six evaluators will visit the grades 9-12 campus April 13 to April 16. They will speak with administrators, teachers, staff, students, and parents. They will examine the facility and make sure the high school is doing everything it submitted in a recent report to the commission.\n\nDuring the Middle States Commission's visit, representatives will pull students out of classes during their visit, asking them questions about school life, course offerings, and technology.\n\n\"We will showcase our school and our extraordinary teachers for their hard work and daily dedication,\" Chesakis said in a prepared statement. \"We applaud the staff for their efforts for taking Middle States seriously and administration for providing all of its support.\"\n\n\"The idea is for them to get an idea of what we are about, and we are implementing everything we say on paper,\" Tuckman added.\n\nAccording to the Middle States accreditation website, about 2,000 schools, school districts, and educational institutions in the US and abroad are accredited by the Middle States Association Commissions on Elementary and Secondary Schools.\n\nThe websites explains that \"Middle States accreditation helps a school critically review its current performance, set a course for positive change and build the commitment and support necessary for significant and long-term improvement…Accreditation helps ensure that schools are making the most efficient use of available resources. Middle States accredited schools are better positioned to use time, talent and money in the most efficient and effective way possible.\"\n\nAbout 18 months ago, the school set up a planning committee made up of teachers from every department, members of the Guidance Department and administration, parents in the community, and several student representatives. The members met periodically to discuss areas in the high school which needed improvement and ways to best showcase the school.\n\nThe high school first received accreditation in 2008 and as a result added new programs to improve the school community. Those programs include Battle of the Classes and the student-produced cable show \"Knightly Wrap-Up\".\n\nAccording to Chesakis, most school districts in New Jersey undergo the Middle States process.\n\nThe Middle States team will present its final report on April 16 in the Main Building auditorium. The presentation will be open to staff, students, and members of the community.\n\nQuinnipiac University\n\nThe following Middlesex County residents at Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut were named to the fall dean's list; to qualify, students must earn a grade-point average of at least 3.5: Sydney S.

More than 14,000 students compete in the NSB each year.\n\nDOE's Office of Science manages the NSB Finals competition. More information is available on the NSB website: http://www.science.energy.gov/wdts/nsb/.\n\nWoodbridge High School\n\nIt's all happening! Movement. Energy. Competition. \"Bring It On,\" the Broadway musical inspired by the hit movie, will be presented by Woodbridge High School on Thursday March 19, Friday March 20, Saturday March 21 (all at 7 p.m.), and Sunday, March 22 at 2 p.m.. The show reflects the emotion, the passion, and the drive that is the engine behind competitive sports. It's a musical about cheerleaders, but it's also about realizing that things may not be as they appear on the surface. Above all, it's about following a dream.\n\nWoodbridge's production of \"Bring It On\" features 44 cast members and more than a dozen crew members/backstage support volunteers, along with student musicians in the pit. Another 25 art students are painting backdrops to transport audiences to funky, vibrant neighborhoods they'll never forget.\n\nThe play tells the story of Campbell (Karli Huber-Sharkus), her two cheertastic besties Skylar and Kylar (Brittney Crawford, Ally Check), her \"so handsome it hurts\" boyfriend Steven (Hamzah Syed), and spunky, curvy team mascot Bridget (CeCe Resto) savoring what they hope will be another championship season for the suburban Truman High cheerleading squad. Eager sophomore Eva (Mia Reiser)'s nervousness might threaten Campbell's \"one perfect moment\" but Campbell's fate is sealed when she and Bridget are redistricted to the rough, urban, Jackson High School, which doesn't even have a cheer squad. Faced with hard knocks, Campbell meets the charming music producer Randall (Ralph Nuñez), and Jackson's resident dance crew (\"we ain't no cheerleaders\"): the fierce Danielle (Daniela Campos), the soulful Nautica (Kenesha Freeman), and the fabulous La Cienega (Xavier Rivera). Colorful characters like hormonal Twig (Devin Van Dross), streetwise Cameron (John Hemmans) and a tough Principal/competition judge (Kevin Chauca) convince Campbell that she needs to start a cheerleading squad at Jackson and challenge her old school for the national title. The competitive tension becomes palpable as suspicious mysteries involving conspiracy and blackmail dare all the characters to find their true selves, define their dreams, and win first place in everything that really matters.\n\n\"Bring It On\" is written by a musical theatre dream team: Lin-Manuel Miranda (\"In the Heights,\" the new New York City sensation \"Hamilton\"), Tom Kitt (the Pulitzer Prize-winning \"Next to Normal,\" \"If/Then\"), and Amanda Green (\"Hands on a Hardbody\") collaborated on the songs, and the funny, sassy book is by Jeff Whitty (\"Avenue Q\"). Woodbridge High School had great success presenting Lin-Manuel Miranda's \"In the Heights\" last year, and decided to keep the good times rolling with another of his exciting musicals.\n\nThe director is Tom Lynch, the Production Supervisor is Kelly Terrell, and the musical directors are Jason Kohn and Lisa Romero. Choreography is by WHS alumni Samantha Tirone, and Joy Velasco, Caitlin Nadler and Ruth Macaulay Smith are stage managers.\n\nTickets can be obtained at the door ($12) or in advance from any cast member, or the main office at the high school ($10 in advance).

The plan involves the swap of 1.53 acres of state land for 3.92 acres – much of it along the bottom of the Brandywine – owned by The Buccini/Pollin Group.\n\nThe land is part of the former Bancroft Mills site, which the development group took over in 2015, embarking on a mission to repurpose it into multifamily residential units. While Buccini/Pollin had hoped to start demolition in early December in preparation for the project, a large fire in November destroyed much of the old mill complex.\n\nThe timeline for the $70 million plan was thrown off because of the fire, said the company’s Senior Vice President for Development Michael Hare about a week after the incident. Redevelopment costs were likely to increase, Hare said, because the old wood timbers within the structure now cannot be sold.\n\nThe council, by law, can't approve the land swap with Buccinni/Pollin, but on Wednesday it voted to ask state lawmakers to authorize it.\n\nThe move is a rare one. The council has requested a land swap just one other time in its 26-year history. It exchanged a piece of land with Epworth United Methodist Church just outside Rehoboth Beach several years ago.\n\nIronically, a second land swap proposed earlier this year with Epworth was scuttled by the council. Council members raised concerns about trading land that was purchased with land conservation in mind.\n\nOn Wednesday, they agreed to an outright purchase of ball fields owned by Epworth – land that was part of the former swap proposal. The state will pay $225,000 to buy the 5.76 acres, adjacent to ball fields the state already owns off Holland Glade Road. The purchase price may sound low given resort area real estate prices, but the council purchased a conservation easement on the land years ago. With this latest deal, the state ends up the outright owner of the property.\n\nSTORY: Bancroft Mills still smoldering, one week after fire\n\nSTORY: Abandoned Bancroft Mills in Wilmington burns\n\nThere was some initial concern about the Brandywine land swap until state park officials explained the long-standing access issues at Alapocas Run.\n\nEven though the land will be transferred to a private owner, \"this is an exception where it should be done,\" said Wayne Holden, a council member.\n\nState Rep. Gerald L. Brady, D-Wilmington, said he was born and raised in the area, as were five generations of his family.\n\n\"I know every square inch\" of the old Bancroft Mill, he said.\n\nBrady, an Open Space Council member, said he's been involved in the park access issue for years.\n\n\"I've worked with just about every personality you can imagine,\" he said. \"Land swaps are the least of our legal issues.\"\n\nThe swap, he said, would improve access and provide the state with additional amenities.\n\n\"This is a good deal. Trust me,\" Brady said.\n\nThe Open Space Council has signed off on four land acquisitions at Alapocas Run. The first was in 1988 when River Gardens, LLC transferred 12.19 acres to the state at no cost. The second came in 1999 when the state spent $4.5 million to buy 152.33 acres from Al-Zar Ltd. The third land purchase was in 2000 when the state paid CCM Realty LLC $350,000 for 1.53 acres. The last acquisition was last year when the state acquired 45.94 acres from the Nemours Foundation at no cost. The urban park stretches from its boundary with Rockford Park to beyond U.S. 202.\n\nCouncil member Lorraine Fleming said she visited the park section along the Brandywine on Tuesday.\n\n\"I guess I was a little stunned to see how dismal the park entrance was,\" she said.\n\nFleming was more concerned that a swap might set a precedent.\n\nBut once she learned there had been a previous swap, she said she was satisfied.\n\nState Park staffers characterized the Brandywine land swap as a unique opportunity to resolve long-standing issues, improve access and gain some park improvements.\n\n\"There are such a limited number of parking space,\" said Ray Bivens, state parks director.\n\nBivens said state park officials can't promote the park because they depend upon an easement with private landowners to reach the tiny parcel. In addition, there is limited parking for visitors.\n\nWith the swap, Bivens said, the developers have agreed to install a 25-space parking lot, a pavilion and restrooms, and provide an improved access route into the state holdings.\n\nIn addition, the state gets control of the river along the old Bancroft Mill site. This area includes an old dam. Bivens said state park officials would ultimately like to remove the dam to allow passage of American shad during their spring spawning run.\n\nContact Molly Murray at (302) 463-3334 or mmurray@delawareonline.com.

Last week, a handful of Delaware House of Representatives chose not to vote as the measure passed in that chamber.\n\n\"My main concern is that I don’t pick up the paper tomorrow and read that we’re giving away more than we got,” said Rep. Mike Ramone, R-Pike Creek, before the vote.\n\nState officials said taxpayers will benefit because the swap mandates BPG build a public pavilion, restrooms, improved parking and a more welcoming entrance to Alapocas Run State Park, which is across the Brandywine from Bancroft Mills. In addition, by taking ownership of the river bottom alongside the mill, the state will be able to remove a dam that was once part of the mill complex and allow passage of American shad during their spring spawning run.\n\nBPG benefits because the state property being transferred is contiguous with the former mill property it owns and will be the site of one of four apartment buildings the group wants to build on the ruins of Bancroft Mills, which was ravaged by a fire in November. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.\n\nScroll the image below to see what the state is getting and what it is giving up.\n\nThe measure passed without opposition in the Delaware Senate with Sen. Harris McDowell, D-Wilmington North, calling it a \"win, win.\"\n\nThe state initially bought the parcel being traded away for $350,000 in 2000 to provide an entrance into Alapocas Run State Park, the state's premier rock climbing spot. But the parcel is awkwardly shaped, makes for a poor entrance and contains a former mill building that is in \"horrible shape,\" said Matt Chesser, Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control environmental program administrator.\n\n\"It is pretty useless to us,\" said Delaware State Parks Director Ray Bivens of the parcel being given up.\n\nThe two properties were not subject to a formal appraisal, but Chesser said the additional improvements \"far outweigh even the initial cost of (the state's) piece of the property.\"\n\nSTORY: Abandoned Bancroft Mills in Wilmington burns\n\nSTORY: Land swap proposed for Alapocas park\n\nMichael Hare, executive vice president for BPG, said the improvements that come along with the swap will cost at least $600,000 on top of the value of the land the group is transferring.\n\nThe pavilion will be located across the footbridge entrance into the Alapocas park where a rusted train platform now sits. Hare described the bathroom and pavilion as \"immediate projects.\"\n\nThe group also will create a landscaped entrance to the footbridge that leads into the park in addition to improving and maintaining an existing public parking lot near the park. Those changes will come as the group builds the apartment development, Hare said.\n\nApproval from the Legislature – and eventually Gov. John Carney – gives DNREC and BPG the ability to enter into a contract with more specific timelines for the amenities, Hare said.\n\nState Rep. Gerald Brady, D-Wilmington West, said the entrance will be an improvement to the tucked away path into the park from the mill side of the river. He added the swap is \"a benefit for all\" and will allow BPG to move forward with its project.\n\nLast week, BPG started demolition of what remains of the mill. The land began housing a textile manufacturing business founded by Joseph Bancroft in the 1830s. The existing buildings date from the 1920s and have been vacant for years.\n\nOver the years, portions of the mill, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places, were subdivided and made into waterfront condominiums to the east BPG's property.\n\nHare said what remains of the former mill will be demolished over the next six months to make way for a $70 million apartment project known as Rockford Falls.\n\n\"We are trying to preserve elements, but as people recognize it now, none of those buildings will remain,\" Hare said.\n\nOriginally, the company sought to preserve at least portions of what is referred to as the Bluestone building, a 250-foot-long structure facing the Brandywine. But that building saw some of the most significant damage in the fire and will be razed along with the rest of the mill, Hare said.\n\nHare said the company is considering ways to pay \"some architectural homage\" to the site's history as part of the four multistory apartment buildings that will be built on the footprint of mill along the Brandywine.\n\nIn all, the development will include roughly 346 units. Hare said the fine design details are still being developed.\n\nHare described the apartments as \"luxury.\" Rent will be comparable to the company's most expensive units along the Christina Riverfront — around $1,300 to $1,400 for a single-bedroom unit.\n\nSTORY: Bancroft Mills still smoldering, one week after fire\n\nSTORY: Raw video: Bancroft Mills devastated by fire\n\nBPG currently has 1,135 apartment units in the city with another 354 under construction, Hare estimated.\n\nNo commercial development will be part of the project. Up the hill from the mill property, the group plans to sell lots for a total of 32 townhomes that will be accessed from Riddle Avenue.\n\nBoth the apartment and townhome parcels were rezoned in August last year.

The river can take care of itself — locals just have to pay to use it.\n\n\"It's just a place to get out to nature when you're so close to the city,\" said lifelong Wilmingtonian Sean Sweeney. \"I didn't know there was a lot of cost associated with it other than general park maintenance. I saw they redid the raceway, which was needed because the walls were falling apart and that dam never really was functioning. I use to swim in the river. I probably shouldn't haven't have, but did. I've always used the river, and I hope they always maintain it.\"\n\nThe Brandywine river winds in from southeastern Pennsylvania across the Delaware state line, and near its mouth once was the site of the New Sweden colony established in 1638. The 20-mile waterway lends its name to the Sept. 11, 1777, Battle of Brandywine, which took place in Pennsylvania and was the longest single-day engagement of the Revolutionary War.\n\nVIDEO: Water flows through icy Brandywine River\n\nSTORY: Del. test cases - When lead is in your water\n\nIts place in the region's history has been essential and sometimes frustrating, such as its role in providing water to DuPont's gunpowder mill in the 1800s but also creating 25 flood events since 1946 when records began to be kept. Today its continued usage still requires work.\n\nThe city only now is completing a $7 million project to renovate the raceway that runs a mile's length down the river inside the city. That yearlong project — which lined the old ditch with reinforced concrete — was designed to re-line the raceway to mitigate leakage problems which had been wasting water drawn from the river for treatment at two plants.\n\n\"We were getting a lot of leakage through the old stone walls and the mortar joints. What we did was make a major improvement in terms of making new walls to contain all that water so we're not wasting any water as a result of taking it from the Brandywine,\" said Wilmington Commissioner of Public Works Jeff Starkey. \"We only want to take out as much as we can use. If we're leaking, we're over-utilizing the river which we don't want to do, particularly in the summertime when it really gets low.\"\n\nA few years ago, a portion of the river's stone retaining wall collapsed because of the crumbling infrastructure of an abandon raceway. Repairing it was a joint project between the city and state parks systems which cost Wilmington about $45,000.\n\nThe recent raceway reconstruction gave Public Works the opportunity to make improvements to the Brandywine Membrane Filtration Plant. Public Works installed new walls and feed lines at a cost of around $700,000.\n\nA pumping station farther upriver has covered the uptake from the river while the raceway and treatment plant were closed for repair. The raceway currently is active, but water isn't being drawn from it for residents' taps.\n\nSignage along the riverbanks through the city remind residents the bacterial content of Brandywine makes its water unsafe for swimming, let alone drinking. That makes essential water quality testing — directly from the river, at the treatment plants and from people's homes.\n\nBill and Kathy Bailey just moved from Bear to a new home minutes outside Wilmington city limits, and already they've made walks along the river a twice-daily ritual. But they've seen the signs and they know the river's purpose and said they only hope the aesthetics of the creek are matched by efforts to make it drinkable.\n\n\"Personally, I wouldn't want a repeat of Flint, Michigan, and I think they need to do everything they can do and have to do as far as water treatment,\" Bill Bailey said. \"The Cuyahoga River outside of Cleveland got set on fire. I certainly don't want that here.\"\n\nRaw water testing is done daily once the water enters the filter plant, Starkey said. Staff goes out into the watershed for testing once a month at seven sites along the river, four on the Brandywine and three were the Brandywine and Christina River merge.\n\nSTORY: Wilmington Public Works: Our water gets a clean bill of health\n\nVIDEO: Wilmington expects new water regulations following flint, Michigan\n\n\"Our biggest concern is upriver what's happening. We don't control what happens in Pennsylvania,\" Starkey said. \"Any development that is sending stuff into the river, we have to treat that water in order to drink it. Any development in Pennsylvania is out of our control, and farms, things of that nature, sending runoff into the river.\"\n\nThe non-profit Partnership for the Delaware Estuary pushes Wilmington to invest in the river's health and spends where it can with federal grant money, but Executive Director Jennifer Adkins said their efforts have to go beyond state lines because of the city's downstream location.\n\n\"It is challenging for a city like Wilmington, and they're certainly not alone,\" Adkins said.\n\nPhiladelphia has similar challenges with the Delaware River, and she said most cities divided by running water face costly economic and environmental challenges. Adkins' organization drives educational efforts in Wilmington, such as its annual Earth Day events aimed at teaching residents about the impact of their pollution on local waterways.\n\nThat outreach extends to politicians in multiple cities across three states, Adkins said, and that revolving door requires constant intervention.\n\n\"There are always new people coming into the mix,\" Adkins said. \"It definitely is a constant need, but you hope there always are more people who'll get on board.\"\n\nMost of Delaware's state-controlled parks include some body of water, whether it's a river, beach or pond. Superintendent for Wilmington State Parks Susan Staats said rivers like the Brandywine don't significantly trouble budgets.\n\nIt's even been 20 years since the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control has had to take erosion control measures, which back then took the form of creek bank stabilization work. Other than that, she said they simply avoid mowing grass too close to the bank to maintain a vegetative buffer.\n\nTrees that come down and clog the river are her best example of an exception to that rule and clearing them generally is a cost shared between agencies, such as obstructions catching at the base of bridges, which fall under the auspices of the Delaware Department of Transportation.\n\n\"It's a natural-flowing river. I'm not going to sit here and say we do anything special as far as the management of the stream bank. For the most part, we leave it to its natural state,\" Staats said.\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at (302) 324-2785 or aduvernay@delawareonline.com.\n\nThe Brandywine\n\n20.4 miles long\n\nTributary of the Christina River\n\nThe region's earliest European settlers landed near the mouth of the Brandywine in March 1638.\n\nThe Battle of Brandywine was fought near the creek at Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania, in September 1777.\n\nWater from the Brandywine was critical to the DuPont gunpowder mill in the 1800s.\n\nBrandywine Park landmark finally restored", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2015/10/28/brandywine-zoo-break-ground/74767714/", "title": "Brandywine Zoo to break ground on 'Eagle Ridge' Thursday", "text": "Brittany Horn\n\nThe News Journal\n\nThe Brandywine Zoo's bald eagles and river otter exhibits will get some special attention Thursday, as zoo officials break ground on the start of new renovations to the park habitats.\n\nThe improvement plan for \"Eagle Ridge,\" the area where the otters and eagles are kept, includes the construction of a \"fully accessible path through the hilly, multi-story area at the back of the zoo,\" connecting visitors to a bridge that overlooks the exhibits, the state Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control announced Wednesday.\n\nThe groundbreaking will take place at 10 a.m. Thursday at the zoo along North Park Drive in Wilmington.

He died at 12:30 p.m. Sunday at MD Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas in Houston, Woodbridge football coach Jed Bell confirmed.\n\nThe four-year starter piloted the offense and rushed for a 13-yard touchdown in the Blue Raiders’ 33-9 victory over Wilmington Friends in the D-II title game on Dec. 1 at Delaware Stadium. He was diagnosed with an advanced stage of kidney cancer in April.\n\nHAYNES A STANDOUT PLAYER:Woodbridge has total trust in its four-year starter at quarterback\n\nOne of his kidneys was removed during surgery in May at Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia. Additional surgery was required at the Nemours/Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children in Rockland, as the cancer had spread to other organs.\n\nIn early June, Haynes traveled to MD Anderson in Houston for treatment that included clinical trials. Haynes had a rare renal cancer that was sickle cell-related.\n\nBut before that, on June 2, Haynes graduated from Woodbridge. It was a moving scene inside the stadium where Haynes heard cheers louder than those his football exploits elicited.\n\nHe had arrived in a wheelchair, but wanted to walk across the football field to the podium. So he asked Bell, school’s Dean of Students, to accompany him.\n\n“It was special, to say the least,” said Bell, who had been an assistant before succeeding Ed Manlove as head coach after last season. “I didn’t realize people would be so inspired by it.\n\n“The original plan was I was just going to push him across the field to the stage and they were going to come down and give him the diploma. In the morning, Troy said, ‘I want to prove to everybody I can do this.’\n\n“That’s kind of the kid he is. There wasn’t a dry eye in the house.”\n\nMORE ON HAYNES\n\nHAYNES AND HIS COACH: QB built special bond with Jed Bell\n\nFIGHT LIKE 4: The football community rallied around Haynes\n\nEAGLES HOST HAYNES: The Eagles gave dozens of tickets to Haynes and invited him on the field and into the locker room for a preseason game\n\nBLUE-GOLD THOUGHTS:Support for Haynes lifts stature of DFRC All-Star game\n\nHaynes wore No. 4 for the Blue Raiders, and in April a GoFundMe online fundraising account was established to help with his medical expenses. Within days, “Fight Like 4” became a rallying cry around the state, with more than $45,000 being raised.\n\nDonations came from individuals, couples, families, businesses, schools, churches, fire companies, civic organizations and, especially, sports teams throughout Delaware and beyond.\n\nAmong the high school football teams that contributed were those from Friends, Sussex Tech, Indian River, Delaware Military Academy and First State Military Academy.\n\nHaynes also played baseball and basketball at Woodbridge, and the baseball teams from Dover and Polytech, the basketball team from Delmar and the girls lacrosse team from Dover also were among those making donations.\n\nHundreds of “Fight Like 4” T-shirts and wristbands were also sold throughout the state as part of the fundraising efforts. Other donations were made through car washes, dinners and bake sales.\n\n“I just remember unloading like 800 T-shirts,” Bell said in August, “and thinking: ‘What are we going to do with all these?’”\n\nThey were all sold within three days.\n\n“People … during tough times they come together.”\n\nNot all contributions were of the monetary variety. Sussex Tech and Milford were among those that tweeted pictures of their baseball teams holding up four fingers in honor of Haynes.\n\nDuring the Woodbridge commencement ceremony, class salutatorian Brock Keeler, Haynes’ teammate and the state’s 2018 football Defensive Player of the Year, spoke to his class and those assembled with a large “4” written in black marker on his cheek.\n\n“I wanted to show Troy and the rest of the community that we’ve got his back with everything he’s going through, that we can support him in his fight with cancer,” Keeler said.\n\nWhile hospitalized at A.I. du Pont, Haynes was visited by Philadelphia Eagles linebacker Paul Worrilow, the former Concord High All-Stater and University of Delaware All-American. He also received videos from Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz and tight end Zach Ertz, and received an autographed football from Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson.\n\nThen the Eagles sent Bell 120 tickets to allow Haynes and his Woodbridge teammates to attend the team’s Aug. 8 preseason game against the Tennessee Titans at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\nHaynes, Bell and a few others were allowed on the field before the game. Haynes was given a green No. 4 Eagles jersey, with his last name on the back, which he wore over a white hoodie.\n\nHe and his teammates lined up along the sideline during the national anthem while the Eagles players stood behind them. Ertz came up to Haynes, shook hands, hugged him and talked with him briefly.\n\nHaynes was also able to meet Eagles players after the game. It was his first time at an Eagles game, the team he started liking as a kid when Michael Vick was the quarterback, “because we're both left-handed quarterbacks who like to run around a lot,” Haynes said with a laugh.\n\nHaynes was also able to attend the first Woodbridge football practice of the preseason on Aug. 12, before returning to Houston for additional treatment. During the practice, he thanked Bell for his fundraising efforts and the trip to the Eagles game.\n\n“A lot of that stuff wouldn’t have been able to happen if it weren’t for him,” Haynes said of Bell. “I’m really grateful for that.”\n\nAmong those particularly saddened by Haynes’ death was Joe McDonough, who operates the Andrew McDonough Foundation to support childhood cancer patients and their families.\n\n“I was devastated,” McDonough said of hearing the news Sunday from Bell. “I can’t say it was a tremendous surprise, but it’s just so shocking when a young person’s life is cut short.\n\n“When somebody is so vibrant and full of life like Troy was, like my son was, the contrast and the stark reality of what cancer does to some of our young people is just harsh and so sad.”\n\nIn January of 2007, Andrew McDonough was a Salesianum School freshman soccer player who had suddenly become gravely ill and diagnosed with AML leukemia after a weekend indoor tournament. His blood type – B positive – became a call to action as high school students began wearing T-shirts with “B+” emblazoned on the back. McDonough died July 14, 2007, but his legacy continues to make an impact through the foundation.\n\nThe statewide support McDonough saw the past five months for Haynes brought out the best in people and gave them perspective.\n\n“It seems odd to say that through such a tremendous tragedy so much goodness can come to the surface, led by a brave young man who fought so hard,” said McDonough, who had first visited with Haynes and his family soon after he was diagnosed last spring.\n\n“Everybody across the state regardless of your school affiliation rallied behind this young man and his family. You just had to pull for them. I’d like to believe that Troy and the impact he had on the world here made people put their lives in perspective.\n\n“We appreciate our family and our friends and these things that we have the opportunity to enjoy. It’s tremendously cruel and unfair, but the whole Haynes family has handled this with such courage and grace. It has been so impressive.”\n\nHaynes quarterbacked teams that went a combined 40-9 over his four years at Woodbridge. The 2016 Blue Raiders swept to a 13-0 record during his sophomore season, winning the school’s first state football championship with a 14-9 victory over Friends in the final at Delaware Stadium.\n\nHaynes scored the go-ahead touchdown on a 21-yard run late in the third quarter that night, but gave all the credit to lineman Shymere Vessels for his key block.\n\n“I saw one man to beat, so I ran as hard as I could to score a touchdown,” Haynes said. “I couldn’t ask for a better lineman. He works as hard as he can in practice and in the offseason, and it all paid off tonight.”\n\nHaynes continued to lead the Blue Raiders the next two seasons, capping his career with a second Division II championship last December.\n\nHe did it all in a calm, understated manner, a trait he displayed while speaking to The News Journal for a feature story heading into the playoffs last November.\n\n“I’m not really a hyper type of person. That’s just not me,” Haynes said. “I just let my play on the field show.”\n\nHaynes continued to motivate the current Woodbridge team. During the fourth quarter of the Blue Raiders’ Sept. 21 game at Friends, Woodbridge defenders could be heard chanting “Fight Like 4” after every play as the Quakers mounted their final drive.\n\nFriends earned four first downs, moving from its own 28 to the Woodbridge 29 before the Blue Raiders’ La-Tyron Stones intercepted a pass with 16.7 seconds left to preserve a 21-14 victory.\n\nWoodbridge (4-0) is home next Friday night vs. Archmere with kickoff scheduled for 7 p.m.\n\nAs the news of Haynes' passing spread Sunday night, many in the Delaware high school community shared memories and reacted on social media.\n\nContact Brad Myers at bmyers@delawareonline.com.

As an A. I. du Pont High freshman, Anderson won the Delaware Junior championship in 1977. He then won the Delaware Open a record seven times from 1983 through 2004 and is the only Delawarean to win the Philadelphia Amateur in its 125-year history. He turned pro in 1984 after graduating from the University of Virginia. Anderson won the 1991 Founders Club Match Play Championship at PGA National Golf Club. He joined the Ben Hogan Tour in 1992 and won the Variety Club Tournament of Champions of Philadelphia and was second in a playoff in the Fort Wayne Open. He also played on the Canadian PGA Tour in 1988 and qualified for the 1996 PGA championship at Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville. After resuming his amateur status, Anderson won the Delaware Amateur in 2005.\n\nKWAME HARRIS\n\nMajor college football coaches rarely visited Delaware until Harris emerged as a four-year, two-way standout on Newark’s teams from 1996-99, the last three being state Division I champions. He was first-team All-State three times and state Offensive Player of the Year as a senior, the first lineman so honored. Recruited by all of the country’s college football powers, the 6-foot-7, 320-pound Harris went to Stanford, where he was a three-year starter and Morris Trophy winner as the top Pac-10 offensive lineman as a junior, when he declared for the NFL draft. He was chosen 26th overall by the 49ers. Harris played in 86 NFL games with 55 starts in six seasons, the last with Oakland.\n\nCHRISTINA HILLMAN\n\nHillman won three discus and three shot put state outdoor titles at St. Thomas More, as well as Penn Relays and New Balance Indoor Nationals titles. At Iowa State, she was a seven-time All-American, highlighted by her 2014 indoor and outdoor NCAA championships in the shot put. She also won Big 12 indoor and outdoor shot put titles in 2014 and won indoors again in 2016. Hillman also placed second and fourth (indoors) and fourth and sixth twice (outdoors) at NCAAs. Her Iowa State shot put record (59 feet 6¾ inches) still stands, as does her 49-1 Delaware high school mark.\n\nRUTH LAJOIE\n\nLaJoie is a long-time official in field hockey and basketball who remains active in both sports and has advocated for women’s sports and those involved. She received the Delaware Pathfinder Award in 2006 from the National Association for Girls and Women in Sport and the DIAA State Award for Outstanding Service from the National Federation of High School Sports in 2017. The Penns Grove (New Jersey) High graduate played field hockey, basketball, lacrosse and tennis at West Chester and made the U.S. Reserve team in field hockey. She is a West Chester Athletic Hall of Fame inductee. LaJoie helped launch girls track and field as a high school sport in Delaware in 1971, created a pioneering sportsmanship award as head of the Delaware Board of Women’s Basketball Referees and, while coaching basketball at Conrad, successfully sought equal pay for coaches of boys and girls teams.\n\nRAY PEDEN\n\nThe captain of Salesianum’s first state championship swim team in 1973 went on to set 42 pool records at York College before becoming a champion open-water swimmer. With the Wilmington Aquatic Club as his base, Peden set the American record in the 26.2-mile marathon swim in 1984 and became only the second Delawarean, and 288th person, to swim the English Channel in 1986. In 2004, he was third (45-49 age group) in the U.S. Masters open water race. Peden was on the first relay team to swim from Cape Henlopen to Cape May across the Delaware Bay, was men's champ of the 12.5-mile Ocean Water Swim Around Key West, Florida, in 2010, and, five years later, was the 2.5-kilometer champion in the 60-64 age group in the U.S. Masters Open Water National Championships. The 29-year state police officer received the Order of the First State, Delaware’s highest civilian honor, in 1996.\n\nGINGER SMITH\n\nSmith, the first Delaware woman to run at the Penn Relays in 1964, then became Delaware’s first runner to qualify for the Olympic Trials that summer, doing so as a 16-year-old and making the finals in the 80-meter hurdles and 100-, 200- and 400-meter dashes. At the rain-soaked 1966 Penn Relays, she anchored Tower Hill to the high school championship in the 4 x 100-yard relay and won the 440-yard dash in 58.9 seconds. Later that summer, she led the Delaware Track and Field Club to the Middle Atlantic title by winning the 80 hurdles, 440 and 4 x 100 relay. Stanford University did not have a women’s track team when she was there so Smith competed for the Millbrae Lions Track Team and won the California 100-yard championship in 1967.\n\nJOE TIBERI\n\nTiberi had an amateur boxing record of 44-4-2 with 31 knockouts followed by a professional mark of 18-5-2 with 13 knockouts during the 1970s and ‘80s. He fought eight undefeated boxers, beating five. That included knocking out New England welterweight champion Fernando Fernandez at the Boston Garden and North Philadelphia's Mike “Youngblood” Williams on ESPN. After his competitive career, Tiberi became a successful trainer.\n\nCHARLES WAHLIG\n\nThe late Wahlig is the only triple USA Roller Sports Hall of Fame inductee, honored as an athlete, coach and for distinguished service. He began winning national competitions in the 1950s, taking USA National Senior Dance and National Speed Skating championships in 1957 and the Senior Dance title with a new partner in 1958. He was second in the World speed competition in New Zealand in 1959. He then coached over 1,000 state, regional, national and world champions after moving to Delaware in 1970 and was U.S. Pan American Games coach in 1979. He later served as president of USA Roller Sports, was on the USA Roller Skating Board of Directors and International Federation of Roller Skating Speed Skating Committee and owned three Delaware roller rinks.\n\nPAUL WORRILOW\n\nWorrilow was first-team All-State on both offense and defense, sparked Concord to the 2006 Division II state title and was state Defensive Player of the Year in 2007. But he received only Division II recruiting interest and, after one junior college season in which he red-shirted, walked on at the University of Delaware. Worrilow became a four-year starter and All-American linebacker for the Blue Hens, graduating fifth in UD history with 377 career tackles. Undrafted, he signed with the Atlanta Falcons in 2013 and made more tackles than all but four NFL players his first two seasons. Worrilow played in the Super Bowl for Atlanta and spent time with Detroit, Philadelphia and the Jets. In 76 career NFL games, including 52 starts, he made 415 tackles, forced four fumbles, recovered four and had two interceptions.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

But Still will enter the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame with two master’s degrees, a national reputation as an advocate for cancer-stricken families and, most importantly, a healthy daughter.\n\nLeah Still was 4 when, in June 2014, she was diagnosed with stage 4 pediatric neuroblastoma, a cancer that kills roughly half of the children whose bodies it invades. Leah underwent surgery, chemotherapy, a stem cell transplant, radiation treatment and other therapy.\n\nLess than a year later, with Still frequently putting his NFL ambitions aside to remain at his daughter’s bedside, doctors said Leah was cancer-free, though treatment continued. Now 11, she remains in remission.\n\n“She’s six years cancer-free,” Still said by phone from Houston, where he lives with Leah, who is in the sixth grade; wife Asha; and younger daughter Aria.\n\nStill earned a master’s degree in business administration at the University of Houston after having played his final NFL season in 2016 with the Houston Texans. He has now completed a second master’s degree in applied positive psychology at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n“The way I’m going to use my degrees,” he said, “is to help provide caretakers, institutions and communities with the tools to help children flourish. Children who are battling cancer are part of that community.”\n\nSPRING TAKEAWAYS: Defense comes out on top in Delaware Blue-White game\n\nBeing an advocate for families coping with cancer has been Still’s livelihood since Leah was stricken and will continue to be.\n\nWhen she was diagnosed, “There was no playbook,” Still said, using a football reference, for how a family was supposed to deal with such a difficult, multi-faceted challenge. He has made it his life’s work to help others through that challenging process.\n\nThat is done through his Still Strong Foundation, which raises funds to help families whose children are being treated for cancer. Still and Leah have also partnered with United Therapeutics to launch “Braving NeuroBLASToma,” which provides resources for those families.\n\n“Since we went public with Leah’s story,” Still said, “it’s been rewarding because I always wanted to give a purpose to our pain. To see the amount of families we’ve been able to impact just by sharing our story and then starting our foundation, and then making partnerships like we have with United Therapeutics, it’s been crazy.”\n\nStill, who grew up in Edgemoor, was a three-sport start at Howard. He was named the 2007 state Lineman of the Year in football, won two state indoor titles in the shot put and started for the Wildcats' basketball team.\n\nFAMILIAR TRANSFER: La Salle’s Ray joins friend on UD basketball team\n\n“One of the biggest takeaways from going to Howard was surrounding myself with amazing athletes,” said Still, adding that made him a more versatile athlete trying to keep up with them. “... I found lifelong friends during that time.’’\n\nHe never knew any former pro athletes to emulate, hatching his own ambitions “off of sheer willpower” and determination, he said.\n\nStill earned a football scholarship to Penn State and went on to be named a first-team All-American and Big Ten Defensive Lineman of the Year as a senior in 2011. He graduated with a degree in criminal law and justice.\n\nAfter being chosen in the second round of the 2012 NFL draft by the Bengals, Still was plagued by hamstring and other injuries in his NFL career.\n\nBeing with Leah through her medical battles kept him away from football, and the Bengals put him on the practice squad to start the 2014 season so he could continue to receive his pay while not having to be present for games. He was then elevated to the active roster and appeared in a career-high 12 games in 2014.\n\n“Of course, I wish this didn’t have to happen to Leah or my family,” Still said. “But it did so it was always trying to find the good, or recycle our pain in a way that could really make a difference.”\n\nSNOW DAY: Wilmington High great inducted to hall of fame\n\nLeah made it “out of the darkness” of cancer, Still said. Now helping others feel some rays of light are a daily goal.\n\n“I was just talking to a father not too long ago that an oncologist put me in contact with,\" Still said. \"Just being able to sit with him on Zoom for like an hour and be a sounding board, a safe space for him to be able to release some of the emotions he’s dealing with on how he can go about this journey with his daughter. If we didn’t go through it, I wouldn’t be able to provide that type of peace for families battling cancer.”\n\nStill and fellow inductees will be enshrined Thursday, May 12, during the 46th annual hall of fame banquet at the Chase Center on the Riverfront in Wilmington. Social hour and a silent auction will begin at 5:30 p.m. and be followed by dinner and the ceremony at 6:45.\n\nTickets are $65 with tables of eight available for $490. They may be purchased at www.desports.org/events. The deadline for reserving tickets is May 9.\n\nThe other 2022 inductees:\n\nJULIET BOTTORFF: The Tatnall School distance phenom was the state’s top cross-country runner from 2006-08 and was equally dominant on the track, setting nine state individual records while excelling at every distance from 800 to 3,200 meters and establishing a slew of state relay marks as well. That included anchoring Tatnall’s winning distance medley relay team in the Championship of America at the Penn Relays. Bottorff then went to Duke, where she was 2011 NCAA 10,000-meter outdoor champion and a two-time All-American at that distance as well as in the 5,000 and in cross country. Bottorff was two-time ACC champ in the 5,000. After college she was a top 10 finisher at several distances on the track and in road racing in U.S. championship events.\n\nKATELYN FALGOWSKI: Falgowski began playing for United States field hockey teams while attending St. Mark’s High, made her senior debut at age 17 in the 2006 World Cup and went on to become Delaware’s first and only three-time Summer Olympian, appearing in the 2008, 2012 and 2016 Games. She played in 261 games for the U.S. senior national field hockey team. Falgowski also starred at the University of North Carolina, where she won two NCAA titles, set a still-standing school record for career assists (83), was a two-time first-team All-American and National Player of the Year as a senior in 201. Falgowski sparked the U.S. to a gold medal at the 2015 Pan American Games and a fifth-place finish at the 2016 Olympics.\n\nDAVE FREDERICK: Frederick was an all-conference football and basketball player at Bishop Egan in Philadelphia’s Catholic League and then played football at Temple University. He was hired as a teacher and coach in 1975 at Cape Henlopen High and guided the Vikings to Division II boys track and field outdoor state titles in 1976 and 1978, the school’s first cross country state championship in 1977 and indoor track state championships in 1984 and 1985. He was state indoor track coach of the year in 1984 and 1985. In 1982, Frederick began writing a weekly column at The Whale, a Sussex weekly, then moved to The Cape Gazette in 1993. His often-humorous musings about the people, places and events in around Lewes have been a staple for area readers and Frederick also authored an anthology of short stories “In A Class By Myself.”\n\nJOE HOLLOWAY: Three years after his induction to the Harness Racing Museum and Hall of Fame, Holloway now joins his home state sports hall. The 1974 Salesianum School and 1978 University of Delaware graduate was introduced to harness racing in his early teens by family friend Rev. Francis Tierney, a part-time driver at Brandywine Raceway, and worked as a groomsman. By age 16 he was racing trotters himself and went on to become one of the nation’s most successful drivers and trainers. Holloway was U.S. Harness Writers Association Trainer of the Year in 1995 and trained seven Breeder’s Crown winners from 1994 through 2015, including three-time winner Jenna’s Beach Boy, which set several world mile records. Among the many other big winners he trained were, most recently, 2016 Horse of the Year Always B Miki. Holloway joins his brother Jack, the former William Penn High wrestling coach, as an inductee.\n\nBOB KING: King won state cross country titles as a Howard junior and senior over 2.3-mile Rockford Park loops in 1957 and 1958, his 10:48 time in 1958 not surpassed by anyone else for more than a decade. He was also state 880 and low hurdles champion in track to spark Howard to three New Castle County and state championships. He then starred at Morgan State University, where he captained relay teams that prevailed at major meets throughout the northeast, including the Penn Relays and Millrose Games. King later returned to Howard as coach, guiding the Wildcats to boys and girls state titles before becoming an administrator and principal. The 3:14.2 his 1984 Wildcats ran at the Penn Relays remains the state 1,600-meter relay record. In 2001, King revived the dormant Wednesday night summer youth developmental track meets at Baynard Stadium that were later renamed in his honor.\n\nKHADIJAH RUSHDAN: The St. Elizabeth High graduate was the first Delaware high school athlete in any sport to be named first team All-State five times, doing so from 2003 through 2007. Rushdan was state Player of the Year three times and sparked the Vikings to the 2007 state championship as a senior. She averaged 11 points, three steals and a team-leading six assists for the U.S. gold medalists at the 2006 FIBA Americas Under-18 Championship. Rushdan graduated with a state record 2,464 career points and was named a McDonald’s and Parade All-American. Rushdan then starred at Rutgers, where she was first-team All-Big East as senior, played in a school record 135 games and scored 1,288 points. Rushdan had a brief pro career before going into coaching.\n\nBOB SHILLINGLAW: Shillinglaw coached an NCAA record 654 lacrosse games while serving as University of Delaware coach for 37 seasons from 1979-2017 after a three-year stint at Massachusetts Maritime. Shillinglaw guided the Blue Hens to 15 conference titles and six NCAA Tournament berths, including the 2007 Final Four. His 310-303 record at Delaware makes him one of just two college coaches to win 300 games at one school. Shillinglaw was national Coach of the Year in 1979 and 2007 and conference Coach of the Year five times. He was also head coach for Team USA when it downed Canada in the inaugural World Cup of Lacrosse in 1999. Shillinglaw was also instrumental in lacrosse’s growth in the First State, which had just two boys high school teams when he arrived and this spring has 40. He established the Delaware Lacrosse Foundation Regional Chapter in 1980 and assisted with starting the Delaware Youth Lacrosse Association, serving as its president for 37 years and creating its Hall of Fame.\n\nGENE THOMPSON: Thompson was boys basketball coach at Wilmington High from 1976-77 through 1998-99, after which the school closed. He guided the Red Devils to the 1978, 1983 and 1988 state championships. His teams included seven first-team All-State players, five second-team picks and three state Player of the Year selections. Thompson also advocated tennis as a youth sports activity and received the U.S. Tennis Association’s National Community Service Award in 1998. Thompson was state Coach of the Year in basketball (1978), tennis (1978) and track and field (1994), when his Red Devils were Division II state champions. He returned to his native Virginia in 2005 to coach men’s tennis at Virginia State University and was also an assistant women’s basketball coach and served as interim men’s coach.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

In some cases, the restaurant — or food truck — serves ethnic food; in others, terrific interpretations of classic dishes.\n\nMost restaurants featured on the show are independent and all feature a menu that is, for the most part, made from scratch. Some are diners, many are dives and, occasionally, a surviving drive-in, complete with trays that attach to the car window.\n\nAt each stop, Fieri spends time in the kitchen, watching the chef prepare one of the specialties of the house.\n\nIn its 25 seasons on the Food Network, Fieri and his red '67 Camaro convertible have managed to visit over 450 restaurants in North America. He's also taken the show to Europe and, most recently, traveled to Cuba to showcase some of its most interesting restaurants.\n\nRelated:Is Mardela's Ernie Adkins worst cook in America?\n\nBut never the 302 area code. In fact, Delaware, is one of the few states not ever featured on the show.\n\nThe omission could not be because the First State lacks worthy candidates — certainly a number of them would meet the show's criteria. Perhaps it is because the producers are unaware of the culinary nirvana that lurks within Delaware's boundaries, and just over the border in Maryland. So, it might be appropriate to suggest some stops along the way, should Fieri decide to visit.\n\nThe possibilities are plentiful, among them: A Cajun restaurant in a strip mall, a roadside spot serving killer breakfast sausage in its Elvis room and, appropriately, a plethora of wonderful seafood houses in Kent and Sussex counties.\n\nThe eateries might not exactly fit the label of a diner, drive-in or dive, but are still some of the best lower Delaware has to offer.\n\nPo'Boys Creole and Fresh Catch; Milton\n\nOwner and chef Michael Clampitt graduated from culinary school and soon embarked on a successful career — working for others. But he was itching for independence and, when an established Cajun restaurant in Milton became available, he seized the opportunity.\n\n\"I decided, I could make this happen,\" he said.\n\nIndeed, he has.\n\nLEARN MORE:Po' Boys chef serves slice of New Orleans in Milton\n\nSince opening for business in January 2014, the restaurant has grown in popularity because of Clampitt's ability to produce authentic New Orleans style cuisine, including andouille sausage gumbo, jambalaya and a tasty crawfish étouffée along with other southern specialties.\n\nAnd, if you have room, you can top off your meal with a beignet for desert.\n\nEverything on the menu is made from scratch and, after a visit to New Orleans, Clampitt decided they had captured the essence of Cajun cuisine.\n\n\"I wanted to make sure we were doing it right and we were,\" he said.\n\nCustomers certainly agree, given the mealtime crowds.\n\n\"Best I've had since I visited New Orleans,\" said Po' Boys regular Paul Schroeder.\n\nClampitt's restaurant, located in a non-descript building that also houses a dollar store and Mexican market, seats less than 30 and is often full at meal time.\n\nThough he's often urged to expand, Clampitt has resisted because the manageable size of the restaurant allows him to spend time with his family.\n\n\"I have been tempted (to expand) but haven't done it,\" he said. \"Plus, I am really enjoying what I have here.\"\n\nHis alternative: Po'Boys now has a food truck to take its cuisine on the road.\n\n\"Plus, it helps get our name out there,\" he said.\n\nHelen's Famous Sausage House; Smyrna\n\nIn 1983, Helen Achenbach decided to open a small restaurant, choosing a location on busy Route 13 north of Smyrna. The prime menu feature was pork sausage, made according a generations-old family recipe.\n\nToday, the tiny restaurant typically has lines of customers waiting to get in: it only has about 20 seats, most of them in a room filled with Elvis memorabilia.\n\nSausage sandwiches have two sizeable links on a roll, with peppers, onions and cheese optional. So, how good is Helen's? In a 50 state survey, Food Network Magazine said it had the best breakfast in Delaware.\n\nThe restaurant opens at 4 a.m. and closes when the sausage runs out.\n\n\"Truckers love this roadside eatery for its hours,\" said the Food Network piece.\n\nThe restaurant is cash only. Sign in the window: \"This is not Burger King.\"\n\n\"We come here at least once a month and have been coming for years,\" said Tom Lauppe of Middletown, who was enjoying sausage and coffee in the Elvis room recently with two other retired military buddies.\n\n\"Yup, we need our sausage fix,\" said Tom Kelly of Saint Georges.\n\nTaco Reho (food truck); Rehoboth Beach\n\nBilly Lucas worked at upscale restaurants from St. Croix to Las Vegas and even catered for rock stars before the lure of the beach brought him to Delaware, where he had vacationed and worked summers at Nage.\n\nHis return to Delaware vision was culinary on wheels. Outfitting a well-worn Stroehmann Bakeries bread truck with a complete kitchen, Taco Reho was born two years ago. Now, the truck is usually parked on Coastal Highway, next to Big Chill Surf Cantina and it offers an array of fresh tacos, burritos and quesadillas.\n\nTony Kornheiser, the American sportswriter, radio and TV talk show, has even given Lucas' truck his stamp of approval.\n\n\"I think I just fell in love,\" Kornheiser said, of the fish tacos\n\nRELATED:Tony Kornheiser falls in love in Delaware\n\n\"Ninety-five percent of what's on this truck is made from scratch,\" Lucas said.\n\nAnd at least one prominent local chef thinks that Lucas has created a gem.\n\n\"I think this is a unique culinary destination,\" said Sean Corea, executive chef of Fork & Flask at Nage.\n\nSambo's Tavern; Leipsic\n\nIt's only open seasonally but the restaurant, perched on the banks of the Leipsic River, has been serving steamed crabs and awesome crab cakes for over 50 years. One blogger said it was one of a dozen restaurants in Delaware \"you have to visit before you die.\"\n\nNASCAR drivers agree because it is not uncommon to see racers and their families in Sambo's when races are held at nearby Dover International Speedway.\n\nMatt's Fish Camp; Bethany Beach\n\nBefore Matt's Fish Camp was Matt's Fish Camp, it was a popular locals hangout, a small beach shack that served breakfast and lunch.\n\nLocal fisherman would sit at the counter, drink coffee, read the newspaper and buy bags of ice before heading a mile or so north toward the Indian River Inlet for a day out on the water.\n\nWhen Matt Haley, later founder and president of SoDel Concepts, bought the building in 2010, he decided he wanted to pay homage to its colorful history.\n\n\"It still very much looks like an old, Sussex County beach shack,\" said Mike Dickerson, vice president of SoDel Concepts, an award-winning hospitality group, which also owns eight other restaurants, a catering company and food truck.\n\nRELATED:Matt’s Fish Camp hires chef, turns page after founder's death\n\nInside, the restaurant is homey and comfortable yet retro, with wooden chairs, a stripped down bar and a casual vibe. The restaurant's decor and menu have a strong New England influence, with a southern, Sussex County twist.\n\n\"It's coastal comfort food,\" he said.\n\nThe homemade menu features items like New England clam chowder, made-to-order thick cut onion rings, oyster po boys, lobster rolls, colossal crab cakes, buttermilk fried chicken and pan seared day boat scallops.\n\nThe restaurant offers a daily happy hour from 3-6 p.m., in addition to fresh specials, and traditional, local favorites, like chicken and dumplings and pretzel salad — made with strawberries, cream cheese, melted butter and crushed pretzels.\n\nThe restaurant is open, and busy, year-round, especially during the summer season. Reservations for the 66-seat restaurant are highly recommended.\n\nGrove Market Restaurant & Smokehouse; Bishopville\n\nHidden among the trees on St. Martins Neck Road, is a funky little eatery called Grove Market.\n\nLocated in Bishopville, Maryland, just over the Delaware line, the restaurant serves a mix of folks from both states.\n\nThe place has been around for nearly three decades, thriving off of exceptional customer service, a fresh, rotating menu and word of mouth — the owners have never advertised. However, it appears as if that hasn't posed a problem for the 12-seat restaurant.\n\nGrove Market has earned a solid reputation as a hidden gem among locals, so popular, in fact, that it's not uncommon for it to be booked up to two weeks out, so a reservation in advance is highly recommended.\n\nThe Baltimore Sun called Grove Market one of the area's top restaurants, due to its, \"genuine and old-fashioned seafood meals.\"\n\nSome of the local favorites include the fresh scallops, flounder and tuna pate, all served on an array of colorful, mismatched dishes. Most of the menu is New Orleans inspired, with a heavy Delmarva influence.\n\nThe restaurant will close for the season in a few weeks, reopening in May for dinner at 5 p.m., daily.\n\nTaqueria La Sierra; Selbyville\n\nTaqueria La Sierra is not much to look at from the outside.\n\nActually, it looks exactly like what it is: a Hispanic general store, for lack of a better description. The tienda up front sells everything from clothes, shoes, gum, DVD’s, music, candles and more. There is also a grocery store, with its own butcher shop, that offers nearly every ingredient a Food Network recipe might call for, in addition to gourmet cheeses, candy, chips, hard-to-find spices and ice cream.\n\nOh, and there's also a barber shop.\n\nNeedless to say, the aisles alone offer a fun, ethnic experience. But the true joy is in the back of the building. That's where the restaurant Taqueria La Sierra, one of Delaware's, \"best kept secrets,\" is hidden.\n\nThe dining room area is uncomplicated, featuring a few booths, an order counter, and a mounted flatscreen TV that plays Latin music videos and soap operas.\n\n\"A lot of people come here when they’re working around. They really like it,\" said owner Diana Barrientos. \"We try to keep everything like they would make back home.\"\n\nAs promised, the menu is as authentic as they come, made from old family recipes and fresh ingredients.\n\nOn it are options like flaky tamales, fajitas, enchiladas and nine different varieties of tacos, some commonly found here in the U.S., such as pollo (chicken), carnitas (deep fried pork) and barbacoa (shredded beef).\n\nREAD MORE:Get an authentic taste of Mexico\n\nOthers aren’t so familiar, such as chivo (goat), pastor (marinated pork with pineapple), cabeza (beef head) and tripa (beef tripe).\n\nThe Taqueria is owned, run by and frequented by the local Latin community, but some of the staff speaks a little English. Don’t let that deter you. The Taqueria La Sierra is a can’t miss.\n\nSouthern Grill; Ellendale\n\nOwner Ron White grew up in Jacksonville, Florida, graciously eating whatever was put on the table.\n\nHis family was not rich, but wealthy in the sense that they had their own vegetable and herb garden, and the tools to hunt for food.\n\n\"We ate anything that walked, swam or crawled,\" he said.\n\nWhen White opened his own restaurant in Ellendale in 2011, he made sure his menu featured the home-cooked, family recipes he grew up on.\n\nThe menu is made nearly entirely from scratch, featuring homemade barbecue, fried chicken, collard greens, mac and cheese, yams, fried cabbage, yeast rolls, corn pudding, crab cakes, broccoli, scalloped apples, cakes, pies and more.\n\n\"It's Southern-style cooking, with a Delmarva twist,\" he said.\n\nEvery Wednesday night from roughly December through the middle of March the Southern Grill also offers a Delmarva delicacy: muskrat.\n\nLEARN MORE:Muskrat: It doesn't taste like chicken\n\nThe swamp rats are broiled and flash-fried whole, and served either plain or smothered in gravy or barbecue sauce with two sides. Southern Grill is one of the only restaurants around that offers the local heritage dish, and sells more than 40 muskrat dinners a night, he said.\n\n302-537-1881, ext. 207\n\nOn Twitter @hcarroll_1\n\nFacebook.com/byhannahcarroll\n\nOn Instagram @thesassy_banana\n\nWhere to find the restaurants\n\n•Po'Boys Creole and Fresh Catch; 900 Palmer St., Milton.

Its annual cookie walk on Dec. 10 begins at 9 a.m. and goes \"until the cookies are gone.\" Fill a box of Christmas cookies for $14.\n\nMore:9 Delaware New Year's Eve bashes to ring in 2023 include EDM concert with Firefly alum\n\nEpworth United Methodist Church at 19285 Holland Glade Road, near Rehoboth Beach, holds its cookie walk at 9 a.m. on Dec. 10 and will continue while supplies last. The price for cookies is $10 per pound.\n\nThe cookie walk at St. Peter’s Episcopal Church in Lewes will be in the parish hall at the intersection of Second and Mulberry streets. The doors for the Dec. 17 cookie walk open at 8:30 a.m. and run until 11 a.m. or until the cookies run out. Masks are encouraged and gloves will be provided. A limited number of people will be permitted in the Parish Hall to promote social distancing. Small containers are $10 and large containers are $15\n\n253 E. Main St., Newark\n\nBing's, an old-school bakery founded in 1946, is a short hike from the University of Delaware's main campus. The downtown Newark landmark is the state's longest-running bakery. Russell and Selena Bing began running it in 1946. The Guzzi family took over the business from Selina Bing in 2005.\n\nBing's has a wide variety of holiday confections ranging from Danish wreaths and Christmas trees to delicate petit fours to cakes topped with snowmen.\n\nA longtime favorite seasonal confection is the Yule Log ($29.95). You can get a chocolate cake filled with mocha buttercream or a sponge cake rolled around vanilla buttercream.\n\nIt serves 10 to 12 people, but there are never any leftovers.\n\n1910 W. Sixth St., Wilmington\n\nWilmington's Little Italy neighborhood has been home to Papa's Food Market since 1927.\n\nPapa's Food Market was founded by Pietro Papa, who was known by his affectionate nickname \"Peter Pop.\" Members of the Papa family are no longer behind the counter, but the store traditions continue on thanks to manager Luis Pelaez, whose stepfather Umberto Gomez bought the property and business in May 2019.\n\nThe store still carries traditional holiday Italian staples like anise oil for pizzelle cookies, panettone, sweet loaves of bread, and confections such as panforte.\n\nPelaez has an Italian culinary background. For eight years, he worked with the Martuscelli Restaurant Group at its La Casa Pasta restaurant in Glasgow and at the Chesapeake Inn Restaurant in Chesapeake City, Maryland. He was a prep cook and did catering for the restaurants.\n\nIf you're looking for old-school Papa products, like its liver sausage, don't worry, it's still produced in-house.\n\nProduction of the seasonal sausage usually begins after Halloween and it tends to be available through the end of January.\n\n318 Eighth Ave., Wilmington\n\nStanding in line at Delaware Provision Company Inc. in Wilmington’s Browntown neighborhood is a longtime Delaware tradition.\n\nThe business opened in 1976 as a wholesale supplier by Kathleen and Sam Lavery and in 2000, their nephew William Hayes acquired the company. Hayes kept the old-school products but now also offers new dishes and full-service catering.\n\nCustomers, especially those of Polish heritage, travel here for their holiday food must-haves: Homemade fresh and smoked kielbasa, stuffed cabbage known as golabki, sauerkraut, a blood sausage known as holiday kiszka and puffy loaves of babka and chrusciki, the Polish cookies sometimes called \"Angel's wings.\"\n\nThis is not a business that hides in plain sight. You really have to know where you’re going. Finding the tucked-away warehouse at 318 Eighth Ave. can be like going on a treasure hunt. Customers have to navigate winding one-way streets to get to the good stuff.\n\nLatkes and doughnuts for Hanukkah\n\nChabad of Southern Delaware is hosting its annual menorah lighting at 5 p.m. Dec. 18 at the Baywalk in Dewey Beach off Del. Route 1 (It's behind the Hyatt.) Admission is free to the event which includes hot latkes, doughnuts, festive music, and even a fire juggling performance.\n\nLatkes served with sour cream and apple sauce, braided challah, and other foods traditionally served during Hanukkah also are always available at the three Rosenfeld's Deli locations in Rehoboth Beach, Bethany Beach and Ocean City, Maryland.\n\nContact Patricia Talorico at ptalorico@delawareonline.com and follow her on Twitter @pattytalorico", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/04/robot-hostesses-veggie-booze-civil-death-news-around-states/39654047/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPrattville: A sheriff says jail inmates were caught making some truly “disgusting” alcohol out of fermenting vegetables. News outlets report it turned up when dozens of officers conducted a shakedown for contraband Monday at the Autauga Metro Jail. Autauga County Sheriff Joe Sedinger says it was the first time he’d seen vegetables being used to make alcohol. He says the jail stopped serving inmates fruit years ago because they made wine with it. Sedinger says searchers also found an electronic cigarette altered to be used as a tattoo gun, as well as dice fashioned from the plastic ball that’s in bottles of roll on deodorant. The sheriff says inmates won’t be punished for the contraband. He just wants to remind them that he’s watching the jail closely.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Wildlife officials and residents of a remote island are cheering the death of a wild rat. A Norway rat that likely was carried by ship was spotted last year on St. Paul Island in the Bering Sea. The Anchorage Daily News reports the island is an internationally known breeding habitat for millions of birds that lay eggs on rocks and tundra. Wildlife officials say an infestation of rats could devastate the bird population. A local wildlife conservation agency and federal officials assembled a team that set up baited rat traps. The rat avoided capture for 10 months but was found dead Sunday by a visiting bird watcher. Monitoring for other rats will continue.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Six itsy-bitsy black-footed ferrets have been born through the Phoenix Zoo’s recovery program. The litter from first-time mom Mandolin arrived two weeks ago. Mandolin will care for them for the next few months at the zoo, which has one of only six breeding facilities in the world for this particular endangered species. In the fall, specialists will determine which of the ferret babies – known as kits – will go to breeding facilities to become future parents and which will be released into the wild. Kits from this litter that are ultimately released will first go to the National Black-footed Ferret Conservation Center in Colorado to prepare them for survival in the wild. Over 400 black-footed ferrets have been born at the Phoenix Zoo under the recovery program.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Finance officials say the state has ended the fiscal year with a $295 million budget surplus, nearly $74 million of which will go toward highway needs. The Department of Finance and Administration said Tuesday that the state’s net available revenue collection for the fiscal year totaled $5.9 billion, $426.5 million higher than the previous year and $231.2 million above forecast. Arkansas already had a $64 million surplus that was included in the state’s budget. The fiscal year ended Sunday. Twenty-five percent of the surplus will be transferred to the state Department of Transportation, while the rest will go toward reserve funds for other needs. The department says the state ended the year above forecast because of high growth in individual and corporate income tax collections.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: A gigantic mansion built in 1991 for the late producer Aaron Spelling and his widow has been sold for $119.75 million. The Los Angeles Times says the sale that closed Tuesday is the highest home price ever in Los Angeles County. Set on 4.7 acres in Holmby Hills, the 56,600-square-foot chateau is the largest home in the city. The unidentified buyer was represented by a Beverly Hills real estate firm. Spelling produced such TV series as “Charlie’s Angels,” “Dynasty,” “Beverly Hills 90210” and “Melrose Place.” After his death in 2006, his widow, Candy, sold the mansion for $85 million to Petra Ecclestone, daughter of Formula One billionaire Bernie Ecclestone. She made modifications, and the home now has 123 rooms, including 14 bedrooms and 27 bathrooms.\n\nColorado\n\nSteamboat Springs: Wildlife researchers say an elk traveled more than 250 miles across the state to give birth. The Steamboat Pilot and Today reports Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials placed a collar on the elk cow known as R190 near the town of Maybell in late March. Officials tracked the elk as she zigzagged east and crossed the Continental Divide. She gave birth last month in North Park, a large mountain valley in north-central Colorado. State wildlife researcher Nathaniel Rayl says the distance the elk traveled was significant, but elk don’t really have average migration distance. They may travel great distances one year but stay put the next. The elk was equipped with a GPS collar as part of a study tracking the survival of elk calves.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStafford Springs: A recently reopened mill in the state is helping the military bring back old-school Army uniforms by providing the high-quality woolen fabric used in their manufacture. American Woolen Company Inc. in Stafford Springs is gearing up to provide high-end wool to make the Army green uniforms that will be worn by soldiers and officers and that echo similar outfits worn by the military more than a half-century ago. Jacob Harrison Long, chief executive officer of the company, says the idea of the new uniform is to boost morale by harkening back to a time when military men and women were “very well-dressed.” Long said he bought the 19th-century mill in 2014 after the previous owner closed down and has hired back many of the previous owner’s workers.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: At the Robot Captain Crabs Cajun Seafood & Bar, new hostess Charlotte seems eager to show customers to their seats. “Please follow me to the table,” she says in a polite, girlish voice. Dressed in a purple uniform with a hat that looks like one worn by an old-fashioned bellhop, Charlotte waits until patrons are seated to say their server will be with them shortly, and she hopes they enjoy their meal. If someone bumps into her, Charlotte says “excuse me” and rolls out of their way. Charlotte, who seems like the perfect employee, is a robot, one of five now “working” at the new restaurant near Newark, where futuristic sci-fi meets rustic seafood. Owner Guang Chen says he believes the establishment could be one of the first in the nation to use robot servers and hosts. Though humans also greet customers and take orders, there are two “hostesses” and three “food runners” that can spin in circles and “talk” to customers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: City officials are pushing back against an unsubstantiated claim by President Donald Trump that he orchestrated a purge of homeless people there to shield visiting foreign dignitaries from having to see them. The claim was among a series of falsehoods leveled by Trump in recent days as he has seized on the homeless epidemic. He has also claimed, wrongly, that homelessness is a novel issue and suggested that local officials have deliberately exacerbated the problem for political gain. “It’s a phenomena that started two years ago. It’s disgraceful,” Trump told Fox News host Tucker Carlson. He then suggested he had done something to end homelessness in Washington, even though thousands still sleep on the streets of the nation’s capital and in its shelters, a claim that left D.C. officials baffled.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Shores: A Miami-area couple whose front-yard vegetable garden prompted a six-year legal battle with their village has held a ceremonial replanting of veggies under a new law legalizing such gardens statewide. Hermine Ricketts and husband Tom Carroll planted jalapenos, green bell peppers and other vegetables this week when the bill went into effect. Miami Shores previously made such front-yard gardens punishable by a daily fine of $50 on grounds they were unsightly and violated zoning codes. Miami Shores told Ricketts to remove her garden in 2013, prompting their lengthy lawsuit. An appeals court backed the village, but then the Legislature stepped in to legalize the gardens. Republican state Sen. Rob Bradley sponsored the bill.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The case of whether hackers may have tampered with elections in Georgia has taken another strange turn. Nearly two years ago, state lawyers in a closely watched election integrity lawsuit told the judge they intended to subpoena the FBI for the forensic image, or digital snapshot, the agency made of a crucial server before state election officials quietly wiped it clean. Election watchdogs want to examine the data to see if there might have been tampering, given that the server was left exposed by a gaping security hole for more than half a year. A new email obtained by the Associated Press says state officials never did issue the subpoena, even though the judge had ordered that evidence be preserved, including from the FBI. The FBI data is central to activists’ challenge to Georgia’s highly questioned, centrally administered elections system, which lacks an auditable paper trail and was run at the time by Gov. Brian Kemp, then Georgia’s secretary of state.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: Officials say the state’s last remaining native lowland bog is thriving again following a more than decadelong restoration effort. The Garden Island reports conservation groups have worked to restore native plants to the Kanaele Bog on Kauai after it became overrun with nonnative weeds and feral pigs. The Nature Conservancy signed a management agreement in 2003 and built a fence around 58 acres to keep out the pigs. They then pulled tens of thousands of weeds. The conservancy’s director of the Kauai forest program, Melissa Fisher, says the bog now has 95% plant coverage with 97% native plants. The bog is home to unique flowering plants, native grasses and sedges, as well as Hawaii’s only carnivorous plant – the mikinalo.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials are revising a 1999 plan as part of a strategy to recover endangered white sturgeon in the Kootenai River in northern Idaho and western Montana. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is taking public comments through July 29 on the draft recovery plan revisions released last week. The document reflects advancements in understanding of white sturgeon and changes that have taken place over the past two decades to help the fish rebound. Sturgeon have been around since the dinosaurs. They have armorlike scales and in the Kootenai River system have been recorded up to 10 feet long. But the population has struggled since the completion of Libby Dam in Montana in 1974, which altered the natural cycle of the river.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state saw an eighth straight year of record tourism growth in 2018, attracting more than 117 million visitors in 2018. U.S. Travel Association numbers released by the state this week show visitors to Illinois spent $41.7 billion over the previous year. That’s a more than 5% increase in visitor spending over 2017. Tourism generated $3.3 billion in state and local tax revenue, a more than 7% jump. Tourism was a boon jobs-wise too. The state says travel and tourism support more than 342,000 jobs last year. That’s up 5,200 jobs from 2017. The Illinois Office of Tourism credits the record numbers to successful marketing efforts. Gov. J.B. Pritzker called tourism “an integral part of our state’s economy.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State wildlife officials say an Asian carp species that poses a serious threat to mussel populations is advancing closer to the state’s waterways. The Indiana Department of Natural Resources says two black carp were captured last month in the Ohio River about 10 miles downstream of Indiana’s state line. Black carp feed on mollusks. They pose a serious threat to Indiana’s native mussel species, many of which are listed as endangered or of special concern. Black carp are native to Asia. They’ve been moving throughout the Mississippi River basin since escaping from captivity decades ago. The DNR asks anyone who catches a suspected black carp to keep it, note its location, cool it on ice once it’s dead and report it to the DNR by calling 1-866-663-9684.\n\nIowa\n\nNewton: Biofuel plants in the state are adding milkweed and other native plants to their properties so monarch butterflies can fuel up during the annual migration. WHO-TV reports that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service says the monarch butterfly could warrant protection if something isn’t done to boost its population. That’s why the Iowa Renewable Fuels Association started its project called the “Monarch Fueling Station” in December 2018. The Renewable Energy Group plant situated on the northeast side of Newton is one of the latest ethanol and biodiesel plants to join the cause. “It’s a little bit of work to begin with, and it’s a small amount of maintenance,” plant manager Phil Abels says. But “the value that will be received goes way beyond any effort.”\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: Drivers can no longer be charged with a crime for refusing a field sobriety test under a new state law. The Wichita Eagle reports that a change in state law that took effect Monday means police can’t ticket suspected drivers for not taking one. But refusal to comply comes with a yearlong license suspension, as long as the longest suspension for failing a breathalyzer or blood test. Drivers who refuse to be tested can still be prosecuted for a DUI based on other evidence. The decision to strike the law making it a separate violation comes amid court rulings on whether motorists driving on streets and highways give implied consent to sobriety tests.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A fire destroyed a massive Jim Beam warehouse filled with about 45,000 barrels of aging bourbon, sparking worries that runoff whiskey seeping into nearby waterways could kill fish. Firefighters from four counties responded to the blaze that erupted late Tuesday. It sent flames shooting into the night sky and generated so much heat that firetruck lights melted. The warehouse was a total loss. Looking to reassure consumers of Jim Beam bourbon, Beam Suntory indicated it amounted to a drop of the iconic brand’s total aging inventory. No injuries were reported, Woodford County Emergency Management Director Drew Chandler said. The fire was contained but was allowed to burn until midday Wednesday, he said. State officials warned recreational users on the Kentucky River that runoff would result in water discoloration, foaming and an odor.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: State wildlife officials are upping the price they’ll pay hunters who catch a large aquatic rodent known for harming marsh ecosystems. Louisiana’s Department of Wildlife and Fisheries has increased the bounty from $5 to $6 after fewer nutrias have been caught than in the past. Nutrias are webbed-toed, buck-toothed rodents that are in between the size of muskrats and beavers. They’re known for nibbling on tree roots and causing erosion and damage to marshes. The Times Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports this damage has been increasing in recent years and affecting southeastern Louisiana most. Officials hope the greater sum will encourage more hunters to kill nutrias during the 2019-20 season. All they have to do to cash in is bring in the tails as proof.\n\nMaine\n\nHarpswell: Some parts of the state are finding relief from a rash-causing species of moth because of the cool and rainy spring. The browntail moth’s caterpillar is an invasive nuisance that causes itchy rashes and respiratory problems. But the Portland Press Herald reports damp weather in the late spring helped spur the spread of a fungus that kills the caterpillars. Scientists predicted earlier in spring that browntail moths would be especially bad this year. But the Maine Forest Service said Tuesday that field surveys have shown collapses of the pest due to the fungus. Such collapses have happened in communities including Arrowsic, Camden, Harpswell and Turner. The caterpillar’s high season is usually mid-May through June.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: A local minister is a top finalist in a nationally recognized singing competition. Joshua Copeland, 37, a praise and worship leader and minister at United Faith Churches of Deliverance, joins 19 other talents from across the nation and world on BET’s gospel-themed show, “Sunday Best.” Joshua is also the son of Bishop George Copeland. The premier of the show’s ninth season Sunday marked its return to television following a four-year hiatus. In a recorded interview, Copeland opened up about his experience growing up as a pastor’s son and being bullied in school because of his weight. “Being a PK has its challenges. Everybody feels like a pastor’s kid can do no wrong. He’s supposed to be the perfect kid. I talked to my parents a lot about it, and they always tell us, ‘We’re not perfect, so we’re not expecting you to be perfect, but we’re going to strive to do what God calls us to do,’ ” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nAquinnah: The Martha’s Vineyard estate of former first lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis is on the market for $65 million. Red Gate Farm in Aquinnah was a sheep farm and hunting cabin when Kennedy Onassis bought it in 1979. She added a more than 6,000-square-foot, five-bedroom main residence and a two-story, four-bedroom guest house. The estate, which includes more than a mile of private beachfront, also has several other buildings. The property is listed by Christie’s International Real Estate. It has been maintained by Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of Kennedy Onassis and President John F. Kennedy. Caroline Kennedy said in a statement that the estate was a perfect expression of her mother’s “romantic and adventurous spirit,” and she hopes that “a new family will treasure this place as we have for three generations.”\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Contemporary Motown artist Ne-Yo will join the Temptations, Martha Reeves and others from the label’s classic era during a concert marking the 60th anniversary of the recording company. The Motown Museum has set Sept. 22 for Hitsville Honors: Celebrating Berry Gordy & 60 Years of Motown, at Detroit’s Orchestra Hall. Others performing as part of the tribute to the company and its founder include the Four Tops, Mary Wilson, Big Sean and Kem. The concert is part of a three-day celebration dubbed Motown 60 Weekend. Other events include the Motown Gospel Concert on Sept. 21. The label paved a way for the Motown Museum to be built in Detroit. It was the first headquarters where Stevie Wonder, The Supremes, Miracles and others recorded before Motown decamped to California in 1972.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Norie, a 2-year-old golden retriever, is the newest staffer at the Ramsey County Attorney’s Office. She’s the latest in more than 200 so-called courthouse dogs around the country that are being used to help take some of the stress out of the place and help people work through the legal system. Tami McConkey, director of the victim witness and community services division for the prosecutor’s office, tells Minnesota Public Radio News that dogs help calm people down and help give them confidence to report what happened. Norie is believed to be the first courthouse dog in the state. Ramsey County Attorney John Choi says prosecutors and others understand the justice system can add to the trauma of crime. He says Norie may help ease that burden.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal lawsuit says the state is violating free-speech rights by banning makers of plant-based foods from using terms such as “meatless meatballs” and “vegan bacon.” The lawsuit was filed this week by the Plant Based Foods Association and the Illinois-based Upton’s Naturals Co., which makes vegan products and sells them in many states, including Mississippi. It was filed the same day the Magnolia State enacted a new law that bans plant-based products from being labeled as meat. A similar lawsuit was filed in Missouri last year by the Oregon-based Tofurky Co., which makes vegetarian food products, and The Good Food Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for alternatives to meat. A Missouri law made it a misdemeanor to label plant-based products as meat. Meat producers have been pushing to protect meat terminology.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The Kansas City Public Library has forgiven $250,000 in overdue fines and will no longer charge late fees on any materials. The Kansas City Star reports that the changes were announced last Friday at the library’s southeast branch. Mayor-elect Quinton Lucas said the decision was made to give more people access to the city’s libraries. About 9,000 patrons with suspended library cards will regain access to library resources. Library director Crosby Kemper III says the fee change will increase children’s use of the library system. More than 450 libraries in the U.S. have done away with fines, but Kemper says the Kansas City Public Library is the first major library in the region to do so.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: A nonprofit foundation that raises money for projects in Yellowstone National Park has about $4.35 million in debt. John Walda, interim CEO of Yellowstone Forever, told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle the organization made faulty revenue projections when it was formed by combining the Yellowstone Association and the Yellowstone Park Foundation in 2016. Yellowstone Forever invested in staff, buildings and technology based on the inaccurate projections. Yellowstone Forever has provided $18 million to the park for projects but will reduce its cash support and hold some jobs open as it works to get back on better financial footing. There have been layoffs, and several employees have resigned, including CEO Heather White last month.\n\nNebraska\n\nBeatrice: A biodiesel plant is ceasing production in this southeast Nebraska city. Flint Hills Resources announced this week that the Duonix Beatrice plant is being idled indefinitely. The Beatrice Daily Sun reports the plant processes corn oil and greases into biodiesel. The prices of soybeans used by most other biodiesel producers are so low that the Duonix plant was put at a competitive disadvantage. Flint Hills does not expect those conditions to change. Duonix Beatrice began operation in 2016 and is a joint venture of Flint Hills Resources and Benefuel Inc. The plant was built in 2008 but wasn’t finished and never operated until purchased and refitted for biodiesel production. Officials say severance packages will be offered to the fewer than 40 plant employees.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Nevada Highway Patrol says passengers must be alive in order to be counted as occupants in cars using the high-occupancy vehicle lane. The reminder was prompted by a traffic stop Monday involving a hearse traveling on the carpool lane on Interstate 15 in Las Vegas. A trooper pulled over the hearse that was transporting a dead body. The agency says the hearse driver assumed the body in the back counted toward the requirement of two or more occupants for the lane. The trooper let the driver off with a warning and advised him to move out of the lane. The agency says only living, breathing people can be counted for the HOV lane.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew Durham: Partnership efforts have resulted in the preservation of 2,000 acres overlooking Merrymeeting Lake as a community forest. The Birch Ridge Community Forest in New Durham rises over the lake with views of Mount Molly and Mount Bet. It filters clean water to the lake and Coldrain Pond. The forest offers 13 miles of trails for hikers, cross-country skiers, hunters and birders. And it offers critical habitat for wide-ranging species such as moose, bear, deer and bobcat. The forest’s protection was helped by donations from community members and the town; grants from the U.S. Forest Service and New Hampshire Land and Community Heritage Investment Program; and the state Department of Environmental Services. A community event celebrating the conservation is planned for July 13.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEast Rutherford: Officials have finally set an opening date for a massive retail and entertainment center in the Meadowlands. The long-delayed American Dream project will open Oct. 25. The announcement was made Wednesday by its developer, Triple Five. American Dream will feature 3 million square feet of retail, dining and entertainment, including more than 450 stores and restaurants. The project includes an amusement park, an indoor ski slope, an indoor ice skating rink, an indoor water park and more. The project has been plagued by financial problems since the first contract was awarded in 2003. The immense structure, once called “the ugliest damn building in New Jersey” by former Gov. Chris Christie, has sat unfinished between MetLife Stadium and the New Jersey Turnpike for years.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State health officials are predicting one of the worst mosquito seasons in decades thanks to wetter weather earlier this year. KOB-TV reports health officials believe the mosquito population and the threat of West Nile virus are on the rise as monsoon season approaches. Mark DiMenna of the Albuquerque Environmental Health Department says the city is preparing for a bad mosquito season, the likes of which they haven’t seen in 15 years. Standing water along arroyos, ditches, wetlands and even the side of the road is a breeding ground for mosquitoes. New Mexico’s largest city uses larval control through water management and source reduction and with the use of environmentally friendly, EPA-approved chemicals.\n\nNew York\n\nVernon: A key local official says hosting the Woodstock 50 anniversary festival on short notice “could pose a significant challenge.” A mass gathering permit application for the Vernon Downs harness track and casino in central New York was recently filed after operators of the original festival site pulled out last month. Oneida County Executive Anthony Picente released a statement Tuesday noting the challenge of preparing for the health and safety of residents and concertgoers with the event just over a month away. The Woodstock festival has faced a series of setbacks, including the losses of a financial partner, a production company and its original site. Vernon Downs has said it can host up to 65,000 people, far fewer than the 150,000 planned for Watkins Glen International.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Vehicle owners now have another option from which to choose when it comes to the state’s regularly priced license plate. The Division of Motor Vehicles began offering a third standard plate this week. Previously motorists could choose between the “First in Flight” background or the “First in Freedom” theme, which refers to pre-Revolutionary War events. Now they can pick a plate with the national motto “In God We Trust” at the top and the state motto “To Be Rather Than to Seem” near the bottom. A 2018 law directed that the DMV create the new option. The agency says current vehicle owners can request the new plate at no additional charge when they renew their car registration. They’ll pay a standard charge if it’s requested at another time.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nJamestown: The National Buffalo Museum says the herd’s white bull bison has died from injuries suffered in an accidental fall into a ravine. Dakota Miracle was 13 years old. The museum says the bison’s health was compromised due to a genetic condition resulting in lack of pigmentation. That caused Dakota Miracle to have poor eyesight, a factor believed to have led to his fall. NewsDakota reports museum board president Don Williams and executive director Ilana Xinos found Dakota Miracle deceased during a routine herd and pasture inspection. Dakota Miracle was the son of White Cloud, an albino bison that lived with the museum’s herd for almost two decades. The National Buffalo Museum’s mission is to educate the public on the cultural and historical significance of the American bison.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: If your summer plans involve traveling through the Buckeye State, and you’re still a fan of paper maps, it’s time you met Bruce Hull. He’s been injecting visual flair, handy information and a hidden bit of his own family history into Ohio’s road maps for almost two decades. Hull’s artistry has appeared on millions of maps helping drivers navigate the state, which has the nation’s fourth-busiest highway system. As a layout design artist with the Ohio Department of Transportation since 1989, Hull has creative control over the map’s look and feel. One year, his design resembled the front of a refrigerator packed with photos of Ohio attractions. He always works to make featured venues reflect the diversity of the state’s racial and ethnic groups; its rural, urban and natural landscapes; and its cultural and recreational offerings.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Medicaid agency is warning its SoonerCare members to keep current their address on file with the agency or risk losing their health care benefits. The Oklahoma Health Care Authority sent out a public reminder Wednesday of the new rule that was signed by Gov. Kevin Stitt last week. The agency says it intends to launch outreach efforts through social media and through outbound phone calls to SoonerCare recipients after hours and on weekends. Agency officials say the new rule is needed to comply with federal guidelines. But advocates for the poor have criticized the policy, saying low-income people move more frequently, and many members will be wrongfully cut from the programs. About 20% of Oklahoma’s population, more than two-thirds of them children, is enrolled in Medicaid.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Despite broad support, a measure that would put the state’s controversial jury system before voters died in the Oregon Senate during the final days of the 2019 legislative session. Oregon is the only state in the country that allows for convictions via non-unanimous juries in criminal felony cases. House Joint Resolution 10 would have put before voters on the November 2020 ballot a proposed change to the Oregon Constitution. If passed, it would have mandated that criminal jury verdicts be unanimous, as is the case with the federal government and all other 49 states. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that with the measure dead, the state’s legal community turns to the U.S. Supreme Court, which will take up non-unanimous juries during its next term.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf has signed legislation that his office says clarifies the options for whom school districts and private schools can hire as armed security guards, although Wolf’s administration says it bars districts from allowing teachers to be armed. The bill also expands training requirements for armed school officers. It says schools can hire armed security guards on contract, as long as they meet certain certification standards. It also expands the definition of a school officer to include a county sheriff or deputy sheriff. Wolf’s office says schools were already employing both. In a statement, Wolf says teachers cannot be considered security personnel and aren’t authorized to be armed in schools under any law in Pennsylvania. Most Democratic lawmakers opposed the bill, saying allowing more guns into school won’t solve school shootings.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The American Civil Liberties Union is challenging the constitutionality of a state statute that punishes inmates serving life in prison with “civil death.” The ACLU’s Rhode Island chapter filed a federal lawsuit Wednesday on behalf of two inmates. A spokeswoman for the Rhode Island attorney general says the office is reviewing it and can’t comment on pending litigation. Rhode Island is one of the few places where inmates serving life in prison are deemed dead, by state statute, with respect to property rights, marriage and other civil rights, as if their natural death took place when they were convicted. Most civil death laws in the United States have been repealed or successfully challenged in court. Most countries never adopted the practice. Rhode Island’s statute from 1909 is still enforced.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: The Greenville Zoo’s newest giraffe has arrived. Autumn, a female Masai giraffe, went into labor Sunday night and gave birth just before 10:30p.m., according to a release from the city. The giraffe was up and walking within an hour and nursing soon after, according to the release. The calf is a 6-foot-1-inch male weighing 165 pounds, the release says. The calf is expected to access the giraffe exhibit Wednesday with his mom. Kiden, the baby’s sister, will be allowed to join Autumn and the calf Thursday. Miles, the giraffe’s father, is separated from the family so the baby can bond with Autumn without interruption, according to the release.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A new state law effective this week eliminates the need for a permit to carry a concealed pistol. South Dakota is the 14th state to enact such a law for both residents and visitors. Pennington County Capt. Marty Graves tells KOTA-TV he thinks it’s a good thing for gun owners. Graves says it will lighten the work load for his office because it will no longer issue the permits and collect the fees. Before the new law took effect this week, people could be charged with a misdemeanor if they carried a concealed pistol or had one concealed in a vehicle without a permit.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Tennessee State Library & Archives has launched a digital project that uses pension records to map out where soldiers lived before and after the Revolutionary War. State Librarian and Archivist Chuck Sherrill announced the Patriot Paths online initiative at the National Genealogical Society’s recent annual convention. It helps researchers study migration patterns of soldiers born in the colonies and Europe who ultimately traveled to Tennessee. About 2,000 pension files exist for the thousands of veterans who came to Tennessee after the war. Most soldiers weren’t eligible for pensions until they were in their 80s, so it’s a smaller subset of those who served. Library workers used the records to find dates and places where soldiers were born, married, enlisted and died. The information was coordinated with GIS mapping.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A new law legalizing hemp in the state is creating problems for authorities that will likely cost millions of dollars to fix and has temporarily stopped the prosecution of some misdemeanor cases involving marijuana, hemp’s plant cousin. After the 2018 federal Farm Bill made hemp legal in the U.S., states like Texas passed legislation allowing farmers to grow it. Texas’ new law provides a specific definition of marijuana, based on its percentage of THC, the compound that gets users high. But before the new law, Texas authorities only needed to show the presence of THC in suspected marijuana. Officials say most Texas crime labs can’t test for exact amounts of THC. District attorneys in at least four Texas counties say they’ll stop accepting misdemeanor marijuana cases until the problem is fixed.\n\nUtah\n\nOrem: Several environmental groups are working together to shut down unauthorized trails and formalize new ones near a wildlife area in northern Utah. The Daily Herald reports dozens of volunteers gathered June 29 at the Timpanogos Wildlife Management Area in Orem to begin rehabilitating parts that have become overrun by unauthorized bike trails in recent years. Biologists have said urban development threatens habitats in the area used by deer and elk. Volunteers closed off switchbacks, broke up the soil to help vegetation grow and placed new signs directing people to designated paths. Some volunteers said they want the area to be sustainable for wildlife and trail users. The project is expected to take at least a year and will reduce total trail mileage from approximately 40 miles to 20.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont State Colleges System is planning for its future as it faces reduced enrollment, underfunding and other challenges and as a number of private schools go out of business. The Rutland Herald reports that a long-range planning committee is hoping to find solutions. It’s part of a project to keep the state colleges – made up of Castleton University, Community College of Vermont, Northern Vermont University and Vermont Technical College – thriving and relevant. The office of Vermont State Colleges Chancellor Jeb Spaulding released a report earlier this month that looked at reduction of population, the low amount of state funding, and the rise of large universities offering remote education at a lower cost, among other challenges.\n\nVirginia\n\nUpperville: Three new historical markers aim to remember the philanthropic efforts of Paul Mellon. Paul Mellon was heir to the financial and industrial fortune of his father, Andrew W. Mellon. He supported universities, civic improvement projects, conservation efforts and fine-arts institutions. The markers issued by the Virginia Department of Historic Resources were set to be dedicated Thursday in Upperville. One marker highlights Paul Mellon’s life and philanthropy. Another highlights Rokeby Stables, where Mellon bred and raised champion racehorses in Fauquier County. Mellon died in 1999. A third marker highlights the work of his first wife, Mary Elizabeth Conover Mellon, whose interests led to the founding of the Bollingen Foundation and publication of the writings of Swiss psychiatrist Carl Jung in English.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has voted unanimously to enable the construction of more and bigger backyard cottages in all neighborhoods while removing requirements that property owners live on site and provide off-street parking. The Seattle Times reports Councilmember Mike O’Brien and other proponents touted the new rules for accessory units passed Monday as a gentle and environmentally sustainable way to add living options in response to the city’s population growth. They say it will open up pricey neighborhoods. Proponents included urbanists, labor unions, homebuilders and the AARP. Critics of the new rules, led by the Queen Anne Community Council, warned about the changes allowing developers to replace modest older houses with up to three rental units. They say the plan would make Seattle’s low-density blocks less desirable.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice says the state collected more revenue growth this fiscal year than any other year in state history. The Republican governor announced in a news release Tuesday that general revenue growth hit $511 million in the fiscal year that ended Sunday. He says the figure is due to the state taking in high amounts of consumer sales, personal income, corporate net income and severance taxes. Growth in oil and natural gas sales, as well as “enhanced construction industry activities,” contributed to the total. Justice says last fiscal year’s revenue growth is one-and-a-half times the combined growth for fiscal years 2007 to 2017.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Scientists with the state Department of Natural Resources are searching for sick snakes. Agency biologists are looking for snakes infected with snake fungal disease. SFD has the potential to devastate snake populations because it prevents snakes from effectively feeding and drinking and causes extended basking periods, leaving snakes more vulnerable to predators. The disease has been confirmed in Buffalo, Crawford, Dane, Grant, La Crosse, Outagamie, Sauk and Trempeleau counties since 2011. DNR biologists are literally turning over rocks and logs in an effort to find infected snakes and put together a more complete map of confirmed cases. DNR officials are encouraging anyone who sees a wild snake to send photos to the agency and report any snakes with unusual lumps, lesions or scabs.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state’s first-quarter economic report shows a modest recovery, but the news came out just a day after the unexpected closure of two coal mines in Campbell County put nearly 600 people out of work. Chief economist Wenlin Liu said Tuesday that the state gained 4,400 jobs from January through March, but a lot of them are related to construction of oil and gas pipelines and wind energy projects and are therefore temporary. Liu says miners who lost their jobs with the closure of the Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr mines are entering a job market in need of workers, but the jobs don’t pay as well. The Gillette News Record reports a bankruptcy judge on Wednesday rejected a financing proposal to keep the mines open while owners restructured debt.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/04"}]}

Or want to rewatch your favorite one? You're in luck because it's National Cinema Day this Sunday, Aug. 27, and most theaters across the country are offering tickets for only $4.\n\n\"Building on the unprecedented success of last year’s inaugural National Cinema Day, the Cinema Foundation is calling on film fans across the country to gather for a national day to celebrate the magic of the movies on the big screen,\" said the National Cinema Foundation in a statement.\n\n\"The second annual National Cinema Day celebrates the power of movies to bring us all together, and discounted admissions for all movies at participating U.S. theaters in all formats (including Premium Large Format screens) will be no more than $4.\"\n\nHow many movie theaters will be part of National Cinema Day?\n\nApproximately 30,000 screens across 3,000 locations are expected to take part in the one-day event, according to The Cinema Foundation, the non-profit organizing the event. Popular cinema chains, including AMC Theatres, Regal Movies, and B&B Theatres have also announced their participation in the event and are offering discounted popcorn.\n\nTo buy tickets or see a list of participating theaters, visit NationalCinemaDay.org, Fandango or your local movie theater’s website or app.\n\nWhat movies will be shown in cinemas?\n\nSummer hits including \"Barbie,\" \"Oppenheimer,\" \"Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One\" and \"Blue Beetle\" are on the menu as well as new films opening this weekend like \"Gran Turismo,\" \"Golda,\" \"The Hill,\" \"Retribution\" and \"Bottoms\".\n\nRecent family hits like \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" and Disney’s \"The Little Mermaid Sing-Along\", and classic re-releases like \"Jurassic Park (3D),\" \"American Graffiti,\" \"Lady Bird\" and \"Oldboy\" are also part of the lineup. The $4 ticket will apply to all movies, screens and formats.\n\n\"One of the lessons we learned from last year is this became more of a family outing because of the pricing. So we are trying to put content out there that is more oriented to the families first,\" Tim Handren, the Chief Executive Officer at Santikos, a chain of cinemas primarily in the San Antonio area in Texas, told USA TODAY.\n\nThe event will also feature independent films and exclusive new content that can only be seen in theaters. A sneak peek of anticipated autumn releases is also expected to play before each screening.\n\nHow to watch:The 10 movies we're most excited to see this fall (hopefully)\n\nDoes National Cinema Day happen every year?\n\nThis is the second consecutive year theaters are celebrating National Cinema Day at the end of the summer and for good reason, given last year's roaring success. More than 8 million moviegoers were part of last year’s inaugural National Cinema Day, organized by The Cinema Foundation, a non-profit affiliate of the National Association of Theater Owners.\n\nThe one-day event, held at more than 3,000 participating locations with more than 30,000 screens, collected box office returns of $23.8 million dollars for the day – 8% more than the previous Saturday's sales – even with the discounted ticket price of $3, the theater group said.\n\n“Movies have the power to bring us together to share in the joy, the thrill and the magic of a great story told on the big screen,” said Michael O’Leary, President & CEO of the theater-owners group. “National Cinema Day is a celebration of movie fandom and of the uniting role that movie theaters play in our communities.”\n\nThis year's event is taking place on Sunday instead of last year's Saturday, and ticket prices have increased a dollar. The average movie ticket in 2022 cost $10.53, according to the theater group.\n\nThe 'Barbenheimer’ phenomenon:How a movie meme inspired the 'crazy, weird' double feature\n\nAfter last year’s National Cinema Day, in a Fandango consumer survey of more than 2,000 U.S. ticket buyers, participants noted the top five reasons they would likely buy tickets for the next National Cinema Day, including affordable pricing, ability to see a specific movie they’ve wanted to see, time with loved ones, being a big fan of a particular movie franchise, and fun activity for their weekend plans.\n\nAnticipation for the event\n\nAnticipation and hype for the event is building up, with cinema owners noting an increase in bookings and pre-sales for Sunday. Some cinemas like AMC Theatres and B&B Theatres have even added more shows for the day to accommodate an increase in viewership.\n\n\"The response has been really positive,\" said Elizabeth Frank, EVP Worldwide Programming and Chief Content Officer for AMC Theatres. \"Both in engagement and feedback on social media and also our theaters. You can feel people getting excited about the movies.\"\n\n\"I think it's gonna be a pretty big day,\" said Handren. \"We're seeing good early ticket sales for Sunday, based on early data.\"\n\nHowever, Handren believes that because National Cinema Day is on Sunday, it might not receive the same level of attention that last year’s Saturday event did.\n\n\"However, it will be a robust day for a Sunday, no doubt,\" he said.\n\n\"We've got ten times the pre-sales as we do on Friday or Saturday, which is unheard of. That's incredible,\" Chief Content, Programming and Development Officer of B&B Theatres Brock Bagby tells USA TODAY.\n\nGiving back\n\nCinema executives also view this event as a way to give back to the community and build stronger relationships with their audiences because the profit margin is slim, given the ticket price and concessions in snacks.\n\n\"We believe that this is an opportunity for us to welcome a lot of people and view it as a part of community engagement,\" said Frank. We're not seeking to do this as an opportunity to maximize revenue. It's good business and it's as much good community engagement as it is profit.\"\n\n\"What cinema is all about is to get people out and help them remember why this is a great family experience,\" said Handren. \"It's a great escape from some of the parts of life that are not that fun.\"\n\n\"We're we're not doing this to make money. We're actually doing this to remind moviegoers why they want to come back to the movies,\" he added.\n\nBagby said that the event is more about giving back and thanking customers, communities, patrons, and guests than a profit-making venture.\n\n\"[It is also] a way for some people that may not be able to go to the movies very often to experience any format, which I think is so exciting,\" added the B&B Theatres executive.\n\nAs for which movies are the most popular, all three cinema executives unanimously agreed that \"Barbie\" is taking the lead, along with other family entertainers like \"Blue Beetle\", \"Gran Turismo,\" \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\", and \"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\".\n\nThe 10 must-see movies of summer:From 'The Flash' and 'Little Mermaid' to 'Indiana Jones'\n\nWhat is The Cinema Foundation?\n\nThe Cinema Foundation is a non-profit dedicated to promoting essential cinema exhibition industry by developing future diverse workforces and growing moviegoing communities through research, education, and philanthropy.\n\nSince March 2022, the foundation is dedicated to shaping the future of the great collective experience of moviegoing and the cinema industry.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2023/10/12/taylor-swift-eras-tour-movie-premiere/71145770007/", "title": "Taylor Swift movie premiere was an Eras Tour party: Inside AMC ...", "text": "LOS ANGELES – There are movie premieres here where the red carpet is the star event.\n\nBut this is Taylor's version.\n\nThe world premiere of Taylor Swift's \"Eras Tour\" movie on Wednesday night was all about what was inside a very common AMC movie theater in an outdoor mall that was closed for the day. And Taylor Swift herself, sitting in theater No. 2, seat F8, at the center, next to her tour backup singers and dancers, and actress Julia Garner.\n\n\"Hi, so you're stuck with me because I'm going to, like, sit with you and watch this thing,\" Swift said, dressed in a strapless light blue Oscar de la Renta high-low gown before the movie began. \"But before we do that, I want to say thank you for wanting to spend your evening with me. ... I've always had fun doing this. I can't believe music is my career; that's crazy to me. I've always loved it. I've never had a fraction of the amount of fun I've had on the Eras tour before, ever.\"\n\nThe theater was filled with fans – some of whom her team invited via direct message on X, formerly Twitter – and celebrity Swifties including Simu Liu, Maren Morris and Adam Sandler and his wife and two daughters, as well as Swift's own camera crew.\n\nTaylor Swift 'Eras' movie review:Concert film a thrilling revisit of her live spectacle\n\nSwift visited each theater to thank guests before coming to the spot where she would watch her movie.\n\n\"I want to say, I have friends in this room, I have my amazing backing vocalists in this room. ... We pranced on that stage grinning because of what met us on the other side and that was you, how much you cared about it. That was absolutely everything,\" she said. \"So, I think you will see that you absolutely are main characters in this film because that's what made the tour magical, that's what made the tour different from anything I've ever done in my life.\"\n\nShe continued: \"Your attention to detail, your preparation, your passion, your intensity, you cared so much about these shows and that made all the difference for us. It made us want to add even more shows. I just have never felt this way about anything. I am so proud.\"\n\nJust before the movie started at 8:30 p.m., she said: \"I think I will just watch it with you now. So let's have a blast, guys. Thank you for coming.\"\n\nGuests ate popcorn out of commemorative Eras Tour tins and Reese's Pieces and Red Vines from a complimentary elaborate candy bar decorated with fresh flowers flown in that morning for the display. An AMC employee stopped by Swift's seat and poured glasses of white wine.\n\nThe movie replicated Swift's popular and sold-out concerts, with an intimacy few felt in the stadium tour. The movie was like a close-up and clearer version of a stadium Jumbotron, with details from Swift's ballerina flats to her multicolored fingernails featured.\n\nMoviegoers at the premiere captured the concert feel with sequined jackets, sparkly boots, pastel pouf dresses and friendship bracelets.\n\n'Eras' tour movie etiquette:How to enjoy the Taylor Swift concert film (the right way)\n\nThroughout the movie, Swift bopped her head with the songs, pumped her arms, mimicked her onscreen dance moves and smiled almost nonstop. Watching her was as fun as watching the movie.\n\nIt was also a movie where participation felt almost mandatory.\n\n\"It's so wild. Watching her is making this so much fun,\" said Arianna Trinidad, a Swiftie from Phoenix who attended the world premiere of the concert tour, and was at the theater for the movie's world premiere. \"I can't believe I'm here, two rows behind her. I think we're both having the same amount of fun.\"\n\nAs the screen showed \"Look What You Made Me Do\" from the \"Reputation\" era, Sandler - sitting just behind Swift in his trademark Hawaiian polo shirt – bounced in his chair and clapped, one of Swift's vocalists held her hands up in the shape of a heart, and Swift vibed to the beat.\n\nBefore the movie began, Swift took photos with fans and made a video with Beyoncé in an empty theater. She posted on her Instagram: \"She's been a guiding light throughout my career and the fact that she showed up tonight was like an actual fairytale.\"\n\nIt was unclear if Beyoncé, who opens her own movie \"Renaissance: A Film by Beyoncé\" with AMC in December, stayed to watch the movie. She was not in the theater with Swift.\n\nWhile Swift's appearance at the movie was expected, most people in theater No. 2 hadn't expected to watch the movie with her. Their eyes gazed from the screen to Swift, while they joined her in singing everything from \"Cruel Summer\" to \"Midnight Rain.\"\n\nBy the end of the two-hour and 48 minute movie, the crowd was standing and dancing to its final song, \"Karma.\" Swift took selfies – with a flash – with her dancers, singers and Garner.\n\nThe credits included cute outtakes from the tour – and some names spelled out in friendship bracelet style. After the movie, Swift took photos with fans and posed while Sandler snapped a photo of her with his daughters before she slipped out a door at the back of the theater.\n\nThe movie was scheduled to open on Friday.

This month, it's Taylor Swift.\n\n\"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" comes to movie theaters everywhere on earth Oct. 13 — and the movie is drawing a lot of interest, and a lot of ticket sales.\n\nIn a year that has already had a few \"event\"-type movie releases — especially \"Barbie,\" which grassroots passion and audience connection made 2023's top-grossing movie — the Swift movie is generating similar vibes.\n\n“I’m looking forward to that joyful energy,\" said Cara Ogburn, artistic director of Milwaukee Film. The nonprofit organization owns the Oriental Theatre, which is showing \"The Eras Tour\" on two of its three screens this weekend. \"‘Barbie’ was sort of that same way. It seems like people were just so happy to be there, be together and have an experience together.”\n\nAccording to AMC Theatres, which is distributing the movie, more than $100 million in advance tickets had been sold worldwide for the \"Eras Tour\" concert movie's first weekend, Variety reported last week.

With the movie playing at 12 of the Milwaukee area's 13 first-run movie theaters — and on multiple screens in most of them — there are seats aplenty for opening weekend.\n\nBut it's complicated.\n\nIn the Milwaukee area, and likely elsewhere, ticket sales for \"The Eras Tour\" had been heaviest on Friday the 13th — for the uninitiated, 13 is Swift's favorite number.\n\nAs the distributor for the show, AMC Theatres, including AMC Mayfair Mall in Wauwatosa, got a few days' head start selling tickets. As of Wednesday, all 10 of AMC Mayfair's Oct. 13 screenings were listed \"almost full\" on AMC's ticket website; seven of the eight screenings at the next nearest AMC theater, in Johnson Creek, were completely sold out that night.\n\nREVIEW:Taylor Swift 'Eras' concert film is a thrilling revisit of her live spectacle\n\nAt Marcus Theatres, many Friday-night screenings were nearly sold out; the few remaining seats at the chain's Milwaukee-area theaters for screenings before 8 p.m. were in the front rows. A Marcus spokeswoman said the company has been adding showtimes to keep up with demand.\n\nSimilarly, at ACX Cinema at Bayshore in Glendale, the theater's 6 p.m. screening on Oct. 13 was nearly sold out, as of Wednesday.\n\nBut Swift and Company threw a wrench into all this on Wednesday night. She announced online that, because of all the opening-night demand, they were adding screenings on Thursday night, Oct. 12, as well as more screenings on the original opening night. Many theaters allow advance-sale ticket cancellations within an hour or less of showtime, so some fans might opt to swap their Friday tickets for the new \"opening\" night on Thursday.\n\nSo: If you still haven't bought tickets but want to see it the first couple of days, check the theater websites again to see what's available.\n\nOn the other hand, if you can wait until after opening night — whether that's Thursday or Friday — tickets are readily available at all of the Milwaukee-area theaters showing \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" on both Saturday and Sunday.\n\nIs the Taylor Swift concert movie only showing this weekend?\n\n\"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" is not your typical movie release. It's only showing on weekends — after this weekend, it's booked in many participating theaters from Thursday through Sunday for the following three weekends.\n\nThe unusual release pattern poses some challenges for movie theaters, which have to find other fare to fill slots on the days when Swift's movie isn't playing.\n\nSo if you can't get to theaters this weekend, you'll have to wait a few days.\n\nMusic icons:Taylor Swift praises Beyoncé's 'generosity' after she attends 'Eras Tour' movie premiere\n\nHow much are tickets for 'Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour'?\n\nHow much power does Taylor Swift have in the entertainment-industry ecosystem? She's even charging her own ticket prices for her concert movie.\n\nNot counting fees and other theater add-ons, ticket prices are $19.89 — echoing Swift's birth year, and the title of one of her biggest albums — and $13.13, reflecting her favorite number.\n\nAdvance tickets are available at theater websites and at the box office.\n\nWill there be anything special in theaters for opening weekend of the Taylor Swift concert movie?\n\nOn opening night, participating Marcus Theatres will have a friendship bracelet-making station (it's a Taylor thing), will be handing out official mini-posters (while supplies last), and will have Swift-themed cocktails and official Swift popcorn tubs and cups.\n\nBut the biggest special effect at opening-weekend screenings of \"Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour\" will likely be Swift's fans. If the attendees at this summer's concerts are any indication, the audience will bring as much energy to the experience as what is on screen.\n\nWhile theaters often ask audiences to keep silent during the movie, \"The Eras Tour,\" like the concert tour it's documenting, is certain to elicit much joyful noise from moviegoers. The Oriental is \"very welcoming\" for the anticipated singalongs at each screening, Ogburn said.\n\n“That energy seems to be something we all are leaning into,” she said. “It feels a lot like a film festival, so it’s something we’re very familiar with.”\n\nRELATED:What's new at Milwaukee movie theaters this week", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/01/18/national-popcorn-day-2024/72257298007/", "title": "National Popcorn Day 2024: The movie theaters offering free ...", "text": "With National Popcorn Day arriving soon, deals on popcorn are popping up at movie theaters across the U.S.\n\nPopcorn, which originated thousands of years ago with the Aztecs among consumers, has been part of the moviegoing experience for nearly 100 years, according to The Popcorn Board.\n\nIt's true, we do like our popcorn, especially when catching a flick.

The hope was that the so-called apes who are fans of AMC (AMC) on Reddit’s WallStreetBets subreddit and other social media sites would eat up both stocks like a carton of buttery popcorn.\n\nAMC even made the ticker of the new shares “APE” in honor of its Reddit devotees.\n\nBut since AMC split into two stocks, the combined value of AMC and APE is hovering near $14. (AMC is trading for around $8.60 and APE is at about $5.20) Do the math and that’s a nearly 25% drop in just the past few weeks. The price of one AMC plus one APE share is also about 50% below where AMC’s stock began 2022.\n\nWhat’s the problem? It seems no amount of promotional hype from AMC CEO Adam Aron can overcome the fact that the economics for theaters are terrible – no matter how often he notes how much cooler AMC is than other theaters and how it has this army of loyal individual investors.\n\nAMC rival Cineworld, which owns US-based chain Regal, just filed for bankruptcy. Shares of other movie theater owners, such as Cinemark (CNK), IMAX (IMAX) and Marcus (MCS), are all lower this year by about 10% to 15%. That’s roughly in line with the S&P 500’s 16% drop.\n\nSure, it’s true that AMC is in better financial shape for now than competitors. AMC reported at the end of the second quarter that it had $1.17 billion in cash and other liquidity on its balance sheet, a fact that Aron proudly noted in a tweet Wednesday following the news of the Cineworld bankruptcy.\n\n“Cineworld/Regal just filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for its theatres in the U.S.and U.K. Fortunately, AMC is in a very, very different situation — because retail investors embraced us and let us raise boatloads of cash. Thank you to retail! You really did save AMC,” Aron wrote.\n\nMovie fans also seem willing to go to theaters for truly big blockbuster film events like the long-awaited “Top Gun” sequel, the latest in the Jurassic World and Marvel franchises or animated fare for the kids. The box office in the US has rebounded from the depths of 2020 and 2021.\n\nBut theaters now face stiff competition from streaming video. Hollywood is shifting more movies to platforms like Disney+, Netflix (NFLX), Paramount+, Comcast (CMCSA) owned Peacock and HBO Max, which like CNN is part of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nThe studios also offer a deluge of original, binge-worthy TV shows on these and other services such as Amazon’s (AMZN) Prime Video, Apple TV+ (AAPL) and Hulu, which is also controlled by Disney (DIS).\n\nAdd all that up and it’s not hard to see why AMC remains in a somewhat precarious financial position. The company is expected to report a loss of about $638 million this year. That is down from a loss of nearly $1.3 billion in 2021 though. And sales are expected to surge nearly 70% to $4.3 billion.\n\nAMC, to its credit, is taking bold steps to try and boost sales (and its stock price) further though. The company is now selling its signature popcorn outside of theaters through partnerships with retailers. AMC also made the bold move to invest in a gold and silver mining company earlier this year.\n\nAt the time, Aron said the decision to buy a stake in Hycroft Mining was an example of how AMC is “thinking creatively and boldly about our future,” adding that Hycroft is “just like AMC of a year ago…It, too, has rock-solid assets, but for a variety of reasons, it has been facing a severe and immediate liquidity issue.”\n\nBut others in the industry seem envious of the fact that AMC has become a pop culture phenomenon.\n\n“While Cineworld would, of course, have welcomed the liquidity of becoming a “meme stock” like AMC, we were never so lucky!” said Israel Greidinger, deputy chief executive officer of Cineworld, in the company’s bankruptcy filing,\n\nThat may be just sour grapes…or stale popcorn…though.\n\nNobody can accuse Aron and AMC of throwing up their hands and doing nothing to combat the fact that the economics of the movie theater business have arguably changed forever. Aron embraced the apes with open arms. Whether or not that means the stock will rebound is another question entirely.", "authors": ["Paul R.

They will re-open when those guidelines allow.”\n\nRegal, which operates theaters at The Avenues, Beach Boulevard and River City Marketplace, is closing all theaters nationwide on Tuesday “until further notice.”\n\nTwo locally owned theaters, the San Marco Theatre and Sun-Ray Cinema in Jacksonville’s 5 Points, shut down indefinitely on Monday.\n\nWednesday morning, Cinemark, which operates at Tinseltown and Durbin Park, posted a notice that it was temporarily closing all of its theaters.\n\nNew Vision has temporarily closed its 12-screen Fleming Island Theatre and Epic has done the same with its Oakleaf theater.\n\nJacksonville Mayor Lenny Curry announced Monday that the city is limiting attendance at public places to no more than 50 people. “Many places of business are going to be exempt from this so they can carry on business as usual,” said city spokeswoman Nikki Kimbleton in a text message. “This limit is specifically for social situations, shopping at the mall, eating out, and going to the movies, for example.”\n\nKimbleton later clarified the city’s position. “We are trying to limit as much person-to-person contact as possible to stop the spread and save lives,” she said in an email. “Any unnecessary social outings, like movie theaters, are limited to 50 people including staff. We are trying to limit people being in close contact, coughing and sneezing in an auditorium is a big risk.”\n\nTheaters are also cleaning surfaces more frequently and setting aside the reserved-seating policies that have become common over the last year in order to let people select their own seats and maintain “social distancing.”\n\nCOMPLETE COVERAGE | Coronavirus in Florida\n\nA statement from Sun-Ray quotes a New York Magazine article. “The evidence suggests that the choice is not between a shutdown and no shutdown; it’s between shutting things down now, when the disease is still relatively rare in our area, or waiting until more people have died, the virus has propagated further, and the medical system starts to be overburdened.”\n\nSun-Ray is closing its auditoriums and lobby indefinitely. The theater’s Pizza Cave restaurant remains open.\n\nSan Marco Theatre cited concerns for the health and safety of its staff and patrons for its decision to shut down indefinitely. “We know this is an uncertain time and there is a lot of fear out there. We are asking you to join us in prayer and to help in taking care of those around us that may need assistance.\n\nLive theater groups are also canceling or postponing performances.

Then, it will appeal to state legislature to pass a charter amendment actually allowing for the new collection.\n\nThe city is aiming for \"up to $50 per semester, per full- or part-time undergraduate or postgraduate student, at any college or university\" attending in-person within municipal borders, according to the draft resolution, with the fee adjusting with inflation. That's UD facing the levy, then likely charging thousands of students.\n\nAnd apparently, the city hopes to move quickly.\n\n\"If we hope to implement either tax early enough for it to be budget relevant for the 2025 budget year, we will need the state legislature to pass a charter amendment this legislative session,\" wrote Tom Coleman, city manager, to the mayor and council Monday. \"Based on the remaining legislative calendar, that means we must act fast.\"\n\nThe council will also discuss a new tax on lease revenues. The city hopes to collect a tax of \"no more than 5% on the gross rents or lease payments\" from owners of any residential and commercial rental properties, including properties owned by UD. The tax would not be applicable to on-campus dorms, subsidized rental properties or those already facing such a lodging tax, according to the draft resolution.\n\nThe council will consider these resolutions during its 6:30 p.m. meeting on Monday, Feb. 12.\n\nIt can likely expect a boost in attendance.\n\nRising costs:Hiring frozen. Projects paused. Travel curbed. UD reacts to spiking state health care cost\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nNewark says some 42% of real estate within the city is tax-exempt.\n\nThat's because the University of Delaware, like all nonprofits under state law, doesn't pay property taxes. It does pay millions in other operating costs to the city, like water and electricity, as well as certain fixed payments in lieu of taxes — but council says such \"PILOT\" payments haven't been adjusted in nearly 60 years.\n\nStill, \"students that attend the University of Delaware rely on the city to provide services that are financially supported by property tax revenue like police services and road maintenance,\" reads the draft legislation. It contends that additional revenue sources are \"imperative\" to continuing to provide city services.\n\nThis isn't a new issue, either. Council discussed the concept of such a student fee back in 2019, after a 13% increase in property taxes spurred a common complaint for residents. Discussions renewed in pitch as city residents will see their property taxes go up for a third-straight year.\n\n\"The city strongly believes that in light of the expansion of the university, both in terms of physical footprint and enrollment, it is only fair that the university pay their fair share,\" said Jayme Gravell, Newark's chief of community engagement, in an email.\n\nGravell also clarified that it's up to the university to pass this charge onto its students, as the city's per-student tax wouldn't necessarily require it.\n\nThe University of Delaware has yet to respond to requests for comment. Online reaction, though, has already started.\n\n\"The town of Newark should be thankful for the students and not punish them,\" reads one comment on a Barstool Delaware post warning of a possible proposal. \"We pump so much money into the local economy. Newark would not be the same place it is if it weren’t for us.\"\n\n\"I don't think you should tax students for getting an education,\" reads the next. \"What’s the point of blaming students?\" poses another. The post encouraged students to head to the council meeting to make their positions clear.\n\nAnd petition has already been circling to do the same. Student government leaders launched the document, with more than 1,700 signatures already.\n\n\"This imposition not only raises concerns about the financial burden placed on students but also presents the potential for future fee increases without adequate safeguards,\" writes the SGA Executive Cabinet. \"College-aged young adults are among the most financially vulnerable populations, and it's disheartening to see the City of Newark attempting to take advantage of this.\"\n\nGot a story?

The development project was revealed publicly in 2016, and construction was supposed to begin two years ago, but hurdles cropped up.\n\n“It took a while, but we stayed with it and it changed and it morphed, and we stayed with what we needed to do, and the timing is right right now for this place to rise,” Latifah said, referring to the project’s name, RISE Living. The name, also an acronym for “Rita is Still Everywhere” is a tribute to her mother, Rita, a former Newark schoolteacher.\n\n“I’m proud to be from here,” Latifah said, joined for the ceremony by New Jersey Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka and other leaders.\n\n“I grew up around here playing in West Side Park, a block away,\" Latifah reminisced. \"My grandfather’s hardware store was blocks from here. I drove past this block. I saw what was needed on this block, houses that weren’t lived in. Some were really dilapidated, and so I thought, 'Why not here?' ”\n\nSituated along Springfield Avenue outside of the city’s downtown, the 76-unit mixed-use project will include 20 three-family townhomes at market rate prices, with rents starting at $1,800 a month.\n\nThe need for affordable housing in Newark is dire. The Brick City needs an additional 16,000 low-rent units to meet the city’s demand, according to a 2021 study by the Rutgers Center on Law, Inequality, and Metropolitan Equity. Nearly 60% of Newark renters are cost-burdened, meaning they spend more than a third of their incomes on housing.\n\nAccording to the study, an affordable rental unit for a Newark household costs $763 a month. That’s $330 less than the city’s median market rent, and $600 less than what the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development considers the city’s fair market rent.\n\nRelated:Queen Latifah returns home to Newark to get COVID vaccine, encourage others to do the same\n\nAnd researchers completed this study before the state’s COVID-spurred ban on evictions ended. Essex County had more than 19,000 pending eviction cases as of the end of March, and a large portion of those are estimated to be in Newark.\n\nAs Latifah spoke, pipes, construction equipment and bulldozers filled the development plot, contained inside South 16th Street, South 17th Street, 19th Avenue and Springfield Avenue. The Newark Art Museum has created a netted art installation around the chain-link fence that features portraits of local artists and others whom neighbors nominated.\n\nA three-story building will house 16 affordable housing units for those earning less than 80% of the city’s median income, according to Alberto Goncalves, CEO of Life Assets. That is $55,950 for a one-person family, $63,950 for a two-person family, or $79,900 for a four-person household, according to 2021 HUD data.\n\nThe structure will also include 1,900 square feet for use by local nonprofits, as well as a fitness center, a business center and electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nPre-leasing for the market-rate units is expected to begin in early July, with the townhouses expected to be completed between September and December, according to Tammy Hammond, vice president of BlueSugar Corp. The entire project is planned to be completed sometime in 2023, Goncalves said.

There’s love in this city.”\n\nNatalie A.

Lewis, who lives in Montclair, owns two properties next to Latifah’s project that he bought years ago, but didn’t develop. He hopes to collaborate with the developers or the city to “better the community,” he said.\n\nDuring the summer of 2020, the City Council approved two tax abatements for the development, One is a 25-year PILOT, or payment in lieu of taxes, under which the owner would pay the city 10% of the market-rate apartments’ annual gross revenue for the first decade, then 11% after 10 years, and 13% after 20 years.\n\nThe building with 16 affordable apartments and retail space would pay 7.5% of its revenues over the course of a 30-year PILOT agreement.\n\nQueen Latifah isn’t the only celebrity-turned Newark real estate developer. Former NBA superstar Shaquille O’Neal partnered with New Brunswick-based Boraie Development on two large complexes: 50 Rector Park, a 22-story apartment building close to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, and 777 McCarter, a 33-story building next to Newark Penn Station.\n\nLatifah said she has a couple of new developments in mind, in which she hopes to be “more creative with the design,” with more senior housing and LEED-certified buildings.\n\n“[We want to] really continue to bring us into the future and give the youth an opportunity to stay right here and create and grow,” Latifah said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2022/10/03/newark-university-delaware-is-approaching-student-housing-building-height/65410662007/", "title": "How Newark, Delaware, is approaching student housing, building ...", "text": "As its student population has grown, UD has lost on-campus housing capacity and median rent in Newark has increased.\n\nGiven the strong demand, developers are beginning to propose six- and seven-story buildings.\n\nNewark is considering changing to its downtown zoning code.\n\nWhen Ann Morrison drives up Main Street on weekday mornings in Newark, she finds an unfamiliar site: a procession of backpacked students trekking up the red brick sidewalks toward class.\n\nIt’s not that University of Delaware students aren’t a regular sight in Newark – their student body more than doubles the city’s population – it’s where they are coming from that strikes Morrison.

So with more than a dozen projects planned, under construction or recently opened, things seem to be right in the Hub City.\n\nAfter all, New Brunswick's motto is, a city is never finished; that also helps explain why there’s always cranes along the growing Hub City skyline.\n\n“Cities always change,” said Patterson, who’s been in the planning department since 1988. “Hopefully, your city is always growing, and that there’s a need for new housing, new office space, new retail and so forth. So hopefully there’s always going to be cranes in the sky and holes in the ground and construction workers employed.\n\n“New Brunswick has a pro-growth attitude,” he added. “That coincides with what the New Jersey State Plans says, with what the county’s master plan says and our own master plan. This is the type of place where development should be focused. We have a dense urban environment. We have mix uses. Almost all of our zones permit mix uses or have a lot of pre-existing mix uses in them, even in our lower density residential zones. Our downtown is particularly mixed use where there’s residential, there’s retail, there’s offices, there’s transit.”\n\nREAD: New Brunswick’s Hub redevelopment aimed at tech\n\nREAD: $172 million New Brunswick PAC breaks ground\n\nStarting with The Hub\n\nOn Monday, Gov. Phil Murphy visited and promoted The Hub transit village across Albany Street from the train station. For what seems to be the most anticipated of several New Brunswick development projects, Murphy outlined his vision for The Hub as the state’s home for scientific research and hi-tech start-up incubation.\n\n\n\nOwned by the city and managed by its nonprofit New Brunswick Development Corp., the site is approved for up to 4 million square feet of commercial development that can complement local residential, retail, and entertainment growth in proximity to corporate, medical, and academic research activity and public transportation. While still years in development, The Hub now is the subject of a planning and implementation study by the state Economic Development Authority, which also has a bioscience incubation station in nearby North Brunswick. Murphy said that the EDA will recruit partners for The Hub.\n\n“Governor Murphy has made re-establishing New Jersey’s preeminence in the innovation economy the centerpiece of his vision for a stronger and fairer economy,” EDA CEO Tim Sullivan said in a news release. “We look forward to working with partners in the private, public and academic sectors to make the most of this uniquely-positioned site with extraordinary potential for major job creation.”\n\nAccording to the state, The Hub has the potential to:\n\nBecome a pipeline for innovative life sciences and technology talent\n\nRestore New Jersey’s place in the Innovation Economy, and provide a spot to create new ideas, organizations, and industries\n\nBe a center of international prominence that accelerates the growth and dynamism of the New Jersey’s life sciences and tech sectors\n\nCreate a partnership between the administration and Rutgers University to build on its research prowess and explore a potential customer experience lab that lets students and faculty develop innovative solutions to improve resident’s interaction with government services\n\nProvide benefits for Rutgers University, including increased access to government and private sector funding, and expanding the university’s national and global reach through partnerships with academic institutions and industry\n\nLead the way toward revitalizing cities by maximizing New Brunswick’s enormous potential based on its access to mass transit, its status as the home of Rutgers University and global pharmaceutical and life sciences businesses, and its abundant health care providers\n\nCreate construction, research, technology, and corporate jobs.\n\n“The co-location of research, innovation, and commercial partners in The Hub ecosystem will foster the development of new science, therapies, and products, creating jobs and growing the economy,” Devco President Christopher J. Paladino said.\n\n“This is the type of place where development should happen because you don’t have to be car-dependent,” Patterson added. “According to WalkScore.com, New Brunswick is a ‘Walker’s Paradise’ with a score of 97. Once The Hub is built, there’ll be a pedestrian path that will allow you to walk from the train station through The Hub to the New Brunswick PAC.”\n\nBut Murphy's support of The Hub already has drawn some questions from Republican leadership about how the project will be funded.\n\n“Building a tech hub is a good idea on paper, but Governor Murphy needs to tell us upfront how he plans to pay for it,\" Assembly Republican Leader John Bramnick, (R-Dist. 21. \"Placing the cost on taxpayers would be counter-productive and should not be an option.\n\n“The governor has been critical of the EDA and has called for an audit. It doesn’t make sense that he wants the agency to now take on a new, huge project,\" he added. \"We need answers before proceeding.”\n\nMore off-campus housing\n\nMore than 350 units of off-campus housing for Rutgers University students are in the approved plan stage. The Collegiate, developed by St. Louis-based Collegiate Housing Partners at 78 Easton Ave., will provide 168 units. Athens, Georgia-based Landmark Properties’s 21-story The Standard at 90 New St. will feature 186 units, 111 parking spaces and 2,000 square feet of retail space.\n\nLandmark has been paying $200,000 in lieu of taxes, which the state allowed several years ago as an incentive to build The Standard. Patterson said that while such high-rise developments typically require incentives and subsidies to get them built, the project is going to pay about $1.6 million in taxes to the city after the abatement.\n\n“It’s paying $200,000 now approximately, so it’s about eight times more funding that the city is going to realize from getting this project done,” Patterson said. “If you don’t do these types of incentives to make these projects feasible, you’re not going to realize those kinds of increases. It will get a nearly vacant lot developed with a nice, new project; it will provide over 180 housing units for the student population, which helps take the student population out of the regular neighborhoods in the city, which provides more opportunities for non-students to go into those houses, and it increases housing supply in the city, which helps to keep the rent numbers a little bit lower.\n\nThe city’s population has increased substantially over the last 20 to 25 years, and the number of housing units hasn’t kept up with that increase in population, which increases the average household size in the city, Patterson said.\n\nWhile officials can’t estimate exact numbers because of a variety of variables, they do believe the 1,300 new units will also increase the city’s population of 2016 population of 56,910.\n\n“By creating more housing out there, it helps create more supply, which will help dampen the pressure to increase the rents,\" he added. \"This is specifically designed for the student market to take them out of the regular housing supply, so that non-student households of families or individuals have more choice out in the marketplace. It also creates nice modern facilities for the students rather than older houses that are 80 to 100 years old being used to house the students. They tend to get really beat up after a number of years. They aren’t always the safest or in the best condition. This gets modern, safe housing for the student population.”\n\nAccording to Rutgers, that population has increased by 15 percent in the past five years, so the forthcoming student housing also addresses that need, Patterson said.\n\nWhile the school district will continue to get its share of the existing taxes of $200,000, once they project is completed, it won’t get a cut of the additional $1.4 million as per state statute, Patterson said. Residents, school board candidates and local media recently have complained that that the struggling city school district won’t get a fair share of the tax revenue pie.\n\nIn response, Patterson said, “The way the state statute works is that the payment in lieu of taxes goes to the city. There is a requirement to share 5 percent of it with the county, but the municipality retains the rest of it. For this type of project, it’s not going to generate any school kids. It is targeted and designed for the student population. The taxes that are already paid on it will be $200,000. The school district keeps that share of the taxes, so they don’t lose any money on that, and they’re not going to any new school children as a cost to the tax payer. That helps to keep the municipal tax rates lower.”\n\n“It’s one of the few things in New Jersey that municipalities can offer as a development incentive,” he added. “We think it’s a positive thing for the city. Most of the redevelopment projects in New Brunswick have had the abatements historically. It’s helped add a lot of new development in the city, really brought the city back. New Brunswick has one of the lowest tax rates in the county, so we think it’s done a good job.”\n\nThe Vue and the George, both of which have 20 percent affordable housing, are among the many city developments that have gotten tax abatements, Patterson said. In their case, the incentive subsidized affordable units, he said.\n\nCommercially, Kilmer Square, Golden Triangle, the Hyatt Regency and the Heldrich Hotel also received abatements, Patterson said.\n\nAlso in planning\n\nNew Brunswick also has approved plans for:\n\nA mix-use high-rise on Kirkpatrick Street with more than 200 units of residential, retail and office space developed by Woodbridge-based Wick Properties\n\nFour-story hotel from Red Bank-based Highview Hospitality with 109 suites on 1.76 acres at former Bennigan’s site at routes 1 and 18\n\nBetween 50 and 60 middle-market units coming to Easton Avenue at Morrell Street from city-based developer Dave Adams\n\nAn expected 20 to 25 units of middle-market rentals developed locally at Lewis Street behind the Ale ’N’ Wich on Hamilton Street\n\nHome2Suites from Hilton to open May 2020 with an indoor pool, patio, breakfast area, fitness room, outdoor lounge space and 109 parking spaces\n\nA 1.2-acre Middlesex County park that is the former site of the Wolfson parking deck at Liberty and Neilson streets.\n\nThe park will be next door to the recently opened Quincy luxury apartments, the former site of Frucci’s Italian Restaurant, which the daughter of the owners, Frank and Dorothy Frucci, recall fondly. Frucci's, also a soda fountain and candy shop established in 1927, was purchased by the city and demolished in 1959 to make way for development plans that never came to fruition until recently with The Quincy.\n\n“It was a very popular spot for young people,” said 87-year-old Doris Frucci Kempton, a New Brunswick native who now lives across the Raritan River in Highland Park. “All the teenagers from St. Peter’s, Rutgers, and Brunswick High used to come down after basketball or football games.”\n\nKempton said she was happy to hear that a park is coming to that area for young people to once again enjoy.\n\nShe is also amazed at how successfully New Brunswick has been developed.\n\n“New Brunswick was a wonderful small town,” she said. “We always said New Brunswick should be like Princeton with two colleges on either side. Then it went down. It went through a bad period. It’s taken an awfully long time to rebuild.\n\nREAD:Recalling the New Brunswick riots of 1967\n\n“I love New Brunswick,” Kempton added. “I boast that I was born and raised there. It’s going to keep growing with the performing arts center and high-rise buildings, like The Quincy.”\n\nUnder construction\n\nThe $172 million, 25-story New Brunswick Performing Arts Center developed on Livingston Avenue by Devco is one of three projects under construction in Hub City. Plans are to open in September 2019 as the new state-of-the-art home of George Street Playhouse, Crossroads Theatre Co., American Repertory Ballet, New Brunswick Cultural Center and Mason Gross School of the Arts.\n\nThe multi-use property also will feature office space for the resident companies and other commercial tenants, plus a 207-unit residential apartment tower that will rise above the theater complex with mixed-income rentals from affordable to luxury. City-based developer Pennrose Properties will own and operate the tower.\n\n“The city is very excited,” Patterson said. “It will provide two new theaters, which will be modern and larger spaces. And 20 percent of the housing will be set aside for lower- and moderate-income housing. We think it’s a really exciting project that will further New Brunswick’s reputation as the cultural center of Central Jersey.”\n\nThe first major new development along Hamilton Street between Easton Avenue in New Brunswick and the border of the Somerset section of Franklin Township is a $10 million, 39-unit apartment complex at 191 Hamilton St. developed by city-based Construction Management Associates. The rental mix will include studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. The front elevation features multi-level townhome-style units expected to blend into the existing neighborhood, said Mitchell Broder, president of Construction Management and its leasing sister company, Premier Properties of New Brunswick.\n\nBeing pushed back and centered, the building massing will be hidden from the street view. The modern apartments will feature spacious kitchens with stone counter tops, stainless steel appliances, detailed moldings and abundant closet space. Recreational amenities include two 1,400-square-foot outdoor terraces with built-in barbecue grills, planters, lighting and seating; a 1,400-square-foot gym, and a decorated lounge. Expected to be completed in the fall, the apartment complex also will feature garage parking and two elevators.\n\n“We are very excited to be underway with construction at our newest development,” Broder said. “This is ideally located to serve the RWJ Hospital and Rutgers markets. This location will also be well suited to anyone interested in close proximity to the train station and downtown. This project will only add to the ever-improving New Brunswick cityscape.”\n\nAlso under construction is The Edge at Raritan Heights, which will feature 254 multifamily units, as well as restaurants and retail, including a Starbucks, developed on the site of the 18-screen AMC Loews AMC movie theater on Route 1 south.\n\nPiscataway-based developer Edgewood Properties has taken a similar approach to the smaller The Edge at Main in Somerville. An opening is expected by year’s end, Patterson said.\n\n“It’s an interesting location because if you want to go to a movie, you just walk out your front door, and you have 18 screens you can choose from,” he said.\n\nOpen for business\n\nRecently opened projects span the housing gamut.\n\nThe Quincy, a luxury high-rise apartment building at 120 Neilson, boasts many amenities, including a rooftop pool that will open for its first season later this spring.\n\nAt 15 Maple St., 15 units of middle-market rentals also were developed by Construction Management.\n\nBut the project that Patterson said he was particularly proud of is the new supportive-needs housing on Zebra Way off Van Dyke Avenue and Somerset Street. Having recently celebrated its grand opening, the 12-unit residence was developed by nonprofits Bergen County United Way, Palisades Park-based Madeline Corp. and Coming Home Middlesex, the county’s homeless advocacy group.\n\n“Zebra Way is the sixth supportive-needs housing project that has been developed in New Brunswick,” Patterson said. “Supportive-needs housing provides housing for formerly homeless persons in the New Brunswick area. The 12 units of housing also come with supportive services for the population to help them with job training, education or any other needs they might have. We’re very proud that we develop projects to address this population.”\n\nThese properties follow such new developments as two Devco projects in partnership with Rutgers University: an honors dorm on Seminary Place and The Yard, a public green with a community megatron screen surrounded by restaurants and retail on College Avenue at Hamilton Street.\n\nThe city also opened the popular Recreation Park on Nichol and Sanford streets that features New Brunswick’s first skate park, as well as a basketball court, a playground, a public garden and more. Patterson said that upgrades to city parks are planned, along with more bike lanes, sidewalk improvements and flashing crosswalks.\n\n“We’re trying to make it a place where it’s comfortable to walk around, to bike around, where there’s good bus transportation,” he said. “The city has a number of shuttles that operate in town to get you around in the town or to other nearby areas. There are five New Jersey Transit bus routes that go through town, plus the Rutgers bus system. You don’t have to be a Rutgers student to get on. You don’t have to show an ID. It’s free, as are our shuttles. So there’s a transportation network around here, plus the train station. You can get to New York by train in 40 to 45 minutes.\n\n“The existing infrastructure here, the sewers and the waterlines and streets are already in place,” Patterson continued. “You don’t have to build a new sewer line to reach a new office development or subdivision, like you might have to do in the suburbs. It lowers the cost here. This type of development reduces the amount of greenhouse gases that are generated because you’re less car dependent. The style of development with the high-rise building is more energy efficient. You have supermarkets, offices and stores all within walking distance, so you don’t have to take your car to get to those places. This is where everybody encourages this type of development — New Brunswick, Jersey City, Newark, Camden — and we’re very supportive of doing that.\"\n\nStaff Writer Bob Makin: 732-998-9339; bmakin@gannett.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/bergen/2018/06/05/american-dream-extravaganzas-mean-big-bucks-meadowlands-hotels/661051002/", "title": "American Dream, extravaganzas mean big bucks for Meadowlands ...", "text": "Coming to the Meadowlands: Taylor Swift concer, WWE Wrestlemania 35, Transplant Games, Army-Navy football.\n\nEAST RUTHERFORD — Big things are going to happen in the Meadowlands, and that's great news for regional hotels and businesses.\n\nA number of scheduled extravaganzas and the pending opening of American Dream are expected to translate into a tourism boost, meaning big money for area businesses.\n\nHotels are positioning themselves to benefit from that boom, expected to start with Taylor Swift in concert this summer, WWE Wrestlemania 35 in April 2019, Transplant Games in 2020, and the Army-Navy football game in 2021.\n\nBusiness leaders have already started preparing to make a good first impression to secure future tourism dollars.\n\nTourists are coming, tourists are coming\n\nSimilar to incentives from other regional hotels, the Renaissance Meadowlands Hotel offers specialized stays for concert-goers.\n\n“We have a new package on our website called Concerts and Cocktails. It includes two cocktails per night to attract people going to the concerts, and that runs all summer long,” said Christie Geiger, corporate sales manager for Concord Hotels.\n\nAny event that brings people to the stadium puts heads in beds, said Sally Altman, director of sales and marketing for the Holiday Inn Hasbrouck Heights-Meadowlands.\n\n“When we have a big event in the area, we’ll either make a special package that offers transportation to and from the event or food and beverage discounts,” Altman said. “The Transplant Games is probably one of the biggest events coming up.\"\n\nThe upcoming events\n\nOrganizers expect between 10,000 and 12,000 celebrants during the 2020 Transplant Games, a six-day, multi-sport festival for people who have received or donated to lifesaving transplant surgeries.\n\nEach big draw brings with it ancillary activities, said Jim Kirkos, president of the Meadowlands Regional Chamber.\n\nThe Rock and John Cena went head to head at Wrestlemania 29 in 2013, bringing over 80,000 spectators to MetLife Stadium and the former Izod Center for a four-day fan festival and Monday Night Raw. The event created an estimated $101.2 million in economic impact for the New York/New Jersey region. WrestleMania returns to MetLife Stadium next April.\n\nThat 2013 weekend brought in $4.21 million in member revenue, and the occupancy rate on that Saturday was 5,118, according to the regional chamber. It also generated $294,933 in sales tax revenue.\n\nSuper Bowl XLVIII in February 2014 was the most recognizable local sporting event in recent years.\n\n“Its largest impact on hotel nights was seen over six nights beginning on the Wednesday prior to the game and continuing through the Monday after the game,” said Marjorie Kaplan, who represents the chamber. About 8,500 regional rooms were occupied in and around the Super Bowl, which translated to $4.18 million in additional revenue, $626,714 in additional generated taxes and $501,371 in state taxes.\n\nMetLife Stadium hosted three pivotal Centennial COPA America matches — Ecuador vs. Haiti, the Peru vs. Columbia quarterfinal and the Argentina vs. Chile final — in summer 2016. For those three days, more than $1.65 million was made in gross member hotel revenue, which equates to an area tourism revenue of nearly $5 million. Sales tax revenue for the same period was $346,970.\n\nDream opening\n\nAlong with special events at the Meadowlands Sports Complex, a permanent magnet is on the horizon: American Dream Meadowlands.

Expected to be a year-round draw are the indoor water and amusement parks slated for the Route 3 Dream project.\n\n“It’s exciting for us as a part of this community that people are actually coming to our neighborhood, instead of just stopping here along the way to the city,” Geiger said, referring to New York City.\n\n“There is so much that this area has to offer that people don’t even realize. Hopefully it will draw attention to our wetlands,” Geiger said.\n\nThe Renaissance Meadowlands Hotel also markets to eco-tourists, partnering with the Bergen County Audubon Society and Hackensack Riverkeeper for a walk and eco-cruise on June 5.\n\n“People don’t understand this region — you can bird-watch in the day and catch a Broadway play at night. Where can do you that in the same day?” said Vincent Prieto, president of the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority.\n\nThe Holiday Inn will look for marketing opportunities in conjunction with American Dream, Altman said. To prepare for the opening of the Meadowlands center, Altman said, she visited The Mall of America.\n\n“The Mall of America was built in a place without many things around it,” she said. “This venue has New York City inches away. I think it’s going to bring in a lot of different types of visitors, both local and from far away.”\n\nAmerican Dream hotel?\n\nEven Triple Five Worldwide seeks to capitalize on the promising hospitality boom. The company plans to build its own hotel in the Meadowlands, Ghermezian said.\n\n“Looking ahead, hotels and those amenities are very, very important to us for the next part of our development,” he said. “We have a dedicated tourism department that goes around and travels the world, just to promote the region, this area, and work together with our local partners to do that.”\n\nWhere the hotel will go is unspecified.\n\nThe neighboring Meadowlands Arena has been shuttered since 2015. Prieto said the facility is presently viable due to rentals to closed-door rehearsals, and is a potential location for off-site events for Wrestlemania.\n\nNo decisions had been made yet about a potential sale of the former Izod Center, he added.\n\n“I’m going to see what is the best for the sports authority, and that means the state of New Jersey,” Prieto said.\n\nThe promise of tourism dollars has put the Meadowlands on the radar of the new gubernatorial administration.\n\nPrieto, appointed by Gov.

It is through this partnership that we will be able to tell our story and show off our great destination to over 200 meeting planners over the three-day event,” said Judy Ross, vice president of the Meadowlands Liberty Convention & Visitors Bureau.\n\nAttendees are professionals who plan events on behalf of corporations and travel groups, said Axiom Communications President and Meadowlands Area YMCA Chairman Ron Simoncini.\n\n“They will inspect all of the rooms and facilities we have there in order to make recommendations to their clients, and their meeting and planning endeavors,” Simonici said. Attendees will get the firsthand experience to fly into Newark International Airport, just across the Hudson River. “There’s a theory that by locating these meetings in the Meadowlands, with easy access to New York City, actually gives people a great value, and at the same time, they have a great experience.”\n\n“I’m confident this is only the beginning of many more national events and conferences to come,” Ross said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/06/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2020/08/22/detroit-office-market-covid-gilbert-buildings/3385465001/", "title": "Work from home could hurt Detroit office market, construction projects", "text": "Downtown Detroit wasn't entirely back to its ghost town days on a recent weekday, although sidewalks that bustled a year ago with office workers and fleets of electric scooters were much, much quieter at midday.\n\nLocal real estate experts anticipate the return of many of those missing workers at some time in the future, once the coronavirus pandemic eases and more businesses call staff back for in-person work and stop them working entirely from home.\n\nYet a post-pandemic downtown Detroit could well be one with fewer office workers in fewer office spaces, should businesses decide to permanently incorporate more remote work than before COVID-19 or even opt to relocate to the suburbs, where leases can be cheaper and parking is often free.\n\nBusinesses also could simply reduce their headcount and space needs if the pandemic-caused recession lingers.\n\n\"The impact of what we’re grappling with now will certainly be more felt early next year,\" said A.J.

So we had a tight market, so if we slip a little bit, we’ll be fine,\" he said. \"With those other cities, they were constantly building new towers.”\n\nGilbert's new towers\n\nOne of the two Gilbert projects, known as the Monroe Blocks, would be built on surface parking lots near Campus Martius. The roughly $1 billion project was designed to have three towers, including a 35-story glass and terra cotta office complex, and 847,000 square-feet of total office space.\n\nAlso planned was a 27-story residential tower and a 10-story building with residential and retail space.\n\nThe project's originally announced completion date was in 2022.\n\nNow, real estate insiders believe the project has been indefinitely shelved or even canceled.\n\nThere were only a handful of workers at the site this week during a Free Press visit, and few building materials and visible construction activity.\n\nMatt Cullen, then the CEO of Bedrock, told reporters in January — before the pandemic — that Monroe Blocks was still happening in the near future but the timing had been pushed back. Previously, Bedrock had said the project's design was being modified.\n\nBedrock representatives did not respond to repeated messages seeking the status of its construction projects.\n\nHudson's site\n\nAnother Gilbert project is underway at the location of the former J.L. Hudson department store on Woodward, although its completion date has reportedly slipped two years to 2024.\n\nCrews have dug a foundation and installed caissons to support two planned structures: a nearly block-long building with office and retail space, and a neighboring skyscraper with hotel rooms and residences. There are two giant cranes in the hole and, during a midday visit, the construction site appeared active but not teeming with workers.\n\nWhen it was announced, the skyscraper was to be the tallest in Detroit and stretch higher than the tallest 727-foot tower in the Renaissance Center; Bedrock later lowered the planned height to 680 feet, according to Crain's Detroit.\n\nThe Free Press reported last September that Bedrock was having challenges pre-leasing significant amounts of space in the planned $900-million-plus buildings, a situation that can make it difficult to obtain financing from lenders for construction.\n\nSince then, any COVID-related drop in anticipated demand for office space would be an added challenge.\n\nMorris, the Axis Partners real estate executive and U-M instructor, said it could take office rents in the high $30s per square-foot to low $40s per square-foot to make a project such as the Hudson's site financially viable.\n\nThe average asking rents for Class A office space in Detroit's central business district was $26.82 gross per square-foot in the second quarter, according to a market report by Newmark Knight Frank.\n\nMorris said there are only so many potential office tenants in Detroit willing to pay $40 per square-foot. Such tenants could be big tech companies. For instance, Google is paying over the $40 mark for its lease next to Little Caesars Arena.\n\nBut Microsoft, Amazon and LinkedIn already have offices in downtown, and aside from Google, they are likely paying rents well below $40, according to a past Cushman & Wakefield office market study.\n\nSeparately, the recent completion of Gilbert's expansion project at One Campus Martius, formerly known as the Compuware Building, which added 310,000 square-feet of office space to the building, could add slack to the market.\n\nNo tax capture unless built\n\nMorris said the rent levels needed for the Hudson's project might have been closer to $50 per square-foot if not for assistance from the state's \"transformational\" brownfield credits for constructing the buildings.\n\nThose tax breaks would come largely from capturing property taxes, state income taxes and withholding taxes from the businesses, workers and residents who would occupy the new buildings. That means Bedrock doesn’t get the captured taxes until the buildings are built.\n\nDetroit-based Quicken Loans recently completed an initial public offering. It's an open question whether Gilbert's potential proceeds from the IPO could boost financing for the Hudson's project and reduce its lending needs.\n\nMatt Schiffman, a senior associate at Southfield-based P.A. Commercial, said Bedrock could be building what is essentially a \"shell\" at the Hudson's site that, as construction proceeds, could be configured to best fit anticipated market demand for types of space.\n\nShorter leases\n\nAcross metro Detroit, landlords have been offering office tenants with expiring leases one-year extensions because of the pandemic and related uncertainties, said Gutman of the Farbman Group. Normally, landlords seek longer-term leases.\n\n\"I think that’s simply because they don’t want to lose their tenancy,\" he said. \"We’re still in the phase where everyone is trying to work together.”\n\nThere also has been an uptick in office subleasing activity, according to Schiffman. Businesses may look to sublease space when they no longer need as much of it.\n\nOverall, experts say there is still a lot of uncertainty about whether businesses will look to shrink their office footprints in the months ahead.\n\nSome may decide to keep their existing arrangements — even if they have fewer workers in the office — and decide to increase the physical distance between employees. And many will likely ditch the once-popular open floor plan office.\n\n\"The net effect may be a wash, but we don't know,\" said Bernard, the commercial mortgage firm president. \"What we do know is those open floor plans for the next five to 10 years are gone. It’s going to go to bigger cubes again, it’s going to go to individual offices, it’s going to be spread out.\"\n\nContactJC Reindl at313-222-6631 or jcreindl@freepress.com.

The Oklahoma-based Muscogee Nation has tried for six years to get the remains back, but bureaucratic red tape has slowed the effort, said RaeLynn Butler, the Muscogee Nation’s historic and cultural preservation manager. The situation is no different than if someone dug up a family graveyard and took the remains for study, said Del Beaver, second chief of the Muscogee Nation. “And then if somebody asked for their grandma back, and we said, ‘No, there’s too much red tape,’ ” Beaver told the news site Al.com. “Just give us our people back.” Communications with the university slowed during the pandemic, frustrating tribal leaders who believe the remains and artifacts at the university’s Moundville Archaeological Park should be reburied, Butler said. This week, a federal review committee is scheduled to consider the evidence linking the seven tribes to Moundville and will rule on whether they can claim the remains as their own. However, the committee can’t force the university to turn over the remains and artifacts, Butler said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is extending through May a timeline to decide how or whether to proceed with proposed restrictions on mining in the state’s Bristol Bay region, known for its salmon runs. Acting Regional Administrator Michelle L. Pirzadeh, in a written notice, said an extension through May would allow time “to consider available information in order to determine appropriate next steps, which may include revising” restrictions that were proposed but never finalized under the Obama administration. The EPA, as part of a 2017 settlement with the developer of the proposed Pebble Mine, agreed to initiate a process to suggest withdrawing the proposed restrictions. The developer, the Pebble Limited Partnership, cast the proposed restrictions as an attempt to preemptively veto the copper and gold mine and said it wanted the project vetted through the permitting process. The company subsequently filed a permit application with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. In 2019, during the Trump administration, the EPA withdrew the proposed restrictions, removing what it called an “outdated, preemptive proposed veto of the Pebble Mine.” That action was challenged in court, and the EPA earlier this year asked a judge to vacate the withdrawal decision and send the matter back to the agency for further consideration. The request was granted.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A union representing the largest group of food service workers at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport went on strike Monday, during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year, to amplify concerns about wages, health insurance and retirement contributions. HMS Host is the single largest concessionaire at the airport in Phoenix that served more than 45 million passengers annually before the coronavirus pandemic. Workers with UNITE HERE Local 11 voted overwhelmingly last week to go on strike. The strike won’t affect flights but will affect hungry travelers because HMS operates more than two dozen restaurants and coffee shops. The company said in a statement that it will offer prepackaged food and scale down offerings for sit-down service during the strike. Four years of negotiations on a contract have failed, the labor union said in a statement. Workers are seeking raises, affordable health insurance, a company-paid retirement contribution and protection from discrimination, according to union officials. HMS Host said it offered substantial wage increases and benefits that include paying 90% of employees’ health care costs. The union represents less than half of the company’s hourly employees, HMS Host said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A lawsuit settlement has prompted the Arkansas State Police to clarify when troopers can try to slow a fleeing vehicle by striking it with a patrol car. Between 2016 and 2020, use of the tactic – which is intended to cause the fleeing vehicle to spin out of control – has increased every year, according to data provided by state police, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The tactic came under scrutiny after a July 9, 2020, incident in which state Trooper Rodney K. Dunn tried to stop Janice Nicole Harper for speeding as she drove in Pulaski County. Denton and Zachary PLLC, the law firm representing Harper, say she was looking for a safe place to pull over on the strip of highway that was lined with concrete barriers when Dunn used the maneuver, known as precision immobilization technique, or PIT, and caused Harper’s car to flip over. State police reached a preliminary settlement with Harper on Friday. Due to the settlement, state police clarified their use-of-force policy, instructing troopers to judge whether using the technique is “objectively reasonable,” Arkansas State Police spokesman Bill Sadler told the newspaper. Since 2018, at least 1 in 4 pursuits has ended with a PIT maneuver, and police and officials have defended its continued use.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: During a visit Saturday to Alcatraz Island, which became a symbol of the struggles of Native Americans for self-determination following its takeover in the 1960s, U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said progress has been made by Indigenous people, but more remains to be done. Haaland visited the island off San Francisco’s coast on the 52nd anniversary of the occupation by Indigenous students who were demanding that the U.S. government recognize long-standing agreements with tribes and turn over the deed to the island. The group was removed after a 19-month occupation, but the takeover became a watershed moment in Native American activism. “Alcatraz was borne out of desperation,” said Haaland, accompanied by some of the dozens of people who occupied the island in 1969. “Out of this we gained a sense of community and visibility in the eyes of the federal government. But more than that, our Indigenous identities were restored.” Haaland, who is from Laguna Pueblo in New Mexico and the first Native American to lead a Cabinet agency, said that thanks to the actions of those activists, Native Americans no longer have to resort to extreme measures to be heard. “The fact that I’m standing here today is a testament to that fact,” she said. “I am here. We are here. And we are not going anywhere.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Coloradans with COVID-19 who are at high risk of severe illness will no longer need a doctor’s referral before getting antibody treatments designed to keep them out of hospitals, starting this week. Gov. Jared Polis made the announcement expanding access to monoclonal antibodies Friday, the Denver Post reports. Colorado’s hospitals have been stressed by high COVID-19 caseloads, and 2 in every 5 hospitals reporting to the state expected to be short on intensive care beds within the next week. Roughly 45% of hospitals said they were experiencing staff shortages. About 1 in every 62 Colorado residents is currently infected with the coronavirus. Still, the governor has resisted reinstating public health measures such as mask mandates or capacity limits on businesses, despite calls from local public health officials to take more aggressive action. On Monday, the health departments representing Jefferson, Adams and Arapahoe counties – which have lobbied Polis to issue a new mask mandate for public indoor spaces – planned to consider enacting their own. Public health experts warn coronavirus cases could climb as people gather together during the holiday season. In Colorado Springs, public defenders are working remotely after employees in the office were sent home amid a possible COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Already facing higher fuel and salt prices, the state is looking for snowplow drivers to fill a shortage as winter approaches. The Connecticut Department of Transportation is seeking to hire nearly 140 more drivers to address a 13% driver shortage, The Day reports. DOT spokesperson Kafi Rouse told the newspaper the shortage is due to a recent spate of retirements and a shortage of applicants who have commercial driver’s licenses. It can be difficult to recruit snowplow drivers because of unpredictable scheduling, Rouse said. Kurt Hayes, owner of Hayes Services, a snow removal service in East Lyme, told The Day he has reduced his customer list due to supply shortages for snowplow parts. Fuel prices have doubled, and salt prices are up about 30%, said Rick Whittle, owner of Allied Snow Plowing Removal in Mystic. Whittle told the newspaper he has had to raise his prices by up to 15%. “Sometimes it can snow three times in a week, so it’s unpredictable to everyone involved, from the salt guy to the plow guy to everyone,” Whittle said. “That’s what makes it hard.”\n\nDelaware\n\nMiddletown: A blast heard throughout northern Delaware on Sunday was the result of an exploding rifle target that destroyed a nearby abandoned car, according to the State Fire Marshal’s Office. The explosion near Middletown was reported shortly before noon in a farm field several hundred yards away from the main roadway in the 4700 block of Summit Bridge Road, officials said. No injuries have been reported. Prior to the explosion, several people gathered in the field for target practice with firearms until an explosive mixture, known as a “binary exploding rifle target,” was placed next to the abandoned vehicle. A long-range rifle detonated the target, leading to the vehicle being destroyed and fragments being scattered across almost 3 acres of farmland, officials said. The explosion sent shockwaves through social media as residents reported hearing a loud boom as far away as Newark and Bear. Numerous commenters also reported their houses shaking due to the explosion. Investigators canvassed the area to see if any property had been damaged as a result of the “misuse” of the target, officials said. The Delaware State Police Explosive Ordinance Disposal Unit also assisted with destroying materials.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture has welcomed millions of visitors through its doors since opening in 2016. Now, millions more can visit with the tap of a button, WUSA-TV reports. The museum launched its latest digital initiative, the Searchable Museum, on Thursday. The digital platform at searchablemuseum.com is aimed at capturing the in-house experience of the museum for anyone with access to a laptop, smartphone or other digital device. “This ongoing project provides a chance for Americans to realize our shared past, bringing the unique museum experience to their homes and on their phones,” said museum director Kevin Young. The digital project’s first exhibition, “Slavery and Freedom,” is based on an exhibition of the same name in the museum’s David M. Rubenstein History Galleries. Users will virtually experience recreations of striking moments from the gallery exhibition, including the History Elevator, which transports visitors back in time from the present to the early 1400s through images accompanied by the words of Maya Angelou. The Paradox of Liberty depicts Thomas Jefferson, U.S. president and principal author of the Declaration of Independence, surrounded by the names of the 609 people he enslaved over his lifetime.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: A judge on Monday officially exonerated four young African American teens and men of the false accusation that they raped a white woman seven decades ago, making partial and belated amends for one of the greatest miscarriages of justice of Florida’s Jim Crow era. At the request of the local prosecutor, Administrative Judge Heidi Davis dismissed the indictments of Ernest Thomas and Samuel Shepherd, who were fatally shot by law enforcement, and set aside the convictions and sentences of Charles Greenlee and Walter Irvin. The Groveland Four, who ranged from 16 to 26 years old at the time, were accused of raping a woman in 1949. “We followed the evidence to see where it led us, and it led us to this moment,” said Bill Gladson, the local state attorney, following the hearing in the same Lake County courthouse where the original trials were held. Gladson, a Republican, moved last month to have the men exonerated. The men’s families said maybe this case will spark a reexamination of other convictions of Black men and women from the Jim Crow era. “We are blessed. I hope that this is a start because lot of people didn’t get this opportunity,” said Aaron Newson, Thomas’ nephew. He broke into tears as he spoke. “This country needs to come together.” Thomas was killed by a posse that shot him more than 400 times shortly after the rape accusation. The local sheriff, Willis McCall, fatally shot Shepherd and wounded Irvin in 1951 as he drove them to a second trial after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned their first convictions, saying no evidence had been presented. The sheriff claimed the men tried to escape, but Irvin said McCall and his deputy shot them in cold blood.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: A newly launched program aims to provide people experiencing homelessness work for pay while also cleaning the city. “One of the things I think people can all come to common ground on is if some of the homeless are willing to work for these couple of hours, then that’s a win for everybody,” said James Scott, executive director of Sparrow’s Nest, a Christian ministry serving those in need. “It’s a win-win. A win for them, and also for the community in keeping Athens safe and clean.” Currently, the initiative pays members of the homeless community $10 an hour for about two hours once a week. It typically opens to the first 10 people to arrive at Sparrow’s Nest. Scott said the program has been running for more than a month, with hopes to expand it. “We want to increase it to two to three hours, or two to three times a week, or three to four hours, either-or, to be able to give people opportunity,” he said. Through expanding the program, Scott said, there’s hope that it can lead to building leadership and additional opportunities for participants. “My long-term hope is that we can begin to, because I’m in ministry, make disciples,” he said. “The guy who is picking up today, hopefully, he can be the guy when we move to 20 to be over a group of people.”\n\nHawaii\n\nWailuku: Some people on Maui want to limit bike tours they say create safety hazards, but company owners worry new restrictions would hurt business. Maui County Council Member Mike Molina introduced a bill last week to limit the times and number of people who could go on guided bike tours, The Maui News reports. Among the proposed rules is a ban on unguided tours and a requirement that guided tours operate only between 9 a.m. and 1 p.m. The measure would also limit riders to 10 per group and cap the number of companies that can operate in certain districts to six. Jeremy Hall, co-owner of Haleakala Bike Company, said the proposal goes against small businesses and is anti-tourism. “We’re not some mainland company that’s popped up and is taking money out of the community, using public resources – we’re people who live Upcountry. My employees live Upcountry,” said Hall, whose business has been operating on Maui for 30 years. Some residents said the tours create traffic hazards. “These roadways were not built for bikes; these roadways are even risky for residents who live here,” said Haiku resident Jasmine Kilborn. “Visitors don’t know the area. They don’t know the road or what they’re getting themselves into.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Most of the state’s emergency medical services rely entirely on volunteers and don’t have enough resources to meet the needs of their communities, according to a new report from the Office of Performance Evaluations. Just 18% of EMS directors reported that their agency is able to maintain sufficient staff, according to the report released Friday, and 65% said they experienced delayed emergency response times because of staffing problems within the past year. Under state law, emergency medical services aren’t considered “essential,” so there is no guarantee that every community will have access to ambulances or paramedics in an emergency. Across Idaho, EMS programs are run by a variety of entities – including private organizations, fire departments, local governments and other groups – using a patchwork of funding. In rural Idaho, nearly 7 out of 10 EMS providers are volunteers. “Agency officials we interviewed consistently reported that not every Idahoan gets the level of care they need during an emergency. They cited insufficient staffing as the primary reason,” the Office of Performance Evaluation staffers wrote in the report. A 2010 report from the Office of Performance Evaluations found similar problems, but lawmakers didn’t follow through on many of the things the office recommended to address the issues.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state wants the public’s help to return nearly a dozen Purple Heart medals to their rightful owners. The medals are awarded to members of the U.S. military who are injured or killed while serving. Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs said the 11 medals each were left in a bank safe deposit box that went untouched for years. The treasurer’s office received them as part of the office’s unclaimed property program after the owners could not be found. “These medals personify honor, sacrifice and duty,” Frerichs said. “They belong in the loving care of families rather than hidden inside our cold basement vault.” His office released a list Thursday of the last names associated with the safe deposit box, the date in which the medal was recorded with the state treasurer’s office and the location of the bank. They include multiple banks across Illinois and one in Portland, Oregon. Frerichs asked anyone who may have a lead on locating a veteran or his or her family to contact his office.\n\nIndiana\n\nEvansville: Hundreds of onlookers gathered Sunday morning to watch as a series of blasts brought down an 18-story office tower that had been the city’s tallest building for than a half-century. Crowds watching from a safe distance cheered as a cloud of smoke enveloped part of downtown Evansville after a rapid series of blasts collapsed the 420 Main Building in less than a half-minute. The office tower had housed Old National Bank’s headquarters from 1970 to 2004. But after the bank moved out, the tower’s occupancy dropped, its condition deteriorated, and efforts to rehabilitate it failed. Neil Chapman’s law firm was the building’s last tenant. He hosted a party Sunday morning to watch the implosion from his new office in the Fifth Third Center, which at 15 stories is now the tallest structure in the southwestern Indiana city, along the Ohio River. “This was a man-made structure, 18 stories tall, and to see it come down suddenly and violently within seconds is amazing. It brings out your inner 8-year-old,” Chapman said. Contractors said most of the 18,000 tons of rubble left will be crushed and reused in the site’s redevelopment. The implosion makes way for a planned retail and apartment development that will top out at four stories. Property owner Domo is leading that endeavor, called Fifth & Main.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State officials say they will continue to strive for fewer than 300 annual traffic deaths, but it won’t happen in 2021. The Cedar Rapids Gazette reports that as of Friday, Iowa’s traffic death count stood at 312. Iowa Department of Transportation officials say that outpaces the death toll for the same date in the four previous years, but it was below the 350 count by the same time in 2016 – the last year highway crashes claimed more than 400 lives. Governor’s Traffic Safety Bureau Chief Brett Tjepkes said a safety campaign will continue to urge drivers to slow down, buckle up, drive sober and remain distraction-free heading into the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel period. State officials cite speeding as a major problem, and the state patrol has been cracking down, issuing more than twice as many tickets in 2020 compared to 2019.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Conservative legislators struggled Monday to build support among Republicans for a proposal to provide unemployment benefits to workers who lose their jobs for refusing COVID-19 vaccines. The GOP-controlled Legislature opened a special session Monday. The measure on unemployment benefits was tied to another that would make it easier for workers to claim religious exemptions to COVID-19 vaccine mandates. Both are responses to mandates from President Joe Biden covering more than 100 million American workers. The push for unemployment benefits for vaccine-refusing workers comes after GOP lawmakers worried for months that the depletion of funds to pay claims last year during the pandemic would force an increase in the state tax that finances the benefits. There’s bipartisan concern that the unemployment proposal before lawmakers now could lead to such a tax increase. “Most of our employers are small businesses. That increase in taxes, on unemployment, will be difficult,” state Sen. Jeff Longbine, of Emporia, told fellow Republicans during a meeting Monday before the session convened.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The chemical giant Chemours, moving to cut emissions of a climate super-pollutant from its facility in the Rubbertown neighborhood, has asked city officials to issue a permit for new abatement equipment that could release chloroform and other hazardous air pollutants. The company plans to capture the climate super-pollutant hydrofluorocarbon-23 and transport the gas to a Chemours plant in West Virginia for destruction. As part of the process to capture HFC-23, about 1,600 pounds a year of chloroform, hydrochloric acid, chlorine and hydrogen fluoride, all hazardous air pollutants, could be emitted into neighborhoods around its Louisville facility. While not a local air pollutant, HFC-23 is one of the most potent greenhouse gases warming the planet. The chemical byproduct is 14,600 times more potent for warming of the atmosphere than carbon dioxide, the primary driver of climate change. Chemours and Louisville officials say the net effect of the abatement project will be a major reduction in greenhouse gases blamed for heating the planet and a plantwide reduction in hazardous air contaminants – even though the proposed construction permit shows a chloroform tank and other new equipment could result in the release of those air pollutants.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The director of New Orleans Emergency Medical Services is resigning after more than three years in the job, a spokesperson for the struggling agency said Friday. Dr. Emily Nichols told her paramedics she was leaving the agency, which has been hit by staffing shortages worsened by the coronavirus pandemic. Spokesperson Jonathan Fourcade said Nichols’ departure is expected in the next few weeks. Details about why Nichols quit weren’t immediately available, but Fourcade said she had not been forced out, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. Mayor LaToya Cantrell appointed Nichols in May 2018. New Orleans Emergency Medical Services was already dealing with staffing shortages and employee burnout when the pandemic began in 2020. COVID-19 sparked even more shortages, with emergency medical technicians and paramedics either out sick or in quarantine. Many ambulances have also broken down. Recently, with only nine ambulances available from a fleet of 40, Nichols decided to send some paramedics and EMTs home despite the staffing shortfalls, leaving the agency unable to answer some emergency medical calls.\n\nMaine\n\nBangor: More hunters are seeing purple as property owners use the color to mark land that is off limits to hunting without first obtaining permission. Purple paint can be used on trees, rocks or fence posts as an alternative to nailing a sign on a tree to let others know that no hunting is allowed without advance permission, said Mark Latti of the Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife. The state’s “purple paint law” has been around since 2011, but it’s being used more and more with each passing year. The marking is a single vertical stripe of purple paint. Hardware stores sell special paint for use in marking properties. According to state law, the signs must be no more than 100 feet apart at locations that are readily visible to people approaching the property, as well as at all vehicular access points off a public road.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Nursing students at the University of Maryland are getting an early jump on their postgraduate careers. The university’s nursing school is allowing its students who are scheduled to graduate Dec. 23 to leave a few weeks early and begin working in the field. The move is motivated by a nursing shortage amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Baltimore Sun reports it’s the fourth time the school has approved such an early-exit program. This time, it was in response to a request from Republican Gov. Larry Hogan. All 161 bachelor’s degree students and 11 master’s degree students will leave early during a period that runs from Friday to the first week of December. “Nurses throughout Maryland have served courageously on the front lines for over 20 months,” the school’s dean, Jane Kirschling, said in a statement. “I am proud of our entry-into-practice students for their willingness to support these efforts, and I applaud all of our students for their resiliency and for persevering in their studies during a difficult time marked by uncertainty and ongoing challenges.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: First responders would be allowed to treat and transport injured police dogs to veterinary hospitals under a bill unanimously approved by the state Senate. The bill dubbed Nero’s Law was named for the K-9 partner of slain Yarmouth Police Sgt. Sean Gannon. Gannon was fatally shot in 2018 while serving an arrest warrant. Nero was also shot, but because of current state law, EMTs weren’t allowed to treat or transport him. Nero had to be rushed to the animal hospital in the back of a police cruiser and survived the shooting. “K-9 officers protect the men and women in law enforcement as well as the community at large,” said Democratic state Sen. Mark Montigny, lead sponsor of the bill. “These animals endure extreme danger from gun violence, narcotics and even explosive materials. Allowing our emergency personnel to provide basic treatment and transport is a commonsense measure that honors their contributions across the commonwealth.” The bill would permit emergency personnel to treat injured police dogs and bring them to veterinary facilities, as long as there are no injured people still requiring a hospital transport. The bill now heads to the Massachusetts House for consideration.\n\nMichigan\n\nMarshall: The last Kmart has closed in the state where the former brick-and-mortar retail giant got its start. Sunday was the last day at a Kmart in Marshall, 100 miles west of Detroit, City Manager Tom Tarkiewicz said Monday. “They still had products they were selling,” Tarkiewicz said. An email seeking comment from Kmart’s corporate parent wasn’t immediately returned. The first Kmart store opened in Garden City, a Detroit suburb, in 1962. The chain grew to more than 2,000 stores across the U.S., but its fortunes changed as other big box retailers gained momentum. Kmart reorganized under bankruptcy protection in 2002-03 and began closing hundreds of stores before merging with Sears, Roebuck & Co. in 2004. Kmart’s website lists 21 stores remaining in the U.S. or U.S. territories. It also sells goods online. Tarkiewicz didn’t know why the Marshall store was the last in Michigan to stay open but said he had heard it was considered to be a profitable location. “It was busy,” he said. “We saw a lot of out-of-state cars. We’re only 36 miles from Indiana.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: About 50 parishioners protested outside Our Lady of Guadalupe Church on Sunday over what they say is the eradication of culture and tradition from Minnesota’s first Hispanic parish. Many of the demonstrators were third-generation members of the Roman Catholic church, which has a 90-year history in St. Paul. Among specific complaints, they say Aztec dancers are no longer allowed inside the church, there is no Sunday school or choir, masses previously led in Spanish are now in Latin, and women are not allowed on the altar. One of the protesters, Vincent Mendez, said that “it feels like we’re being forced out again” and that the parishioners “just want to save our church.” The Rev. Michael Tix, with the Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, said in a statement that he and Archbishop Bernard Hebda are involved in conversations between parish leadership and parishioners, the Star Tribune reports. Tix said it is “through open and honest conversation that concerns will best be addressed and solutions reached for the good of everyone involved.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has overturned the approval of a massive flood-control project in the south Mississippi Delta that officials said was erroneously greenlit in the final days of the Trump administration. In a letter to the Army for Civil Works, EPA officials said the past administration’s November 2020 decision to approve the Yazoo Pumps Project was in violation of the Clean Water Act and “failed to reflect the recommendations from the career scientists and technical staff.” Radhika Fox, assistant administrator for the office of water at the EPA, said the federal government is concerned about the serious impacts from flooding on people and the economy of the lower Mississippi Delta. But she said she wants to work with the Corps and others to find “a path forward that addresses flooding concerns in an environmentally protective manner.” The decision was cheered by conservation groups – American Rivers, National Audubon Society, Sierra Club and Healthy Gulf – which had sued the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service earlier this year over the construction of pumps in the Yazoo Backwater area north of Vicksburg.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: The American Civil Liberties Union on Monday sent a letter demanding a school district return two LGBTQ-themed books to library shelves. The North Kansas City School District pulled “All Boys Aren’t Blue” and “Fun Home” from high schools this month in response to parent complaints, the Kansas City Star reports. The district is reviewing the titles, and the books were expected to be discussed during a Monday school board meeting. In a letter to school officials, the ACLU of Missouri said removing the books violates students’ First Amendment rights by restricting their access to ideas. “Students must be free to access library books – without discrimination or censorship – that are LGBTQ+ affirming as well as books that provide an inclusive and accurate history of racism,” ACLU of Missouri Executive Director Luz María Henríquez said in a statement. Students also are petitioning to have the books returned. “All Boys Aren’t Blue” is a coming-of-age memoir about the author’s experience as a queer, Black adolescent. “Fun Home” is about the author’s relationship with her gay father.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: A program in the resort community of Big Sky that offers landlords cash to convert vacation rentals or seasonal homes into long-term homes for locals converted 21 homes and housed 58 locals in its first three months. After a three-month trial of the Rent Local program, launched by the Big Sky Community Housing Trust, the nonprofit launched the full program Nov. 1. The success of the pilot program wasn’t a surprise, executive director Laura Seyfang said. “It’s what we were hoping for,” she told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. The program hopes to convince some 1,200 owners of seasonal homes or vacation rentals to rent to local residents by bridging the gap in money the homeowner might make with short-term rentals. The housing trust estimated homeowners make on average anywhere from about $3,800 to about $10,400 more annually on short-term rentals than long-term leases. “By providing this boost, it’s enough to make it even out,” Seyfang said. “We’ve put in place all these ways to make it easier for an owner to rent to a local worker, but then there was that cash difference. By making up that income difference, it takes away all these excuses.” The nonprofit estimates the incentive created new inventory 89% faster than through some of its other programs.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A petition drive is underway to change the state’s constitution and eliminate its Board of Education. The proposal would shift oversight of the Education Department into the governor’s office and eliminate the elected board, but backers would have to gather roughly 125,000 signatures by next July to put the question on the November 2022 ballot. The Omaha World-Herald reports the measure comes after Gov. Pete Ricketts clashed with the Education Department at times in the past year. Ricketts spoke out strongly when the state board considered adopting new health education standards for schools that incorporated teaching about gender identity and sexual orientation. The board later abandoned those proposed recommendations for local school districts after it encountered strong opposition. Ricketts said in a statement that any changes to the current structure of the department would have to be approved by voters. “The Nebraska Department of Education should respect that parents are the primary educators of their children, and the agency must continue to be accountable to the people of Nebraska,” Ricketts said. Critics of the petition drive said it would concentrate too much power in the governor’s office and mess up a system that is working.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A man has been accused of beating another customer over the head with a dog bone during a quarrel over a pet store’s mask policy, according to authorities. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police said 22-year-old Juan Hamilton was arrested on a warrant after the Nov. 8 incident that left the unidentified victim with a skull fracture. Court records show Hamilton was still being held on a $5,000 bond on suspicion of attempted murder, battery, abuse of an older person resulting in substantial bodily harm and burglary of a business. The Las Vegas Review-Journal also reports that witnesses told police Hamilton was in line behind another man when the two began arguing over the PetSmart store’s mask mandate. Witnesses said Hamilton left the store before returning and allegedly beating the victim over the head with a bone. PetSmart employees helped detectives identify Hamilton because he was a regular at the store. Hamilton told police he hadn’t been to the store for several months and then asked for a lawyer. It was unclear Sunday if Hamilton had an attorney who could speak on his behalf about the case. If Hamilton is released from jail, court records indicate he’ll be required to avoid all PetSmart stores.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state’s bear population is on the move, and officials are asking residents not to detour the animals with snacks. The Fish and Game Department says the public should hold off on putting out bird feeders until December. Right now, bears are searching for high-fat, protein-rich food to sustain them as they head into their dens, and bird feeders are often a target. Andy Timmins, the state bear project leader, said reports of conflicts between bears and people were low this summer, but there has been an uptick in activity since late October, mostly involving bird feeders. He said a single feeding will cause a bear to return in other seasons, leading to property damage and the bears becoming nuisance animals. “Bears have an excellent sense of smell and good memories,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: The city’s nine casinos saw their gross operating profit more than double in the third quarter of this year, according to state figures released Monday. The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement figures show the casinos posted a collective gross operating profit of more than $310 million in July, August and September. That is more than twice the $151 million profit they reported in the third quarter of 2020, when they were still operating under state-imposed capacity restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic. For that reason, James Plousis, chair of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission, said the results are not directly comparable. Instead, he compared them to the third quarter of 2019, before the pandemic hit, and found the casinos still did nearly 30% better in the third quarter of 2021. “Through efficiencies, every operator posted a profit in the third quarter, a great accomplishment coming out of an extremely challenging period,” he said in a statement. “Atlantic City’s recovery is gaining momentum and is on track for an impressive year.” Gross operating profit reflects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and other expenses and is a widely accepted measure of profitability in the Atlantic City casino industry.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s exports are barreling toward an annual record this year, marking a sharp turnaround from last year’s pandemic-induced slowdown. Total state sales worldwide climbed 55% in the first nine months of 2021, from $2.77 billion in the January-September period last year to $4.28 billion this year, according to the U.S. Commerce Department. If those trends continue, the state could well surpass its previous annual export record, reached in 2019, when global sales hit $4.68 billion. In fact, at $4.28 billion as of September, the value of state exports is already more than $1 billion higher than the January-September period in 2019, when sales abroad totaled $3.16 billion. “It’s looking really good,” said Jerry Pacheco, trade consultant and executive director of the International Business Accelerator at Santa Teresa in southern New Mexico. “I expect this to be our biggest year yet,” Pacheco told the Albuquerque Journal. “New Mexico exports are already well exceeding 2019, which was our flagship year before the pandemic.” The coronavirus pandemic markedly slashed exports nationwide in 2020 as consumers hunkered down at home, businesses temporarily shut down across the globe, and supply-chain disruptions slowed commerce worldwide.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Job candidates rarely know when hidden artificial intelligence tools are rejecting their resumes or analyzing their video interviews. But New York City residents could soon get more say over the computers making behind-the-scenes decisions about their careers. A bill passed by the City Council this month would ban employers from using automated hiring tools unless a yearly bias audit can show they won’t discriminate based on an applicant’s race or gender. It would also force makers of those AI tools to disclose more about their opaque workings and give candidates the option of choosing an alternative process – such as a human – to review their application. The measure aims to open a window into the complex algorithms that rank the skills and personalities of job applicants based on how they speak or what they write. “I believe this technology is incredibly positive, but it can produce a lot of harms if there isn’t more transparency,” said Frida Polli, co-founder and CEO of New York startup Pymetrics, which uses AI to assess job skills through game-like online assessments. Her company lobbied for the legislation, which favors firms like Pymetrics that already publish fairness audits. But some AI experts and digital rights activists are concerned it doesn’t go far enough to curb bias and implicitly gives the city’s OK to the technology.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A human rights group is suing the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, alleging its staff censors magazines inmates receive by mail, especially those with articles about prison misconduct. Human Rights Defense Center in Florida filed the suit in U.S. District Court, The News & Observer reports. The nonprofit publishes Prison Legal News and Criminal Legal News, which focus on inmates’ rights, court rulings and other criminal justice issues and circulate to 232 people in state correctional facilities. The group claims that 23 magazine issues or annual reports were banned between 2019 and August. The department’s policy allows material to be kept from offenders because of “threats to institutional safety and security,” but the content can’t reasonably be considered to contain such threats, the lawsuit says. Last month, a contractor began converting prisoners’ letters to digital files, but it doesn’t handle magazines. The nonprofit claims the state violated its free speech and denied access to readers without notice or opportunity to appeal. It argues the department is suppressing its political message and costing subscriptions. It seeks a declaration that such actions are unconstitutional and an end to the practice.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The city’s only Democrat in the Legislature won’t run for reelection next year. State Sen. Erin Oban announced Thursday that she won’t be seeking a third term, citing the divisive nature of current politics. The Bismarck Tribune reports her departure opens up one of seven seats held by Senate Democrats, who have dwindled to their smallest minority in 50 years in the Republican-controlled Legislature. “It’s obvious that the extreme rhetoric and divisiveness of the national scene have seeped into our state,” Oban said in a statement. “The North Dakota Senate has been a place that, for the most part, has maintained decorum and respected the rules that govern the way in which we do business. For that, I am grateful. But it was also considered the more ‘serious’ legislative body, the chamber with far less tolerance for distractions, nonsense, and political theater, and over the last few years, that’s been changing.” Oban, 39, is a former junior high math teacher. She was first elected in 2014. Her announcement came a week after Bismarck GOP Sen. Nicole Poolman said she won’t seek reelection. Poolman, an educator, said she wants to spend more time with her family and students but also cited an eroding civility in politics.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Public health officials are asking folks in Greater Columbus to make sure one particular unwanted guest doesn’t crash any Thanksgiving gatherings this year. To help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Columbus Public Health is offering free, at-home testing kits from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday in a drive-thru event at the Celeste Center on the Ohio State Fairgrounds. Franklin County residents can get up to 12 home test kits at the event, while supplies last, according to the health department. People are encouraged to test themselves and guests the day of gathering or traveling to someone else’s house. People who test positive should stay home, follow guidance on isolating and notify others with whom they were in close contact, according to the health department. “Testing before you gather adds another layer of protection, especially for those who are at greater risk of serious illness and those too young to get vaccinated,” said Columbus Public Health Commissioner Dr. Mysheika Roberts. Along with the drive-thru, free at-home tests are available at local libraries and recreation centers, according to a health department release. Thanksgiving approaches as Ohio is seeing yet another rise in COVID-19 cases. Getting vaccinated is “the safest way to celebrate” the holiday, Roberts said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma City Thunder announced Monday that beginning Dec. 1, fans attending games in person will no longer be required provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test. “We have decided to lift our vaccination/testing requirements,” a team statement said, citing a decline in coronavirus cases and an increase in COVID-19 vaccinations in Oklahoma County. “Since we announced the protocols in September, the Oklahoma Department of Health reports the percentage of Oklahoma County residents 12 and older who are fully or partially vaccinated has risen to 85%,” according to the statement. “The number of COVID cases statewide has dropped approximately 60% and hospitalizations have declined at similar rates.” The requirements remain in place for games scheduled for Wednesday and Friday. The NBA suspended the 2020 season in March that year after two Utah Jazz players tested positive for the coronavirus prior to a scheduled game in Oklahoma City.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state Supreme Court on Monday dismissed two challenges filed by Republicans to new legislative districts approved by the Legislature in September. The lawmakers passed new legislative and congressional boundaries that included a new, sixth U.S. House seat. The ruling Monday was specifically about the 90 state legislative districts that will likely enable Democrats to continue to hold majorities in the House and Senate but will not guarantee the party the three-fifths supermajorities it currently holds. Republicans throughout the redistricting process accused Democrats of gerrymandering. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports that in petitions challenging the maps, Republicans alleged that Democratic lawmakers drew districts for partisan political gain and to help incumbents. In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the GOP failed to show that the new districts violated state law.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Sean Parnell, a U.S. Senate candidate endorsed by former President Donald Trump, on Monday suspended his campaign after he lost a court fight over custody of his three children in which the judge said he believed allegations of abuse by Parnell’s estranged wife. In a statement, Parnell said he was devastated by the judge’s decision and planned to ask the judge to reconsider, but he cannot continue his campaign. The high-stakes campaign in the battleground state could help determine control of the U.S. Senate in next year’s election. A Pennsylvania seat is opening up with the retirement in 2023 of two-term Republican U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, and both Republicans and Democrats have a big field of candidates in the politically divided state. Parnell’s withdrawal comes as many in the state Republican Party remain undecided about their field, which includes conservative commentator Kathy Barnette, real estate investor Jeff Bartos and Carla Sands, Trump’s ambassador to Denmark. Also swirling is a suggestion from Mehmet Oz – the cardiac surgeon and longtime host of TV’s “Dr. Oz Show” who gained fame as a protege of Oprah Winfrey – that he is being encouraged to enter the Republican primary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: About 1 in 6 households across the state struggles to put enough food on the table – significantly lower than during the height of the pandemic last year but higher than pre-pandemic levels, according to a report released Monday. Black and Latino households were particularly hard-hit this year, with 34% each unable to meet basic food needs, according to the Rhode Island Community Food Bank’s 2021 Status Report on Hunger. Hunger is also “alarmingly high” in families with children, as 1 in 4 cannot meet basic food needs, the report said. The number of food-insecure households in Rhode Island is expected to grow as government programs that supported low-income families during the COVID-19 pandemic end. “Post-pandemic recovery simply doesn’t apply to the lives of many Rhode Islanders,” Andrew Schiff, chief executive officer of the food bank, said in a statement. “As supportive government programs and benefits disappear, the ripple effects of COVID-19 continue to be seen on the kitchen tables of people across the state.” The numbers are based on the RI Life Index, compiled by Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Rhode Island and the Brown University School of Public Health.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: Federal agents are looking for someone who used a metal detector and dug 19 holes earlier this month looking for artifacts at a historic site that was once the Charleston-area plantation of a signer of the U.S. Constitution. Rangers at the Charles Pinckney National Historic Site found the holes all over the park Nov. 13, the National Park Service said in a statement. Some of them had discarded metal artifacts nearby, and some did not, leading rangers to think a thief was using a metal detector to steal selected artifacts, investigators said. The digging also caused damage to resources at the park, said Kate Funk, chief of resource management at the site. It is illegal both to dig without permission and to have a working metal detector at a national park site, officials said. “Archaeologists make a great effort to record the context from which artifacts are recovered to better understand their use and disposition and the wider historical picture. All this important information is now lost because of this illegal excavation,” Funk said. The Charles Pinckney National Historic Site was once a Lowcountry plantation that produced rice and indigo and was owned by the man sometimes called one of the forgotten signers of the U.S. Constitution. The site also tells the story of how slaves were treated.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Local police say they’re staffed and ready to run security for the Parade of Lights in light of recent events out of Wisconsin. The Parade of Lights is returning to downtown Sioux Falls for its 29th celebration this year. The parade is slated to start at 7:30 p.m. Friday, bringing lights, floats and music to downtown. Last year’s celebration was canceled amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. In a police briefing Monday, Lt. Andrew Siebenborn discussed potential changes to security for the parade given recent events in Wisconsin that led to multiple deaths and more than 40 people injured in a parade. “We always staff for the worst-case scenario,” Siebenborn said. The incident in Waukesha, Wisconsin, happened during a Christmas parade Sunday. An SUV rammed through the parade, striking a high school band, children’s dance group and the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies. Siebenborn said he couldn’t discuss specifics about the security detail at Sioux Falls’ parade Friday but said weeks and sometimes months of planning go into security protocols. “Credit goes out to our chief and command staff erring on the side of almost overstaffing an event in the interest of safety,” he said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The ex-girlfriend of the man who detonated an explosive in downtown Nashville last Christmas has filed a lawsuit, saying she should receive $284,000 in rewards offered after the blast. Pamela Perry filed suit Friday in Davidson County Chancery Court seeking the reward because she came forward “at great personal risk to aid law enforcement in identifying” Anthony Warner as the bomber. Warner parked an RV in the middle of a tourist district early Dec. 25 before setting off the blast that killed him, injured several others and heavily damaged dozens of buildings, including a key AT&T network facility. After the blast, Camping World CEO Marcus Lemonis offered a $250,000 reward and Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp. offered $34,500 to anyone who came forward with information identifying the bomber. The Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp. gave the $34,500 it raised to law enforcement organizations including the Metro Nashville Police Department. On Friday, convention officials said they hadn’t seen the lawsuit and couldn’t comment, but CEO Butch Spyridon told WTVF-TV in May that hundreds of tips were called in, and an FBI report thanked law enforcement but didn’t identify citizens who gave tips. “I don’t have documentation to say this helped more than anything else,” Spyridon said.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: A late October land transaction helped to complete one of the largest land purchases and donations of unspoiled coastal land in the state. The final 1,360 acres of the Powderhorn Ranch donated to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department will be added to nearly 15,000 acres donated to TPWD in 2018 by the Texas Park and Wildlife Foundation. The transaction conserves one of the state’s largest “unspoiled coastal prairies in Texas,” and it one day will become a state park. “It demonstrates how Texas’ community of conservationists can work hand-in-hand with the state to preserve an extraordinary piece of our natural heritage for generations to come,” said Dan Friedkin, chairman emeritus of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Commission. According to a 2015 story published by Texas Monthly, the land’s history dates back nearly 500 years. The Karankawa hunted there, and the explorers Rene Robert Cavelier and Sieur de La Salle lost a ship to a storm in 1686, according to the story. Included in the land is nearly 11 miles of coast along Matagorda Bay, and the site is near the Aransas Wildlife Refuge, making one of the longest stretches of unspoiled coastline in Texas.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: For decades, the U.S. Forest Service’s practice of putting out wildfires was a huge success. But the policy backfired, setting the stage for the massive destructive wildfires that have flared with increasing regularity across the West. While putting out fires remains a priority, deliberately setting them is becoming more common, especially in Utah, as a more cost-effective and ecologically sound strategy for fixing forest health, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. The pitfalls of fire suppression are evident across Monroe Mountain in central Utah. The plateau’s historically abundant aspen stands are disappearing under thickets of fir and other conifers that have long impeded fresh aspen growth that should be succeeding the aging trees but aren’t. In the hopes of restoring the historic role of fire, at least three Utah national forests plan to sharply expand the use of “prescribed fire” to nurse sickly forests back to health. Like much of the West’s wooded terrain, large parts of the Fishlake National Forest are ecologically wired to burn from time to time. To thrive, aspen groves need to get wiped out from time to time, said Richfield District Ranger Jason Kling of the Fishlake National Forest. “That keeps the fuels in check, not allowing the overgrowth to occur, keeping the landscape open, allowing sunlight to reach the forest floor,” Kling said.\n\nVermont\n\nKillington: Killington ski resort is making final preparations to host women’s World Cup ski racing on Thanksgiving weekend. The event was postponed last year amid the pandemic. This year tickets are being sold to control attendance, and proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test taken within the prior 72 hours is required to attend. “We usually have about 15,000 people each day, and we are trying to cut that in about half. Even though it is an outdoor event, we really wanted to be able to get people to be careful in terms of being too close to each other,” said Mike Solimano, Killington’s president and general manager. Snow guns have been blasting, and race organizer FIS gave Killington a positive snow control Wednesday, which means the race is on. “We’re feeling confident. I mean it’s definitely been warm, and it’s been a struggle, but it looks like we’re gonna make it,” Solimano said last week.\n\nVirginia\n\nManassas: Reports of black bears afflicted with mange are growing in Northern Virginia. What used to be fewer than 10 sightings a year in 2018 has grown to more than 100 annual reports. “Those are just the ones that people see. We’re sure there are quite a few more bears that are out in the woods that are not encountering a person,” said Katie Martin, a deer, bear and turkey biologist for the Virginia Department of Wildlife Resources. The area where most cases are reported is confined to a dozen counties roughly north of Interstate 64 and west of U.S. 29, including Fauquier, Culpeper, Loudoun and Prince William counties. Infestations of sarcoptic mange can be mild, fatal or anywhere in between. “And if it’s a severe case, and they lose all their hair, and they stop eating and become emaciated, then obviously that bear going into the winter is going to have a much harder time surviving,” Martin said. Preventing bears from congregating and spreading the disease to one another has proven to be a challenge. Residents are being asked to do their part. Anyone who has seen a bear near their property is asked to take down bird feeders for a minimum of two weeks after the sighting to prevent the bears from returning. Martin said she believes no one should have bird feeders out at all between April and November.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Steve Hobbs was sworn in Monday as Washington’s 16th secretary of state, the first person of color to head the office and the first Democrat to hold the position in 56 years. Hobbs, who is of Japanese descent, is leaving his Senate seat representing the 44th legislative district to replace Republican Secretary of State Kim Wyman. The fifth consecutive GOP secretary of state in Washington dating back to 1965, Wyman is taking a key election security job in the Biden administration. Hobbs was sworn in by state Supreme Court Justice Mary Yu in the state reception room at the state Capitol, after which he thanked Wyman in his speech, saying she understood and dealt with the threats of cyber and information warfare in the elections sphere. “I’m going to build upon that,” he said. “And I’m glad that we’ll have a partner in Washington, D.C., to build upon that.” Wyman will serve as the election security lead for the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the agency responsible for safeguarding U.S. elections. In the role, she will serve as the federal government’s top liaison to the states. Hobbs said that in addition to building upon cybersecurity efforts in the state, he plans to create a plan to respond to misinformation and disinformation that hits elections.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Tolls on the West Virginia Turnpike will increase at the beginning of next year, officials said. The rate for most passenger vehicles will rise by 5% on Jan. 1, going from $4 to $4.25, West Virginia Parkways Authority Executive Director Jeffrey Miller told a legislative committee, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail. The E-Z Pass annual program will also see an increase from $25 annually to $26.50, Miller said. The proposed fee schedule for the turnpike allows up to a 5% increase every three years, he said. Voters approved selling up to $1.6 billion in bonds to fund the Roads to Prosperity program in 2017, and the Parkways Authority has returned $595 million from tolls to the state to support projects for the 10 counties affected by the Turnpike, Miller said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A judge says the state Department of Natural Resources violated the law by not immediately scheduling a wolf hunting season after federal protections were removed in February. In an order Thursday, Jefferson County Judge Bennett Brantmeier said the agency must hold a hunt immediately any time federal protections are lifted during the statutory hunting season, which runs from November through February. The injunction was issued in response to a lawsuit brought by Hunter Nation Inc. that challenged the agency’s decision not to hold a hunt as soon as the gray wolf was removed from the endangered list in January, the Wisconsin State Journal reports. Brantmeier is the same judge who last winter ordered the DNR to hold a hunt in the final days of February. State-licensed hunters killed at least 218 wolves in less than three days, more than the state and tribal quotas combined. However, wolf hunting in Wisconsin remains on hold while a Dane County judge considers a lawsuit filed in August by a coalition of wildlife advocacy groups seeking to stop the hunt and invalidate the law requiring it. In a ruling last month, Judge Jacob Frost said the law creating the wolf season is constitutional, but the DNR failed to create permanent regulations enacting it.\n\nWyoming\n\nKemmerer: With just four years left before its coal plant shutters, this southwestern Wyoming town, population 2,750, has been bracing for a seemingly inevitable loss. Along with the neighboring coal mine, the Naughton Power Plant is one of the biggest employers in Kemmerer. Its closure was expected to cut local jobs, slash revenue and force some residents to move away for work. Then nuclear developer TerraPower announced last week that it would build a next-generation nuclear reactor in Naughton’s place and staff the new facility with the existing Naughton workforce. Kemmerer and three other candidate coal towns – Glenrock, Gillette and Rock Springs – had waited six months for the decision. Over those months, the prospect of getting an advanced nuclear reactor has injected new optimism into a community used to weathering the booms and busts of the state’s energy industry, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. “We’re absolutely ecstatic,” Mayor Bill Thek said. “We’ve been hopeful from the beginning, and as time went on, we became more and more hopeful.” Some people are apprehensive about living near a demonstration nuclear reactor, he said, but few are outright opposed.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/23"}]}

Elections to be held Tuesday.\n\nCaesar Rodney, four-year term, at-large seat\n\nPolling places\n\nAllen Frear Elementary, 238 Sorghum Mill Road, Camden-Wyoming\n\nW.B. Simpson Elementary, 5 Old North Road, Wyoming\n\nW. Reily Brown Elementary, 360 Webbs Lane, Dover\n\nTawanna Prophet Brinkley, Magnolia\n\nBackground: A school counselor in the Lake Forest District for seven years, Prophet Brinkley was previously a paraprofessional at Fifer Middle School and a preschool teacher for the Early Childhood Assistance Program. She has two children who have graduated from the CR District and one attending now. She’s served as a board member at Early College High School and for four years as first vice president for the national sorority Phi Delta Kappa-Alpha Pi Chapter. She declined to give her age or political party, saying, “I am not influenced by a political party and instead am running with the focus of what is in the best interest of our students. The group that will be influencing the decisions I make are the citizens of the Caesar Rodney School District, the families and the students.”\n\nIssues: The top three factors that motivated her to run for the board are the need for equity, transparency and more parent engagement. She said the most important issues in districts across the country, not just in CR, are staff retention and safety.\n\nWhile the district referendum April 22 didn’t pass, Prophet Brinkley said she was in favor of the plan: “The referendum would have allowed the district to increase educators' salaries and make needed repairs for our schools.”\n\nAs for controversial issues such as critical race theory, parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices and transgender policies, she said she wouldn’t comment on critical race theory specifically but, “Culturally relative/culturally responsive teaching is a priority. I believe parental involvement in the district's curriculum choices should be taken into consideration. Regarding transgender policies, I believe we should treat all individuals like we would want to be treated and that is with love, respect and support.”\n\nNicole Hill, 44, Dover\n\nBackground: Hill is the Kent County coordinator for Read Aloud Delaware since March 2021, recruiting, training and coordinating volunteers to read in childcare centers and writing grant proposals to help fund the program. She worked for the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control as an environmental scientist and program manager. She has three children who attend district schools and listed her political affiliation as independent.\n\nIssues: Hill decided to run for the board because, “I am a proud CR graduate and I received an excellent education that helped to prepare me for college and the workforce. I want the same, or better, for all of the students attending CR schools.” She is concerned about the safety of students and staff and heard other parents express concerns. “As a mom of three kids that attend schools in the district and a wife of a CR teacher, I felt that I could offer a unique perspective in these areas as well as many others.”\n\nShe said the top issue is the recruitment and retention of quality educators. She favors competitive pay, expanding the search for candidates by also recruiting outside Delaware and using alternative certification programs for those with degrees other than in education. She wants to encourage students interested in becoming teachers by promoting the high school’s education pathway.\n\nAs for the district referendum that failed April 22, Hill was initially against the plan, \"but after attending one of the district meetings explaining the need for the referendum, I felt that I had a much better understanding of why it was necessary.” She said the district should improve communication with the community and explain what’s been done to cut expenses before asking for another referendum because an increase in taxes is difficult for most families, including hers. \"However, it is challenging for the district to continue to provide high-quality programs as well as recruit and maintain quality educators without adequate operating funds,” she said.\n\nOn controversial issues like critical race theory, parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices and transgender policies, Hill said, “Students should have access to a wide variety of educational resources. Schools should foster an environment that encourages the exploration of different perspectives and ideas while ensuring that materials are developmentally appropriate. I am in favor of parental involvement in the district’s curriculum choices.”\n\nSchool boards should listen to families, review the curriculum, seek expert advice, consider alternatives and communicate the decisions transparently.\n\n“All students have the right to access quality education without discrimination,” she said.\n\nEmily Phelan, 40, Magnolia\n\nBackground: An Air Force veteran, Phelan also worked as a medical receptionist and is now a Realtor. She is the Allen Frear Elementary PTA vice president with a daughter who attends the school and a stepson who graduated from the district. As for political affiliation, she said she's fiscally conservative but more libertarian in her views that political/social agendas shouldn’t be part of public school education.\n\nIssues: She was motivated to run for the board because teachers need help, students are falling behind particularly with low reading and math scores, and change is needed. She said the top issue in the district is disciplinary discrepancy. She favors examining discipline policies to make them more consistent, with more accountability and transparency. “We need to have ground rules. They need to be clear cut,\" Phelan said. \"While younger children need more guidance in what is right and wrong, by the time the older students are getting ready to go out into the world, they need to be better prepared for the consequences of their actions.”\n\nAs for the district referendum that failed April 22, Phelan said she realizes the district needs help, but she was against this referendum because she wants more transparency about how the district is spending money. She believes schools need financial help, “but this was asking too much, too fast with too little information.”\n\nOn controversial issues like critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, Phelan said, “I’m all for parental rights in schools. More parents should be involved. That will help with accountability and teacher-parent relations. I also believe political and social agendas shouldn’t be part of school curriculum. Maybe we could have after-school programs for parents who want that for their children.”\n\nLake Forest\n\nNo election.

Deinert, 34, Lincoln\n\nBackground: Deinert graduated from the Milford School District and two of her three children are enrolled in district schools. She serves as Parent Teacher Partnership president at Morris Early Childhood Center and serves on the Parent Teacher Partnership at Ross Elementary School. She coaches for the Milford Little League and Girls On The Run.\n\nDeinert has a master's degree in special education and over 10 years of experience in teaching and administration. She declined to state her political party affiliation.\n\nIssues: Deinert wants to focus on school safety, discipline, bullying, increasing family and community engagement and academic achievement.\n\nAshlee Connell, Milford\n\nThis candidate did not respond to requests for comments from Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nDistrict A\n\nNo election.

School Lane, Smyrna\n\nSmyrna Middle School, 700 Duck Creek Parkway, Smyrna\n\nKenton Ruritan Club, 249 S. Main St., Kenton\n\nMarie Fontaine St. Pierre, 39, Smyrna\n\nBackground: A Realtor for nearly six years, Fontaine St. Pierre has a 17-year-old son who attends Smyrna High School. For four years, she's served on the town of Smyrna Board of Adjustment which rules on zoning variance requests. She’s a member of the Alpha Beta Gamma sorority at Delaware Technical Community College, the Holly’s Club and the Boys and Girls Club board. She declined to disclose her political party, advocating a neutral approach in school board elections.\n\nIssues: Fontaine St. Pierre decided to run for the board because she wants to serve as “a liaison between parents, teachers and the community, providing the best resources for our children's education, and allowing parents to have the most influence in their children's life.” She wants to recognize and prioritize instructors' interests and concerns.\n\nShe said the most important issues in the district are continuing to push for high-quality, intellectually-rigorous education to prepare students for the competitive labor market, providing safe schools, confronting bullying and cyberbullying, and expanding self-esteem initiatives for students.\n\nAs for controversial issues such as critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “An inclusive educational system offers various advantages, including enhanced educational quality for all students and assisting students in becoming more responsive to an inclusive attitude. This could also help with behavioral issues, self-esteem, social skills, and community involvement. All students have the right to a challenging core education and outstanding instruction from well-trained educators. Students should be allowed to have an open and honest discussion about America's past, and they deserve to see themselves and the issues that impact them reflected in their classrooms and books.”\n\nShe encourages parents to attend board meetings to address issues and share comments and insights.\n\nBobbi Jo Webber, 44, Kenton\n\nBackground: A farmer for over 25 years along with her husband on their family’s farm, she has two children, a son who attends Smyrna High School and a daughter at Clayton Intermediate School. She’s volunteered for 10 years at Sunnyside Elementary and Clayton Intermediate School, running fundraisers, helping teachers in classrooms and hosting free field trips at her family’s farm. She declined to disclose her political party: “I believe that a school board election is not a political race.\"\n\nIssues: Webber wanted to run for school board to improve safety, success of students, transparency and teacher compensation. She believes teachers and staff should hold students accountable for misconduct and follow through with consequences, but also favors hiring constables “who will help pull some of that responsibility off of the teachers so that they can focus on education.” She wants the administration to notify parents “about important issues that occur in the schools – the good and the bad.” She also favors competitive pay: “We cannot lose these amazing educators we have to neighboring districts because of financial reasons.”\n\nAs for controversial issues such as critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “In my opinion, all races and groups should be represented in our classes. Our students should be exposed to a well-rounded curriculum. Bias and unfounded opinion do not belong in the classroom.”\n\nOn transgender policies, Webber said, “I believe that students can express themselves in a way that they feel is appropriate, although personal expression cannot become a distraction for other students. I do not approve of transgender students using the locker room or rest room of their choice of gender. I feel it could develop into an unsafe and distracting situation for other students.\"\n\nIn curriculum decisions, she said parents and community members should have their opinions represented, but they also need to trust educators to make decisions that will benefit students’ education.\n\nWoodbridge\n\nNo election.

And districts in Delaware’s largest county have been no stranger to unruly debates, packed meetings and sharp tensions.\n\nNow, such a trend continues to trickle down to local elections.\n\nNew Castle County hosts the heaviest competition in school board races this year — as Appoquinimink, Red Clay and Christina public schools post contentious races for open seats.\n\nPushes to strip mask mandates and return to in-person learning dominated rooms in the pandemic.

However, general opposition to social justice themes — from banning books, challenging critical race theory or other representation — are expected to appear in new packaging, members said, from discussions of a \"Parent Bill of Rights\" to concerns of \"indoctrination.”\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHigh learning:New plan promises experience outside the classroom will earn college credit in Delaware\n\nAll of these hot-button issues have, however, brought more eyes to school boards.\n\n\"That's a good thing,\" said Sadé Truiett, the PTA’s vice president of advocacy, back in March. \"We want people involved in our school boards, for people to really be speaking about the things that matter to our kids in our schools.\"\n\nSchool board races are considered nonpartisan, though the races have become increasingly rife with political discourse and party influence.\n\nThis year’s election comes on Tuesday, May 9.

It has since been changed, as the organization remains nonpartisan.\n\nAt-Large seat\n\nTashiba A. Graham, 40, Townsend\n\nBackground: Tashiba Graham is vice president of operations and innovation for a healthcare system in Pennsylvania. The mother of two has a youngest son in the Appoquinimink School District.\n\nIssues: According to Graham, the focus of her campaign is advocating for students with special needs, school safety and teacher retention. She shared her intention to introduce regular assemblies to combat bullying and violence in schools and address general mental wellness among students.\n\nGraham has stated her support for paying teachers and staff members a more competitive salary and improving incentives for new candidates while also evaluating what factors are working to keep staff members in the district. Engaging family members on resources available for students is another priority of hers.\n\nIn response to ACLU-DE voters guide questionnaire regarding national movements restricting certain curriculum material, Graham remains adamant that policies must be put in place to keep the district’s curriculum factual and comprehensive and protect the rights and inclusion of LGBTQ+ students. Graham has been supported by Appoquinimink Educational Support Professionals, First State Action Fund and more.\n\nEducation roundup:Delaware is 1 of 5 states to get $1 million for tutoring in schools\n\nTimothy W. Johns, 57, Middletown\n\nNote: This candidate did not return any requests for contribution from Delaware Online/The News Journal.\n\nBackground: Timothy Johns is an entrepreneur and co-founder of Heaven’s Gate Ministries, which he runs with his wife, Monique, in Newark. As co-founder, Johns oversees nonprofit charity work and established a leadership institute, where he has worked as an educator for 12 years. The U.S Army veteran is a father of four adult children.\n\nIssues: Johns says he's mainly concerned with bridging the achievement gap between students of different backgrounds and accessibilities, while setting students up for success in the global marketplace with leadership skills.\n\nJohns has stated during a public Q&A session that he believes conversations related to sexual orientation and gender identity are “family matters\" and should be left out of the classroom. He proposes setting up a public forum where debates about curriculum censorship can take place and be evaluated fairly.\n\nRestorative justice is another hallmark of Johns’ campaign, he told ACLU-DE in its voter guide, which includes training staff members and SROs about de-escalation techniques. He also proposes enhancing parent participation within the district by holding parent education classes focused on child development and communication.\n\nRaymond J. Petkevis, 45, Middletown\n\nBackground: Raymond Petkevis is a real estate broker for Keller Williams Realty around the Middletown area and recently started a position as Delaware’s principal broker for REAL, a virtual-based real estate company. His two children are students in Appoquinimink.\n\nIssues: Petkevis has mainly expressed concerns about violence in schools, citing outreach from community members worried about student safety. To combat this, reevaluating measures of rule enforcement and the district’s code of conduct have been suggested by the candidate.\n\nThe district’s teacher shortage and dwindling test scores are intertwined with issues related to violence in the district, according to Petkevis. In response to Citizens For Delaware Schools', he also recommended potentially soliciting funding from local developers to go toward the district’s resources and implementing financial responsibility into the curriculum for high school students.\n\nPolls will be open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nAlfred G.

The alumna of Red Clay Public Schools holds a bachelor's degree in dance, as well as another bachelor's degree in English and a master's in education from the University of Delaware. Gilbert is a certified teacher, with experience from K-12 special education to high school English Language Arts, though currently a stay-at-home mother to her four children. Her two daughters and two sons attended private schools in Delaware.\n\nIssues: “Let me be clear,\" wrote this candidate on her Facebook page, operating as a landing pad for other campaign materials. \"The school’s role is to educate, NOT indoctrinate. Reading, writing, mathematics (not Common Core), true history (not Critical Race Theory or whatever name they’ve morphed it to).”\n\nGilbert said plummeting test scores in the district motivate her to run, alongside hopes to boost graduation rates and college readiness. She lists safety, effectiveness, curriculum and transparency as her priorities on her website. Among top-of-mind issues, she also noted parents and guardians \"will have their voices heard.\"\n\nLearning loss concerns:What’s the cost of failing math? Well, for Delaware kids it could be $66 billion\n\nDouglas Danger Manley, 38, Newark\n\nBackground: Manley works at a cybersecurity startup as a software engineer, an industry and occupation he’s found himself in for about 17 years. The Newark resident is also a volunteer firefighter with Mill Creek Fire Company, where he’s been for the past decade. He’s now its president, after having served on the board for three years.\n\nManaging a $3-4 million budget with Mill Creek, Manley told The News Journal/Delaware Online he’s used to dealing with a fixed amount of funding from state and local governments — which leave a “need to squeeze every bit of value out of that funding as we can to provide our services.”\n\nIssues: Manley has no children, and he sees that as an asset. He says this will allow him to maintain a public-service perspective. The candidate shared his focus on supporting resources for Christina School District, sharpening communication and community engagement. He also said protecting students will be a priority, especially gay or transgender children — but he hopes the district “focuses on its mission of education and doesn't get lost in the mire” of various culture wars.\n\nDistrict E\n\nY.F. Lou, 36, Newark\n\nBackground: The single father of two children, enrolled in Christina, works with the state’s health department, where he said his work focuses on improving healthcare for the most vulnerable in long-term care facilities. He also serves as a volunteer firefighter for Aetna Hose, Hook and Ladder Company. Lou's family moved to Delaware from China when he was young, an experience the candidate believes will allow him to advocate for Christina's diverse student body, as he said in a late-March candidate forum. He attended public school in Lewes, graduated from the University of Delaware, and has been a full-time Newark resident since 2012. Lou also attended both University of Southern California and Johns Hopkins University, Bloomberg School of Public Health for graduate degrees.\n\nIssues: With an 8-year-old at West Park Elementary — and a 5-year-old headed there in the fall — Lou finds himself motivated by three key issues: safety, community engagement and a goal to \"broaden our students’ horizons.\"\n\nFor Lou, safety includes keeping guns out of schools, \"fostering a safe and welcoming environment for all of our students especially those most vulnerable,\" as well as monitoring environmental health and safety, such as lead. Community and stakeholder engagement, as he put it, focuses on how the pandemic created opportunities to capitalize on for information sharing and family engagement. In terms of broadening horizons, the candidate hopes to see more support of art programs to keep students \"curious and innovative.\"\n\nYong Peng, 53, Newark\n\nBackground: Peng works for the federal government as a software engineer, having previously worked for companies like Delmarva Power and Bank of America. Peng, in one candidate forum, called himself a “happy immigrant” focused on giving back to Delaware. Peng was born in China and came to the U.S. to study. The 15-year resident of Newark has a doctorate in physics, having worked in research and teaching at a few universities before his current line of work. Peng said he has also worked as a math tutor in Wilmington.\n\nIssues: Peng said he sees a “crisis in public education.” Two issues are top-of-mind for the father of two. One, he perceives too much focus on topics that are “ignoring the core curriculum,” which are reading, writing and math. He didn't elaborate. Two, he believes school policies are failing at “enhancing the parent's right to oversee their children’s education.” Peng said his daughter used to study in Christina School District, though no longer, and now he is running for the future of the community.\n\nPolling places, open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nPulaski Elementary School , 1300 Cedar St., Wilmington\n\n, 1300 Cedar St., Wilmington The Bancroft School , 700 N.

Before that, English-Wynn worked in the Department of Labor as a deputy principal. This career, the candidate said, meets more than 10 years of experience in mentorship and advocacy connected to K-12 education and the community. A \"proud alumna\" of Red Clay schools herself, English-Wynn also has a young child entering the district this fall. She said the Wilmington district prepared her for later degrees from Wilmington University and Delaware State.\n\nIssues: The alumna said the impact of both \"a supportive community and quality education\" are keys to students succeeding. She noted three issues motivating her campaign: equity and access, parent engagement and support for educators.\n\nWilmington:They struggled during Ida. Now one Wilmington community is finding a better way to respond\n\nJohn Shulli, 50, Wilmington\n\nBackground: Born and raised in Wilmington, Shulli returned to his home state after 26 years in the U.S. Army and Department of Defense — 22 of which were spent overseas. He works in a civilian job on A.I. policy for the Pentagon, as well as teaches part time as a colonel in the Army Reserve. He graduated from John Dickinson High School before attending Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Arizona.\n\nIssues: Shulli said he's motivated to run by the \"severe\" learning loss faced since the pandemic and highlighted in state and district's statistics. The district must, as he sees it, \"restore our children’s academic standings so they can compete in a local, regional, national and global jobs market.\"\n\nDistrict D\n\nCarlucci Coelho, 53, Wilmington\n\nBackground: Coelho said he came to the U.S. hoping to work as an artist. He has worked in real estate since 2017, as well as the nonprofit sector. He earned a two-year degree in fashion business, according to his website, alongside a parallel degree in costume and set design while studying in Portugal. Though he doesn't have kids enrolled in the district, Coelho said he's been close to the community for over 30 years. Coelho also ran for state representative as a Republican last year, but did not secure a win in District 13.\n\nIssues: Coelho stressed that he is against any kind of bullying, citing that protecting safety in schools is paramount in his platform. Another motivating issue is budgeting, making sure money is distributed \"to those schools and programs who need the most.\" He also said he supports strong academics alongside more vocational training in every school.\n\nIn other background, in response to a question for the ACLU-DE voter's guide about the teaching of U.S. history and whether students have the right to learn free of viewpoint-based censorship, Coelho said parents should have \"the choice of accepting or denying what their own kids have the right or not to read. These children have parents who have different views about life and we must respect all parents views.\" Also when running for state representative, the candidate expressed support for a failed 2022 bill aimed at barring transgender athletes to compete in school sports, saying: \"Woman sports is woman sports.\"\n\nJose Matthews, 27, Elsmere\n\nBackground: Matthews has represented District D on the Red Clay School Board since 2018. Working in the healthcare field in different capacities over the last six years, his day job is working a community liaison for Rockford Center, a community mental health organization. The incumbent lives in Elsmere with his husband, who is a teacher.\n\nIssues: Matthews said he wants to keep up his work. In his first term, he said, the board tackled many issues related to equity around the pandemic, one being transparency. He said he \"was one of the biggest supporters on the board to make sure we continue to provide a Zoom option both to watch the meetings and to participate in public comment.\" If elected, he hopes to continue to offer that access.\n\nRed Clay has fallen behind other northern New Castle County districts, Matthews said, in terms of keep up with building maintenance and competitive salaries. He plans to make that competitiveness a priority, even if it means the district's first referendum in nearly a decade. He also aims to maintain a focus on family and parent engagement.\n\nPolling places, open 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:\n\nActivity Center at Hockessin PAL , 7259 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin\n\n, 7259 Lancaster Pike, Hockessin AI DuPont High School , 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington\n\n, 50 Hillside Road, Wilmington Baltz Elementary School ,1500 Spruce Ave., Wilmington\n\n,1500 Spruce Ave., Wilmington Cab Calloway School of Arts , 100 N.

For four years, she's handled zoning variance requests on the town of Smyrna's Board of Adjustment. She’s a member of the Alpha Beta Gamma sorority at Delaware Technical Community College, the Holly’s Club and the Boys and Girls Club board.\n\nIssues: Fontaine St. Pierre decided to run for the board because she wants to serve as “a liaison between parents, teachers and the community, providing the best resources for our children's education, and allowing parents to have the most influence in their children's life.” She wants to recognize and prioritize instructors' interests and concerns.\n\nShe said the most important issues in the district are continuing to push for high-quality, intellectually-rigorous education to prepare students for the competitive labor market, providing safe schools, confronting bullying and cyberbullying and expanding self-esteem initiatives for students.\n\nAs for controversial issues such as critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “An inclusive educational system offers various advantages, including enhanced educational quality for all students and assisting students in becoming more responsive to an inclusive attitude. This could also help with behavioral issues, self-esteem, social skills, and community involvement. All students have the right to a challenging core education and outstanding instruction from well-trained educators. Students should be allowed to have an open and honest discussion about America's past, and they deserve to see themselves and the issues that impact them reflected in their classrooms and books.”\n\nShe encourages parents to attend board meetings to address issues and share comments and insights.\n\nBobbi Jo Webber, 44, Kenton\n\nBackground: A farmer for over 25 years along with her husband on their family’s farm, she has two children, a son who is a freshman at Smyrna High School and a daughter in sixth grade at Clayton Intermediate School. She’s volunteered for 10 years at Sunnyside Elementary and at Clayton Intermediate School, running fundraisers, helping teachers in classrooms and hosting free field trips at her family’s farm.\n\nIssues: Webber wanted to run for school board to improve safety, success of students, transparency and teacher compensation. She believes teachers and staff should hold students accountable for misconduct and follow through with consequences, but also favors hiring constables “who will help pull some of that responsibility off of the teachers so that they can focus on education.” She wants the administration to notify parents “about important issues that occur in the schools – the good and the bad.” She favors competitive pay: “We cannot lose these amazing educators we have to neighboring districts because of financial reasons.”\n\nIn regard to issues like critical race theory, transgender policies and parental involvement in a district’s curriculum choices, she said, “All races and groups should be represented in our classes. Our students should be exposed to a well-rounded curriculum. Bias and unfounded opinion do not belong in the classroom.”\n\nOn transgender policies, Webber said, “I believe that students can express themselves in a way that they feel is appropriate, although personal expression cannot become a distraction for other students. I do not approve of transgender students using the locker room or restroom of their choice of gender. I feel it could develop into an unsafe and distracting situation for other students.\"\n\nIn curriculum decisions, she said parents and community members should have their opinions represented, but they also need to trust educators to make decisions that will benefit students’ education.\n\nPolling places, open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/05/09/delaware-school-board-members-election-2023/70194477007/", "title": "Delaware school board election results: Here are the newest members", "text": "Tuesday brought nearly 21,000 Delawareans to the polls for elections impacting kids, schools and their communities.\n\nSchool board races in New Castle County hosted some of the heaviest competition this year, but ballots were cast across every county May 9.\n\nDelmar and Milford schools technically dominated in turnout across districts at 10% and 8% of registered voters, respectively, according to results released about 10 p.m. However, Red Clay's 4.4% carried nearly double the votes of both combined at over 4,700.\n\nAverage turnout was just under 5%.\n\nPreliminary results now reveal the latest additions to Delaware's school boards, most set to serve for four years in these new seats.

School referendums splinter communities", "text": "Matthew Albright, and Saranac Hale Spencer\n\nThe News Journal\n\nVoters are set to consider three referendums statewide that would would raise almost $500 million.\n\nSchool district officials say they're forced to ask for money because of the state's complex funding system.\n\nThe regular referendums have sparked tension among voters who are asked to fund education.\n\nSpring is the time of year when education turns into politics, when school districts give residents a choice: Vote to raise property taxes or face teacher and program cuts.\n\nNobody — not seniors, not parents, not even school officials who say the money is desperately needed — like asking for a tax hike.\n\nSchool supporters and parents bemoan the fact that educators and parents are forced to campaign for referendums, rather than focus on teaching children.\n\nWhat's frequently misunderstood by citizens is that referendums are often intended only to keep the status quo, supporters say. But Delaware's complex school funding system has made it difficult to convince voters the increases are necessary to cover growing student enrollment and maintenance costs.\n\n\"There's so much time and energy that has to be poured into it, it's just hundreds and hundreds of man hours,\" said Eve Buckley, a Christina School District parent who is one of the volunteer leaders in an effort to pass that district's referendum on Wednesday. \"And it's time you're using just in hopes of staying where we are, maybe getting a little better, not providing some big new idea. The process is a real drain.\"\n\nBrandywine and Cape Henlopen also are seeking voters' approval that day. The three referendums combined would raise almost $500 million.\n\nThe success of those votes comes down to whether district officials can coax enough parents with children in public schools to go to the polls. They must outnumber those who don't feel they have a stake in the schools or who feel districts should do more to prove they deserve a tax increase.\n\n\"If I go to my boss and haven't done what I'm supposed to ... I don't ask for a raise,\" said Susan Welsh, who wants to see Christina begin to improve student test scores and find efficiencies before she votes in favor. \"I love my child enough to vote 'no' and hold them [the district] accountable to raising the ranking before I give them a raise.\"\n\nDistrict supporters say referendums aren't a luxury. They are a necessity.\n\nMoney that pays for schools is a mix of state, federal and local funds. While the state's portion grows as districts enroll more students, the local portion comes from property taxes that don't increase to match growing costs.\n\nIf districts don't get the money to cover those costs, the results can be demoralizing, Buckley says.\n\n\"You want to think you're part of a community that is at least reasonably supportive of public education, and then something like what happened last year takes place,\" she said. \"And then you start to worry about this negative feedback loop, where people think the district isn't worthy, so then we have to cut budgets. And that means the schools suffer, and the perception only gets reinforced.\"\n\nActing Christina Superintendent Bob Andrzejewski says its dangerous to leave districts without a steady, reliable base of funding.\n\n\"There are no reruns when it comes to education,\" he said. \"If a student misses out on important educational services because there's no money, you can't go back and make that up later.\"\n\nChristina is seeking about $16 million, which would amount to roughly $192 a year more in taxes for the average homeowner, according to the district. That money would be used to plug some of the holes left after the district slashed $9 million from its budget last year and would also add some new programs.\n\nBrandywine is asking taxpayers for money to cover operating expenses, for work on school buildings and to put synthetic turf on its athletic fields. It estimates that an average home-owner would pay an extra $243 per year for the next three years and $206 per year after the $1.7 million turf project will be done. The district needs $19.3 million for the building projects and $9.5 million for operating expenses.\n\nThe referendum in Cape Henlopen is a little different – it is asking voters for money that would be used strictly for building two elementary schools and doing work on two others, which is the last phase in a 20-year, long-term plan that the district committed itself to in 1999. The total cost for the project is $154.5 million, but local taxpayers are being asked to shoulder $48.4 million of it.\n\nSwaying the public\n\nThe base of the bloc that typically votes against referendums is believed to be older residents who don't have children, don't directly benefit from the tax increases and are often on fixed incomes.\n\nOlder residents vote more than younger residents. And low-income families are less likely to vote than more affluent families, who may not send their children to traditional public schools, Buckley said.\n\nThat stacks referendums against the districts.\n\n\"It's a huge challenge, no question,\" Buckley said.\n\nIn Christina's first referendum last year, when voters slapped down a tax increase by an almost three-to-one margin, turnout in more affluent suburban areas dwarfed turnout in poorer urban areas.\n\nSTORY: Robocalls used in Christina schools referendum\n\nSTORY: Wilmington redistricting plan advances on shaky ground\n\n\n\nIn five polling places in Wilmington, there were a total of 258 votes. At a single suburban polling place – McVey Elementary, just off the University of Delaware campus – more than 556 people voted.\n\nThe vote failed 2,119 – 6,076.\n\nWhen Christina took a second shot with a smaller referendum last year, the district made more energetic efforts to get the word out to voters, and turnout evened out somewhat. The referendum failed again, but this time by less than 900 votes out of more than 11,000.\n\n\"The support's there,\" said Brian Stephan, a parent with two children in Christina and co-chair of the district's referendum steering committee. \"It's just tapping into it and letting them know where to be and what you're voting for.\"\n\nPart of the problem, supporters say, is that the state's school finance system is so complicated.\n\nStephan points out that school referendums are the only time residents get to choose whether to tax themselves. For other taxes, elected representatives choose when to raise rates; citizens vote those representatives out if they don't like their choices.\n\n\"It's the one chance that people get, so they tend to vent some of their frustrations,\" he said. \"It doesn't just become about school taxes, it's all taxes. And that makes it hard for us.\"\n\nReferendum opponents do frequently bring up other tax proposals.\n\n\"The governor wants to put more money in for the gas tax, he wants to give more money to the casinos,\" said Marie Lulfs, a 76-year-old Christina resident. \"Everybody wants more money, and where are they getting it from? The taxpayer.\"\n\nWhat's at stake\n\nNobody knows the impacts of a failed referendum quite like Christina parents and teachers.\n\nAfter voters twice rejected tax increases last year, the district made more than $9 million in cuts, laying off 78 teachers and 14 aides.\n\nStephan's daughter's first-grade class has 37 students, far more than last year.\n\n\"That has been an extreme challenge for her teacher and for her,\" Stephan said. \"You can just tell when she comes home from school.\"\n\nSupporters like Stephan say it is hard to make voters understand that operating referendums don't necessarily mean a district is seeking new goodies. In some cases, like Christina's, they are simply asking for enough money to preserve the level of services.\n\nAbout 55 percent of Christina's budget comes from state funding, while 38 percent comes from local property taxes (the rest comes from federal sources).\n\nThe state's share of school taxes grows as the district adds students, but the property tax revenue doesn't always do so.\n\nUnlike many states, school taxes don't automatically adjust for inflation. So when costs of things like fuel and electricity go up, the money a district gets from property taxes buys less and less.\n\nIf more of the budget goes toward overhead, there is less available for educational programs.\n\nThat argument hasn't convinced some referendum opponents.\n\n\"They got $20 million five years ago – it didn't do anything,\" said Welsh. \"So what's this $16 million going to do? There's no proof in the pudding.\"\n\nA better system?\n\nMichael Griffith, who studies school finance issues at the Colorado-based Education Commission of the States, said local school funding mechanisms vary widely from state to state. When it comes to picking the best method, he said figuring out \"the one true religion is probably easier than this.\"\n\nMost states require voter approval for school tax increases, he said. But many allow districts the choice to occasionally raise taxes by a small amount, usually tied to an inflation rate, without going to voters.\n\n\"If you believe in public education, as we do, the quality of our childrens' educational experience should not depend on a vote,\" Andrzejewski said. \"There are very few states left in the country that require referendums for operating expenses.\"\n\nAndrzejewski, who was previously Red Clay superintendent and has worked on several referendums, argues the state should move to a similar system. Delaware's vo-tech school districts, he points out, are given the ability to raise taxes up to a certain cap before getting the General Assembly's approval.\n\n\"There is a politically accepted, viable model that Delaware already has,\" Andrzejewski said. \"School board members are elected officials just as the General Assembly is. They should be trusted to make a prudent financial decision on behalf of the community.\"\n\nFor taxpayers, Andrzejewski said a system like this would allow districts to raise taxes gradually over time, instead of periodically hitting them with one big increase all at once. Inflation rates are typically under two percent; by contrast, Christina is looking for a 21 percent increase in its tax rate.\n\nThere are two big caveats, Andrzejewski says.\n\nFirst, school board members should be required to get financial training and should be penalized if they don't.\n\nAnd second, districts should still be required to go to referendum for major new programs or building campaigns.\n\nAre schools 'electioneering?\n\nAnother problem is Delaware districts are sometimes accused of employing underhanded tactics to get the votes they need.\n\nThe same day Christina's first referendum failed in 2015, Red Clay passed one. Almost immediately, some residents cried foul.\n\nMany Red Clay schools held parent engagement events on the night of the vote in their buildings, which serve as polling places. Several older voters said those events crowded parking lots, denying them parking spaces that were close enough for them to make it in to vote. It also boosted turnout among parents.\n\nAn ACLU of Delaware lawsuit over those claims is still making its way through the courts. Red Clay maintains that it took sufficient steps to provide enough parking and argued it frequently holds events at schools to keep parents engaged in their kids' education.\n\nSTORY: Christina School District takes third try at referendum\n\nSTORY: UD to make SAT optional\n\nState Sen. Karen Peterson, D-Stanton, received numerous complaints from constituents.\n\n\"Last year's Red Clay district referendum was the poster child for what's wrong with the whole system,\" Peterson said. \"There was so much electioneering that went on inside the polling places that it was just an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nPeterson says this isn't the first time a district has been accused of electioneering, referencing a so-called \"Pizza-gate\" incident a few years ago in which Smyrna schools threw pizza parties at schools on referendum night.\n\n\"I couldn't stand inside a polling place and hand out pizza if you voted for me,\" Peterson said.\n\nPeterson has proposed a bill that would change how districts go out to referendums.\n\nFirst, schools could only seek one referendum a year, at the same time as school board elections. That would save the state Department of Elections money and force districts to make one pitch for what they really need.\n\nThe fact that districts often come right back with referendum requests if a previous one fails upsets many opponents.\n\n\"If you say 'no' once, I mean 'no,\" Lulfs said. \"You don't have to keep shoving it down my throat.\"\n\nPeterson's bill would also have referendums conducted via mail. That would make more voters aware of the issues, she said, and prevent the inherent problems in having polling places that directly benefit from the results of a vote.\n\n\"We don't have to worry about all this going on at the schools,\" she said.\n\nWhile Peterson argues these changes would make the system fairer, she agrees with some school supporters who say broader change is a good idea.\n\n\"These districts can get in a really bad place, because this is money they really do need,\" she said. \"But you're asking people to vote for a tax on themselves. Something has to change.\"\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428, or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.

The first part adds 10 cents to purchase land and pay for construction and would decrease over time; the second part increases the tax rate by 17 cents starting in 2016.\n\nHad voters rejected the referendum, the district would have been forced to purchase more modular buildings to accommodate for growing enrollment.

Thomas Wagner Jr. “At the end of the day, if you are the board, it is your responsibility.”\n\nAmong the processes questioned were unauthorized use of the board president’s signature stamp to approve transactions, a payroll process controlled entirely by the CFO “that severely lacked documentation and review” and an abundance of in-state meals that did not appear to meet the criteria provided by the state’s Budget and Accounting Manual.\n\nSeveral employees stated they were forced to share log-in credentials into the state’s accounting system, which is a violation of the state’s computer usage security policies, according to the audit.\n\nSeveral types of purchases were deemed inappropriate or questionable based on a lack of supporting documentation. Those included a Teacher of the Year ceremony held at Baywood Greens for approximately $7,000, Alex and Ani bracelets totaling $352 for certain district office staff and a Tiffany & Co. bracelet for $380 as a recognition gift to Superintendent Susan Bunting.\n\nIn December 2015, the auditor's office received complaints on its fraud hotline about alleged financial misconduct by district CFO Patrick Miller. The audit of the district’s $50 million annual budget began shortly after Miller was placed on leave April 24. Miller later submitted his resignation, effective June 30.\n\nSTORY: DuPont to end pension contribution for active employees\n\nSTORY: Student breathalyzers anger Smyrna parents\n\nWhen the audit was launched for the time period of July 1, 2011 to June 30, 2016, district officials did not reveal what led to Miller’s involuntary leave or the state of the audit itself. On Thursday, district grant writer David Maull said comment would be reserved until a Friday morning briefing at the district office in Selbyville.\n\nWagner said Bunting and the Indian River School District were very cooperative during the investigation.\n\n“They accepted the findings and want to fix the problems in the district,” Wagner said. “Dr. Bunting has asked for our help. I think in a year and a half from now, Indian River will be running smooth and fine. She seriously wants to fix the problems.”\n\nThe findings come less than a week before Indian River School District's referendum seeking additional local funding for school security programs, technology, textbooks, student organizations and measures related to enrollment growth.\n\nWagner waved off any suggestion the timing was political, saying people are going to think what they want.\n\n“The two don’t equate to each other. We just try to put the facts out there in a timely manner,” he said.\n\nIn the Nov. 22 referendum, the district is seeking a tax increase of 49 cents per $100 of assessed property value to raise $7.35 million in operating funds.\n\nThe district has experienced budget issues because of enrollment growth, including an increase of 296 students from last year, giving the district 10,467 students. Enrollment has grown an average of 3 to 4 percent every year since 2010.\n\nThe Indian River School District was formed in 1969 through the consolidation of several smaller districts and now is the fifth-largest district in the state. There are eight elementary schools, three middle schools, two high schools and three special service schools over 365-square miles.\n\nFurther findings from the audit revealed that Miller made a payment of $20,343 to the Indian River Volunteer Fire company, and another for $32,500 to the Boys & Girls Club of Oak Orchard/Riverdale. The CFO served as board president for both organizations.\n\nThe audit also found “the District’s processes centralized around the CFO’s review and approval of financial transactions due to the District’s complete trust in him. This blind trust resulted in the CFO’s work not being reviewed and the complete absence of policies and procedures, amongst other issues discussed in this report. Because of these deficient internal controls, an environment in which employees were intimidated and afraid to speak up or report concerns was created.”\n\nMiller also had been audited in his previous job as business manager of the Brandywine School District. He faced criminal charges as the result of that audit and resolved his legal troubles by entering a no contest plea before Superior Court Judge Carl Goldstein.\n\nSettlement of those charges came after he began his new position with the Indian River School District.\n\nReach Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com.

John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, who chairs a Senate subcommittee on food and nutrition, didn't support the deal because of the cuts to food stamps and saw it as foreshadowing of a shutdown fight.\n\n\"I won't give Republicans an opening to try and take food from more food insecure Americans in Farm Bill negotiations later this year,\" he said at the time.\n\nNow, food stamps are among the sticking points in government funding debates and potential shutdown talks.\n\nAt issue is the farm bill, which is passed every five years and funds food programs like SNAP, sets policies for how food is grown and conserved, helps farmers and more.\n\nSome 25 House Democrats on the Agriculture committee sent a letter to Speaker Kevin McCarthy last month during recess, urging Republicans to stop calling for deeper cuts.\n\nRanking member Rep. David Scott, D-Ga., said the partisan negotiations over the farm bill, like in 2014 and 2018, cause \"a great deal of anxiety in rural America.\"\n\n\"That should be enough of a reminder to you that playing partisan SNAP politics does nothing to address the needs of our farm and ranch families who depend on the other components of the farm bill, whether it’s the farm safety net, conservation, trade or other titles,\" Scott said in the letter to McCarthy.\n\nThe letter came after one of McCarthy's top negotiators, Republican Rep. Garrett Graves of Louisiana, talked to Politico and opened the door to more cuts.\n\n\"We kind of got what we could get in the debt ceiling,\" Graves told Politico. \"I think we’re gonna continue working, whether it’s approps, farm bill or others to keep building on it.\"\n\nAfter a long recess, the House returns Sept. 12.\n\nHouse Agriculture Committee Chair G.T.

A ​​​​​​meme posted to Facebook on Sept.​ 15 says Biden is no friend of working folks because of his voting history on taxes, such as his vote for a 1983 bill authorizing a 50% tax on Social Security.\n\nThe former senator from Delaware was also the deciding vote in raising the Social Security tax rate to up to 85% in 1993, according to the meme.\n\n\"His voting record on Social Security records over the years is one slap in the face to retirees after another,\" says the claim. \"Now he wants to tax our 401k's and IRA's ... and he also wants to introduce a 3% annual tax on our homes.\"\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to the user for comment.\n\nAnother Facebook post calls into question Biden played in drafting the 1983 changes. The post's author, who did not respond to a request for comment, claimed Biden was behind the tax increase, writing: \"Social Security wasn’t Taxable until Joe Biden wrote a bill and passed it to Tax Social Security Choose Wisely Nov. 3rd\"\n\nMore:Fact check: Biden tax plan would raise rates for those who make more than $400K, corporations\n\nReagan-era changes to Social Security\n\nThe Social Security Amendments of 1983, which led to its taxation, is such a contentious topic on the internet that the Social Security Administration added it to its list of myths and misinformation.\n\nThe tax was one of several significant changes to Social Security that Congress passed in \"an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote,\" according to the Social Security Administration's website. The law postponed cost-of-living increases, put federal workers into the system, raised the retirement age and taxed up to 50% of a person's Social Security income if he or she met certain income thresholds.\n\nThe ideas to \"save Social Security\" came from a bipartisan commission Republican President Ronald Reagan created two years earlier after learning the fund was in danger of running out of money, according to a Brookings Institute article.\n\nReagan called it \"a monument to the spirit of compassion and commitment that unites us as a people,\" and the deal has been hailed as one of the great political compromises of the 20th century.\n\nIn fact, President Barack Obama referred to it during the 2012 presidential debates, saying Social Security needed a new bipartisan deal.\n\nSocial Security benefits were \"explicitly excluded\" from federal income taxation before Reagan signed the amendments into law, according to the SSA. Up to 50% of benefits could be added to taxable income based on certain income thresholds from 1984, onward.\n\nA provision of the 1993 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act raised the Social Security tax rate from 50% to 85% for households in a higher income bracket. The act was Democratic President Bill Clinton's first budget and marked the highest peace-time tax increases on high-income earners in U.S. history up to that time, according to the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nWhat was Biden's role?\n\nBiden was a U.S. senator from Delaware, but he wasn't one of the senators on the commission, according to a list of members from the Social Security Administration. The agency also had an online copy of the commission's recommended changes, which included \"taxation of benefits for higher-income persons.\"\n\nThere's no evidence to support the claim that Biden wrote the bill. In fact, it was introduced in the House by a Democratic representative from Illinois, Dan Rostenkowski.\n\nBiden voted for the bill when it came to the Senate, and it passed 88-9.\n\nGovTrack, a government transparency website, recorded Biden's yea vote on the 1993 Act.\n\nIndividuals who report a combined income between $25,000 and $34,000 may be liable for income taxes for up to 50% of Social Security benefits. For joint filers, the bracket is $32,000 to $44,000. Those whose earnings match or exceed the upper tier of each bracket could pay tax on up to 85% of benefits, according to the SSA.\n\nDid Biden propose taxing 401(k)s and IRA's?\n\nThe claim alleges the Biden campaign proposes taxing retirees' 401(k)s and IRAs in addition to a 3% federal tax on property.\n\n\"It's on page 78 of the Dems' platform,\" says the meme.\n\nBut there's no indication of proposed taxes on 401(k) or IRA retirement accounts on Biden's official campaign website. The Democratic presidential nominee said he wants to equalize retirement plan tax benefits across the income scale, according to the Biden campaign.\n\nBiden would accomplish this by eliminating the current deduction for contributions while providing a 26% refundable tax credit for each dollar contributed to a traditional retirement account, according to The Tax Foundation. The tax credit would be deposited into the retirement account as a matching contribution.\n\nAside from raising taxes on families in the top tax bracket, other proposed tax policies include raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, a 15% minimum tax on book income \"so that no corporation gets away with paying no taxes,\" asking families earning over $1 million to pay wage and investment income taxes at the same rate and instituting a true minimum tax on U.S. companies' foreign earnings while penalizing corporations that outsource jobs overseas.\n\nMore:Fact check: National property tax isn't part of Joe Biden's plan\n\nThe part of the claim stating Biden would propose a 3% federal property tax has already been debunked by USA TODAY. Property taxes are collected at the state and local level, according to the article.\n\nOur rating: Partly false\n\nWe rate this claim PARTLY FALSE, based on our research.

Here we are in late January, a time when we should be talking/plotting/dreaming about what Notre Dame needs to do the rest of the way to get back to the NCAA tournament. Instead, the Irish season has gone off the rails, the head coach has decided (likely with a nudge) that this season will be his last, and the program is staring at a future that is, at best, uncertain. Mike Brey was right - this whole college basketball thing really is fragile. We're about to find out just how much. Anyway, how's your month been? Probably better than Brey, who's set to leave after season No. 23. He'll be the first to admit that it's time, and it is. It's also time to talk Notre Dame men's basketball, which we'll do today forever however long you want to ask, vent, etc. Just make sure to include your name and hometown. And with that, you know how this goes. Let's light this chat candle...\n\nGuest: I congratulate Tom for his fair & balanced critique of ND b-ball over these past years. I thought his article Sunday highlighting the top 23 games under Coach Brey was particularly effective to remind us all of the skill & leadership Coach has given the players & fans over his 23 seasons.\n\nTom Noie: Skill and leadership and, oh, by the way, a heck of a lot of memories and games and wins that nobody thought possible back in 2000. Should this program have won more? Yes. Should it have been better in the NCAA tournament? Absolutely. But rewind back to July 2000 when Mike Brey walked in the door of the Joyce Center. How many fans of a program that was dying a slow death would've taken nearly 500 wins? Three Sweet 16s? Two Elite Eights? A freaking ACC tournament championship after beating Duke and North Carolina? How many would've taken that? How about everybody. This isn't ending the way anyone imagined, but it was one hell of a ride. That you can't argue. Roll through the 23 memories of Brey's 23 seasons for evidence.\n\nMike, Nyona lake: Recruiting question. Keep hearing N.D. can't recruit because of standards. Just can not believe there are not three or four kids in the whole USA that are not smart enough to go to N.D. and still play ball. Maybe not top ten guys but 15 thru 80. Maybe not get the one or two to make you a national champ every year but good enough to be in the top twenty and at least compete for the top half in the ACC. You can not tell me that none of the teams that do compete every year don't have some standards also.\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Two questions in and and we've already reached the non-believer section. That's OK. I get it. One former Irish assistant coach said years ago - a decade or so back - that even back then, in the mid-2000s, out of the top 100 high school seniors maybe 10 - maybe - would have the grades to get into Notre Dame for basketball. Of those 10, maybe two, sometimes three would actually have a passing interest in the program. That was then. Now? Maybe one or two top 100 would be seriously interested in Notre Dame. The admission standard remains the standard. I can't tell you that \"none of the teams that do compete every year don't have some standards,\" but I will. Notre Dame often can't touch the prospects that go to Duke or Carolina or Kansas or UCLA or even Virginia. It's a harder job than anyone wants to admit, which is why it's a lot closer to Boston College and Georgia Tech than anyone wants to admit.\n\nSteve McTigue: Tom, what do you think the Irish are looking for in a new head coach?? Don’t you think they should secure that position fairly soon to avoid to many portal transfers, and to bring in new talent?\n\nTom Noie: Steve: A coach with a plan would be a good start. Notre Dame is going to be this kind of a team on offense, and be that kind of a team on defense. There seemed no plan the last couple of years, just kind of roll the ball out. When you watch how other teams run offense, with different actions and sets you're struck by how Notre Dame doesn't nothing like that. Same goes for defense. And then there's the overall structure of the roster. I'm all for rolling more guys through and being multiple - not the same stuff from the same five guys. So you need a little of everything from someone who's got endless energy, someone who's going to sell his program, and the sell the fans the product is worth watching... Tom Noie: ...As for the second part of your question, I'd be surprised (stunned) if this was a quick hire. Now, if you believe Chris Quinn or Sean Sweeney (both NBA assistants) are the answer, and you can get them out of their current jobs today, you do it. But no sitting college coach is going to leave in the middle of the season for another job. I expect this process to be more exploratory for the next six, seven weeks where Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick does his due diligence, narrows his list to a select few in early March, then zeroes in on a candidate as that coach's season comes to an end. Everyone wants a timeline and wants it to be sooner than later, but it wouldn't surprise me if this pushes closer to April. And it's Jan. 25. Buckle up. This is going to be a loooooooooong haul.\n\nTerry: How is it that the ND Women’s BB program can continually recruit the top players in the country and the men’s team can’t even sniff a top recruit?\n\nTom Noie: Terry: Let's start with this - it's comparing apples to oranges. Yes, the game is the same - they play on rims that are 10 feet and courts that are 94 feet long and all that, but comparing what the Notre Dame men's program can't do compared to the Notre Dame women's program is downright silly. The Notre Dame women's program is one of the sport's bluebloods - Connecticut, Tennessee, Stanford, etc. It SHOULD recruit the elite of the elite. Asking why the men's program can't do what the women's program can do is like asking why the Notre Dame men's program can't be like Duke or North Carolina. The men's program and the women's program couldn't be more different.\n\nPaul R: If you were Jack Swarbrick, who would be your pick for next head coach and who do you think is most likely/realistic?\n\nTom Noie: Paul: I'm glad I'm not Jack Swarbrick having to figure this out, because, as has been mentioned, this is not going to be a quick-hire situation, as it was when he needed a football coach (Marcus Freeman) and women's basketball coach (Niele Ivey). It's hard to say who is likely/realistic because we have no idea what Notre Dame wants from its next head coach. Dynamic young guy? Established older guy? Someone in between. If he were to speak to the media, which he likely won't until the process ends, Jack Swarbrick would say he wants the best possible coach to lead Notre Dame. Who is that? I'll go, in no particular order, with Darian DeVries (Drake), Micah Shrewsberry (Penn State) and Pat Kelsey (Charleston) with wild cards being Chris Quinn and Sean Sweeney. But again, a disclaimer...nobody has ANY idea what direction this is going to go. None.\n\nMatt from Aldie, VA: Thanks, Tom. Quick two-parter: Bottom line, was Brey forced out against his will, or did he come to the realization before it got to that point? And are you hearing anything specific about what his role could be at ND in the future? He's a class act and it would be great to keep him on campus in some capacity, when he's ready. Bonus question: Since Brey has nothing to lose, do you foresee any dramatic lineup or strategic changes between now and the end of his tenure? Thanks again!\n\nTom Noie: Matt: Quick two-parter that doesn't have a quick answer. Last week's decision that this is it was a combination of factors. Jack Swarbrick is on record with the South Bend Tribune as saying that Mike Brey could coach at Notre Dame for as long as he wants. As December became January, that want-to waned. He just didn't feel like he could reach his guys and do the job the way the job needs to be done. I'm sure he went to Jack and Jim Fraleigh, the administrator in charge of men's basketball and they agreed. Some sort of separation agreement was reached and here we are. Tom Noie: As for a future role for Mike Brey at Notre Dame, that was more feel-good/wishful thinking than anything. When this season ends, he can't put Michiana in his rearview mirror fast enough. Save for returning for some reunion doings during football weekends, I don't expect Mike Brey to have any future reason to return. And if the first two games since his I'm-outta-here presser is any indication, he's going to ride into the college basketball sunset his way. The rotation hasn't changed much. I don't see that changing.\n\nMike, New Jersey: Hey Tom, Do you have any sense of direction Notre Dame will be going to in looking for the next Head Coach? Personally I’d love someone with Midwest ties who builds the roster with size, physicality, and athleticism.\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Zero. Maybe less than zero. As mentioned earlier, Jack Swarbrick, should he choose to speak with the media, would hit all the high points on what he wants from the next men's basketball coach, but does he? An elite coach, a coach who's going to make this an elite program, may be too expensive. Does Notre Dame want to pay north of $3 million for an elite coach? My guess is no.\n\nGuest: monte williams or marty inglesby??\n\nTom Noie: Monty Williams. But again, you have to ask yourself - why would someone who has one of the best 30 jobs in the basketball coaching world where you have the best of everything at your fingertips while coaching the best of the best decide yeah, I'm done with this lifestyle of private planes and five-star hotels and sold-out arenas and international attention to go back to college and recruit high school kids? It's a tough sell. Maybe Monty Williams or Chris Quinn or Sean Sweeney, the three possible candidates with NBA ties are looking for a career change, but that's a big jump. The NBA is the great known. College basketball in 2023 and beyond is the great unknown.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Before we get to the back and forth of this, I want to make one comment. Prior to Brey's announcement of stepping down, you were writing about the failures of this season's team. You pulled no punches. You were exceptionally critical, but truthful to a fault. You must have a great deal of clout at SBT to take on a Notre Dame sports program like that. In any event, I admired and appreciated your accurate assessment of where this season was going. Tip of the cap to you.\n\nTom Noie: Thanks my man...say it louder for the people in the back...you know, the ones who shout from the shadows about how the beat guy should be more cheerleader and less critical. I'm glad someone understands that it just doesn't work that way. It can't. Not for the team you cover or the person covering it. The beat writer has to take the good and the bad and the ups and the downs and continue to tell the story. I hope I've done that. It's not easy, but that's our job. We have to do it whether the team we cover is 15-5 in the ACC or headed toward 5-15. Now....back to our discussion...😀\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, This team collapsed for many reasons. From the outside, I see 3 big ones. 1. Poorly coached. Go back to SYR at ND. I think Goodwin said, \"We didn't know what to do against the zone.\" WHAT? You've played in more games than anyone in ND history. You played against SYR 1,000 times. Edwards played the entire 2nd half 15 ft from the bucket. That's how far Boeheim extended. How hard is it to put LAZ or Ven under the hoop and force Edwards out of the middle of the zone? Then, Dane goes back to working the spot at the FT line. No ability to adapt. 2./3. No athleticism. On D, they play matador style. Wave the cape and let the bull go by. Hell, they escort opposing guards to the hoop. On O, they have no ability to beat anyone off the bounce. LY, you polled us about the MVP of the team. I said Wesley because you can't teach his athleticism and instinct for the game on O or D. But, I also said Paul A. was a close 2nd because his post play created space for the jump shooters. Now you see that 1st hand.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: All true. All of it. But here's the thing too about Notre Dame being poorly coached. This team, and teams before it, knew what they signed up for in playing for Mike Brey. He's not going to browbeat you into figuring out the zone. He's going to trust that your proverbial basketball IQ will see it and allow you to say, yeah, I get it. I know what to do. Brey's at fault for the collapse of this season, but is it his fault that he draws up the perfect baseline out of bounds play at the end of the Florida State game, only to have a super senior throw away what would've been a game-winning layup? Is it Brey's fault that a super senior can't effectively inbound the ball late in the game at 'Cuse? Or that another super senior can't make a critical WIDE OPEN 3-pointer in that game? Brey's at fault, but the guys he trusted to deliver didn't deliver. Tom Noie: Notre Dame misses Blake Wesley terribly and misses Paul Atkinson terribly, but don't dismiss what Prentiss Hubb brought to that group. Yeah, he took the occasional bad shot, but he brought a certain swagger a certain middle-finger to you attitude on the road that the rest of his teammates fed off and followed. Notre Dame won seven games away from home last year, and was 6-4 on the road in league play. The Irish are 0-5 on the ACC road this year and 0-7 overall. Ask yourself why, then remember P-Hubb.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, In your opinion, is the new coach, whiever it is, capable of \"patching this together\" or are we in a complete overhaul/rebuilding mode? Part 2 is I doubt ND will ever go for wholesale transfers to restock the program immediately. Do you feel the same way and if so, how does that impact the next coach's success?\n\nTom Noie: Joe: This is headed toward a complete teardown/overhaul/rebuild. On Tuesday, about an hour before the Notre Dame-North Carolina State game tipped, news broke that Brady Dunlap, one of the three recruits signed for next season, had asked for his release from Notre Dame. Had Dunlap remained in the fold, and if (massive if) Cormac Ryan decides to return for a sixth year, Notre Dame would have only 10 players on scholarship - and that's with nobody leaving. Dunlap's departure drops that number to nine. If Ryan decides it's time for a change, that number falls to eight. Dunlap probably won't be the only guy who decides to seek something else besides Notre Dame. That's the way of the college basketball world. Notre Dame has not been hit hard by the transfer portal, but I don't expect that to be the case. New coach wants a new direction. Somebody else is going to leave. Next year will suffer with a patchwork roster. Tom Noie: And Notre Dame won't stabilize through the transfer portal. While it's true that Notre Dame basketball has taken transfers in the past dating all the way back to Ryan Humphrey in 1999 and Dan Miller in 2001, the game has changed. Notre Dame could afford to take a Humphrey or a Miller or a Ben Hansbrough or a Scott Martin with a promise (and a wink) that though their transcripts might not mirror Notre Dame, they could get on the Notre Dame academic track during their sit-out seasons. There's no longer a sit-out season - kids are immediately eligible. It's not a coincidence that since the sit-out season went away, the only transfers to choose Notre Dame - Paul Atkinson and Marcus Hammond - are GRADUATE TRANSFERS. Now, the new coach may get a transfer break or two next season, but the portal is more myth than reality for Notre Dame. It just is.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, You, and others, have speculated about the next coach. I think you even mentioned Beilein and Pitino, both of whom are 70ish. If you really want to hire a 70 year old coaching legend, go after Coach K. While at Duke he repeatedly stated that the only place that could make him leave Duke was ND. Admitedly, that was some time ago, but \"ya never know until you ask.\"\n\nTom Noie: Joe: You know you're my guy, but that might be the silliest idea around. Beyond silly. Here's why - yes, John Beilein and Rick Pitino are both in their 70s, like Mike Krzyzewski. But they couldn't be more different. Here's why - Beilein and Pitino may both feel like they have something still to prove at the highest college level. Beilein for his epic failure in the NBA, Pitino for his epic exit from Louisville. It's no secret that Pitino wants back in to the white-hot spotlight of a major college job. If you know him, Iona's a stopover. A stop-gap. Beilein has long dreamed of coaching at Notre Dame. K? He's got too many NCAA championship and Olympic rings on his fingers to answer the phone.\n\nGuest: Play the bench already\n\nTom Noie: I don't see it happening. Mike Brey's going to do it his way. That's how Notre Dame got to where it is now - he's going to play the guys he trusts. He doesn't trust the bench. Not saying he's right, just saying Brey's going to Brey the rest of the way. As wrong as that might be.\n\nBill Milford ct.: hey Tom — your the man to trust on who’s coaching in 23 season -so my question is regarding the current commits. Give us a break down on each one’s strengths & weakness AND will they stay committed - can any expect to contribute right away ? thanks\n\nTom Noie: Bill: Notre Dame's incoming recruiting class slipped from three players to two following Tuesday's news that swingman Brady Dunlap from Harvard-Westlake High School in California has asked to be released from his letter of intent. Of the three - Markus Burton and Parker Friedrichsen - Dunlap might've been most ready to play given his size (6-foot-7). Burton and Friedrichsen are skilled guys, but also guys who look like they've never set foot in the weight room. It's so hard to say, even the in the best of years, how a prospect's going to carry over from high school to high Division I. No idea if they'll stay committed. It all depends on what the new coach wants, though it would be hard to see Burton going elsewhere. The last thing the new coach wants to do is run off the local kid. Both may HAVE to contribute next season given the uncertainty of the rest of the roster. We can't sit here on Jan. 25 as the snow falls outside and say we have ANY idea what Notre Dame's roster will look like next season.\n\nMatt: Tom, what do you think the time line will be on getting a new coach. Late March early April until they get the list and then interviews. The first recruits are the underclass men, 2023 class and then he can hit the portal.\n\nTom Noie: Matt: Late March at the earliest if everything falls into place. Mike Brey announcing when he did that this is it for him allows for everyone who might be interested in the job to really take a long look at it, and vice versa in terms of vetting candidates, but how much can you do with a sitting head coach in the middle of his season? Little. Next to nothing. So the timeline is going to be an extended one, unless there's a stealth candidate that Jack Swarbrick has identified who can be hired on say, Selection Sunday. Otherwise, pack your patience. This is going to take some time.\n\nMike,: Tom, do you think a few from the staff will stay to help smooth over the transition?\n\nTom Noie: Mike: I don't know how their contracts are structured - say, they're obligated to work through a certain date every year before it rolls over - but I can't see anyone from the current coaching or support staff saying, yeah, you know what, I'll help without any assurances that they're going to be retained. Mike Brey knows what he's going to be doing next year (hint: sitting on a beach in Florida) but his staff and support members are likely worried as much or more right now about where life is going to take them than what kind of defense Louisville might throw at them Saturday. It's human nature - you want to finish this out and do what's best for Notre Dame if you're an assistant coach, but you're also worried about where you're going to land in this profession. It's hard.\n\nMike, Nyona lake: Another question about recruiting. Just read your story in Monday paper about the five things a new coach should ask. If everything in that story is true then I guess that answers the question why there are no fans at the games. Been a season ticket holder for over 35 years. Give me one reason after reading this story I should renew next year.\n\nTom Noie: Mike the non-believer returns....what do you mean \"if everything in that story is true...\" Seriously? Come on, my man. I'd give you a reason why you should renew your tickets for next season, but you probably wouldn't believe it. Sorry.😄\n\nguest: Any thoughts on who you think will get the coaching job? Brad Stevens ?\n\nTom Noie: You're Brad Stevens, president of the Boston Celtics. You make close to $4 million a year. Why are you going back to college? Hard pass.\n\nJoe: My dream candidates that you throw a blank check are Billy Donovan, Tony Bennet and Dana Altman. Any of those above a 0% chance?\n\nTom Noie: Less than zero.\n\nJoe: I feel what made Brey’s offenses excel through the years was a floor general point guard. I know Hubb was better than perceived, but do you think that was the biggest issue the last 5 years. I’m confident we have more wins if Matt Farrell is on the team\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Here's what I don't get about the whole notion of this program has stunk for five seasons. Did last year NOT happen? Did Notre Dame not go 24-11 and win a school record 15 Atlantic Coast Conference games? Did it not have the school's only one-and-done in Blake Wesley? Was it not two minutes from getting to a Sweet 16? Please eliminate last season from the other four, where you do have a point. The pieces didn't fit those seasons. Brey hitched his coaching wagon to guys who didn't deliver, who should've been better than what they were - save for John Mooney who was left a bag of spare parts during his best seasons. Prentiss Hubb was really good for this program - trouble is, he was too inconsistent, which blinded fans' perspective of him.\n\nJoe: Obviously the program needs a breath of fresh air and reboot, but I can’t help but think they are such a better fit in today’s big east than the acc. I know men’s bball will never be the driver of nd’s conference alignment and I think the acc move was great at the time, but do you think there are any administrators in the athletic department that regret that move?\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Did you see the Dec. 11 game against Marquette? Not only was the first sign that this run was over for Mike Brey, it was a sign that Notre Dame (as it's currently constructed) has no business being in the Big East. Notre Dame used to play like that. Notre Dame used to win like that. But the move to the ACC was done for more than just men's basketball. If Notre Dame were to be part of a conference on a sport by sport basis, the Big Ten and the Big East would fit better - but it would take time to overhaul the roster to fit those leagues. That's not how college athletics works. Jack Swarbrick had to take a big-picture 35,000-foot view of what league best served his entire athletic department. That's the ACC.\n\nJoe: It shocked me that Brey’s first game was a sellout. His engagement and personality could not have been more conducive to garnering fan support. I get that the losing the last few years is going to drive fans away (I was looking for Wake Forest tickets and it’s incredible that the cheapest ticket is $35), but what do you think the new coach has to do to re-energize the fan base?\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Win, but even that's hard and not the only answer. Fans are hard to figure out. Notre Dame won last year - won in the ACC like it's never before won - and it had exactly one sellout (Duke). Fans today are beyond fickle. Even when you win, you sometimes lose. I can't imagine that had Brey played more than seven guys, the fan base would be like, whoa, gotta go out and see the Irish. Fans today are different. They'd rather stay home and watch it on their TVs. New coach isn't changing that.\n\nJoe: Correlation or coincidence that the program finally got it’s sought after practice facility and then went into a terrible tailspin?\n\nTom Noie: Joe: I'd say correlation. Notre Dame without a practice facility was a program with a certain underdog edge. Like, we practice in the basement of an old arena that has seats held together with Duct tape. We don't get any bells and whistles but you know what, we're still going to win. It got way more country club when Rolfs opened. It just did.\n\nJoe: Do you think there’s a difference between how the job is perceived nationally compared to how you perceive it up close and personal? I was particularly struck by Pat Forde’s column about the success of other catholic schools in college basketball and how strange that ND doesn’t match their consistent success.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: No, because what's the separator when you look at other Catholic schools. Let's take Gonzaga and Villanova for their previous sustained successes and Marquette and Xavier right now. All private schools, but all schools that don't play football. Basketball is the sole focus, it's where every single one of those schools' resources go toward. They better be good in men's basketball because that's what's going to make the most money. That's never going to be the case at Notre Dame, where it's football first and second and third and sometimes fourth and fifth. Pump the powers that be with truth serum and they'd probably admit - and maybe even without serum - that's it's critically important for Notre Dame football to be good for myriad reasons. Notre Dame basketball? Yeah, that matters and they want to get to the NCAA tournament, but if they don't, hey it's almost time for spring football. And who's the quarterback?\n\nJimmy D: Who realistically are the top 2-3 options to replace Brey? How soon after March madness can we expect an announcement?\n\nTom Noie: Jimmy: Realistically, there's no realistic top options because as was mentioned earlier, nobody knows what Jack Swarbrick wants out of this job. If you're realistically serious about winning national championships and going to Final Fours, then you hire Rick Pitino. He'll win. Maybe not the way anyone in the university would want, but he would. The next hire will tell us a lot of how men's basketball is viewed by the university. Timetable? Don't expect anything to happen before April. This is a long haul process.\n\nMark from Rochester, NY: Tom, I know there are games left in this lost season, but what are your thoughts on Starling? Does he stay for a new coach? Transfer? Professional? Thanks for all you do.\n\nTom Noie: Mark: He's played/developed like someone who knows he needs another year in college, whether that's at Notre Dame or elsewhere, we don't know. He was as tied to Mike Brey as any recruit in recent memory. He wanted to go to Notre Dame, but he also wanted to play for Brey. It's hard to see him going the NBA route based solely on his stats - 12.0 ppg., 2.9 rpg., 1.3 apg., .425 FG, .311 #-point, .640 FT. He needs at least another year to show what he can do well. What is that? I don't know, and I don't know if he knows. Blake Wesley set such a high bar that everyone expected the same (and more) from Starling. He's not built that way. Does he come back? That's a question you can ask for every single player on the roster and the two incoming recruits. Until a new coach is in place and every player sees how they fit, there's no real answer.\n\nMark from Rochester, NY: Tom, with how bad this season has been, I feel like the next 2-3 seasons could be more of the same. Talk me off the ledge\n\nTom Noie: Mark: Nope. You're on that ledge and have to decide for yourself if you want to slide back toward terra firma before that ledge snaps. When Mike Brey arrived, he had Troy Murphy and David Graves and a young Matt Carroll and an old Martin Ingelsby and Ryan Humphrey in a sit-out season. That program was built to win from the jump. This one's not. He's not leaving the cupboard completely bare, but there's a chance for it. Yeah, next year is going to brutal unless Jack Swarbrick nails this hire. He has to.\n\nAndrew from Mass: How many games do you project they win in conference this year? Not that I still think the season can be saved or anything but I am very curious\n\nTom Noie: Andrew: Notre Dame is staring down the barrel of 3-17 in the Atlantic Coast Conference. Tuesday's loss at North Carolina State marked the unofficial halfway point - 10 games down, 10 to go. Notre Dame is 1-9 in the league. When you look at what's coming on the back half, you understand how desperate everything felt when Notre Dame lost its first two home games and lost getable games on the road against Florida State and Boston College. That was against the bottom half of the league. Look at February. Where do you see wins? You want to say Saturday at home against Louisville and maybe the following Saturday at home against Wake Forest. But those aren't guarantees. December and January were times for this program to stack a few wins. February was going to be brutal regardless. Even more so now that you have a lame-duck coach and a lame-duck roster in a lame-duck season. As bad as it's been to date, it might get worse.\n\nPat H. Springfield Illinois: Can’t disagree with any of your reporting and analyses. You did an exceptional and, most important, extremely fair job. What you are doing is what journalism is about - reporting history as it happens in a thorough and objective manner.\n\nTom Noie: Pat: Many thanks. When you've covered Notre Dame men's basketball for 25 seasons, you just want to be prepared for when something like this to max it all out and give readers they best sense and understanding of what it all means. I hope I've done that.\n\nPat H. Springfield Illinois: Forgot to ask my question: When can we expect Mike Bret to be inducted into the Ring of Honor?\n\nTom Noie: Pat: The Ring of Honor was Brey's baby. He chose the guys to go up. Somebody has to choose him. If I were the new coach, I'd wait a year or two before (if) everything gets back on track to where fans care and the wins are there and then give Brey his proper day.\n\nEM: Echoing Muffet McGraw’s comments in the immediate aftermath of Brey’s announcement, how can any N.D. men’s b-ball coach hope to compete and win in today’s environment - including, e.g., the transfer portal, NIL rules, and the general sense that every sport at N.D. takes a back seat to football? Having said that, how did McGraw manage to succeed where Brey didn’t?\n\nTom Noie: EM: You can't. Oh, you can try and do and say all the right things, but even then, it's only going to get you to the occasional Sweet 16 or Elite Eight. Notre Dame men's basketball is about players/prospects choosing Notre Dame for more than just basketball. Pat Connaughton is one of only two former Irish in the NBA, but he didn't seriously dream of being an NBA player when he was at Notre Dame. Now, when that dream materialized, Connaughton chased it and made himself an NBA player. Blake Wesley as well. But they're exceptions, not the rule. How did Notre Dame do it with Muffet McGraw? How many women's basketball players leave after one year for the WNBA? Apples to oranges again. Same sport, way different success models.\n\nTom from Sister Lakes MI: Hi Tom, Great coverage of Brey's retirement and the aftermath. Play along with me. Based on your many years of being around the program, Jack Swarbrick asks for your opinion on the new hire. JS has two questions for you: Should I hire a former ND player? If yes, who should it be? What are your answers?\n\nTom Noie: Tom: Still waiting for the phone to ring with Jack Swarbrick on the other end. Don't think he's going to do that anytime soon - OK, never - but I'll play along. I'd say, why, yes, you need to do whatever's needed to hire Monty Williams. He'd be more than a basketball coach at Notre Dame. And it's about way more than basketball there. It's a sense of spirituality, and Williams would definitely fit. He's won, he's as class as they come and he could relate to today's college athlete. He'd be perfect for the job, given nothing else than his life experiences. But again, if you're an NBA coach, at the peak of your profession, why college? Tom Noie: Do I get to keep my press pass?😃\n\nGuest: Tom, thanks for your terrific reporting. Given its many constraints, is it even possible that Notre Dame men’s basketball could ever be an elite program for an extended period, for example on a part with women’s program? Thanks for your consideration. From John, Leonardtown, MD\n\nTom Noie: John: Mike Brey was quick to say in his walking-away presser last week that the Notre Dame men's basketball job is a great job, but what he didn't say is it's a really hard job. For myriad reasons. I don't ever see it being elite - like Jay Wright made Villanova. It's a good program, that's expected to be great. If that's the case, the university needs to do everything in its power to make it great. They don't do that. They won't do that. That's what made Brey so unique - he accepted all of it and said, yeah, fine, I'm going to win anyway. Eventually, that fight wears on you, and wears you down. It did to Brey. Notre Dame is different in so many ways. Not always for the best when it comes to sustained basketball success.\n\nJoe C: Hi Tom. I just read your listing of 15 possible candidates to replace Coach Brey, who did a remarkable job during his tenure at ND. One coach I'm thinking you may have overlooked is Matt Langel from Colgate. Coach Langel checks all the boxes but one, that being no previous connection to ND. But he's the winningest coach in Colgate history, Patriot League Coach of the Year three straight years, and resurrected a program that has now been to the dance 3 of the last 4 years. He's young, graduates his players, and is accustomed to recruiting kids who need to meet rigorous academic standards. Plus he's used to living in snowy, cold-weather towns. And he's Catholic!! Your take, please, and thanks for hosting the forum.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Matt was No. 16 on my list, so he definitely was on my radar. I had to trim it somewhere, so I went with 15. Matt Langel fits.\n\nScottie: Tom, you made history Sunday for the first time ever the SB tribune had more ND bball articles than ND football congrats and thoroughly enjoyed it\n\nTom Noie: Scottie: There's more where that came from. Keep reading!😃\n\nEd,Greensboro: Belated Happy New Year Help me understand how a group of players can find out their coach is leaving, and the go out and lay an egg against B.C.. Have they no. grit or pride? This is how we will remember this group.\n\nTom Noie: Ed: Good call. Mike Brey has done nothing but own where this season has gone. Notre Dame stinks, and he has said it's his fault. At what point do we point to the players. At what point does pride kick in? If you're ever going to win one league game, wouldn't you think Boston College would be it? How do you not win that game? Brey put all his trust in guys who've done nothing to reciprocate. Yeah, Notre Dame's a player or two short in the big picture, but where's the pride? The want-to? Don't know.\n\nGuest: With 6 more weeks in the regular season, what must happen so the Titanic does not completely sink?\n\nTom Noie: The violinists already are playing, the lifeboats are being lowered, there are people running from stern to bow and bow to stern. It's only a matter of time. Notre Dame is 1-9 in the league with a mind-numbing February still to come. If you can get off the boat now and get to dry land, do it. Don't hang around to see if Jack can get out of the makeshift brig. 😃\n\nGuest: Do you think it might be time to give VanLuben more court time? The same for Zona? They both appear to be active inside when given a few minutes. It is something that has been missing in most games.\n\nTom Noie: More Ven-Allen Lubin, still not sure on Matt Zona, but that's another conversation. Mike Brey admitted (yet again) that he erred in Saturday's loss to Boston College after he decided not to play Lubin more than six minutes in the second half after he was pretty good in the first. Best scenario for Notre Dame on Tuesday was Nate Laszewski picking up three really early fouls. Lubin had to play, and finished with 10 points, five rebounds and two blocks in 22 minutes. Notre Dame's best lineup might be Laszewski and Lubin with Cormac Ryan, Marcus Hammond and J.J. Starling. Let that group get loose. We've seldom seen it. One of the many missteps in recent weeks.\n\nJim from California: Why is the ND woman’s basketball team able to recruit the elite high school prospects in the nation and Canada, and the men’s team can’t?\n\nTom Noie: Jim: If you're an elite high school prospect and can go anywhere to play men's college basketball, why would you go to Notre Dame? You can go to Duke. You can go to Kansas. You can go to Kentucky. You can go to UCLA. Why would you ever pick Notre Dame? You wouldn't. The answer's obvious.\n\nGeorge Bernard: I heard Bill Walton this morning say that 25% of NBA players were international. When I went to check the internet I could only find a hit from 2020. Why is there not information from 2023? Surely it is known.\n\nTom Noie: George: Think you've been hanging around a bit too much with Bill Walton while listening to the Grateful Dead, if you catch my, um, drift. Thanks for the insight. I think. 😃\n\nBrian Batavia, IL: Hi Tom: The b-ball program went sideways after the 2017 Maui Invitational. I am surprised Brey lasted this long. His successor will not find a bed of roses when he arrives full time. There will be no allowance for one and done players. No throwing NIL money at recruits. The transfer portal will be curtailed by university brass. The only way this program can reach an Elite 8 presence on occasion is for the new coach to get lucky with recruits and be able to coach them up. The new coach will need to have more than 7 scholarships on his squad. The 7-man rotation beats the crap out of the players. Do you have a long term solution for the program with these constraints? If you do I’ll drive to South Bend and buy you drinks and dinner.\n\nTom Noie: Brian: A complete tear-down and overhaul of the Notre Dame men's basketball program as we know it would be a start. New head coach. New assistants. New voice. All needed. But a new direction. More support staff. Admissions restrictions relaxed. It wasn't a coincidence that Notre Dame rarely carried the maximum number of scholarship players allowed (13). Mike Brey's marching orders from the university was this - less is better. If you can get by with 10 or 11, we'd really appreciate it. Long-term? Many dark days are ahead. Can this program sidestep them? Good luck\n\nDave: Hi Tom for the next coach will they focus on a young uand coming guy with recruiting experience\n\nTom Noie: Dave: Only Jack Swarbrick knows, and he's not telling.\n\nDan - Chicago: I think we all overrated this team's talent before the year. I think especially in terms of Starling and Ryan and their expected contributions But yet, with even that said, I think this is the most disappointing team I have watched in terms of results vs talent on paper. Where does it rank for Tom?\n\nTom Noie: Dan: Somewhere beyond the bottom, and even then it might be too generous. A lot of this is on Brey, but a lot of it is on the players. They knew the drill. They knew what the roster was going to look like. Why, then, did Dane Goodwin and Nate Laszewski and Cormac Ryan decide to come back if they knew the pieces wouldn't fit or that they were a player or two short? They believed they could make another run. Maybe they fooled themselves. But this season was off the tracks almost from the start. We just didn't see it, or just figured once they get it figured it, they'd be fine. They never did figure it out. It's a complete collapse in every sense. Put it on Brey, but put it on a group that was given so much, but delivered so little.\n\nDan - Chicago: For the obvious question, who is your money on?\n\nTom Noie: Dan - Nobody, because I don't know what this program wants to be. Maybe when there's a no coach in place and it's five years down the road (and I'm hopefully still employed) we can say then, ahhhhhh, it all makes sense. We see why Notre Dame went the route it went. But now? It's had to point to one guy, one clear-cut guy and say, he's the slam-dunk hire who's going to make this all better.\n\nDan - Chicago: I know when you have a 7 man rotation it is hard to shake things up. But I think the one thing last thing that hasn't been tried is starting Lubin and giving him more minutes. Seems worth a shot. I hate to say it, but I might sit the 5 star recruit more in lieu of extra minutes for Lubin. Starling has been the least effective of the five guards.\n\nTom Noie: Mike Brey admitted he made a mistake against Boston College by not playing Ven-Allen Lubin more. Lubin played more Tuesday and was really good. Why not play Lubin and Starling and heck, Dom Campbell and Tony Sanders and Matt Zona more moving forward? Brey will never do it. He really should. It's time.\n\nDonny: Obviously this season is not over yet, but I am extremely scared of what this roster is going to look like next season. Do you expect most of the non seniors/graduates to come back? Even if they do, there is so much inexperience everywhere.\n\nTom Noie: Donny: Be scared. Very scared. I drew the comparison of LSU when it fired Will Wade last year. There was a point where the Tigers didn't have a single scholarship player on the roster. It might not get that drastic for Notre Dame, but the new coach isn't exactly walking into a situation where he has a roster ready-made to even compete, let alone win.\n\nDan - Chicago: Is Markus Burton the starting pg next year? Is he tall enough to be effective in the ACC?\n\nTom Noie: Dan: Markus Burton is really good right now at the high school level, but he has to get bigger and stronger to survive college basketball life in the real world. We need to see the next coach before figuring out the next starting point guard.\n\nChris from Albany: Tom thanks for the chat. In reading your article about the hurdles to overcome at ND what do you think the realistic expectations of the basketball head coach is at ND? My own expectation is to make the big dance 2 out of 3 years which Brey did through his first 17 years.\n\nTom Noie: Chris: Here's my expectation for Notre Dame men's basketball - stop expecting the NCAA tournament. Here's what I mean - run a program that doesn't worry about getting to the NCAA tournament. Does Tom Izzo worry about getting to March? Does BIll Self? Does Mick Cronin? No. Build a program that might not win NCAA championships, but is respected enough and good enough to be competitive enough where you're not sweating out Selection Sunday every single year. Market your program better. Promote it better. Get the national media to understand that even if you lose a game, you're good. I don't get this NCAA tournament scorecard nonsense. Welp, made it two of the last three years. We're good. Nah, forget that. Just be good enough and respected enough and sustained enough where Selection Sunday doesn't matter. Get to the point where the only question is where you're going, not if you're going. That's reasonable, isn't it?\n\nChris from Albany: Is Virginia the blueprint that ND should reach for? I assume they have some of the same issues as ND but they seem to overcome. Why? Is it simply Bennett is that good?\n\nTom Noie: In theory, but be Notre Dame. Do it your way, but be 1,000 percent committed to doing it your way. The commitment level, not sure if it's always there. Notre Dame talks so much about being elite, but it's really not, not the way it could and should and has to be in men's basketball.\n\nJim Tal Valley Center, CA: Morning Tom, Great work on all the latest doings involving the ND hoop program. In your estimation, what would be a reasonable timeline by which the Irish should have a new coach in place? Unless it's someone that isn't currently coaching it's hard to imagine anything getting done before mid-to-late March at the earliest. Also, do you have any preferred candidates for the job as of now? Thanks for all you do.\n\nTom Noie: Jim: First week of April would fit. And look back in the chat for our poll - the top six possibilities are in the poll. But I'll let you in on a secret. Just between you and me, OK? Nobody knows who the next coach will be. Not the beat writer. Not the athletic director. Maybe not even the next coach.\n\nChris, DC: Tom, Do you think ND can keep Starling, Lubin and Campbell?\n\nTom Noie: Chris: All depends on the next coach. Do those players fit his style? Do they meet the next coach and think immediately, yeah, I can play for this guy. I WANT to play for this guy. Nobody knows.\n\nChris, DC: Tom, How big of a difference would Basile at VTech have made ?\n\nTom Noie: Chris: Perhaps he'd have helped, but it never got to that point where they wondered how he'd fit. His visit was more courtesy than reality.\n\nJack: In his retirement presser, Brey made it seem like he will be very much involved in the coaching selection. Do you think he should be, and could this tilt things toward Inglesby?\n\nTom Noie: Jack: That was a fun line, but absolutely not. Mike Brey can offer his opinion to Jack Swarbrick, but this is Jack Swarbrick's hire based on who he best fits for his vision of the program and for the university. At some point, he'll have to say, if he hasn't already, Mike, I love you and love what you've done for our school, but I need to go this alone. Thanks.\n\nEd Zagorski, Irving, TX: Your article on the challenges for the next coach was really interesting. Using your crystal ball, how long (or can) will it take the program overcome the issues that have mounted and do you believe the University will invest in support staff to help the new coach? I was there as a student in the late 70s during the ‘glory days’ and am concerned that the school won’t invest as it will never make the kind of money that the football program does.\n\nTom Noie: Ed: The issues are too great to overcome to get this program to the point where Mike Brey couldn't get it - to a Final Four. This is not a Final Four program. That comes from deep within the university. Look, there's care there. People care about the program, but not enough to help get it where it should be. You think this year or the last couple years (minus 2021-22) were bad. Might have to get used to it.\n\nClaire M: Tom, appreciate your coverage of ND hoops. Amongst other issues with this team this year, the inability to guard or win the close games they did last year is there is no Blake Wesley to get a steal and dunk to put a game away as he did last season in numerous game situations. With that, while Starling is a gifted guy and will become a good player at some point (somewhere), there is a big gap between where he is and the impact Wesley had on a team as a freshman. We were lead to believe that Starling was the guy with “it”, that he got itwas so mature and we have not seen that from him.\n\nTom Noie: Claire: good stuff. What we've seen from Starling this season is a lot of what we saw from him last season at LaLu. He was OK with being the fit-in, third guard. When the time came for him to step into more of a role, he did. He was that gifted. That's different at the college level. Again, he was OK with being the fit-in freshman surrounded by old guys. Whereas Blake Wesley was like, yeah, I'm playing and I don't care who cares, Starling's a different kind of kid. He may be more talented in a raw sense than Wesley, but Wesley was, for a lack of a better term, a killer. Like, I'm coming after you and you have no choice. Starling's not there yet. Wesley raised the bar so high, a bar that Starling hasn't been able to reach. I believe Notre Dame missed its chance when it started 0-2. It should've given the ball then and there to Starling and said, run with it. We've not seen Starling's true skills. We might never see them.\n\nWillie from Mishawaka: I recently read an article written by Brett Friedlander about how Pat Kelsey would be a perfect fit to replace Mike Brey. Young, energetic, and a catholic school product who learned from Skip Prosser. What do you think about this possibility?\n\nTom Noie: Willie: There's a reason why he's in the SBT's top three possible candidates. He fits for a lot of reasons. Not the least of which was this - he took over a Charleston program last year - his first year - and the roster had .... two players. He still had a winning season. He's got the juice for a program that lacks it.\n\nHarold C.: I think that LaPhonso Ellis would be a great fit for ND BB Coach! What’s your opinion?\n\nTom Noie: Harold: If there's a person in the world better than Phonz, show me. Phonz is a friend, but he has zero coaching experience. He could reach guys and teach guys but in this day and age, you better know exactly what you're signing up for and, in the case of Notre Dame, what you're walking into. For someone who's never been the lion cage at this level, that's a tough ask. I can't do that to my man.\n\nEd,Greensboro: Tom, same old story last night in Raleigh.How much damage is this season's death march doing to the program?\n\nTom Noie: Ever seen the GIF of the child swinging innocently on a swing while a structure fire rages behind him? It's like that. This program is headed for 3-17 in the league. When it ends, there will be nothing remaining but ash.\n\nSteve Duff: You deserve hazard pay for covering this team Tom - ooof. Any chance Brey will start lengthening the rotation now that the season is effectively over? I believe JR is a redshirt but it would be nice to see what Zona and Dom in particular can do. That cupboard is gonna be pretty bare for whoever replaces him. Thanks Tom and hang in there!\n\nTom Noie: Steve: Thanks, but I didn't sign up for this job with the stipulation that it would be all sunshine and balloons. It comes with the job, and I owe it the readers and the people who care about Notre Dame men's basketball to paint a fair and accurate picture, regardless of how awful it might look. Lengthen the rotation? If Mike Brey was going to do that, he could've started two games ago. Why would he start now? He's nothing if not loyal, and his loyalty to Trey Wertz and Dane Goodwin and Nate Laszewski goes beyond anyone's comprehension.\n\nRyan mars pa: Tom what is going on with this team lost some close games will miss coach brey after this season\n\nTom Noie: Ryan: A complete collapse in confidence from a group that was supposed to carry a boatload of it through this season. And that's just for starters. I'd say keep the faith with the hope that it gets better, but I'm not sure it will. At least, not anytime soon.\n\nGuest: I would also love to see the men’s basketball program get the talent and also support from local fans as the women’s program has. But we need to win first…\n\nTom Noie: Great. I'd love to see local fans be expected to play the same prices for women's basketball tickets as they do for the men. Then we're having a totally different conversation. There's a reason why the women's program has built a stronger following. It's all about 💰\n\nJohn, Orlando: Hi Tom, where does Notre Dame’s winning percentage over the past 23 years under Coach Brey rank nationally among division 1 schools over the same period? I realize that this data may be difficult to find / access but to paraphrase Coach Brey this is the ultimate measurement.\n\nTom Noie: John: Interesting, but impossible to find on the fly. My apologies. Answered a similar question earlier. I'm not about this program getting to the NCAA tournament X number of times in Y amount of years. This should be a program that should annually be good enough to where it shouldn't sweat Selection Sunday. The NCAA tournament is an absolute crapshoot (coming from someone who doesn't gamble). Just get in and then you go from there.\n\nJack: Hey Tom, do you expect buy-in from Notre Dame to actually go out and get a coach with a chance to be successful and provide him with the resources to succeed? Or do you expect them to got the traditional route of finding the cheap option and putting him on an island with no resources? Maybe they can find a few extra dollars in the football team's Gug couch cushions?\n\nTom Noie: Jack: Start shaking those couch cushions. Resources? That's a four-letter word around Notre Dame when it comes to the basketball program. Taboo. Off limits. It's not something anyone wants to talk about.\n\nChris, DC: Do Lubin and Starling return?\n\nTom Noie: Hire a head coach first. Then salvage the roster.\n\nBrian: Real question, who is in the starting lineup next year? Starling possible transfer or NBA, VAL could leave. Zona, JR, Sanders who else?\n\nTom Noie: A great unanswerable question. Nowhere close to being answered.\n\nEM, South Bend: I know it’s comparing apples to oranges, but why has the women’s program under both Coach McGraw and Coach Ivey been able to be so successful for longer and the men’s program has not?\n\nTom Noie: EM: It's like asking why Duke and North Carolina has been able to sustain success. Look at the women's game as the women's game. Look at the men's game as the men's game. Comparing it is beyond silly. Are we then going to ask why Notre Dame men have had a one-and-done but the Notre Dame women haven't? See? Silly.\n\nEM, South Bend: Endorsing comment by Joe from South Side!\n\nTom Noie: Amen brother!\n\nPhil: Do you expect to see a transfer portal exodus among the younger guys (and maybe even older guys that have sat at the end of the bench their whole career)? Maybe a change will be good for some of these guys as they might get a coach that goes more than 6 deep?\n\nTom Noie: Phil: Mike Brey's rotation now goes only six deep? In another week, it will have gone only five deep. But I get it. Don't know how many times this has to be said to understand - it's beyond impossible to say for sure what's going to happen with the roster until there's a new coach in place. Matt Zona may look at the new coach and say, yeah, my kind of guy. J.J. Starling may look at the new coach and say, nah, I'm out. We. Don't. Know. They. Don't. Know. Nobody. Knows.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Absolutely true. There is CLEARLY enough blame to go around. I am just saying, he let Boeheim sit in his comfort zone for the entire 2nd half. TAKE HIM OUT OF IT! Force Boeheim to counter your move. Make him collapse the zone and maybe you can get off a decent shot or two. Part 2 is I always supported PHUBB. Last chat, I brought up the A/TO ratio. Last night, 11 Assists to 15 TOs. 15! NCST, not an overly impressive OFF team, 13 to 2. Poorly coached, no ability to defend.\n\nTom Noie: No want-to. No care. No nothing.\n\nMike in PA: Tom - thanks for this much needed therapy session. This is more of a comment than a question, but the folks who say good riddance to Brey, or say 3 sweet 16's in 23 years is underachieving or mediocre, must not have been alive for most of the 80's or 90's, right? ND Basketball was simply non-competitive for a decade. Brey comes in and immediately gives them a shot of life, and he goes on to have some of the highest highs in program history. He should be celebrated at all costs. Put him in the ring of honor now. Those who mock him, pun intended, will likely never be happy with any coach, in any sport.\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Thank you, a voice of reason. Look what Mike Brey did in establishing a culture/identity in the Big East as it changed. Look at what Mike Brey did in starting over, then establishing a culture/identity in the Atlantic Coast Conference. There may have been two or three, OK, maybe four coaches in the country who would've enjoyed similar success. Do others see that? Nah, they whine about the NCAA tournaments and the losing seasons. Think back to where Notre Dame was in 2000 when Brey arrived. You'd have been laughed out of Rocco's if you said the new guy was going to go to a couple Elite Eights. They would've locked you up and thrown the key in Saint Mary's Lake if you said the new guy would beat Duke and North Carolina on back-to-back nights to win an ACC tournament. Brey fell short in a few areas, yes, but he far exceeded expectations in many more. And he did it all under the guidelines set forth by his bosses.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, I think Parker F. walks as well. Remember, he and Dunlap had already reneged on scholarships prior to ND calling. In your opinion, where do they stand with Burton? Is he committed to ND or Brey. I was kind of surprised he said he would decide after the season. I just thought he was locked in with ND.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Yeah, I'm not sure that's not Markus Burton just being a 17-year-old kid who's head is still swimming. It's not like he had a lot of high major offers when Notre Dame came calling. Is he suddenly an option for Indiana or Purdue or someone else close to home? Not really sure. If any recruit should feel safe - way safer than Brady Dunlap (see ya!) or Parker Friedrichsen - it's Markus Burton. The last thing the new coach is going to do is to cut ties with the local guy. Not exactly the way to build interest/equity with your fan base, is it? I'd be surprised if Markus Burton isn't at Notre Dame next season, no matter the coach.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, I would like to comment on your hiring timeline. First, the only guys who leave the NBA for college ball are guys who have exhausted their chances in the NBA. There are exceptions, but Quinn, Williams.....No Chance. Sweeney maybe just because of his attraction to ND. Also, a lot of the names mentioned are likely taking their teams to the Big Dance. They are not going to disrupt their seasons with an announcement like that. Finally, Jack S. has made a lot of hires in his time. I am sure he has a replacement planning chart on his computer somewhere. Let's let this play out and put some faith in his track record.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Agree with that 1,000 percent. Our timelines line up. Jack Swarbrick needed four days to hire Marcus Freeman. He didn't even need four hours to hire Niele Ivey. This will not be a quick hire, nor should anyone expect it to be. This will be an extended timeframe. We're not talking days or weeks. We're talking months. Jack Swarbrick has nailed a lot of the big issues (football coach, women's basketball, ACC membership, football independence). I expect him to nail this one as well. He's said on multiple occasions that it's the big-picture/high profile issues that drive him. Here comes another.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, Cannot hire any coach in his 70s. Too old. Everyone opposing coach will tell recruits \"that guy will die before you graduate.\" That includes Mike K. They need 40ish like Brey was when he was hired. Pitino is a much larger longshot than Mike K. based on the fact that his background isn't as clean as ND would require. No chance for him. Wouldn't want him anyway.\n\nTom Noie: Want to win today? No, really win. Seriously win. Gotta get dirty. Got to.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, sincere question. Why aren't we hearing Mike White as a possible hire? 45 years old. Wildly successful at every stop. And certainly strong ties to South Bend. The guy's childhood dream was to play QB at ND.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: How do you convince anyone you're the right hire if you're on your third head coaching job in three years? A lot of anything that happens moving forward with the job is based on timing. It has to fit. If Mike White still was at Florida and ready for a reset, yeah, he might be the clubhouse leader.\n\nDave: Does the football team have the same admission requirement as the basketball team? How is it that only 10 of the top 100 hoops recruits can get into ND, but we can get top 150 football recruits?\n\nTom Noie: Dave: You do follow Notre Dame football. You know of the Four Horsemen and Rockne and Holtz and everything else. If you do, you don't have to ask the question. It's Notre Dame football.\n\nTom: Tom can you please provide a public service announcement to all of the delusional Irish fans that Mark Few, Brad Stevens, Monty Williams, and all these other pipe dream candidates are not walking through that door. Some of the names I have seen tossed around are absurd. Notre Dame Basketball does not equal Notre Dame football. Why would any of these guys take a job at an ACC bottom feeder that could care less about their basketball program?\n\nTom Noie: Tom: They wouldn't. There's a faction of the fan base that doesn't operate in reality. They believe what they want to believe and nothing - and nobody - is going to convince them any differently. The elite of the elite college coach looks at Notre Dame and say, no freaking way. They know. They know not only how the sport operates but how Notre Dame operates. Mike Brey did a whole lot for that program, and it's still in the coaching stone age.\n\nMark: Has the name Bryce Drew came up at all?\n\nTom Noie: Why would it? What's he done? He's OK at a mid-major right now. He went 0-18 in the SEC. That's the hardest of sells at Notre Dame, regardless of his feel-good storybook career at Valpo, which, in today's world of college basketball, may as well happened in the 1960s. This has to be as close to a home-run hire as it can get. Bryce Drew's a leg-it-out close call at second base double.\n\nMike in PA: Tom - I saw someone mention Coach K as a replacement. Obviously, that's just crazy and will never happen in a million years. If on a crazy scale of 1 to 100, and Coach K is a 150, where does Jay Wright stand? I know I know, probably 149. But I would love it.\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Honestly, if the scale is 1 to 100, both are about a 2,500. And that might be too low.\n\nChris, DC: Tom, your thoughts on Cormac Ryan coming back for a sixth year. I say slim to none\n\nTom Noie: Chris: Same stance as J.J. Starling and Ven-Allen Lubin returning. No thoughts until a head coach is in place. Ryan, though, may decide it's time to start his next chapter, though his return would work for various reasons.\n\nRay: Hi Tom. During your last chat in November you ended the chat claiming I was pretty much crazy in my opinion of Brey. I said if I knew today what Brey's record would have been after 23 years that I would not have hired him. You called my drunk and dismissed my opinion as silly. I completely disagree. College hoops for the last couple of decades is all about NCAA tournament success. The regular season is meaningless. This is not an opinion Tom. Look at the TV ratings for games in November- early March and compare it to the tournament. Power programs fire coaches who don't perform well in the dance. Brey has failed in the dance. In 23 years he made the second weekend of the tournament only three times. He made zero final fours and lost as a favorite to the following teams - Mississippi, Winthrop, Washington State, Xavier, Old Dominion, Florida State, Old Dominion, and Iowa State. In 23 years he only defeated two teams that were seeded higher - Illinois and Alabama.\n\nTom Noie: Ray: Still silly, and still wondering if you're at the bar at 9:36 a.m. California time. If you need to be walked through where this program was when Mike Brey arrived and where he took it, NCAA tournament flameout aside, we'll just have to agree to disagree. Have another one on me, though 😃\n\nJim Tal Valley Center, CA: Tom, I have great admiration for Mike Brey but one of the true testaments of a successful coach is the condition that he leaves the program in when he departs. And from that standpoint, given all the uncertainty concerning the Irish as to the incoming freshman class and the potentially dubious makeup of next year's roster, there's no way anyone can say he succeeded on that front. Your thoughts?\n\nTom Noie: Jim: Agree. Epic failure, a failure that is totally unacceptable. Brey will long be remembered for what he did with this program in the Big East, then in the ACC, but the shape in which he leaves it, yeah, that's in the second paragraph as well.\n\nChris, DC: Tom, if somehow this team made the NIT they will not go correct? Again a long shot. I understand.\n\nTom Noie: Chris: It depends. Do they stagger across the finish line to get to NIT territory or do they beat Duke or Virginia on the road. Right now, this can't end soon enough. It's hard to see that sentiment changing.\n\nBonkers in Yonkers: Tom, it's been awhile. I'm sure you've answered this but bear with me and anyone that's joined in the last 10 minutes. Rank the Top 3 coaching candidates, if you'd be so kind, that are your most likely to be interviewed and offered the job. #KeepGrindin\n\nTom Noie: Bonkers: It's been about four hours, so I might be a little punchy. But the top three, in any order, would be Darian DeVries from Drake, Micah Shrewsberry from Penn State and Pat Kelsey from Charleston. NBA guys? Chris Quinn and Sean Sweeney. That's a pretty good starting five. Let's see where it goes.\n\nRay: Ray from Southern California - Tom I don't personally know one ND fan that agrees with what you wrote below in BOLD: How many fans of a program that was dying a slow death would've taken nearly 500 wins? Three Sweet 16s? Two Elite Eights? A freaking ACC tournament championship after beating Duke and North Carolina? How many would've taken that? How about everybody. These numbers would be good if Brey coached 10-12 years and decent if he coached 13-15 years but three Sweet 16's and zero final fours in 23 years is not good Tom. I don't know one ND fan that thinks it is. I will stop commenting on this now. I think you understand my position and its a position of many Notre Dame fans.\n\nTom Noie: Ray: Just stop while you're way behind. You cull this information because as you've said, you know ..... 25 Notre Dame fans? Whoa, a whole 25. Not exactly a good cross section of the fan base, or maybe it is. Let me put this as delicately as possible - wake up. This program has gone to one Final Four in its history, and wandered through the college basketball desert for 10 years before Brey. But it's suddenly Final Four or bust? Couldn't be more wrong. You and your \"many Notre Dame fans.\" When the new gets to multiple Final Fours in his 10 seasons - that's the timeframe, right? - I'll buy you and your 25 fellow fans dinner.\n\nJames - Indiana: Micah Shrewsberry as next HC? Brad Stevens lead assistant at Butler and then Celtics and then went to learn under Painter and now at PSU. Seems like a home run hire\n\nTom Noie: James: Almost too good to be true, right? He fits for many reasons.\n\nDave Y - St Louis: Based on what you know about coaching hoops at ND, what kind of style of play do you think fits them best for ACC play and what new coach can provide that style?\n\nTom Noie: Dave: Look at what wins in the Atlantic Coast Conference. You better run some offense that's difficult to defend. Multiple actions. Multiple options. Have skilled guys who can go off the dribble. Have versatile wings who can shoot it and rebound. Defend. You better have at least one pro every season. Two? Even better. Three? Now you have the makings of a team that can make a deep NCAA run. A team that's unafraid on the road. What coach fits that criteria? That's the job of Jack Swarbrick.\n\nMike - NC: Any chance Chris Quinn comes back? I know he's Spo's top assistant and likely wants to stay in NBA but think he could be convinced to come back?\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Chris Quinn had the chance to come back a couple years ago and learn the college game, where he'd likely have been Brey's successor. He chose to stay in the NBA, where he believes he has a future as a head coach. Has that changed? If it has, and has drastically, then yeah, he's on the short list. But I don't know any NBA coach who's in a hurry to go back to college.\n\nJohn: Cupboard looking awfully bare next year lol, especially if Ryan leaves. Assuming Burton and Parker stay in class, you're looking at Starling, JR, Sanders, Zona, and Lubin as starters?\n\nTom Noie: John: That's best-case scenario, which everyone would sign up for right now. Will it stick? We'll see...\n\nDave - NY: I think this is a worse job than people think. AD and President rumored to leave in 2-3 years right? The talent on this roster that is coming back is bad for even a mid major team. Do you think Burton and Parker will stay?\n\nTom Noie: Dave: I wouldn't go as far as classifying it as a \"worse job\" but it's a difficult job. Way harder than an outsider would admit it to being. It's only going to get more difficult with NIL and the transfer portal (i.e. free agency). Notre Dame's academics-first model doesn't cut it.\n\nLInas from Orange County,CA: Hi Tom, Really tough season. Thanks for letting us vent. Here's my take on what went wrong with the Irish this year: No really good passer (never thought I'd miss Prentiss:) and no \"bangers\" under the boards (think Harangody/Geben/Mooney/Cooley). Thoughts?\n\nTom Noie: Linas: Fair on all levels, and that the returning guys didn't get any better, didn't add a new dimension to their games, Fellow ACC opponents have to be looking at Dane Goodwin and Nate Laszewski and saying, I guarded this four years ago...you're still doing all the same stuff?\n\nDan - Chicago: I'm surprised that Ryan coming back for a 6th college year is still a possibility in your eyes. Which way do you think he is leaning?\n\nTom Noie: Dan: He's not, and it's not, but it's there. You have to leave that door open since it is an option. He won't close it until this season ends. Never thought Nate Laszewski was coming back...every indication was that he was ready to move on. Then he returns. Just when you think you know, you don't.\n\nJim Tal Valley Center, CA: Tom, though there are many reasons why this season went down the drain, I believe one thing stands out. This team and these players were lost when it came to being clutch. A number of games were there for the taking, but this group shrunk big time when it mattered most. It was simply beyond them to deliver at critical times and without a go-to guy to rely on, they had nowhere to turn. No question, this team goes down as the epitome of a club that didn't measure up when push came to shove!\n\nTom Noie: Jim: True, but how do we explain what Cormac Ryan did in the NCAA tournament last March? Every indication was that it was the beginning of him making that his team. That he would pick up where he left off. Man, talk about a big swing and a miss on that one.\n\nDave - NY: Does Jack make major changes to this program and give them the support it needs or do he and the administration not care enough about the success of basketball? Even though ND is a \"football school\", why can't they pour resources and money into it in a way we see many other schools do for their \"Second sport\"? Hell, Michigan did it for basketball. Why can't ND?\n\nTom Noie: Dave: If there's one thing that Notre Dame has more of than almost every other private school, it's money. And if there's one thing that Notre Dame doesn't want to spend, it's, yep, money. If it was THAT serious about having the elite of the elite athletic programs across the board, money is no issue. At Notre Dame, it's a HUGE issue. They have it, and they're not spending it .... on athletics?? No way.\n\nMike from San Diego: It’s not feasible we have a head coach before end of march correct? Anyone worth getting probably won’t confirm to ND until their respective season is over with- am I correct in that assumption? That being said does Mike stepping down so early give the incoming freshman and current players (ie Starling and Lubin) too much time to look elsewhere??\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Agree on the first part, don't agree as strongly on the second. Mike Brey saying he's leaving or not saying he's leaving, kids (especially freshmen) all spend time about looking elsewhere. Should they transfer? Should they try and make it in the league? Brey leaving doesn't change that. Or accelerate it. When it goes as sideways as this has gone, everybody's looking with the side eye at something that could be better for them.\n\nJames - CA: It's odd how this program always used to have really good guard play and what seems like the last 5 years haven't had a single guy who could consistently get downhill. Hubb at least took care of the ball but why did Brey think Wertz could run this offense when he's arguably the worst of the 7 guys?\n\nTom Noie: James: One of the greatest unanswerable questions about this season and about this team. Trey Wertz by all accounts is a great kid, but he's simply not a frontline Atlantic Coast Conference caliber guard. He's just not.\n\nPeter, VA: Tom, what are your thoughts on goodwin’s career? Having played the most games in school history, this year he has looked slower and less consistent.\n\nTom Noie: Peter: He's played in a lot of games, but never really added to his. He's got the flat-footed 3 and the low-post game and that's about it. Limited. It's hard watching him try to figure it out, when there are no answers. Maybe that's him. Maybe that's lack of development.\n\nGuest: Any word of Bobby Hurley or Chris Collins being considered??Both Duke guys that kno ACC n east coast recruiting!I think could be nice fits but my list is like most ND fans 1-Monty2-Quinn then Kelsey!!\n\nTom Noie: Quick, easy passes on both. Notre Dame isn't Duke Midwest. Time for a new direction.\n\nJustin Ft. Wayne: Hey Tom! I saw earlier you said a new coach is going to change putting butts in the seats and selling the place out. You don’t think the right hire could bring juice to this program and sell the place out and get students back to the games. Not every game sure but half the games? Maybe it’s wishful thinking on my part!\n\nTom Noie: Nail the hire first and get the roster figured out. If you win, the fans, even the Notre Dame fans, will find their way back. Maybe. Until there's something else to complain about. Or if it's snowing outside. Truth.\n\nBonkers in Yonkers: Tom, any early indication of who will be coming back for Brey's final home game? Coach Brey was instrumental in creating the Ring of Honor. Hopefully ND gives him something big after the game so the former players that are able to come back and the fans in attendance can give him the ovation he deserves. Think we'll see him inducted into the Ring of Honor on that night?\n\nTom Noie: Bonkers: Still a ways out from that final home game against Pittsburgh, but it being a midweek game instead of the weekend kind of curbs the enthusiasm if you will. Ring of Honor that night? Not seeing it. Yes, Mike Brey did a lot for this program since he arrived, but this season has been the greatest of failures. Hard to look past that - at least, at this point. Let a few years pass so the good times can better be remembered. It's too soon now to point to 2015 and 2016 and everything else and say, hey, thanks MB\n\nJames - CA: The 5 man class in 2017 did Brey in. Not only did they not live up to their rankings, it made it so Brey couldn't recruit over them and then couldn't recruit behind and develop the typical 4 stars he used to. Instead, tried to go for a 5 star to get immediate playing time or low 3 stars and this is the result. It's baffling how these 6th year seniors are playing like freshman\n\nTom Noie: James: So true. The loyalty for his guys that long sustained Mike Brey wound up doing him in. He just couldn't bring himself to consider there might be better players out there than Dane Goodwin and Nate Laszewski. That's an aspect that has to change - you have to earn your spot every single season. If there's someone out there who's an upgrade, don't be afraid to upgrade. But that 2017 class ran its course a year and a half ago. You saw it. Others saw it. Brey never saw it.\n\nTom D.: My biggest fear is ND hiring \"Mike Lite.\" Any chance we will get an aggressive coach who recruits at a high level and plays more than seven guys?\n\nTom Noie: Tom D: Yes, yes, yes. I'm confident Jack Swarbrick will land this hiring plane. It's a little rocky coming down out of the clouds now, but it will be OK. Watch.\n\nChad ,Toledo: Any mention of Bobby Hurley or Chris Collins ??Both Duke guys that know the ACC and east coast recruiting!!Maybe nice fit imo!!\n\nTom Noie: Second time around for these guys today. Answer's still the same - absolutely not.\n\nJames - CA: What's the excuse for ND to not be like Michigan in basketball? Both are football schools but the difference is Michigan seems to actually care about pouring money and resources into bball program to be good, while Jack is fine with just sniffing the NCAA tournament\n\nTom Noie: James: You answered your own question. Notre Dame is not Michigan because Michigan does something for basketball that Notre Dame doesn't do and likely will never do - pours money into the program. Also, Michigan and Notre Dame being even, the cost of attendance is more attractive at Michigan than at Notre Dame. (see, Dickinson, Hunter)\n\nRobert from Mishawaka: Your recent articles have given the average fan some very interesting insight as to what the Notre Dame administration does for the program. From the support staff, to the admissions office. Thank you for blunt answers, and continue being you. I hear you all the way from the back row.\n\nTom Noie: Robert: I'll keep shouting if you promise to keep reading. Deal?.\n\nGuest: Except for last year's success, I think one of the amazing things about the struggles over the last five years, is that the ACC has been so down. Even this year, ND's conference schedule has been incredibly manageable. I know there has been coaching turnover at UNC, Duke, and Louisville, but what are some other factors you can point to that has contributed to the ACC's decline?\n\nTom Noie: How about this one - let's go with arrogance. For the longest time, the Atlantic Coast Conference was seen as the best college basketball conference in the country. Everybody wrote it. Everybody believed it. To the point where the league didn't believe it needed anyone selling its product to the nation. And then everything changed. The SEC got better and stronger. Same for the Big 12. And the Big Ten. Now, turn on any game from those conferences on a given night, and listen to the commentators and the studio talent talk up those leagues. The SEC. The Big 12. The Big Ten. How this league or that league is so deep. Just recently, there was talk of how every single Big 12 team could - and maybe should - make the NCAA tournament. Who's carrying the torch nationally for the ACC? Nobody. It's just kind of stepped back into the shadows, where everybody else talks up those other leagues, and rarely talks about the ACC. Tom Noie: More proof? Look at last year, when Notre Dame won a school record 15 league games and finished second - one win away from sharing the regular-season title with Duke. What was the national narrative? That the ACC was down and that Notre Dame didn't deserve an NCAA bid. At 15-5. Who went to bat for Notre Dame? For the league? Nobody, to the point that if the regular season had lasted another week, Notre Dame wouldn't have made the Field of 68. The reaction of the ACC was like, meh, who cares, we're the ACC. The league's become an afterthought, because the league's allowed it to become one. That's wrong, and that should never happen.\n\nMikeMcFadden, Williamsport, PA: What advantage did coach Brey think he had by playing ONLY 7 players for 23 years? I cannot think of one thing, only disadvantages like no player development, lost recruits, etc.\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Easy. Seven personalities are easier to manage than seven, eight or nine. Play seven, and get those seven to act/work/think like one to the point where they just know how to play a d know what the other guys are doing. You take care of the ball better, you play better. Now, for that to work, it has to be the right seven guys. Think back to 2014-15 and those seven - Pat Connaughton, Jerian Grant, Zach Auguste, Steve Vasturia, Demetrius Jackson, Bonzie Colson and V.J. Beachem. You can win with those seven. You can go far with those seven. Why? Because it was the right seven. That's when it works.\n\nGuest: Hey Tom - here are some names I thought of potential replacements that I havent seen much of.. Ed Cooley, Anthony Grant, Earl Grant, Valentine from Loyola (although this year has been gross).. any thoughts on those 4?\n\nTom Noie: Absolutely. For starters, Providence and Dayton (heck, yeah) are better jobs than Notre Dame. In addition, Ed Cooley and Anthony Grant are alums of those schools. Earl Grant hasn't exactly done enough at Boston College to warrant a lateral move - and it is lateral. Drew Valentine went from 25-8 in the Missouri Valley Conference to 6-12 in the Atlantic-10. And the ACC is probably two steps up from that. Tough sell on him.\n\nMike from San Diego: I'm just curious, does your criticism of the team cause any bad blood between you and the players / coaches?\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Bad blood? No, for the most part, the players and the coaches get it. A lot of that came from Mike Brey, like this is what we signed up for. It's part of the deal. The one area where it has caused friction is when it gets really bad (2018-19, this season) where the core guys get a little salty. Guys that don't really get what we do (I'll refrain from names) who truly believe I should be more of a champion/cheerleader of the program. I've had former players unfollow me on Twitter, and also confront me on why I was negative toward them. I explain to them that I didn't go 3-15. Sometimes they don't get it. Brey and I have had our moments and our battles, but that's normal. He gets what our job is.\n\nChris, DC: Tom, I was wondering if ND can have a tickets policy of kids get in free for certain games. At least there is someone in the seat who may occasionally yell and stand.\n\nTom Noie: Chris: You'd think they'd have adopted that long ago, or especially when there were maybe 4,000 total for the Dec. 11 game against Marquette. Get it that you don't like the coach, but you've got to be better than that.\n\nRay from Southern California - Thank you Tom. You do a great job and I have enjoyed your articles for many years. I respect your opinion even when I disagree with you.\n\nTom Noie: We can agree to disagree. It might be difficult to see all the way out there, but if you sat in my seat, it all makes a whole lot more sense. Trust me.\n\nMike from San Diego: Do we look to hire a guy that could (potentially) bring over some good players for next years roster (I'm totally kidding.. but kind of not)\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Next season has to be a wash. Now, I know the new guy will get here and insist that they can win and win now, but this has to be more of a big picture hire. If you have to sacrifice next year and the roster makeup to get the right guy, it's more important to nail the hire than salvage the roster.\n\nMike in PA: Ray - You now know me, and I could not possibly disagree with you more. I also know TWENTY SIX ND fans that also disagree with you. So there's that.\n\nTom Noie: Mike: You go to the right coast, Ray will go to the left. Somebody's gotta keep the peace.\n\nRay from Southern California - When did I say final four or Bust? My position is only making 3 Sweet 16's in 23 years. I never said final four or bust. If Brey never made a final four but made the Sweet 16 say 5-6 times then you would be correct. Nobody is expecting final fours. We were expecting Brey to win some of the games against Old Dominion, Winthrop, Iowa State, Ole Miss, Florida State, Xavier, and Washington State. Brey laid a huge egg many times in the dance. That's the issue. Like you said we agree to disagree. Robert from Mishawaka: I can't believe Ray thinks ND is a power hoops program and should fire a coach based on NCAA tourney results. Matt Painter would be nervous if Ray were his boss.\n\nTom Noie: Robert: As would a lot of other coaches. Getting to a Final Four, getting to a Sweet 16 isn't as easy as filling out a bracket every Monday in March.\n\nJustin Ft. Wayne: Your telling me every football player goes to class and has good grades? I surely hope they loosen up the policies so basketball can get to the national stage it should be at.\n\nTom Noie: Justin: Don't hold your breath. 😃\n\nJoe from Chicago: How would you assess the comradery of this group? They've seemingly been around forever, but I never got the sense that there was a ton of chemistry\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Seven guys in the rotation, seven Ubers to the arena. Not a whole lot of togetherness there. Or if it is, it's so understated that it's barely noticeable.\n\nWadelite: Is it a bit disingenuous to even suggest Brey inherited a dumpster fire job. He inherited 2 first round draft picks plus a top 40 recruit in Carroll who would become a 10 year nba vet. Also a 1500 point scorer in Graves and a verbal from Chris Thomas. Yes he secured his verbal, but would he have landed it from the beginning. In 22 years Brey has recruited 2 first round draft picks. One from his high school and one from South Bend. Just 3 second round picks, 2 from northern Indiana. In terms of roster talent he is leaving his successor a lot less than what he inherited. There are many coaches who could have taken ND to the NCAAT in Brey's first 2 seasons.\n\nTom Noie: Wade: Nobody's saying it was a Dumpster fire when Mike Brey walked in the door, but it was a Dumpster fire of a decade. It remained Independent way too long, then wandered around aimlessly in the Big East wilderness for five, six years. And that core that Brey inherited of which you speak? The Troy Murphys and the Matt Carrolls? That core lost 17 games the year before Brey got here. The ground on which he walked in on as the third coach in three years was a whole lot shakier than you might want to believe. Tom Noie: This is what set Brey apart - how many times did the Big East change during his tenure? Going division? OK, you better win. he won. Going one division? Better win. He won. Then expansion, how many times? Three? Four? Better win. He won. He also did it with little backing from the administration in terms of arena renovation and practice facility. He barely cared. Notre Dame won. Notre Dame established an identity in arguably the country's toughest league. It stood toe to toe with Connecticut and Georgetown. It beat Villanova and Marquette. That matters. Tom Noie: Then just when everything seemed in place, they up and moved leagues. Brey had to start over. Two years later, Notre Dame is cutting down nets in Greensboro. From no direction, no culture, no anything to something. Even the most ardent Brey basher has to see that. Acknowledge that. When people don't, or won't, that's just crazy talk,\n\nMike from San Diego: To the poll question.. could that someone else be Chris Mack? Is he just out of the question bc of a couple bad years? Andy Kennedy? I'm going w/ a bald theme here\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Given my current hairline, I admire the flex, but given how it ended with Chris Mack at Louisville, with him secretly taping a conversation with Dino Gaudio to save his own backside, that's too much to look past. Andy Kennedy? Think Notre Dame can do better.\n\nWadelite: Have to disagree with Bill on Brady Dunlap. He is the least ready to play. No defined skill. The Oklahoma guard can at least shoot and he will put on some muscle. Burton is not scrawny, but of course will need more strength.\n\nTom Noie: They're both too little to withstand the ACC. Burton can get to the basket as easily as anyone right now, but that's not the case when it's Armando Bacot lurking. At best, even with Mike Brey back next season, I couldn't see any of those three being must-play pieces.\n\nWadelite: I believe early on we wanted to believe the too close early season games were because of experienced mid major teams with some quick guards and physical big men, but for me the nathan Jessup code red was saint bonaventure. They returned no one from last season. It was a patch work group of unheralded transfers and frosh that manhandled ND'S super seniors and top 50 frosh. Embarrassing, because that team had no continuity in playing together. The msu game was a mirage. A team on fumes from 2 cross country trips missing 2 of their top 5 guys. They were like an nba load management team on a back to back. This team was doomed when Brey thought he could get by Lasz at center for 30 mpg and Hammond being hurt and losing his opportunity to stake out the lead guard spot to start the season.\n\nTom Noie: Amen, but I wrote part of the Saint Bonaventure disaster on playing away from home for the first time. Like, it had to get better. It never got any better. Still hasn't, to the point where you wonder if they're going to win even once away from home. Speaks to the \"road dawg\" mentality of good Irish teams of seasons past.\n\nMike from San Diego: It can’t be understated that I think we had the coolest coaching duo in D1 w/ Brey and Freeman... at lot of our reputation is at risk w/ the new hire. We need somebody funny and charming like MB or I am out. Those r my only reqs\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Regardless of who is hired, he's not going to come anywhere close to Mike Brey. We all were spoiled for 23 seasons. He was the best to cover because he got it. He got all of it. He never closed down his locker room after even the toughest nights. He never made his guys unavailable. He never declined to answer a question, and there were plenty of tough ones. I'll miss covering him every day for six months out of the year, but intrigued as hell about where all this might go.\n\nWadelite: I have an interesting darkhorse coaching candidate: Ryan Odom. His father has big time ACC roots and Ryan was the head coach for a 16 seed that beat Virginia by 20 points. Doing alright at Utah State, a sneaky very good mid major program. Oh and regarding Bryce Drew. He does not go 0-18 if Darius Garland is healthy for his entire frosh season. His value to that team was comparable to Troy Murphy as a soph at ND. Also recruited Nesmith, a future 1st round pick. A promising wing for the Pacers.\n\nTom Noie: Ryan Odom, yes. Bryce Drew. Nope. Don't see it.\n\nRobert from Mishawaka: I’ll keep listening my man!\n\nTom Noie: You better!\n\nJoe from Chicago: As far as names being thrown out. I hear Porter Moser a lot and while he had success at Loyola, I think is OU stint has not been anything to elevate his profile. TJ Oltzenberger from Iowa State and John Beilein would be my home run hires. Never knew Belein had said that Notre Dame was his dream school Tom Noie: Joe: Timing with Porter Moser. Had he still been at Loyola, maybe the frontrunner. Now? Don't see it. And Oklahoma has more resources/money than Notre Dame. You also could argue that Iowa State and the Big 12 (Otzenberger) is a better situation. Not everybody is looking at Notre Dame job and thinking, that could be mine. Might be the opposite.\n\nWadelite: How about Scott Drew?\n\nTom Noie: Why? He's built Baylor into his own, and can get anybody he wants into school. He gets here and learns how it works and thinks, yeah, Waco ain't that bad.\n\nBobby: Steve Pikiell?\n\nTom Noie: I'd look hard at him. You win at Rutgers the way he's won at Rutgers, it's impressive. So is he. Has been since his days at Stony Brook.\n\nWadelite: Based on what you noted on transfers, is it likely ND will only be able to look at freshman transfers besides graduate transfers. FWIW I can come with at least 4 that ND recruited who are buried at better programs and will be recruited over. There are also at least 2 ivy league potential transfers who have a 5th year option. Last seasons poty and the second leading scorer this season.\n\nTom Noie: That's great, but from what I understand, getting a freshman out of the portal today is akin to Mike Brey playing 12 guys - impossible. The portal the way it's currently constructed works against Notre Dame. A freshman's transcript better look almost identical to that of a freshman at Notre Dame. The chances of that happening? Good luck.\n\nWadelite: On Scott Drew, at ND he would just have to play second fiddle to Marcus Freeman. In Waco he has to play second fiddle to Chip and Joanna Gaines.\n\nTom Noie: Or he can have them refurbish a farmhouse for him out on Mayflower Road...IYKYK 😃\n\nWadelite: If Darian Devries were hired at his coach, do you really think his sophomore son averaging 19 ppg at Drake is not admitted as a transfer? The PTB would find a way.\n\nTom Noie: Little different deal there, my man.\n\nMike in PA: Tom - what do you think Mike Brey's next move is? He said he wouldn't rule out coaching again. Everyone, and I agree, says he would be great on TV. Do you get the sense that is something he would want to do? If he did coach again, do you see it at a Power 5? Or would he go somewhere like, Iona?\n\nTom Noie: Mike: Mike Brey's answer the other day for what's next was along the lines of being at a party/gathering for an extended time, enjoying the hell of out of it, but then ducking out to take care of something and promising to return. Everyone at the party is telling you/begging you not to leave the party yet. It's still a good time. But you leave anyway and when you return, the vibe's different. Nothing is the same. You kick yourself for not just going home. That's what it is with Brey right now - just go home. The thought right now about coaching sounds like a good time, but get him away from the grind, and then have him jump back into it at some other school. He'll realize it's just not the same. He says he wants to coach, but I don't see it. The time and the effort and the energy that it takes, yeah, he's a competitive SOB, but he's also someone who had looked forward to unplugging from coaching and all that it entails. Don't know if TV is the next move. Can see him in more of an advisory/consultant role.\n\nPaul R: What do you think about John Becker from Vermont? Consistent winner, teams play hard and come close to big upsets in the NCAA tourney almost every year\n\nTom Noie: Paul: Solid coach, along the lines of Matt Langel from Colgate. Would be on my second Top 15 list. Might be someone to at least effort.\n\nMatt from St. Louis: Think any of the current super seniors continue to play after this year? Nate and/or Dane good enough to play some overseas? Do you think any of them have interest in that?\n\nTom Noie: Matt: Yes, especially given how their last seasons at Notre Dame went, they won't/don't want that to be their last organized basketball experience. They'll find a place to play overseas for a few years, then fall back on those MBAs. It's a nice option to have.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, I don't see Brey coaching college ball again. He never embraced the changes that we now have to live with and he never showed the hunger necessary on the recruiting trail. As much as he sees himself as a teacher, and I think he is, I just don't think he is willing to put up with all of the \"distractions\" that prevent him from teaching. And they are hear to stay.\n\nTom Noie: Joe: Agreed. It's more difficult to win these days, let alone getting out of it for a year or two, then trying to get back up to speed. Like, wait, THIS is what I came back for? Forget that. He's run his race. It's time to live a good life, a better life.\n\nCraig in NJ: The coach who will take this job is a young guy at a smaller school like Digger (Fordham) or Mike (Delaware). ND may provide job secuirty but it is not one of the top twenty jobs in the country. Well, top 30. Okay, maybe top 50\n\nTom Noie: Craig: Are you sure it's Top 50? Now, it can be if there's a buy-in from the university. Jack Swarbrick comes to the new guy and says, we've decided to do it the way Duke and Villanova and Gonzaga do it. Then everything's there - the national name, the facilities, the league, everything. If nothing changes, or very little changes, it remains a really difficult job. Even worse for a young guy who doesn't know any better and won't push for any additional support.\n\njoe from the south side: Tom, The Parker, Brady, Markus recruiting class was never meant to be a \"Homerun\" class. Brey's poor roster management backed him into a corner. That class was intended to lend stability to the program so that it didn't become an annual revolving door. Those 3 were likely multi-year guys. BTW, what is your read on JRK? I would think the local boy sticks it out. Yes?\n\nTom Noie: Joe: J.R. Konieczny strikes me as someone who will wait and see how all this shakes out. He has to get this next move right - stay or go? He can't afford to be like, ah, it's never going to happen here, so I'm out, when it MIGHT happen here. See Matt Ryan. He was soooooo anxious to go and start his clock that he missed out on a potential gold-mine of an opportunity at Notre Dame. You know what they say - grass ain't always greener.\n\nJim from Charlottesville VA: Hello Tom & All. I observe a lightness about the Coach retiring—both here and throughout college basketball— that does not extend to the players in this disastrous season. There’s something misguided about that. The Irish roster proved in over its head in November. In the flow of play this year, they too often get beaten by better players (who are better coached) to be pinned with beating themselves. Brey particularly should not throw them under that bus.\n\nTom Noie: Jim: Lightness? Around these parts? Not feeling that. If anything, I've been told I'm too hard on the coach and the players and the program. Gotta pat 'em on the back for giving it the old college try. As has been mentioned, Brey owns everything about this tire fire, but the players don't skate. Look at some of the end-of-game/close-game decisions they've made. That's not a coach thing. It's a player thing. Brey has talked a lot about this team taking ownership of itself, but no player has said, hey, this one's on us. We've failed Coach.\n\nMatt: I really hope Brey just empties what bench he has and let them all play at this point. Give the incoming coach some game film on them. They can't do any worse.\n\nTom Noie: Wanna bet...we crossed the \"this can't get any worse\" the afternoon of the North Carolina loss. My response to Dane Goodwin when he said it was, really? Sure it can get worse. Remember the core of this team was on the court when it trailed North Carolina by 52 in an ACC tournament game. Just when you think it can't get worse, it gets worse.\n\nCraig in NJ: Sorry Tom. I need a sarcasm font. The primary appeal of this position is job security.\n\nTom Noie: True, but if you get a coach worth anything, he'll be like, forget job security and no pressure. I want to freakin win.\n\nMatt: For the last game, if Brey isn't wearing a mock turtleneck underneath a Hawaiian shirt, I will be upset.\n\nTom Noie: Please, only in your dream. Or nightmare. Let's not make this more of a clown show than it already has been. Please. 😃\n\nWadelite: Tom, I am still mystified on the parent of a former player taking a cheap shot at you on Twitter. Garbage about you \"not being supportive\". What a crock as you have considerably more grief about being the opposite.\n\nTom Noie: It's all good. Just consider the source. Some people get it, some don't.\n\nTom D.: Does anyone ever confront Jack Swarbrick about ND's lack of commitment to basketball success. If so, what is his reply? Thanks!\n\nTom Noie: Tom: Confront probably not the right word to use. We're not in the confronting business (seriously). I've had plenty of talks with Jack Swarbrick, particularly about the basketball program. He'll give the standard middle of the road all is well AD kind of answer.

Phil Murphy on Tuesday continued his trend of reversing the policies of his Republican predecessor by signing bills into law giving greater rights to transgender people and allowing tax credits for filming in New Jersey.\n\nMurphy also approved measures to give police and firefighters more control over their pension investments, fulfilling a longstanding desire of union leaders, and to allow toxic water to be treated at a South Jersey facility.\n\nHere's a breakdown of what Murphy signed Tuesday:\n\nTransgender rights\n\nNew Jersey joined a small group of states to allow people to amend their birth certificate without proof of having undergone a sex-change operation.\n\nAnother bill Murphy signed, S-493, allows a person's changed gender identity to be reflected on death certificates.\n\nMurphy also announced the creation of the Transgender Equality Task Force, a 17-member body that will be charged with assessing the legal and societal barriers for transgender individuals, particularly in the areas of health care, education, housing and criminal justice, according to the bill, S-705.\n\nThe actions represent movement by Murphy toward fulfilling a campaign promise to protect and expand the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, commonly known as members of the LGBT community.\n\n“Today is an important day for New Jersey as we continue to strive toward equality for all of our residents, regardless of sex or gender expression,” Murphy said in a statement.\n\n“Allowing vital records to match gender identity is an important step forward that will allow transgender individuals to control the disclosure of their transgender status. And by creating a Transgender Equality Task Force, New Jersey can ensure that all residents receive the protections they deserve,\" Murphy said. \"New Jersey will continue to stand with our LGBTQ residents in the continued pursuit of similar rights nationwide.”\n\nFormer Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, twice vetoed the birth certificate bill, S-478, citing \"legal uncertainties.\" But the American Medical Association called in 2014 for states to stop requiring surgery as a condition of amending birth certificates because it did not reflect all the options to change one's sex.\n\nRelated:First operation in New Jersey creates penis for transgender man\n\nMore:NJ budget agreement: Deal on taxes, spending increases includes gimmicks Murphy faulted\n\nThe birth certificate measure will now be known as the Babs Siperstein Law, named for the advocate who pressed for its passage. According to the bill, a person must complete and submit a form from the state registrar affirming under penalty of perjury \"that the request for a change in gender — to female, male, or undesignated/non-binary — is made for the purpose of conforming with that person’s gender identity and is not for any fraudulent purpose.\"\n\nMurphy's actions were praised by Garden State Equality, the gay-rights organization that helped draft the legislation. The group said New Jersey is the 17th state to enact a law dropping the surgery requirement for amending a birth certificate and just the fourth, behind California, Oregon and Washington, to allow for a third gender option on the document.\n\n\"New Jersey has finally removed the outdated, invasive and overly burdensome proof-of-surgery requirement. Furthermore, we have created a path for people who identify outside the binary to access accurate documents,\" said Aaron Potenza, the group's director of programs. \"I am proud to have worked with the National Center for Transgender Equality, with activists like Babs Siperstein and with our allies in the Legislature, to modernize the process for changing gender markers on New Jersey birth certificates.\"\n\nFilm tax credits\n\nMurphy also signed what's known as the Garden State Film and Digital Media Jobs Act, a potentially money-losing tax-credit program. Christie had suspended the program because, he said, it was unsustainable.\n\nThe bill, S-122, was passed last month and would give up to $75 million in tax credits for film production and up to $10 million for digital media over five years. The credits could cost the state up to $425 million in direct revenue, according to the Office of Legislative Services.\n\nMurphy had returned the bill to the Legislature with suggestions to lure companies to make significant efforts to hire diverse casts and crews. The Legislature complied with those suggestions before Murphy signed the bill.\n\nDespite the potential loss of hundreds of millions in revenue, Murphy and bill sponsors viewed it as a positive for the state.\n\n“The film and digital media industry is poised to become a dynamic part of New Jersey’s economy, one that will create good-paying union jobs and countless residual benefits to the economy,” Murphy said in a statement. “By signing this legislation, we are allowing these companies to take advantage of New Jersey’s unique culture, location and geography.\"\n\nPension spinoff\n\nAnother law Murphy signed Tuesday, S-5, spins off management of the retirement fund for police and firefighters from New Jersey’s larger pension system, giving the employees more control over investment decisions and benefits.\n\nMurphy conditionally vetoed an earlier version of the bill and added protections to make it harder for a new board of trustees to make benefit enhancements or restore cost-of-living adjustments that were frozen under Christie. The state's major police and fire unions support the changes and hope the new law will help insulate their fund from harmful policy decisions by the state.\n\n“It places in the hands of [Police and Firemen’s Retirement System] members and their employers the tools to do what the state has failed to do for too long: focus on fully funding the system,” Pat Colligan, president of the state Policemen’s Benevolent Association, said in a statement.\n\nWastewater treatment\n\nMurphy also signed a bill that will allow toxic water to be treated at a South Jersey facility after he conditionally vetoed the measure in May, saying it needed more environmental safeguards.\n\nAfter changes to the bill, S-879, the DuPont Chambers Works in Salem County will need a number of permits from the Department of Environmental Protection before being allowed to resume treatment of toxic water and discharge it into the Delaware River — a practice the company halted six years ago.\n\nEnvironmentalists wanted Murphy to issue an outright veto instead of offering a compromise. They say the facility, owned by DuPont’s spinoff company Chemours, will likely accept chemicals and water used to frack natural gas from underground rock formations in northeast Pennsylvania.\n\nStaff Writers Nicholas Pugliese and Scott Fallon contributed to this article.

Harris McDowell, co-chair of of the powerful budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, said at a Friday press briefing. “I don’t want to de-emphasize that it’s a difficult issue. But we just have to get those diversity numbers up.”\n\nMcDowell and other state leaders came together to say, unequivocally, that it is untenable for the state’s flagship university to have only one in 20 students enrolled be black when one in five residents statewide are black. That’s especially true, McDowell points out, when state taxpayers annually hand the school millions of dollars – $120 million in the most recent budget passed in June.\n\n“All our students, including our minority students, need to see a path forward at UD,” said Sen. Margaret Rose Henry. “Many of our students in Delaware are not able to attend their own state school.”\n\nCalls for change are welcome to students like Jasmine Anthony, a Sussex County native who is used to finding herself the only black student in any class.\n\n“I sometimes feel like, whenever I speak out in class, I’m not just speaking for me, I’m speaking for all black people,” said Anthony, who’s majoring in black studies and political science. “I have to be very careful what I say, because everyone is looking at me like, ‘This is what all black people think.’”\n\nUD grad Carl Suddler knows precisely what Anthony is talking about. He calls it “being speaker for your race.”\n\n“As a student, it puts you in this position where you’re more cautious, you’re timid, you don’t want to say the wrong thing,” said Suddler, who graduated from Glasgow High School. “You feel like everybody’s looking at you.”\n\nSeveral black students said they’ve rarely encountered outright, flagrant racism at UD, though incidents do happen. Anthony says she once had a racial slur shouted at her from a passing car, and one of Anthony’s friends said she had the same N-word hollered at her by a white person who tossed a chicken nugget while she walked down a sidewalk.\n\nLast year, when UD played Delaware State University, a historically-black university, racial insults spread on the social media app Yik Yak, drawing condemnation from top UD officials.\n\nYasser Payne, a professor of black studies at UD, often tells black students that adjusting to college life will take more effort for them than it will for white students.\n\n“Your biggest challenge will not actually be drilling down and doing the work, attending class, doing papers,” Payne said. “Your biggest challenge will be with contending with the culture of this place. It will be trying to get the jokes, to find out when it is appropriate to speak or not to speak.”\n\nPatrick Harker, UD’s president the past eight years, is leaving to lead the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, putting the university at a crossroads as it selects his replacement.\n\n“One of the biggest things we need to address is diversity,” said Robert Opila, the incoming president of the Faculty Senate and a member of the search committee. “The student body isn’t diverse. The faculty isn’t diverse. But the state of Delaware has a sizable African American population. It has to change.”\n\nOpila points to a Middle States Commission on Higher Education review of UD released in 2012 that praised UD for many things, but found it lacking on diversity.\n\n“UD is not diverse in either absolute or relative terms,” the report said. “With few exceptions, we believe that the university trails its peers in every measure of diversity in every constituency of the institution.”\n\nIn the fall of 2014, more than 76 percent of UD’s undergraduate students were white. About 5 percent of undergraduates were black, 7 percent were Hispanic, and 4.5 percent were Asian or Pacific Islander. Foreign students, Native Americans and multiracial students made up the remaining 7.5 percent.\n\nBy contrast, 64 percent of Delaware’s population is white, 22 percent is black, 8 percent is Hispanic and 3.7 percent is Asian, Census figures from 2013 show. Native Americans and multiracial citizens make up the remaining 2.3 percent.\n\n“It’s not like we’re in Minnesota,” said Leland Ware, a black professor who has taught at UD 15 years. “We are between Baltimore and Philadelphia, where there are large black middle classes.”\n\nBetween 1998 and 2014, the percentage of Hispanic students at the school leaped from 2.4 in 1998 to more than 7.\n\nMaria Matos, president of the Latin American Community Center, credited Harker’s predecessor, David Roselle, with helping build the Hispanic student body by hiring upper-level administrators, like the provost and admissions staff, who were Hispanic.\n\n“If there’s diversity at the table when people are making decisions, there are different perspectives,” Matos said. “If you don’t have those perspectives, it’s difficult to make decisions that lead to diversity.”\n\nAsian students’ share increased from 2.6 percent to 4.6 percent between 1998 and 2014.\n\nPalash Gupta, President of the Delaware Asian American Business Association, believes more Asian students are attending UD because more Asian families are coming to Delaware. Over the past few decades, Gupta said, immigrants flocked to the U.S. to receive training in burgeoning engineering and computer science fields – and children of those immigrants followed in their parents’ footsteps.\n\n“Delaware is definitely one of those places where there is opportunity,” Gupta said.\n\nWhile Hispanic and Asian students have seen steady gains, the percentage of black students has stubbornly stayed around five percent for decades. In 1998, 5.8 percent of students were black; in 2014, that number was around 5.1.\n\nJames Jones, Director of the Center for the Study of Diversity at UD, says cost is often a factor, because black families generally have lower incomes than white families. The K-12 school system, he points out, also continues to see achievement gaps between white and black students, meaning fewer black students reach the admissions bar. And those that excel may go elsewhere.\n\n“Those black students who are well-prepared and have the economic wherewithal have a lot of options, so we are really competing heavily with other institutions for them,” Jones said.\n\nNationally, there were 17.5 million undergraduates in 2013, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Of those, 56 percent were white, while almost 2.6 million – about 15 percent – were black. The number of black students nationally doubled between 1990 and 2013.\n\nOther regional institutions have higher proportions of black students: last school year, the University of Maryland was 12.7 percent black, Rutgers was 10 percent black and the University of Pennsylvania was 7.1 percent black.\n\nUD’s 5.1 percent was higher than Penn State’s 3.8 percent.\n\nSchools nationwide that set similar entrance requirements to UD were slightly more diverse. About 7 percent of students were black, according to U.S. Department of Education Data analyzed by Anthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.\n\nThese comparisons hardly mean UD is alone in having a less-than-diverse student body. In fact, many schools that require high test scores and GPAs have largely white, affluent populations.\n\n“If you look at the demographics nationally, we are on par with our aspirant and peer institutions when it comes to attracting students who are of African descent,” said Carol Henderson, vice provost for diversity.\n\nUD officials point to the statistics for research-intensive universities that the school either competes with, like Rutgers, Penn State, the University of Maryland, or aspires to compete with, like Ohio State, University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin.\n\nA group of 34 such universities had an average of 4 percent black students, according to a report run for UD officials by the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nUD agrees that it needs to do more.\n\nIn February, when Harker went to discuss the school’s state funding in front of the Legislature’s budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, he addressed growing criticism about the lack of diversity from groups like the NAACP.\n\n“In all candor, this has been a long-standing issue for the University of Delaware. It’s an issue that we need to continue to plug away at,” Harker said. “It’s not something we’re going to solve overnight.”\n\nIn 2012, after the Middle States report, the university launched the President’s Diversity Initiative, spurring the creation of new programs and student organizations designed to make the campus more inclusive.\n\nIn June of last year, Harker named Henderson, a UD professor who has authored books about the representation of black people in literature and culture, the school’s Vice Provost for Diversity.\n\n“Diversity is an ongoing process and the university is actively involved in that process,” Henderson said.\n\nHenderson’s job is to not just encourage diversity based on race, but also family income, sexual orientation and gender.\n\nHarker directed Henderson to create a university-wide plan for diversity. She says a draft of that document should be ready by summer’s end.\n\nHenderson points to a host of different programs UD already has created aimed at recruiting minorities and helping them succeed. A few of those programs include:\n\n• The College Readiness Scholars Institute, in which Christina School District seniors and juniors get to visit the school and get help with admissions.\n\n• UD Scholars, in which first generation freshmen come to school early to get acclimated to college life.\n\n• Diversity Enrichment Leaders, specially trained guides who host campus tours for minority students and send personal letters to admitted students.\n\n• Each One Reach One, which pairs first-year black students with upperclassmen.\n\n• NUCLEUS, which includes additional work with academic advisers, weekly e-mails and social media posts about important academic deadlines and campus events, a dedicated study space, work-study positions and opportunities to do research as an undergrad.\n\nSchool officials also point to a long list of student organizations dedicated to minority students, from the Asian Student Association to the Caribbean Student Alliance and the Indian Student Association.\n\nUD has a Center for Black Culture, which lists at least 17 different student organizations for black students, including seven black sororities and fraternities, an NAACP chapter, gospel choir and African Dance troupe.\n\nHenderson argues there’s evidence all these efforts are bearing fruit. Considering all minority races, the past two freshman classes have been some of the most diverse in school history, she said.\n\n“Different affinity groups require different approaches,” Henderson said. “Here at UD we try to take lots of different approaches to diversity.”\n\nSome, like professor Jones, see promise in the work that Henderson is doing and changes in the admission process.\n\n“I don’t believe the efforts and the analytics have been there to support this effort until recently,” Jones said.\n\nBlack students were not permitted to attend UD until 1950, when Louis Redding successfully sued the school on behalf of six black students who were turned down for admission because of their race. Unable to attend UD himself, Redding went on to graduate from Brown University and earned a law degree at Harvard.\n\nThe year after the UD suit, cases Redding had filed in Delaware were combined with suits from other states in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court which found schools that were separated by race were inherently unequal. The decision led to desegregation of public schools.\n\nStudent activists like Anthony, who is president of the UD chapter of the NAACP, acknowledge that UD is taking some action.\n\n“Dr. Henderson is fabulous,” Anthony said. “They’re trying. But more needs to be done.”\n\nFor one thing, Anthony argues the university needs to target more efforts at white students. Many white students and even white professors, she argues, are ill-equipped to have conversations about race.\n\n“It’s a very polite campus,” Anthony said. “Talking about race can be difficult, and people don’t like to do it. But how can we address a problem if we can’t even talk about it?”\n\nHenderson said the university has tried to spur campus-wide conversations about diversity through its First Year Experience program, in which freshmen students read a common book and have group discussions.\n\n“The First Year Experience is one of the rare times that we get all our students together,” Henderson said. “We use that opportunity to have conversations about how we can be a more inclusive academic community.”\n\nThe university needs to hire more black professors, many students and faculty say.\n\nOf the 1,203 full-time faculty at UD last year, only 52 professors were black – less than 5 percent.\n\n“If I come visit campus and it looks like all the students are white and all the professors are white, that’s going to be a worry for me,” said UD grad Suddler.\n\nHe remembers black students at UD finding common places where they could gather to avoid a sense of isolation, like “The Booth” in the Trabant Student Center.\n\nSuddler was a member of the first graduating class in the University’s Black American Studies program, double-majoring in history. He recently earned his PhD at Indiana University – another largely-white school – and will be a visiting fellow at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\n“[Emory's] population is 10 percent black,” Suddler said. “That was appealing to me, to know that it was less likely where I’d run into the situation where my whole class is white students. To know that there’s a better chance there will be other black members of the faculty.”\n\nUD professor Payne argues that the university can’t simply hire its way to a more diverse student body.\n\n“It can be a hard problem for a university to solve because it is sort of an abstract issue,” Payne said. “There has to be a cultural shift that starts at the administration and goes all the way down to the faculty.”\n\nProfessor Ware says continued efforts from top officials won’t get traction unless the broader university community starts to see a shift in mindset.\n\n“Decisions at the staff level, at the department level, have to be made with diversity in mind,” Ware said. “Professor Jones has to look out and see an all-white class of 35 students and think, ‘OK, this is strange.’ And that’s often not the case now.”\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2017/11/28/confidential-plan-calls-consolidating-wilmington-schools-down-two/899139001/", "title": "Confidential plan would close three Wilmington schools", "text": "A confidential draft of a memorandum of understanding between the Christina School District and Gov. John Carney's office calls for consolidating five Wilmington schools into just two by fall 2018.\n\nThe schools would be called New Bayard and New Bancroft, and both would serve kindergarten through eighth grade, according to a document obtained by The News Journal and dated Nov. 22.\n\nThe other three – Pulaski Elementary, Stubbs Elementary and Elbert-Palmer Elementary – would no longer serve as schools but could house resource centers. The document is not final and is subject to change.\n\nIt is unclear what details of the plan will be shared at a public meeting Wednesday. At a meeting Tuesday morning, three school board members, district staff, a union representative and members of Carney's team talked about the memorandum but did not make the document available for public consumption.\n\nThey avoided using specifics, though eventually, it became clear the plan called for closing some schools and keeping others open.\n\nSchool board member John Young approached the subject bluntly, saying \"Eventually, we're not going to be able to say 'repurpose.' We're going to have to say 'closed,'\" referring to the language used to promote the public meeting on Wednesday night.\n\nSuperintendent Richard Gregg recommended removing the names of schools from the document before it came to the school board for the vote, and there was a discussion about having the governor refrain from using the schools' names in public.\n\nThe Wilmington Education Improvement Commission, a state advisory committee formed by then-Gov. Jack Markell to come up with ideas to improve education in the city, was also scheduled to review Carney's original outline of the proposal Tuesday night. They did not meet to discuss the draft MOU. WEIC did not publicly advertise the meeting in compliance with state law or post the agenda for the meeting until late Monday, after a News Journal reporter called and asked when it would be shared.\n\nThe Christina school board was originally scheduled to discuss the agreement on Dec. 5 and vote on it Dec. 12, but it will now take a preliminary vote on the draft on Dec. 5, before voting on a \"final\" draft Dec. 12. Both meetings were originally scheduled to be held at schools in Newark but will be moved to schools in Wilmington.\n\nIf approved in its current form, the memorandum requires the board to either accept or reject the school reconfiguration plan by Feb. 28.\n\nIf it rejects the plan and fails to come up with an acceptable alternative, the agreement would be terminated immediately, resulting in the loss of any additional financial support for the district.\n\nThe memorandum says Carney and the state Education Department would ask the General Assembly for additional funding to renovate the schools, as well as provide trauma-informed training to principals and teachers. It also promises funding for a dual-generation education center, as well as \"philanthropic monies to support all Wilmington schools,\" starting with those in Christina.\n\nThe exact amount of extra funding is not specified in the draft, though blanks are left open for the final amounts. Carney, who attended the Tuesday meeting briefly before leaving for Dover, said he is still working on those details and that the General Assembly would need to approve any appropriation of funds.\n\nSTORY:Gov. Carney meets with Christina families ahead of Wednesday public meeting\n\nSTORY:New Castle police searching for Monday night shooter\n\nMeredith Griffin Jr., another school board member, asked that the district be able to opt out of the partnership if the money does not materialize, but was otherwise in favor of the concept.\n\n\"It's phenomenal,\" he said. \"I'm excited about the opportunity. I think we're in a unique position to do what hasn't been done before, and we can set a trend.\"\n\n'New' Wilmington schools\n\nNew Bayard would serve students from Wilmington's west side, while New Bancroft would serve students on the east side.\n\nThe \"West Wilmington School\" would be housed in the building currently known as Bayard Middle School. If feasible, the school would be remodeled to house grades K-3 on the first floor, grades 3-5 on the second floor and grades 6-8 on the third floor, effectively placing students into three separate areas for a \"school within a school\" model of education, according to the draft memorandum.\n\nThe West Wilmington School may also offer science, technology, engineering and math programs as well as arts programs, according to the document.\n\nThe East Wilmington School will be housed in what is currently Bancroft Elementary School. Once again, grades will be split among three floors, and STEM and art programming may be offered. There is no mention of Christina's Montessori program, which is located at Bancroft.\n\nEach school would have a wellness center that provides social-emotional, behavioral and mental health services, according to the plan. The Henrietta Johnson Medical Center may provide those services at Bancroft, the memorandum said.\n\nCareer pathways for grades 7 and 8 are also recommended.\n\nThe plans call for both schools to start operating in their new form by fall 2018 unless the Delaware Department of Education determines otherwise.\n\nTeachers now working at Bayard and Bancroft would be given the option to continue working in the building, though their duties may change, according to the confidential document. Employees working at the district's other Wilmington schools would be able to \"opt out of employment\" at one of the new schools, according to the draft memorandum.\n\nThe dual-generation center would provide early education and day care services for children from birth to 4 years old, as well as a variety of services to their parents, according to the document. The reconfiguration plan calls for the program to be housed at Stubbs Elementary School, which would also be renovated.\n\nThe newly re-established Family Services Cabinet Council would provide technical assistance for the dual-generation program, as well as for the wellness centers.\n\nThe plan also mentions the potential establishment of an early education center and a center for students and families learning English as a second language. Potential locations for those services include Elbert-Palmer Elementary School and Pulaski Elementary School, which the school district would retain ownership of but could lease out to generate additional revenue for the district.\n\nThe buildings could be converted back into schools if the district gets more students.\n\nStory continues below PDF.\n\nSupport for school staff\n\nAnother area the draft document touches on is providing school staff and principals more support and flexibility.\n\nOne section even says the new schools \"will not be bound by any Christina School District policy absent an affirmative election, in writing,\" meaning the school board would have only limited authority over them. Based on the conversation on Tuesday, however, that section will be either changed or removed from the agreement.\n\nThe schools would instead be able to propose curriculum and student handbook changes and bring them to the school board for approval.\n\n\"We're not saying we want to make the rules,\" Bancroft Elementary School Principal Harold \"Butch\" Ingram said. \"We just want to have a voice.\"\n\nThe memo also calls for the school district and union to negotiate new collective bargaining agreements that may include higher salaries for city educators. New contracts may not be necessary, school leaders said Tuesday, though at the very least, the union would have to approve a separate memorandum of understanding laying out new employee incentives.\n\nThe document also outlines a \"co-leadership model\" involving the schools' principals and associate principals. One leader would focus on evaluating, coaching and supporting educators, while the other would focus on school operations and culture.\n\nEach school would form teacher-leader teams, which would work with school administrators to make key decisions on school schedules, budget and resource allocation, staffing, curriculum, collaborative time and professional development. Teachers would participate on the teams on a rotating basis. Teachers would also receive training on classroom management, trauma-informed care and culturally relevant instruction, among other things.\n\nTo reduce teacher turnover, the plan proposes a loan forgiveness stipend for educators and would give teachers interested in working in Wilmington the option to \"secure their employment\" for three full school years. At the principal's discretion, they may be able to secure an additional two years.\n\nMany of the changes would require an affirmative vote by the Christina Education Association, though that would likely come after the memorandum of understanding is actually approved.\n\n\"It is the heaviest lift, in my opinion,\" Young said of negotiating the proposed terms with the union.\n\nNOTE: You must be signed into Facebook vote to see the poll results below.\n\nHarrie Ellen Minnehan, another school board member, said staffing and union issues were part of the reason other turnaround efforts, like the Priority Schools plan, eventually fell apart. Teachers did not want to be laid off or transferred to other buildings when the state took over three low-performing schools.\n\nUnless policies are put in place to make sure the district is hiring and retaining quality teachers, the new partnership won't work either, she said.\n\n\"Leave it alone, and things won't change,\" she said. \"We don't have stability in the faculty in those schools.\"\n\nDorrell Green, director of the state Education Department's Office of Innovation and Improvement, said employment incentives alone won't help Christina retain quality educators.\n\nSchool leaders will have to work hard to create a positive culture, with opportunities for professional development, instructional coaching and trauma-informed training, instead.\n\nIngram agreed. \"Incentives don't keep you in the building, especially if you don't feel supported,\" he said.\n\nThe draft memorandum also calls for longer school days and a longer school year, the lengths of which are yet to be determined. Schools could also start later in the morning, to help ensure kids make it to school on time and are not absent. The change would primarily affect middle schoolers.\n\nThe document also says the district would develop \"vacation academies,\" which students could attend over the summer or school breaks. Such academies could include literacy, STEM, art and project-based activities to boost student achievement. The academies would also feature social-emotional supports.\n\nThe schools would also offer after-school programming, with help from local nonprofits, meant to improve student achievement and offer city kids a safe place to hang out after school.\n\nIf you go\n\nConversation on Wilmington Schools hosted by Gov.

The Cullman Times reported that sixth-grader Denna Chivers has been helping the Cullman County Animal Shelter for three years by holding yard sales and giving the proceeds to the operation. The girl’s mother, BethAnn, said she raised $400 one year and $1,400 the next. She raised $3,000 this year, which was used to purchase some equipment. The shelter decided to use the remainder of the money to offer free adoptions to people looking for a pet. A shelter worker said the offer started Thursday. Denna said she loves all animals, but dogs and cats are her favorite.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: The Sitka Planning Commission got its first look Wednesday at how city code could be amended to make room for tiny houses, specifically those on chassis allowing the structures to be moved. At Wednesday’s meeting, the commission voted 3-2 to direct special projects manager Scott Brylinsky to continue developing proposals on changing parts of the general code to define tiny houses and tiny houses on chassis. The idea is to allow them in mobile home parks and manufactured home parks. Brylinksy was hired to work on an action plan for tiny homes, among other projects. The informal action plan was proposed by the Sitka Assembly last year. The plan directed the Planning Commission review zoning codes to see which ones could be changed to enable tiny homes as a potential affordable housing option. Acting Chairman Darrell Windsor said he would like the full commission present before making recommendations for changes related to tiny homes.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Democratic U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona has introduced a bill that would ban new mining claims around the Grand Canyon. The Obama administration put about 1,562 square miles outside the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park off-limits to new hard rock mining claims until 2032. The bill would make that permanent. Environmentalists and Native American tribes applauded Sinema’s introduction of the bill Thursday. They say mining in the Grand Canyon region, particularly for uranium, could contaminate a water source that serves millions of people. The bill isn’t expected to have an easy ride in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans who have opposed the effort. The House passed a similar bill introduced by Arizona Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva earlier this year. Meanwhile, the mining industry has been pushing President Donald Trump to boost demand for domestic supplies of uranium, tax breaks and other financial incentives.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Republican president pro tem of Arkansas’ Senate said Friday he won’t seek another term leading that chamber next year. Sen. Jim Hendren said he won’t run for another two-year term as the chamber’s president when senators meet at the end of next year’s fiscal session to select a new leader. Hendren’s term as Senate president runs through the end of 2020. Hendren said he’s still seeking re-election to the Senate next year. Hendren said he plans to decide after next year’s session whether to seek the Republican nomination for governor in 2022. Hendren said he didn’t want to serve as the chamber’s leader and run a statewide campaign if he does jump in the governor’s race. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is Hendren’s uncle, is barred by term limits from seeking re-election in 2022. Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin has said he’s seeking the GOP nomination. Other potential GOP candidates for governor include former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and Attorney General Leslie Rutledge.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: At least three unoccupied passenger buses caught fire Saturday night at Los Angeles International Airport, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Shortly after 9 p.m., LAX Airport said on its Twitter account that “there is a significant fire emergency at the LAX-it lot. Emergency responders are on scene. More to come. No immediate reports of injuries.” KTLA and the CBS station in Los Angeles tweeted photos of the fire spewing smoke. At about 10 p.m., the airport said that the fire had been put out, and there were no injuries. The lot reopened, and ride-share services resumed.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Michelle Lindsay, a Zumba instructor and registered dental hygienist from Fort Collins, became the country’s first avalanche death of the season on Dec. 8. On her first run down the South Diamond Peak face, Lindsay was engulfed by an avalanche in a narrow gully. Despite efforts to save the 29-year-old, she died from asphyxiation after being buried. The Colorado Avalanche Information Center released its full report on the avalanche Thursday, which included details from interviews with Lindsay’s companion, a male who was not named in the report. According to the report, Lindsay was 150 feet below her companion, about 11,200 feet in elevation, when she triggered an avalanche midslope. Her partner watched the avalanche unfold around her but noted that it did not look very deep, maybe only up to the top of her boots. He continued to see Lindsay in the avalanche, but the visibility was poor and she disappeared into the white cloud.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Department of Consumer Protection reminded residents that package stores must be closed on Christmas Day and on New Years Day, under state law. Connecticut law also requires bars to be closed by 3 a.m. on the morning of New Years Day. Consumer Protection Commissioner Michelle Seagull said her office encourages those who choose to drink alcohol “to make responsible decisions.” She reminded the public they must be over age 21 to make alcohol purchases. Connecticut lawmakers this year passed legislation updating the state’s liquor laws, in hopes of helping the state’s growing craft brewery industry. One change, which has taken effect, allows breweries to sell more beer to customers for consumption off-premises. The prior law limited craft breweries to selling only up to nine liters to a single individual within one day.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state has confirmed that 26 school-aged children have been infected through a salmonella outbreak that is potentially linked to recalled fruit. The state’s health department said in a statement Friday that evidence indicated that the fruit potentially came from a company in New Jersey. The firm had recently recalled some fruit mix, as well as cut honeydew, cut cantaloupe and cut pineapple. The fruit was distributed in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Delaware. It was sold for use in institutional food service establishments such as schools. The children who were infected with the bacteria in Delaware were in New Castle County. Officials said there is no ongoing risk to any students. The children affected are between the ages of 4 and 17. Salmonella are a group of bacteria that can cause gastrointestinal illness and fever. Most people develop diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. But some people might need to be hospitalized.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture has extended its hours from 10 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. starting Dec. 26, and patrons won't need a pass to enter, WUSA-TV reported. The no-pass entry will go through Dec. 30. After those dates, the museum will resume back to its regular schedule. Groups of 10 or more are still required to get passes to enter the museum. Since opening three years ago, more than 6 million people have visited the museum, the largest cultural destination showcasing the African American story and its impact on American and world history.\n\nFlorida\n\nYeehaw Junction: A semi-truck plowed into a historic inn south of Orlando early Sunday, causing major damage but no apparent injuries. The truck ran through the wall of the Desert Inn and a portion of the building collapsed around it. Lisa Mason, who ran the inn before it closed last year, confirmed the crash but said she didn’t know any details. She said she doesn’t believe anyone was injured. The Florida Highway Patrol did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment. The inn is the centerpiece of Yeehaw Junction, a tiny respite off Florida’s Turnpike between South Florida and Orlando. According to a 2013 article in the Orlando Sentinel, the Desert Inn dates to 1889 when it was a barroom and brothel for cowboys and lumberjacks, and the look of the place hadn’t evolved much since. Through the years, the Desert Inn has been a trading post, gas station and dance hall. Until its closure, it served as a motel, restaurant and convenience store. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A family got a real hoot from its Christmas tree: More than a week after they bought it, they discovered an owl nestled among its branches. Katie McBride Newman said Friday that she and her daughter spotted the bird on Dec. 12. They had bought the 10-foot-tall tree from a Home Depot, brought it back to their Atlanta-area home and decorated it with lights and, coincidentally, owl ornaments. “It was surreal, but we weren’t really freaked out about it,” McBride Newman said. “We’re really outdoorsy people. We love the wilderness.” The family opened windows and doors near the tree hoping the owl would fly away, but it didn’t. So the family called a nonprofit nature center for help. The Chattahoochee Nature Center caught the bird and helped the family release it. McBride Newman said she believed the bird had been in the tree since they bought it but was hidden.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An illegal fishing net discovered in Oahu’s Kaneohe Bay was so large that a forklift was needed to move it, state officials said. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources said the net was found by two boaters last week, Hawaii Public Radio reported Thursday. The boaters discovered the net after their craft became entangled. They said that after they pulled the net out of the bay, the apparent owners chased them to retrieve the equipment. The boaters returned to the harbor and their pursuers fled, they said. State officials were not able to immediately measure the net, but the boaters said their measurement found 500 yards of netting. Rules adopted in 2007 to govern the use of gill nets left floating on top of the water to trap fish can be no longer than 125 feet. Lay nets are banned within 3 miles of the Oahu shoreline and in specific areas of the island including Kaneohe Bay, where the net was found, officials said. Maui has banned lay nets, which a land and natural resources department official said is the most regulated form of gill net fishing. A $5,000 fine can be levied for a first offense of catching threatened or endangered wildlife in the nets, with additional fines for each threatened or endangered wildlife taken, harmed or killed. A first-offense fine for illegal lay net fishing can cost up to $1,000.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Idaho Public Utilities Commission has rejected a proposal that would have slashed the incentive for the power generated from solar panels. The proposal to change net metering would have changed how much Idaho Power customers with solar panels can be reimbursed for the energy they harness that goes back into the power grid. The proposed settlement between Idaho Power, the Sierra Club, the city of Boise, Idaho Clean Energy Association, Idaho Irrigation Pumpers Association and others would have cut the rate from almost 10 cents per kilowatt produced to somewhere around 4.4 cents per kilowatt hour over the course of about 10 years. The PUC on Friday rejected that settlement, saying the public wasn’t adequately notified about the significant changes. The commission instead directed Idaho Power to conduct a cost-benefit analysis on the solar panel program while also voting to permanently grandfather in the 4,000 existing Idaho Power customers so that their rates will not change.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Metra is buying hundreds of new rail cars and wants passengers to weigh in on what amenities they would like to see in them, from cup holders to power outlets, tray tables or wifi. The suburban Chicago commuter rail agency expects to spend almost $1.2billion over the next five years to buy and rehabilitate rail cars and locomotives. The funding comes from a capital bill Illinois lawmakers approved this year. Metra issued a request for proposals earlier this year for at least 200 new rail cars, with options for up to 300 more. Manufacturers were encouraged to submit proposals that increase capacity and optimize amenities. Now the agency is asking commuters to complete a survey about which amenities are most important to them. Options include tray tables and power, as well as head rests, interior and exterior information signs or lights that can be dimmed. Metra said it can’t guarantee everything commuters want will be incorporated into the new cars but said it will try to get the most amenities possible. The survey is available at metrarail.com through mid-January.\n\nIndiana\n\nTerre Haute: Unusually large flocks of seagulls have descended on a western Indiana city, bringing the sounds of the beach to a local reservoir where the birds began gathering in late November. Residents near Hulman Lake on Terre Haute’s east side have seen hundreds of ring-billed seagulls in the skies over the reservoir since the birds began flocking around Thanksgiving. Peter Scott, a retired Indiana State University ecology professor who directs an annual Christmas Bird Count around Terre Haute, estimated that between 400 and 1,000 of the birds have congregated at the lake.He said ring-billed gulls aren’t uncommon in Indiana, but they prefer to winter around larger bodies of water like southern Indiana’s Lake Monroe. Scott said their appearance in large numbers at Hulman Lake is rare. Scott said the birds are most likely feeding on small fish in the lake. The Cornell University Lab of Ornithology described ring-billed seagulls as sociable creatures that feed together at coastal beaches but often head inland during winter to forage at golf courses, farm fields and garbage dumps.\n\nIowa\n\nDuncombe: After more than a century, a barn near this northern Iowa community is getting a new home and a new look. Matt and Libby Mitchell acquired the barn built in 1915 and watched nervously Thursday as it was moved about a mile over fields to a new location. Matt Mitchell prepared a path over fields by driving a blade over the land, smoothing out ruts. He now plans to restore the barn. Mitchell has restored two other barns and knows he’s in for a long process. Still, he said the structure is worth the restoration work. The Iowa Barn Foundation covered about half the moving expenses. The job was handled by Vote House Moving of Bradgate, in Humboldt County. Once the barn is restored to its original appearance, Libby Mitchell said she has plans for it. “We’ll put some cows and pigs in it,” she said.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The Lawrence library is joining a growing number of libraries that are dropping fines for overdue books. The library’s board voted unanimously Tuesday to make the change, The Lawrence Journal-World reported. Library patrons still will be charged for lost or damaged items. Patrons also would be blocked from checking out additional books and materials once an item became two weeks overdue, but the return of the overdue item would immediately restore access. Among those expressing concerns was Michael Austin, who said the change could result in people keeping books for long periods of time, ultimately reducing access to those materials for everyone else. But Brad Allen, the library’s executive director, said eliminating overdue fines is in line with the stance of the American Library Association that library policies should not disadvantage low-income people. The ALA officially came out against charging fines earlier this year, citing concerns that fines create barriers to library materials and services.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Deeply affected by a Courier Journal series in August on child abuse and neglect, members of Christ Church United Methodist are collecting and displaying prayers on behalf of abused children in Kentucky, which has the highest rate of child maltreatment in the nation. Church member Bill Cooper, a retired lawyer who is active in social justice work at Christ Church, is working with others at the church, including Shelah Woodruff, director of outreach, and the Rev. Leanne Hadley, the children’s and youth minister. They came up with an idea: collect 1,000 prayers during the four-week Advent season before Christmas and display them. Christ Church also created a display that is open to the public with information about child abuse, how to report it, Kentucky’s sobering statistics and suggestions on how people can volunteer or get involved in efforts to fight the problem. People who view the display are invited to fill out a prayer card.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana’s recreational red snapper season likely will continue through 11:59 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. Surveys indicate that 98% of the state’s quota had been caught as of Dec. 8, with about 16,100 pounds remaining, according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. If that’s all that is caught before Dec. 31, the season will end earlier. Louisiana’s recreational season opened May 24 and was weekends-only for most of the year. But in early November, Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Jack Montoucet expanded it to all week, starting on Thanksgiving. At the time, 27,582 pounds were left in the quota. The popular sport and table fish is still recovering from nearly disastrous overfishing. Red snapper has been a hot issue in the Gulf of Mexico, with seasons getting shorter and shorter as fish got larger and more numerous. In 2017, the Trump administration extended a three-day season to 42 days, even though regulators said the extension could add up to six years to the time required for red snapper stocks to recover. Regulators agreed in 2018 on a two-year pilot program under which each state sets dates for and keeps tabs on the recreational red snapper catch in federal waters off its coast. If approved by the U.S. commerce secretary, this would become official policy. In April, the group that manages Gulf of Mexico fishing in federal waters said states can continue managing anglers’ catch of red snapper after this year.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: A mapping and engineering company is donating about a million aerial images of New England to a University of Maine library. The university said Raymond H. Fogler Library has received 3,000 rolls of film from the James W. Sewall Co. of Old Town. The collection is made up of original aerial photography of Maine and other New England states, and it spans more than six decades. The archive of images will allow researchers and members of the public access to “a vast collection that details changes to Maine’s landscape over the past century,” the university said in a statement. The collection will be especially useful for forestry research, said Daniel Hayes, assistant professor in the university’s School of Forestry Resources.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Salvation Army leaders said a donor recently dropped thousands of dollars worth of jewelry in a red kettle. Capt. Ryan Vincent is commander of the Salvation Army in Annapolis. He told the Capital Gazette that everyone was shocked to find out the ring and two bracelets were real. One of the bracelets, a yellow-gold piece by Tiffany & Co., has been sold for $1,500. A gemologist will soon examine the ring and second bracelet that features diamonds and rubies to determine their value. Pearl Eldridge is the ringer who collected the donation. She called the donor a “quiet spirit,” and said the woman told her the pieces were sentimental but had been laying around. Other unusual donations have been reported in Salvation Army kettles across the country, including a gold bar in Kentucky and a more than century-old gold coin in North Carolina. Vincent said the Salvation Army has a policy for dealing with jewelry donations. Pieces found in a kettle are kept for 30 days, but if someone acknowledges leaving a piece with the bell ringer, it’s immediately considered donated. If big donations are found to be stolen, the charitable organization arranges them to be returned.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is using money it received from a nationwide settlement with Volkswagen to help electrify the state’s transportation sector and reduce air pollution. The state has designated a total of $7.5million toward 98 projects, including the purchase of electric cars, diesel-hybrid electric waste collection trucks, liquid-propane-gas school buses, cleaner-diesel trucks and ferry engines, and a marine shore-power installation. The money for the grant program comes from a settlement with Volkswagen over the company’s illegal tampering of vehicle emission control equipment. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said the money will be used on projects to put 32 heavy-duty vehicles, eight medium-duty vehicles, 17 buses, two marine engines, 35 pieces of airport ground-support equipment and three pieces of cargo-handling equipment into operation and install one new marine shore-power site. The new equipment will replace pre-2010 diesel counterparts. Baker said three-quarters of the funding will go towards areas where there are high populations of minority, low-income, or low English proficiency residents\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing:A nonprofit distributed nearly 50 bicycles to children after a dozen volunteers spent several weeks cleaning and repairing them. The Lansing Bike Co-op staged the giveaway last weekend, offering the 49 used bikes to anyone on a first-come, first-served basis, the Lansing State Journal reported. There were no rules or requirements, but the co-op teaches cyclists, many financially struggling, how to keep their rides in good working order. Every bike came with a red, green or blue helmet. Among those claiming bikes was Ciera Bonilla, who secured two for her daughter, 6, and son, 3. She said her son has autism and she hopes his first two-wheeler will help him gain independence and physical skills. Co-op President Aaron Fields said he believes a bike is “an essential part of childhood.” The organization launched in 2015 and is raising money to pay the mortgage for the east-side property it bought in July.\n\nMinnesota\n\nProsper: Authorities said four people were injured, including one critically, in separate vehicle crashes involving horses on the same southeastern Minnesota highway. The crashes happened within an hour of each other Friday night on state highway 44, the Star Tribune reported. The State Patrol said a 12-year-old boy was critically injured when a car struck a horse and buggy carrying the boy and five others. It happened about 7 p.m. just outside Prosper, on the Iowa border. The boy was airlifted to a hospital in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Two others on the buggy suffered nonlife-threatening injuries. The driver of the car and his passenger were not injured. About 45 minutes later, a pickup truck hit a horse that was loose on the highway about 13 miles east of the first crash. The driver was taken to a hospital with noncritical injuries.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: Teachers and staff at two northern Mississippi schools are receiving more than $370,000 in bonuses because their schools have improved under a state grading system. Columbus Municipal School District trustees voted in 2018 to adopt a Teacher Incentive Pay Plan to provide bonuses for faculty and staff members of improving and high-performing schools. The plan also includes bonus incentives for math and science teachers. The first checks arrived this month, and the Commercial Dispatch reported that a celebration was held Tuesday at an elementary school. Superintendent Cherie Labat credited the trustees for showing employees how much their achievements are valued. Stokes-Beard Elementary School and Columbus High School improved this year in accountability ratings from the state Department of Education. Faculty and staff members at the schools received a combined $181,354. The district’s 54 math and science teachers, 15 of whom are new hires, received $189,000 total. The Columbus district has maintained a D overall rating for the last two years. However, during the 2018-19 school year, Columbus High improved from a C to a B, and Stokes-Beard jumped from an F to a B.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Mayor Lyda Krewson is pulling the plug on an airport privatization effort because of a lack of support. Krewson said Friday she’s determined that there is “very little support for moving forward with a private operator” for St. Louis Lambert International Airport after listening to members of the public, business leaders and other political leaders. She said she is sending a letter to members of the Airport Advisory Working Group, asking that her representative, Linda Martinez, not support or vote to move forward with issuing a request for proposals, St. Louis Public Radio reported. Krewson has been in favor of exploring the process to see if it could result in a good deal for the city – canceling nearly $600million in airport debt and bringing in up to $2billion in net proceeds.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A natural gas leak caused an explosion at an apartment complex that sent two people to the hospital with severe burns, officials said Saturday. Billings Deputy Fire Marshal Jeff McCullough said the explosion at about 9:45p.m. Friday caused an estimated $250,000 in damages. The Battleship Apartments building was cleared of residents, and an adult male and adult female were taken to a hospital. Residents of the building told The Billings Gazette that the blast sent glass from a door shooting into the road and that it sounded like a tree hitting the roof. Montana-Dakota Utilities was called to turn off gas to the building.\n\nNebraska\n\nColumbus: Consumers who get electricity from the Loup Public Power District in eastern Nebraska won’t see an increase in their electricity rates this year. The Columbus-based power district said the rates will hold steady for the third year in a row because of the district’s financial performance this year and its budget and expenses, according to the Columbus Telegram. District CEO Neal Suess said the company’s internal costs generally determine whether customer rates get raised. Jim Donoghue, chairman of Loup’s Rates Committee, said in a statement that company representatives have been working to make sure that customer’s rates do not increase next year.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Washoe County Roads has begun posting a snowplow monitoring system featuring an interactive map showing where trucks are operating in Incline Village and Crystal Bay in nearly real-time. County Community Services Operations chief Eric Crump said one of the most frequent questions officials get from the public is, “Where are the plows?” He said that by equipping trucks with automated vehicle locator technology, people can see for themselves which areas have recently been plowed. Officials said they hope they will be able to expand the “Where’s My Plow?” interactive map to other snowy high-elevation areas near Reno.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPlaistow: Firefighters said they got to work when a woman arrived in the lobby and announced she was having a baby. Firefighters told WMUR-TV that the woman was put on a stretcher, and the fire station training room became a delivery room Friday night. Seven minutes later, a baby boy was born. Firefighter and EMT Derek Travers said the episode was his first “field birth” in 23 years. “It meant a lot to me to see the beginning of life, not the end of life that we see a lot of times,” he said. Firefighters said they’re happy everything went smoothly. An ambulance transported mother and baby to a hospital.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Two Florida companies failed to comply with subpoenas to turn over records to New Jersey regarding the sale of outlawed large-capacity gun magazines, Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Friday in a suit against the firms. Elite Aluminum, of Holly Hill, Florida, and 22Mods4All, of Longwood, Florida, refused to turn over documents showing information about large-capacity magazine sales into the state, Grewal said in a statement. Messages seeking comment have been left with both companies. New Jersey sent both firms cease-and-desist letters earlier this year after they sold the outlawed magazines to an undercover state investigator, said Grewal, a Democrat. The firms complied, but then failed to hand over more information about earlier sales despite subpoenas. New Jersey law caps magazines at 10 rounds, down from 15 before 2018, when Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation limiting magazine size. The suits were filed in state Superior Court in Essex County.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said people shouldn’t expect any major administrative changes with White Sands National Monument becoming the state’s first national park since 1930. But he cited a study that said the park could see an increase of 100,000 visitors annually with the change in status. Heinrich told the Albuquerque Journal that such an increase would be a boom for the local economies with an additional $7.5million in tourist spending in the area a year. He said national park status will open White Sands to more exposure from national travel and outdoors publications. Heinrich has also introduced legislation that would designate Bandelier National Monument in northern New Mexico a national park.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday he will push legislation banning gender-based price disparities for similar goods and services. Cuomo, a Democrat, cited research that indicated women often end up with a larger bill for items like toys, clothing and personal care products. The proposal, rolled out as part of Cuomo’s State of the State agenda, would require certain service providers to post price lists for standard services. Businesses that don’t comply could be hit with civil penalties. A 2015 study by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs found that 42% of the products targeted at women were more expensive than those marketed to men. Products aimed at women cost an average of 7% more than similar items for men and personal care products for women were priced 13% higher than men’s products, according to the study. In 2016, New York banned taxes on menstrual products and last year enacted laws mandating equal pay and barring companies from asking about salary history.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nManteo: Cold weather is causing a problem for some sea turtles off the North Carolina coast, and an aquarium has taken in dozens of them for treatment. WVEC-TV reported that 96 turtles were taken to the North Carolina Aquarium on Roanoke Island after a drop in temperatures on Thursday and Friday. More are expected to be treated there in the coming days. Dropping water temperatures can cause cold-stunning, a condition similar to hypothermia that makes turtles unable to swim properly. The recovery process involves gradually warming the turtles up over a few days. According to the TV station, the center will be closed to the public beginning Sunday to accommodate all the turtles.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Bismarck Park Board has voted to create a formal process for renaming city parks after some residents pushed to have a park stripped of its name because of the “historical trauma” they said is associated with its namesake, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. Rather than immediately change the name of Custer Park, the board voted Thursday to develop guidelines for renaming parks. A draft of those guidelines will be considered by the board in February. A member of the Three Affiliated Tribes, M. Angel Moniz, told the board that to some, Custer is a reminder of violence and genocide, according to the Bismarck Tribune. Custer served during the Civil War and fought against Native Americans on the Great Plains in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1868, he launched an attack on Chief Black Kettle’s Southern Cheyenne Village near present-day Cheyenne, Oklahoma, in which Native American women were raped and killed in an assault known as the Washita Massacre. Custer spent several years stationed at Fort Abraham Lincoln in Mandan before his death.\n\nOhio\n\nAthens: The Ohio school district where Heisman Trophy winner Joe Burrow played football has named its high school stadium in his honor. The Athens City School District Board of Education in southeast Ohio posted a proclamation about the naming this week on Facebook. The proclamation details Burrow’s accomplishments as quarterback for Athens High School, where he was named Ohio Mr. Football in 2014, and at Louisiana State University, where he’s the quarterback for the undefeated Tigers. LSU faces the University of Oklahoma on Dec. 28 in the semifinals of the College Football Playoff. Burrow endeared himself to many by discussing the poverty endemic to the Appalachian region where he grew up in his Heisman acceptance speech. His comments prompted a campaign that has raised more than $400,000 for the Athens County Food Bank, the Athens High School Boosters, the county’s Children’s Services agency and other nonprofits. The proclamation directs Athens school district officials to plan a ceremony in Burrow’s honor.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Officials said a privately owned cemetery is blocking efforts to find the remains of black Tulsa residents killed nearly 100 years ago in a race riot. But an attorney for the cemetery said his client submitted a proposal in November that would allow the city to search under certain conditions. Mayor G.T. Bynum has insisted that the city would do everything it could to find possible mass graves with victims of one of the worst race-related massacres in U.S. history. The 1921 violence left as many as 300 dead on Tulsa’s Black Wall Street. Bynum said the city has been unable to investigate whether Rolling Oaks Cemetery in south Tulsa contains unmarked graves, the Tulsa World reported. However, Timothy Studebaker, a Tulsa attorney representing Rolling Oaks, said the cemetery is not opposed to scanning its grounds. Bynum said the city will look at possible legal action if an agreement can’t be reached.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Oregon is renowned for its craft beer and increasingly for its high-grade marijuana, but the state is keeping the two apart – for now. In a new ruling, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, which regulates alcoholic products and recreational marijuana, said beer and other alcoholic drinks as of Jan. 1 cannot contain either THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, or CBD, the nonpsychoactive part that is said to relieve stress and pain. Mark Pettinger, a spokesman for the agency, cited concerns raised by the U.S. Food and Drug of potential liver damage from CBD, also known as cannabidiol. One prominent CBD-infused beer, Two Flowers IPA, was popular in The EastBurn, a Portland pub, according to Michael Fritz, one of the owners. The website of the brewery that made the beer, Coalition Brewing of Portland, said the CBD’s “bitter grassiness augments the hop bitterness, while the citrusy terpenes in the CBD mirror the aromatics and hop flavors.” Coalition Brewing recently went out of business. Pettinger said he didn’t know of any other Oregon brewery that makes CBD-infused beer.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Businesses that manufacture frames that can be built into working firearms sued Pennsylvania’s attorney general on Friday, five days after he issued a legal opinion classifying the products as guns under state law. The Commonwealth Court lawsuit asks a state judge to stop the state police from implementing any new policy, including background checks, based on a legal opinion the agency received Monday from Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Shapiro told state police to treat unassembled “ghost guns,” gun frames also referred to as 80% receivers, as firearms. The plaintiffs said the opinion does not give fair notice to people regarding what is legal and what is not, said Joshua Prince, who filed the petition.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State lawmakers are unveiling bills they plan to pursue in the new legislative session that begins Jan. 7. Democratic Reps. June Speakman of Warren and Terri Cortvriend of Portsmouth said they will introduce legislation establishing a state-level process to set maximum contaminate levels for toxins, including a family of industrial chemicals turning up in public water supplies across the country. Democratic Sen. Leonidas Raptakis of Coventry said he will reintroduce legislation that stalled in past years to establish an inspector general’s office to identify fraud and waste in public spending. Raptakis will also again propose allowing voters to vote on a constitutional amendment to give the governor the power to veto parts of the state budget. Most states allow governors to strike individual budget items without having to veto an entire appropriations bill. Democratic Rep. Joseph Solomon of Warwick said Thursday he has prefiled legislation to cap the amount health insurance providers can charge for insulin co-pays. Solomon said he’s concerned about rising costs.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A unique, dome-shaped house on the South Carolina coast dubbed “Eye of the Storm,” has recently been sold for $4million. The Post and Courier reported that according to Charleston County land records, a firm called ITAC 433 LLC that lists a Chapel Hill address, bought the 3,384-square-foot house in early October. The distinctive house features a white shell that resembles a Storm Trooper helmet from the movie “Star Wars.” It was built in the early 1990s by Huiet and Helen Paul after their beachfront home was destroyed in 1989 by Hurricane Hugo. The house is made of concrete and steel and weighs 1.3million pounds. It includes an elevator, wet bar, skylight, an 889-square-foot deck and a bank vault room. The seller was a trust associated with the late couple. The property was marketed as hurricane-resistant because its design doesn’t have seams for strong winds to hook onto, the newspaper reported. The design is also intended to allow storm surge to pass through several openings on the lower level. The house’s unique architecture in comparison to the more antebellum homes often seen on the island attracts curious onlookers. But even at a $4million price tag, the dome house isn’t the most expensive to be sold on the island. Last summer a 5,000-square-foot, three-story house fetched $7.35million.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Tribes in South Dakota are trying again to gain state legislative support to repeal an archaic law that bans them from Minnesota. The State-Tribal Relations Committee voted this week to introduce a resolution during the 2020 legislative session requesting that Congress repeal the 1863 Dakota Removal Act. The law forced Native Americans onto South Dakota reservations following an 1862 conflict that included the mass hanging of 38 Dakota men. Minnesota passed a resolution supporting its repeal in 2009. The South Dakota Senate State Affairs Committee, without any discussion, failed to pass the same resolution during the 2019 session. Republican Rep. Tamara St. John, a historian for the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, said she’s concerned that repealing it could impact legal precedents based on the act, specifically a lawsuit involving Mdewakanton Sioux members in Minnesota that has not been resolved.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee has landed a $5.3million federal grant that aims to address opioid misuse among expectant mothers and improve care for their affected children, the Division of TennCare announced Thursday. TennCare plans to partner with Vanderbilt University Medical Center to focus on the issue in 26 rural and urban counties. Tennessee is one of 10 states to receive the Maternal Opioid Misuse Model grant from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Tennessee’s initiative will focus on expectant mothers and their children beginning in pregnancy and extending to one year postpartum. The money covers a five-year performance period beginning in January. The program aims to get the women engaged in treatment before and after pregnancy, use therapies to maximize the time they aren’t using illicit substances, reduce infant hospital stays to keep them with their biological mothers as much as possible and connect to early intervention services for the children.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Police said one woman was killed and another was injured after they were attacked by three pit bulls. Authorities said a man called 911 just before 6 a.m. Saturday to report that his wife had been attacked by dogs in a north Houston neighborhood. At the scene, police found the woman had been bitten multiple times. She was taken to a hospital and was expected to survive her injuries. Soon after arriving at the scene, police received another call, this one from the dogs’ owner. The owner reported his dogs had attacked a woman and her body was in a ditch in front of his home. The three dogs were taken away by authorities. Police said the case will be referred to the Harris County District Attorney’s Office to determine if any charges could be filed against the dogs’ owner.\n\nUtah\n\nHyrum: A northern Utah bank is dismantling and rebuilding a historic small-town grain elevator for its new “Scandinavian-modern” building in Hyrum. The tall wood structure, now weathered with age, was first built in 1918 by the Holley-Globe and Milling Company, the Herald Journal reported. It has been a fixture in the small town for a century, but soon it will get a new life: front and center into Cache Valley Bank’s new location. Workers began lifting sections of the structure with a crane this week. The bank wanted a building that was creative and embodied the town. Board member Peter Daines said his grandfather, a high school shop teacher and Hyrum native, informed their decision to incorporate the rustic appeal of the historic wood on the agricultural storage structure. Bank CEO George Daines remembered seeing the big tower when while visiting his grandparents as a child, though it wasn’t in operation even then. Visitors to the new bank building, though, will be able to reach the top through a spiral staircase. It will also have a new all-glass observation deck.\n\nVermont\n\nMonkton: A general in Monkton is going to close its doors by the end of the month. The Alderman family, which has managed the store for more than 12 years, said the costs of operating the business are “just too much,” MyNBC5 reported. The closing comes less than a year after the Aldermans announced they were struggling to pay back approximately $20,000 in delinquent state taxes. An online fundraising campaign brought in nearly $9,000 over the course of eight months. In a social media post, the Aldermans said they appreciated the community’s support and expressed their sadness in having to close.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State health officials are mounting an effort to identify people who might have recently been exposed to a person with measles. The Virginia Department of Health said in a news release Saturday that the person visited Richmond International Airport on Tuesday night and a doctor’s office in suburban Richmond on Thursday afternoon. The department posted detailed instructions online about what to do if you were at either of the locations during certain time frames. The directions depend on whether you have been vaccinated against measles. Based on the date of exposure, the health department said people infected could develop symptoms as late as Jan. 11. Measles is a highly contagious illness spread through coughing, sneezing and contact with droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of an infected person. Symptoms include a fever, runny nose, watery red eyes and a cough, followed by a rash that begins on the face and spreads all over the body.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Officials are warning about the Asian giant hornet, a new invasive species found in the state that can pack a powerful sting and be a threat to honeybees. The Washington State Department of Agriculture said the bug was found in early December in Blaine, near the Canadian border. The state’s agriculture and health officials are now warning people in the area to be on the lookout and avoid the hornets, which are typically 1.5 inches long with large yellow heads. The species is not usually interested in humans or animals but might sting if they or their ground nests are disturbed or threatened. The health department said humans should take preventative measures by covering food and garbage and also avoid swatting at the hornets. Winter is the dormant season for the bugs, which are more often seen from July through October.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nElkins: The U.S. Forest Service has halted a logging project in Monongahela National Forest to protect an endangered fish. The Center for Biological Diversity and Friends of Blackwater submitted objections in July to the project to protect the endangered candy darter. The Center for Biological Diversity said in a news release the project would likely have caused significant erosion and sent sediment into rivers and streams, threatening the rare fish. The candy darter was listed as endangered in November 2018.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:A judge has reinstated a felony count against a Milwaukee man who was living in an underground bunker that contained a stash of weapons, generator and various power tools. Geoffrey Graff, 41, was originally charged with two felonies after police discovered the bunker while investigating a report that he fired a shot into the nearby Milwaukee River. A court commissioner earlier this month dismissed one of the charges, for recklessly endangering safety. Milwaukee Circuit Judge David Borowski reinstated the charge on Thursday, the Journal Sentinel reported. Graff is facing a separate felony charge of possessing a short-barreled shotgun. Graff told authorities he had been using the bunker for at least seven years.\n\nWyoming\n\nSaratoga: The U.S. Forest Service has bought the last piece of private land within a wilderness area in central Wyoming. The 80-acre purchase in Carbon County will allow members of the public to roam the Huston Park Wilderness without the worry of crossing into private land, Forest Service officials said Friday. The land is located just north of Colorado-Wyoming state line and is part of the Medicine Bow National Forest in the Sierra Madre mountain range. Congress designated the 31,000-acre Huston Park Wilderness in 1984 and officials have since been seeking to buy up private lands inside its boundaries. The purchase price for the 80-acre parcel was not released. Officials said they worked with the Daley family and the Daley Basin Land Company to complete the deal.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/17/tidal-basin-flooding-rally-raccoon-garden-razed-news-around-states/50241761/", "title": "Tidal Basin flooding, 'rally raccoon': News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A man convicted of murder more than a decade ago was captured Monday a day after escaping from a minimum-security corrections center near Mobile, prison officials said. Jeffery Strugg, 31, was discovered missing from community-based facility in Prichard on Sunday, according to a notice from the Alabama Department of Corrections. The agency didn’t release any information about how Strugg got out. He surrendered without any violence in Mobile County, corrections officials said. Strugg was 18 when he was sentenced to 29 years in prison after being convicted in the 2007 killing of Dewone Smiley, 15, in Selma, court records show. Strugg was accused of entering an apartment and shooting Smiley, a student at Selma High School, to death in front of two witnesses. Strugg is eligible for parole consideration Dec. 1, prison records show.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state House on Saturday voted against accepting a spending package passed by the Senate that included payments of about $5,500 to residents. The vote to concur with the Senate package failed, with 18 members in favor of accepting the Senate plan and 22 against. The vote sets the stage for a conference committee, with the regular legislative session set to end by Wednesday. In a conference committee, House and Senate negotiators are tasked with hashing out differences between the state budgets that passed each chamber. The House, in its version of the budget, included a dividend of about $1,250 plus a $1,300 “energy relief” check. The Senate plan called for a dividend of about $4,200 from Alaska’s oil wealth fund, an amount in line with a long-standing formula last used in 2015. The Senate plan also included a $1,300 energy check. Some lawmakers have argued the state is benefitting from high oil prices and can afford to help Alaskans who are struggling. But critics of the higher payments to residents say oil prices are volatile, and the oil price in the state revenue forecast can’t be assured.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A federal appeals court has upheld a judge’s ruling overturning a federal agency’s approval of Toronto-based Hudbay Minerals Inc.’s plan for a new open-pit copper mine in southeastern Arizona. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that the U.S. Forest Service’s approval of a permit for the Rosemont Mine project in a valley on the eastern flank of the Santa Rita Mountains near Tucson went beyond what is allowed under a federal mining law. The appellate court cited the planned use of Coronado National Forest land for long-term storage of waste rock, not actual mining, and the lack of valuable minerals on that property. Hudbay Minerals officials said in a statement Thursday that they were reviewing the ruling and would continue to pursue alternative plans for mining part of the Rosemont copper deposit on nearby private lands. A coalition of environmental and tribal groups challenging the mining hailed the appellate court’s decision, the latest in a series of legal obstacles to the project. “This momentous decision makes it clear that Hudbay’s plan to destroy the beautiful Rosemont Valley is not only a terrible idea, it’s illegal,” said Allison Melton, an attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity. Hudbay has another mine project in the works on the western flank of the Santa Ritas.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A raccoon ran loose in the stands during Arkansas baseball’s Friday matchup with Vanderbilt, but a fan came to the rescue. Fayetteville native Grant Harmon grabbed the raccoon with his bare hands and held it up to cheers from the crowd at Baum-Walker Stadium as members of the Commodores’ bullpen looked on from left field. The incident was dubbed by fans on social media as the “rally raccoon,” as the Hogs came back to tie the game after being down 5-0 and then 6-5. Despite that, the rallies ultimately fell short as Vanderbilt won 9-6 in 10 innings. After grabbing the raccoon, Harmon continued to carry it out of the stadium. “The opportunity just came about, and I guess I just took action and grabbed it,” he said. “That was a first. I have no prior experience grabbing raccoons.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nModesto: The state will acquire a sprawling former farm property in the San Joaquin Valley and create a new state park for the first time in 13 years. Dos Rios Ranch, where the San Joaquin and Tuolumne rivers meet southwest of Modesto, will become California’s 280th state park and the first new one since Fort Ord Dunes near Monterey in 2009, the Modesto Bee reports. Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday earmarked $5 million for the new park as part of his revised budget proposal for the fiscal year starting July 1. The nearly 4-square-mile expanse featuring willows and valley oaks will be donated by River Partners, a conservation group that’s spent the past decade restoring the site. State Parks Director Armando Quintero said Friday that the property will serve “a park-poor region” – the San Joaquin Valley – and help address inequities in access to state recreation sites. “Everyone deserves to have close access to vibrant parks, and this opportunity is an exciting one,” Quintero said. Dos Rios could get trails, picnic areas, restrooms and other basics within five years, state parks officials said. Campgrounds could follow within another five years, the Bee reports.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: The city is enacting a fire ban after a series of blazes have spread quickly in hot and dry conditions, including a fatal one caused by smoking. Under the ban taking effect Monday, smoking and grilling will be banned in parks in Colorado’s second-largest city. People grilling at home will only be able to use gas or liquid fuel, not charcoal or wood, and chain saws must have spark arresters. Welding or torching work may still be allowed but only with a permit, the Colorado Springs Fire Department said. A woman died in a fire Thursday at a mobile home park that was blamed on “the improper disposal of smoking materials,” city spokesperson Natashia Kerr said. Eight homes were destroyed. Under the ban, smoking materials must be disposed of in a non-combustible container with a lid. Meanwhile, a wildfire in the foothills southwest of the city that also started Thursday has burned 2.4 square miles. The fire near the former mining town of Cripple Creek was 27% contained Monday.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBridgeport: A former assistant police chief’s lawsuit claiming he was defrauded out of the police chief’s job can go forward, a state appeals court has ruled. James Nardozzi’s lawsuit stemmed from the hiring scandal that landed the city’s police chief and personnel director in prison last year. Nardozzi claimed former Chief Armando Perez and former personnel director David Dunn conspired with Bridgeport Mayor Joe Ganim to fix the selection process so Perez would be selected as chief, the Connecticut Post reports. Prosecutors said Perez, 65, received confidential information about the police chief’s examination that was stolen by Dunn, including the questions for an oral examination and the scoring guide for written essays. Perez, who was the acting chief at the time, also admitted that he had two officers complete his essays, passed the work off as his own and lied to federal authorities in an effort to cover up his actions. Last April, Perez was sentenced to a year in prison, and Dunn received a four-month term. Both have since been released, according to the Courant. The appeals court ruled Friday that Nardozzi’s suit can proceed even though the city had paid him to settle a previous lawsuit after he was fired by Ganim in 2016. The case could go to trial later this year.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: State lawmakers have introduced bipartisan legislation that would put state law enforcement officials in charge of background checks for gun purchases. A bill filed Friday would resurrect Delaware’s Firearm Transaction Approval Program, which was eliminated more than a decade ago when lawmakers voted to rely on the federal government’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System. That vote came amid concerns then that Delaware’s background check system was not providing the federal NICS with information about mentally ill individuals prohibited from buying or possessing firearms. The bill authorized state agencies to provide such information to NICS, created a federally mandated program allowing individuals previously deemed mentally ill to reestablish eligibility for gun ownership, and abolished the state’s existing background check system. Lawmakers now want to return responsibility for firearm transactions background checks in Delaware to the State Bureau of Identification. The SBI would be the point of contact between gun dealers and the federal databases checked by the FBI. The SBI would thus become responsible for determining whether a person is prohibited from receiving or possessing a firearm and would be able to search other databases other than NICS in making that determination.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: In 100 years, if nothing is done, the historic Tidal Basin may be underwater, WUSA-TV reports. In 500, the Jefferson Memorial will be accessible only by boat. A combination of rising waters and a sinking human-made Tidal Basin puts the entire area – cherry blossoms, memorials, walking paths – at risk. But it’s not inevitable. The Trust for the National Mall and the National Trust for Historic Preservation have teamed up to create the Tidal Basin Ideas Lab, an initiative to plan out what the reservoir could become in the next century. It was once just a part of the Potomac River, but after the great flood of 1881, city planners got to work dredging up the river and Washington Channel to build the Tidal Basin. Teresa Durkin, executive vice president for the Trust for the National Mall, said the gates that engineers installed to control the water flow are no longer doing their job. “The gates have actually silted shut. So the water keeps coming through, but with it, it’s bringing all this silt and debris. So over time, it literally cannot open and close anymore. It doesn’t function as it was designed to,” Durkin said. “A lot of that sediment, because it’s not flushing out of the out gates, is also settling in the Tidal Basin itself. So it has likely raised the water.”\n\nFlorida\n\nVero Beach: A food truck exploded during a seafood festival Saturday, sending one person to the hospital with severe burns, according to authorities. The Vero Beach police said state and local fire officials are investigating the cause of the explosion. The department posted photos of the scene on Facebook that showed the sides and roof of the truck blown off the vehicle. One person was flown to a hospital burn unit in Orlando. There were no other injuries, and the festival continued as authorities secured the scene of the explosion, police said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A group of voters who challenged U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s eligibility to run for reelection said Monday that they have filed an appeal of the Georgia secretary of state’s decision that she can appear on the ballot. The five voters from Greene’s district in March filed a complaint with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger alleging that the Republican congresswoman played a significant role in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory. They argued that puts her in violation of a seldom-invoked part of the 14th Amendment having to do with insurrection and makes her ineligible to run for reelection. Georgia Administrative Law Judge Charles Beaudrot last month held a daylong hearing that included arguments from lawyers for the voters and for Greene, as well as extensive questioning of Greene herself. He then sent his decision to Raffensperger on May 6. Beaudrot found that the voters hadn’t produced sufficient evidence to back their claims. Raffensperger affirmed that decision, writing that whether Greene’s political statements and actions disqualify her from office “is rightfully a question for the voters of Georgia’s 14th Congressional District.” Under state law, the voters are allowed to appeal that decision in Fulton County Superior Court.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaiian Airlines is exploring electric aircraft technology with an eye toward using the vehicles for interisland travel, Hawaii News Now reports. A Boston-based company called REGENT is designing “seagliders” that would each carry up to 100 people. Hawaiian hasn’t committed to purchasing any of the aircraft but is exploring the possibility. A news release from REGENT said Hawaiian agreed to strategically invest to support the initial design of the company’s next-generation seaglider. Hawaiian is the first airline to partner with the company, which hopes to have its Monarch seagliders in the air by 2028. “We look forward to working with REGENT to explore the technology and infrastructure needed to fulfill our vision for convenient, comfortable and environmentally sustainable interisland transportation,” said Avi Mannis, chief marketing and communications officer at Hawaiian Airlines. REGENT’s seagliders fly through the air close to the water’s surface. The company said the aircraft will service routes up to 180 miles with existing battery technology and routes up to 500 miles with next-generation batteries. The company said the seagliders will move at the speed of an airplane but have the operating cost of boats and will use existing dock infrastructure.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials have agreed to a $119 million settlement with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson and three major distributors over their role in the opioid addiction crisis. Republican Gov. Brad Little and Attorney General Lawrence Wasden said in an announcement Friday that it’s the second-largest consumer settlement in state history, trailing only the 1998 national tobacco settlement. An Ada County judge on Wednesday approved the settlement that includes all 44 Idaho counties, 24 cities and the state’s seven health districts. The money will address damage wrought by opioids, which the federal government declared a public health emergency in 2017. Johnson & Johnson and the three distributors agreed to a national $26 billion settlement in February. “Idaho has made significant strides in recent years in combatting the opioid crisis, and the culmination of our legal action against opioid manufacturers – led by Attorney General Wasden and his team – now offers additional resources,” Little said in a statement. Wasden is continuing legal action against other opioid makers as well as the Sackler family, owners of Purdue Pharma. “This settlement holds some of those most responsible for the opioid crisis accountable and provides significant funding for treatment, recovery and prevention in Idaho,” he said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Mayor Lori Lightfoot tightened a citywide curfew for young people Monday, a day after she restricted access by unaccompanied minors to downtown’s Millennium Park following the weekend shooting death of a 16-year-old boy near “The Bean” sculpture at the park. The citywide weekend curfew for minors now will begin each night at 10 p.m., instead of the 11 p.m. curfew in place since the 1990s, Lightfoot said. At Millennium Park, which is a popular stop for tourists and Chicago residents, minors will not be allowed in the park after 6 p.m. Thursdays through Sundays without an adult. “We need to make sure they are safe and importantly that our young people understand and respect basic community norms, respect for themselves, respect for each other, and we must ensure that every one of our residents and visitors – no matter who they are or where they come from or how old they are – are able to safely enjoy our public spaces,” the mayor said at a news conference. Lightfoot said she hoped and expected that people would abide by the restrictions and that it would not lead to widespread arrests. She said officials “don’t want to arrest children,” but those who break the law will be.\n\nIndiana\n\nNoblesville: A tiny community garden that provided 1,500 pounds of free food over five years to people in need was bulldozed by city crews after a nuisance call about overgrown grass. City officials said the lease with the nonprofit that managed the garden expired more than a year ago, and there was no sign that the land had been maintained since. The overgrown six parcels next to Southside Park posed a safety risk, officials said. Garden caretakers said they were in talks with the city about entering a new contract and weren’t given a warning the plot would be flattened and its furniture removed. Hidden underneath the pollinators and overgrowth were viable shrubs and plants, said Renee Rule, coordinator of the garden since its founding. The plot is messy when it’s not growing season but was a little more scraggly this year because bad weather had delayed volunteers who were to prepare it for planting, Rule said. “I wish they would have given us a call, and we could have saved some of the plants,” Rule said. The garden has provided free tomatoes, green beans, zucchini, onions and lettuces to neighborhood families and served as an instructional farm for college students and Girl Scouts alike. Families rented plots so they could grow vegetables to eat. Schoolchildren were given pumpkins in the fall. A beekeeper gave demonstrations at a beehive.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: School districts across the state are up against a federal deadline that will end a pandemic-era free meals program for students next month. While many school officials are waiting to see if federal or state lawmakers will extend the program, at least one district, Des Moines Public Schools, is working to continue offering most of its students free meals next school year. Students have faced repeated upheavals since March 2020, when schools across the country closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. In an effort to help districts feed students during the health crisis – whether they were at school or home – the U.S. Department of Agriculture temporarily relaxed rules that tied who received free lunch to family income and neighborhood poverty levels. As the June 30 deadline draws near, school district officials and school nutrition advocates are asking state and federal lawmakers to intervene by either extending the relaxed rules or offering free meals to all students permanently. If no legislation is passed, students who qualify for free or reduced-price meals will still receive those services. Educators and advocates stress that studies show students do better academically when they are not hungry. School meals reduce both hunger and anxiety about it.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A federal judge is blocking a public school’s policy preventing teachers from outing transgender students to their parents after a teacher raised religious objections. Fort Riley Middle School math teacher Pamela Ricard sued USD 475 Geary County Schools over LGBTQ anti-discrimination policies that conflicted with her Christian beliefs. District Judge Holly Teeter issued a preliminary injunction Monday blocking the school from disciplining Ricard if she reveals preferred names and pronouns of her transgender students when communicating with their parents. “The Court relies on Plaintiff’s statements that she does not intend to communicate with a parent for the sole purpose of disclosing a student’s preferred name and pronouns,” Teeter wrote. Ricard has two transgender students in her class, the judge wrote, neither of whom has authorized the district to disclose a preferred name and pronouns to parents. While Ricard uses their preferred names in class and avoids pronouns, she has emailed parents using a student’s legal name and biological pronouns. “Plaintiff believes that addressing students one way at school and a different way when speaking to their parents is dishonest,” the opinion said. “Being dishonest violates her sincere religious beliefs.” Teeter was appointed by then-President Donald Trump.\n\nKentucky\n\nRichmond: A judge entered a not guilty plea Monday for a man accused of fatally shooting the daughter of a former state lawmaker during a home invasion. Shannon Gilday, 23, appeared in Madison Circuit Court for a continued arraignment on charges of murder, attempted murder, assault, burglary and criminal mischief, news outlets report. His attorney tried to enter a plea of guilty but mentally ill on his behalf last week, but the prosecution argued against it, and the judge continued the hearing. Meanwhile, prosecutors filed a notice of aggravating circumstances seeking enhanced penalties upon a conviction, which stopped defense attorney Tom Griffiths from trying to enter a plea of guilty but mentally ill, news outlets report. Gilday allegedly broke into a multimillion-dollar Madison County home owned by former lawmaker C. Wesley Morgan and shot Jordan Morgan while she was asleep, according to court records and statements from Morgan. Gilday also exchanged shots with Morgan during the Feb. 22 break-in. State police investigators said Gilday told them he was determined to get access to a bunker in the home. He was arrested in Madison County about a week after the shooting.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Child drownings are on the rise in Louisiana, according to the state Department of Health, which says inability to swim, lack of supervision, and unfenced pools, spas and water bodies are top causes of drownings among babies and children under 15 years old. “As temperatures heat up and families return to water activities, it is important for parents and families to stay aware of the precautions they can take to prevent child drownings,” the department said in a news release. The agency said the number of drownings among children had fallen steadily for years, from 26 in 2015 and 2016 to 15 in 2019. But the total rose 60% in 2020, to 24. And preliminary data indicates that last year’s total was 25, it said. The department’s most recent Louisiana Child Death Review Report, covering 2017 through 2019, found that an average of 17 children drowned each year. That made drowning the No. 3 cause of injury-related death in children up through age 14, behind vehicle crashes and homicide. It found that 96% of them could not swim, 72% were unsupervised, and 54% died in water that hadn’t been fenced off. It found that 60% drowned in a pool, hot tub or spa. Looking at all drownings including adults, Louisiana had the nation’s third-highest rate, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A proposed order from the state’s Board of Environmental Protection would let stand a permit issued for a $1 billion electric transmission corridor to serve as a conduit for Canadian hydropower. The draft order was written by environmental agency staff ahead of a hearing this week that was postponed because of COVID-19 illnesses. The board was supposed to meet Tuesday to decide whether to hold a public hearing or to begin deliberations the following day. The permit was suspended by Maine Environmental Commissioner Melanie Loyzim after voters rebuked the project in a statewide referendum. Because the permit was not permanently revoked, the Board of Environmental Protection was required to issue a final decision on consolidated appeals. The Maine Supreme Judicial Court, meanwhile, is weighing a lawsuit aimed at overturning the referendum on constitutional grounds, as well questions about the legality of a state lease for a small portion of land. Funded by Massachusetts ratepayers, the New England Clean Energy Connect would supply up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower – enough electricity for 1 million homes – to the regional power grid. Supporters say bold projects are necessary to battle climate change. Critics say the benefits are overstated, and it would destroy woodlands.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: U.S. Sen. Chris Van Hollen says he has suffered a minor stroke and is being treated at George Washington University Hospital. The Maryland Democrat said he has been told there are no long-term effects or damage. In a statement Sunday night, Van Hollen said he has been advised by doctors to remain under observation at the Washington, D.C., hospital for a few days out of an abundance of caution. Van Hollen, 63, was elected to the Senate in 2016 after serving seven terms in the U.S. House. The senator said he experienced lightheadedness and acute neck pain while delivering a speech in western Maryland. On the advice of a physician, he sought medical attention upon his return home. An angiogram indicated a minor stroke in the form of a small venous tear at the back of his head, Van Hollen said. “I look forward to returning to work in the Senate later this week and thank the medical team for their excellent care,” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Chelsea Millsap, 32, who can trace her ancestry to the Pilgrims, is the first woman named sexton in the nearly 300-year history of Boston’s Old North Church. The critical job involves caring for and maintaining the parish buildings and equipment, including an 18th-century clock, the 75-piece chandeliers and the crypt where more than 1,100 people have been laid to rest. One of her first tasks will be managing a major renovation and restoration of the crypt. The church, still home to an active Episcopal congregation, is famous as the place where in 1775, two lanterns in the steeple signaled British soldiers were heading to Concord and Lexington, sending Paul Revere on the ride that sparked the American Revolution. One of the people who hung the lanterns was Robert Newman, the sexton at that time. “What an incredible opportunity to be able to sit in the very same pew as Robert Newman and in a world that is so divided to work in a place that welcomes all people from Bostonians to world dignitaries, like the Queen,” Millsap, a Detroit native and former firefighter with experience in fire prevention, security technology and project management, said in a statement. “I could have been the one to hang the lanterns 247 years ago. It is such an honor to show women that they too can hold these sorts of jobs.” Millsap is a descendant of teenage Mayflower passenger Mary Chilton, buried at nearby King’s Chapel.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A man walking on a footbridge to a Detroit Tigers game said he fell 15 feet to the ground when part of the concrete collapsed. Ely Hydes said the incident occurred May 9, but the bridge still was open until the Detroit News reached out to the state Transportation Department on Sunday. The Spruce Street pedestrian bridge is above M-10, also known as the Lodge Freeway. Hydes said he was walking to Comerica Park with a friend when “the bridge just collapsed under my feet.” “I remember thinking, ‘I hope I’m not over the freeway.’ I landed about 6 feet from the traffic. … After I hit the ground, I got the wind knocked out of me pretty good,” Hydes, 36, told the newspaper. He informed police, then resumed his walk to the Tigers game, a 2-0 loss to Oakland. Hydes went to a hospital a few days later. “I’m a giant walking bruise right now,” he said. The Transportation Department said it wasn’t aware of the hole in the bridge until notified by the newspaper. “The Spruce pedestrian bridge was built in 1953, and based on its age and condition, it is on a yearly detailed bridge inspection that is due this month,” spokeswoman Diane Cross said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nLutsen: Communities in northeastern Minnesota are preparing to deal with more flooding and are calling for volunteers to help with sandbagging. Near Voyageurs National Park, most docks are underwater at area lakes, and some 200 homes and resorts are at risk. Kabetogama Township Supervisor John Stegmeir said his area is bracing for a record-breaking flood. Stegmeir said more volunteers are needed, especially since the average age of volunteers sandbagging right now is 65. The volunteers, along with some staff from Voyageurs National Park, have been working since last Tuesday, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. “I think we’ve filled 8,000 bags this week, which isn’t big when you talk about the flooding on the Red River – they’re talking millions of bags – No. 1, we couldn’t do that, and the people who have been coming out to bag are older, you know,” he said. Volunteers are asked to check in at the town hall and to bring a shovel if possible. A flood warning is in effect for many communities in the Rainy River Basin of far northern Minnesota. In Cook County, the owner of Lutsen Resort on Lake Superior is hoping the iconic bridges on the property can be saved. Recent high water levels sent debris rushing down the Poplar River, damaging the bridges.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state has revised its landlord-tenant law to give renters time to gather their belongings from a home before being forced to leave, after a federal judge ruled that the previous law was unconstitutional. U.S. District Judge Michael P. Mills wrote in his Nov. 30 order that the old law was “unpredictable and absurd,” saying it went further than eviction laws in any other state. He wrote that it violated an occupant’s right to due process. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves signed the new law April 21, and it took effect immediately. It passed with broad bipartisan support. The Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal reports the new law gives a tenant seven days to gather belongings and vacate a home after an eviction notice. An exception is made for emergencies. If the occupant does not leave during the initial order, a judge could issue a separate one authorizing law enforcement to remove a tenant. That would give the person another 72 hours to gather their belongings. The previous law allowed landlords to immediately seize and dispose of a delinquent occupant’s personal property. The impetus for his order was a lawsuit by Samantha Conner, a Columbus woman who sued her landlord after he took nearly everything she owned when she was evicted in 2019.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The state has retained a dubious distinction for the 10th time, topping the Humane Society’s list of the worst puppy mill problem. In their annual list of worst dog breeders in the country, the advocacy group listed Missouri as having 26 of the most abusive puppy mills. Since the “Horrible Hundred” list was first published 10 years ago, Missouri has topped the list each year. This year the Show-Me State garnered 26 spots on the list, compared to just 17 in Iowa, 12 in New York, and seven each in Kansas and Wisconsin. That Missouri has so many puppy mills is no surprise, according to Humane Society Stop Puppy Mills campaign senior director John Goodwin. “Missouri has always been at the heart of the puppy mill industry since the beginning,” Goodwin said. “The post-World War II era was a time period where there was a lot of consolidation in agriculture, and a lot of small farms closed. This industry was seen as a solution in Midwestern states, and Missouri became the epicenter of large-scale puppy mills.” That evolution was aided by state regulations allowing the mills to flourish, Goodwin said. That would have changed in a 2010 proposition approved by voters that would have required large-scale breeders to provide “sufficient food, clean water, housing and space” to the dogs under their care, along with “necessary veterinary care; regular exercise and adequate rest between breeding cycles.” After the initiative was passed, the Legislature changed the language of the regulations.\n\nMontana\n\nCrow Agency: Little Big Horn College, a tribal college on the Crow Reservation, in partnership with the Crow Language Consortium, will host the 10th annual Crow Summer Institute on June6-24. The three-week program offers free Crow language and culture classes. Participants must be at least 18 years old, and registration is now open, according to a news release. The institute offers two options, one for beginners and one for intermediate learners. Learners will have access to resources developed by Crow elders, speakers and knowledge keepers, including textbooks, flashcards, dictionaries and multimedia apps. The Crow Summer Institute is offering $100 gas cards to some early registrants and Crow dictionaries for those who complete the program. Participants may also earn college credit through Little Big Horn College. Ishkoochìia Chiiakaamnáah (Jacob Brien), a Crow language learner who attended past Crow Summer Institutes, said the program helped him “realize different connections and patterns within the language.” “It really helped me understand Crow jokes and, by extension, Crow culture, which of course usually doesn’t translate, as many subtleties of the language don’t work in English,” he said in a statement. For more information, visit summer.crowlanguage.org.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state has agreed to pay $479,000 to the family of a “talkative” Scottsbluff man who was strangled to death in 2017 by a fellow inmate who didn’t want a cellmate. The lawsuit, filed by Terry Berry Jr.’s family against prison officials they argued were responsible for the 22-year-old’s death because they put him in the same cell as Patrick Schroeder, was dismissed last week after both sides agreed to the settlement. Berry was nearing parole on a sentence for forgery and assault when he was placed with Schroeder, who was serving a life sentence for killing a 75-year-old man and dumping his body in a well. The Lincoln Journal Star reports Schroeder later pleaded guilty to killing Berry and was sentenced to death. Berry’s family argued in the lawsuit that prison officials should have known there would be problems if they placed the two men together, and a caseworker at the prison even warned co-workers involved in the decision that Schroeder didn’t want a cellmate and wouldn’t likely tolerate Berry well because he was known to be “very talkative and bothersome.” Back in 2019, a federal judge dismissed the head of the state Department of Correctional Services and the prison’s warden as defendants, but the case had been allowed to move forward against several prison employees involved.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A proposed ballot initiative seeks to amend the state constitution to establish open top-five primaries and ranked-choice voting for general elections, though it isn’t without its critics. The Nevada Voters First political action committee is spearheading the initiative and must collect 140,777 signatures from registered Nevada voters by June 29 to qualify the measure for the 2022 general election ballot. Approval in November would call on the Legislature to institute the changes to the Nevada Constitution by July 1, 2025. In ranked-choice balloting, voters are directed to mark candidates in order of preference and to mark as many choices as they want. A voter may also choose only one candidate. The proposal would establish open primary elections, including all candidates regardless of party affiliation, squaring off in ranked-choice fashion. The top five finishers would advance to the general election, which would also be conducted using ranked-choice voting. About 30% of registered voters in Nevada list themselves as nonpartisan, and about 40% aren’t registered as Republican or Democrat, said Sondra Cosgrove, a representative with Nevada Voters First and a past president of the League of Women Voters of Nevada. “That’s a lot of people who are being shut out of important races,” she said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A former Trump administration official running for Congress did not violate state law by voting twice during the 2016 primary election season, the New Hampshire attorney general’s office said Thursday without taking a position on whether federal law was broken. The Associated Press reported in April that Matt Mowers cast ballots in both the Feb. 9, 2016, New Hampshire presidential primary and the New Jersey primary four months later. Legal experts said Mowers could have a violated federal law that prohibits “voting more than once” in “any general, special, or primary election.” That includes casting a ballot in separate jurisdictions “for an election to the same candidacy or office.” Though the article did not allege violation of state law, the attorney general’s office investigated based on the report and complaints from voters. After reviewing Mowers’ voting history, rental and property records, driver’s license documents and other material, it concluded he did not violate New Hampshire’s law against double voting. Mowers is a leading candidate for the GOP nomination in the state’s 1st Congressional District, though New Hampshire has yet to complete its redistricting process and finalize the congressional map. He was the nominee in 2020 but lost to Democratic incumbent Rep. Chris Pappas.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nToms River: The Ocean County Board of Commissioners plans this week to wade into the contentious debate over the state’s new health and sex education curriculum. While the five-member, all-Republican board has no legal authority to determine what is taught in schools, its bully pulpit is seen as influential in a county that is a bastion of conservatism in an otherwise progressive state. Commissioner Virginia E. Haines, who is also a Republican National Committee member, circulated a draft resolution among her colleagues last Wednesday to establish a “Parents’ Bill of Rights.” If approved as expected, the resolution would put the full weight of the county government behind a grassroots effort to establish such a bill of rights by providing political, administrative and legal support. The text of the draft resolution authorizes and directs the county commission director, the county administrator and county general counsel to organize parents, community leaders and unspecified professionals to develop the framework for such a document. The framework for such a declaration would then be used to marshal local school districts and county schools into adopting their own bills of rights.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The city’s Asian American community is testing a new way to bolster security for Asian-owned businesses in the wake of two deadly shootings. KOAT-TV reports an Albuquerque startup is trying out an online service that connects armed security guards with Asian-owned businesses. Businesses would report suspicious activity to toServo. The service would utilize GPS-enabled mobile technology to put them in touch with a private security team, and the security on call would respond within minutes. It is part of an initiative established by the Asian Business Collaborative. The nonprofit started a Good Neighbor Program to check up on shops and restaurants. For now, four businesses will be chosen for the service. But there are hopes to expand its use by the end of the year. Collaborative organizers say the city’s Asian community has been on edge since shootings at two Asian-owned spas. In January, the female owner of one spa was shot and killed during an attempted robbery. Two men have been charged in her killing. Less than a month later, another woman of Asian descent was killed inside another massage business during a robbery. The suspect was killed in a police pursuit 10 days later.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: City health officials issued an advisory Monday urging New Yorkers to wear masks in all indoor public settings as the city approaches “high risk” COVID-19 alert status. Health Commissioner Ashwin Vasan said everyone “regardless of vaccination status or past COVID-19 infection” should wear face coverings at all times in settings such as grocery stores, offices and building lobbies. People at high risk of severe illness from the virus, such as those over 65 years old, should avoid crowded settings and nonessential gatherings, he said. Vasan said he was issuing the guidance as the city approaches the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s “high” level of COVID-19 alert, representing high community spread and increasing pressure on the health care system. New York City has been averaging about 3,600 reported new cases of COVID-19 per day over the past week – a number that is likely an undercount because it doesn’t include positive tests done at home. The daily case counts have been rising slowly since March but have leveled off somewhat recently. The CDC risk level for Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn and Staten Island is currently “medium,” while the Bronx is still “low.” But much of the surrounding metropolitan area has already moved into the CDC’s “high risk” category.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to a conviction in the shooting death of an endangered red wolf in North Carolina. The wolf was found in a muddy field in Tyrrell County on April 15, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The News & Observer reports it had been shot in the spine and collapsed in the mud – some of which was found in its lungs. Killing a red wolf is illegal, except under special circumstances. Red wolves once ranged across the Southeast, but after decades of habitat loss and killing by humans, they were nearly extinct by 1980. The Fish and Wildlife Service gathered up the remaining wild wolves and began a captive breeding program. The first captive wolves were reintroduced to the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge in eastern North Carolina in 1987. By 2006, as many as 120 red wolves were thought to be living in the wild. Since then, wolf populations have declined again. Last year, the Biden administration abandoned a proposal made under President Donald Trump to scale back the areas where red wolves are protected and allow the killing of wolves found outside federal land.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Hoping to head off an explosion of electronic pull tab machines at gas stations and liquor, grocery and convenience stores, state regulators want to change the definition of a bar to make clear where the wildly popular Las Vegas-style games that mimic slot machines will be allowed. The state attorney general’s office, which oversees gambling in North Dakota, has identified a handful of gas stations and convenience stores that have begun selling and serving booze and are now “masquerading” as bars so that they can put the machines in their businesses, Attorney General Drew Wrigley said. Wrigley and Deb McDaniel, North Dakota’s top gambling regulator, said the idea for the rule change is to clarify and preserve what they believe the intent of the Legislature was when it defined a bar as a “retail alcoholic beverage establishment where alcoholic beverages are dispensed and consumed.” The amended language specifies that a bar does not include gas stations or liquor, grocery and convenience stores. A bar in a hotel, bowling alley or restaurant could still have the machines, under the new definition. The North Dakota Gaming Commission scheduled a Thursday meeting at the state Capitol to discuss the proposed changes and to take public comments.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state took the formal step of signaling interest in expanding Amtrak passenger rail in Ohio, though it is far from saying yes to the idea. Gov. Mike DeWine has asked the Ohio Rail Development Commission to work with Amtrak to study potential new routes, according to Dan Tierney, a spokesperson for the governor’s office. The move was first reported by Cleveland.com. “It’s not to the point where we’re ready to go jump up and ‘yippee,’ but it’s significant, and we’re optimistic,” said Stu Nicholson with All Aboard Ohio, an advocacy group for rail. Amtrak wants to build a line connecting Columbus, Cleveland, Dayton and Cincinnati. The company agreed to cover the cost of construction, track upgrades and operating costs for at least five years, then split the estimated $17 million to $20 million annual operating costs with the state. The roughly $100 million cost to build the line would come from a massive infrastructure package Congress passed into law. The approach could better entice Ohio to expand rail given much of the upfront cost will be covered, advocates said. Nicholson said recent guidance allows the state to use other sources outside its general revenue, such as private grants, to go toward its share.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: New laws signed by Gov. Kevin Stitt will increase funding for local enforcement of the medical marijuana industry and target illicit sales of cannabis. Each of the bills moved through the Legislature last week, and as a result county sheriffs are now able to receive grant funding to dedicate a full-time deputy to assist with compliance visits conducted by the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority. The intent of the law is to allow enforcement officers to help the medical marijuana authority in situations where licensed cannabis businesses are not willing to allow inspections of their property. According to the bill’s authors, compliance inspectors were denied access 181 times between April 2021 and February of this year. “This bill is not meant to threaten anyone. We just want to make sure our compliance inspectors can safely do their jobs,” said state Rep. David Hardin, R-Stilwell, the House author. “This is a very important piece of legislation that will help rein in illegal marijuana operations and give Oklahomans the safe, fair, free market for medical marijuana that they voted for in 2018.” Logistics of the bill create a revolving fund, provided by the medical marijuana authority, that sets aside an annual $5 million for county sheriffs to dedicate an officer for one year to the medical marijuana authority.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Criminal defendants who have gone without legal representation for long periods of time amid a critical shortage of public defense attorneys filed a lawsuit Monday that alleges the state violated their constitutional right to legal counsel and a speedy trial. The complaint, which seeks class-action status, was filed as state lawmakers and the Oregon Office of Public Defense Services struggle to address the huge shortage of public defenders statewide. The crisis has led to the dismissal of dozens of cases and left an estimated 500 defendants statewide – including several dozen in custody on serious felonies – without legal representation. Crime victims are also affected because cases are taking longer to reach resolution, a delay that experts say extends their trauma, weakens evidence and erodes confidence in the justice system, especially among low-income and minority groups. “There is a public defense crisis raging across this country,” said Jason D. Williamson, executive director of the Center on Race, Inequality, and the Law at New York University School of Law, who helped prepare the filing. “But Oregon is among only a handful of states that is now entirely depriving people of their constitutional right to counsel on a daily basis, leaving countless indigent defendants without access to an attorney for months at a time.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nCarlisle: Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Mehmet Oz is stepping up his criticism of far-right candidates gaining traction ahead of Tuesday’s primary election. After spending much of the campaign steering clear of fellow Republican Senate contender Kathy Barnette, Oz on Saturday said she was out of step with the GOP and would be unable to win the general election in November. In an interview, he took issue with a 2015 tweet from Barnette in which she wrote that “Pedophilia is a Cornerstone of Islam.” Oz, who would be the nation’s first Muslim senator, described the comments as “disqualifying.” “It’s reprehensible that she would tweet out something that is defamatory to an entire religion,” Oz told the Associated Press. “This state was based on religious freedom. I’m proud as a Pennsylvanian to uphold those founding beliefs that every faith has its merits.” The Barnette campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Earlier in the week, Barnette told NBC News that she did not make the statement, which was still live on her Twitter feed Monday.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A congressional candidate recently arrested on a menacing charge in another state has dropped out of the race. Michael Neary said in a statement Friday that he was seeking medical treatment for non-epileptic seizures following his arrest in Ohio in March. He said the decision followed “careful consultation and prayer.” Neary, 28, was among a large field of candidates seeking the Democratic nomination in Rhode Island’s 2nd Congressional District following incumbent Democrat Jim Langevin’s announcement in January that he’s retiring. Neary has pleaded not guilty to a misdemeanor charge of menacing by stalking March 23, as well as drug counts after marijuana and drug paraphernalia were allegedly found in his car. He’s previously said he’d remain in the race despite the charges. The Columbus, Ohio, resident, who grew up in Rhode Island, was stopped by police after another driver reported having been followed from Columbus to Troy, more than 60 miles away. Police said the driver reported that Neary’s car mimicked their every move, matching speed and lane changes and even stopping at a rest area after they did. Authorities said Neary told them he had recently returned from Rhode Island, was very stressed and had been focusing on the vehicle’s Ohio registration.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Grace Church has purchased a dormitory building from Greenville Technical College to convert into affordable housing as part of a special program to address the local housing crisis. The church will serve as the landlord for the property, and rent will be adjusted to fit families’ income. Rent prices will range from $450 for a single room to $1,000 for a three-bedroom unit. The goal, according to Grace Church’s care and recovery ministry director LeeAnne Cavin, is that the average family will pay in the $900 range for a unit. “We do have a crisis of housing,” Cavin said. “Our whole community is really starting to desire collaboration.” The units are expected to open for rent the first week of June, and the church already has almost 40 families ready to move in. The program will accept emergency housing vouchers through the Greenville Housing Authority but not Section 8 vouchers or extra subsidy from the federal government that goes directly toward rent. To sign a lease in one of the units, families agree to be a part of a Grace Church housing program that offers medical coverage, dental care, a savings matching program, mental health support, car maintenance, financial education, cooking classes, self-defense classes, and job and interview preparation.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The ongoing drought in South Dakota has been hard on the state’s wildlife. The U.S. Forest Service says the grouse population in the Fort Pierre National Grassland has declined by 15% in 2022, largely because of the dry conditions. The total grouse population has averaged about 300 since the mid-1980s. Over the past twenty years, both greater prairie chicken and sharp-tailed grouse populations have primarily remained stable or have grown. “The thing that I think was really damaging to us last year was we had record-high and record-dry conditions in early June, right when those birds started incubation or, for the earlier semester, to hatch. And, boy, that’s just so tough on a chick to thermoregulate and be able to find sufficient moisture,” District Ranger Dan Svingen said. Greater prairie chickens and sharp-tailed grouse both nest on the ground and require tall grass to hide their nests, the Capital Journal reports. Because they start laying eggs as early as April, before sufficient grass growth, they’re dependent on dead grass from the previous year as cover. However, the drought prevented extensive grass growth in 2021, leaving them more exposed to predators in 2022. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a little more than 76% of South Dakota is experiencing some kind of drought.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: In its quest to redefine tourism at the gateway to the Great Smoky Mountains, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians has inked a deal to bring an international entertainment company to the United States for the first time. Tribal Council and international theme park company Puy du Fou have signed a letter of intent to develop a new “spectacular immersive show” as part of a 200-acre development located at Exit 407 south of Interstate 40 on the way to the Smokies. The Tribal Council approved $75 million May 4 for phase one development of “The 407: Gateway to Adventure.” Its leaders are seeking world-class attractions to appeal to the record-breaking crowds flocking to Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. The 407 partners have estimated the development could attract 6.7 million visitors in the first year after phase one is complete. That’s expected sometime in 2024. “We are excited to take the first steps towards developing this world-class attraction that will help support our nation economically while creating a new platform to share dimensions of Cherokee history many have never heard,” said Chairman of the Tribal Council Richard French. Puy du Fou is known worldwide for its immersive experiences inspired by history.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Two people were killed and three more taken to a hospital with injuries after a shooting Sunday at a bustling flea market, authorities said. The shooting at the open-air market arose from an “altercation” that involved at least two guns and all five of the people, according to Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez. He said no “innocent bystanders” were injured. Investigators believe one of the people hospitalized was among those who opened fire, and two more suspected shooters were detained at the scene, a sheriff’s deputy told KTRK-TV. Thousands of people were shopping at the market 14 miles north of Houston’s downtown when the shooting began around 1 p.m. Sunday, Gonzalez said on Twitter. The sheriff said multiple shots were fired, and deputies recovered two pistols from the scene. Authorities did not immediately provide further information about what led to the shooting but said all the people involved were men in there 20s who appeared to know each other.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A copper mining company will begin manufacturing a rare mineral used in solar panels that used to be discarded along with the other mine tailings. Rio Tinto officials and Gov. Spencer Cox unveiled the plan Wednesday at the Kennecott refinery west of Salt Lake City where the tellurium will be produced, FOX-13 news reports. The company says it is one of two in the U.S. to produce tellurium, which is listed as a “critical mineral” by the U.S. government. Most of the tellurium produced comes from China and other countries. Rio Tinto is working with the U.S. Department of Energy on ideas to produce more tellurium. The company said it hopes to produce 20 tons of the tellurium each year. “If we can produce it here, we are all going to be better off,” said Cox, a Republican. “We desperately need more of it.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott signed legislation into law Monday that creates an advisory committee to make recommendations on how to spend the state’s share of settlement money with drug manufacturers and distribution companies over the toll of prescription opioids. The number of opioid-related overdose deaths in Vermont jumped 33% in 2021 to a record 210 fatalities, the Vermont Health Department reported last month. The committee will be made up of the state’s health commissioner; a member each from the state Senate and House; health care providers; two people who lived through the experience of opioid use disorder; an assistant judge; and representatives from municipalities. Each year, the committee will make recommendations to the Vermont Department of Health and legislative committees for expenditures from a special opioid abatement fund. The health commissioner is expected to call the first meeting of the panel to occur on or before June 30.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: A professor whose research on pedophilia created a stir at Old Dominion University has landed a new job with Johns Hopkins University’s Moore Center for the Prevention of Child Sexual Abuse. Allyn Walker stepped down from ODU in November after using the phrase “minor-attracted person” instead of “pedophile” in research, leading to an outcry on campus and social media, as well as threats of violence. The Virginian-Pilot reports the Moore Center announced last week that Walker, who uses the pronoun they, would be joining the center as a postdoctoral fellow. The center said in a series of tweets that it was excited to welcome Walker and that they would be working on research and new projects to develop a “comprehensive public health approach to addressing child sexual abuse and effective prevention programs.” On its website, the center says it works “to change the way the world thinks about child sexual abuse, from inevitable to preventable.” In the series of tweets, the center referred to Walker as “a leader in the field of perpetration prevention research.” Walker was an assistant professor of sociology and criminal justice before more than 15,500 people signed an online petition calling for their removal from ODU in the fall. That came after a controversial interview about “A Long, Dark Shadow: Minor-Attracted People and Their Pursuit of Dignity,” a book focused on people who do not act on their sexual attraction to children and strategies to prevent them from acting on the attraction.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amtrak will postpone restoring its Cascades passenger-train service between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., until possibly December because of a lack of personnel. The service gap occurred despite the Biden administration’s much-hyped $66 billion allotted in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to catch up on maintenance and spread Amtrak’s national railway service to new cities, The Seattle Times reports. Janet Matkin, rail spokesperson for the Washington State Department of Transportation, said transportation officials in the state hoped the trains would roll again by summer or even late spring. Amtrak doesn’t have enough conductors, mechanics and onboard service staff yet to operate the trains, though new classes of conductors are in training, according to a letter to Washington and Oregon rail directors from Ray Lang, an Amtrak vice president. Pre-pandemic, about 159,000 people per year rode between Seattle and Vancouver, B.C., or 290,000 when including stations between the cities, Matkin said. Passenger fares traditionally cover about two-thirds of operation costs, while states cover the rest.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWelch: Gov. Jim Justice visited the site of a planned $147 million highway project that will connect Welch to the Coalfields Expressway. The 5-mile stretch of highway is expected to be completed in 2026. “This announcement today means we are one step closer to bringing this area of West Virginia to the world once and for all,” Justice said in a media release. “We have waited and waited in southern West Virginia for way too long.” Justice announced Friday that Bizzack Construction of Lexington, Kentucky, won the bid to build the new highway. The governor’s office said plans are in the works to build a 5-mile stretch of the Coalfields Expressway from Mullens to Twin Falls State Park and a 3-mile link from Twin Falls toward Pineville. The four-lane Coalfields Expressway that runs from Raleigh County to Wyoming County opened in 2020.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSparta: The popular Elroy-Sparta State Trail officially reopened over the weekend following several years of flood-related repairs. Summer flood damage in 2018 closed the 32-mile-long trail which had about 60,000 visitors a year. The state Department of Natural Resources said the western Wisconsin trail needed two complete bridge replacements and landslide repairs, among other work. According to the DNR, $2.3 million needed for repairs came from the Federal Emergency Management Administration and the state. State Sen. Howard Marklein, of Spring Green, and state Rep. Tony Kurtz, of Wonewoc, spearheaded efforts in the Legislature to secure funds for the trail’s repairs, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. “The easy part was the funding,” the DNR’s Missy VanLanduyt said. “The more difficult part was just the sheer amount of infrastructure that needed to be replaced, and designing all of that, and then going through the bidding process and then finally a very long construction period as well.” While repair work is largely complete, a 1-mile section of the trail was closed as of Friday because of bridge safety concerns.

Cynthia Lummis apologized Monday after getting booed and heckled for remarks she made on sexual identity during a University of Wyoming graduation speech. A first-term Republican from deep-red Wyoming, Lummis said in Saturday’s speech in Laramie that human rights are derived from God but that government seeks to redefine many of them. “Even fundamental, scientific truths such as the existence of two sexes, male and female, are subject to challenge these days,” Lummis said. She paused and smiled while many in the crowd responded with boos and heckling. “And I challenge those of you,” she said, without completing that thought, saying: “I’m not making a comment on the fact that there are people who transition between sexes.” Lummis is a former congresswoman, state treasurer and University of Wyoming graduate who’s been prominent in Wyoming politics for decades. Until now, at least, she has been less outspoken than many Republicans who’ve made a major issue of gender and sex identity. The stir happened in a community known for the murder of gay University of Wyoming student Matthew Shepard in 1998, a watershed event in LGBTQ activism. A college town of about 32,000 people, Laramie leans left compared to the vast majority of Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/17"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/08/12/million-dollar-embezzlement-sparks-reforms-dhss/556553001/", "title": "Delaware Department of Health and Social Services: Million-dollar ...", "text": "A year after a politically explosive, food stamp embezzlement scheme came to public light, Delaware social service officials say they have transformed how they guard against and root out fraud.\n\nAnd, to do so, they are looking over the shoulders of their own employees with a beefed-up team of as many as 20 quality-control investigators.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Health and Social Services adopted a litany of anti-fraud measures after seven social workers between 2008 and 2015 stole nearly $1.3 million worth of social service benefits, including about $900,000 of food stamps.\n\nThe culprits, who since have pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison or probation, created fake accounts in the names of fictitious homeless people with no mailing addresses. The resulting benefit cards were sent to DHSS field offices in New Castle and Kent counties, which the culprits then collected for themselves.\n\n“We had controls in place but, obviously, our controls were not sufficient,” said Ray Fitzgerald, director of the Delaware Division of Social Services, who described the crime as stealing from “poor people.”\n\nCRIME:Delaware State Police arrest six in drug investigation\n\nTwo years ago, an employee during a regular case check noticed suspicious information within a file, Fitzgerald said. The discovery led to a broader investigation, which unraveled the million-dollar fraud.\n\nIt wasn't disclosed to the public until a year later, after seven suspects were indicted.\n\nIn many instances, the culprits had entered all zeros into the Social Security Number line on food stamp application forms, Fitzgerald said. Some also were captured on video using the ill-gotten benefit cards at grocery stores, he added.\n\nAfter the fraud came to light, a federally contracted consultancy team descended onto Delaware to investigate vulnerabilities in state operations. In an investigative report, the team said the food stamp program had been at risk because supervisors didn’t think their employees would steal from the state — and instead focused fraud investigations on benefit recipients.\n\n\"Efforts were not heavily focused on internally-falsified documents,” stated the investigators from Georgia-based Teracore in a report, obtained by The News Journal through an open records request.\n\nFitzgerald now has more than doubled the size of a fraud oversight team at the division, which today fluctuates between 15 and 20 employees — and includes seasonal and temporary workers, he said.\n\n“They review the cases for quality and integrity to make sure nobody’s doing any funny stuff,” Fitzgerald said.\n\nTeracore in its report also issued recommended reforms, which today have resulted in automated checks of Social Security Numbers listed on files, shifts in food stamp cases between social workers over time, physical inspections of state employees’ desks and the prohibition of social workers from the mail room.\n\nSTORY:NCCo Council president under internal investigation while assistant in legal limbo\n\nThe reforms, Fitzgerald said, make it nearly impossible for thieving employees to keep a single case on their desk in an attempt to thwart others from finding fraudulent activities.\n\n“That can’t happen anymore,” Fitzgerald said, punctuating every word with a strike of his pen on a table.\n\nIn the intervening years since fraud was discovered, U.S. Department of Agriculture officials have been conducting regular inspections of Fitzgerald’s food stamp operations.\n\nAn agency spokesman in an email said officials during inspections have found “no major violations of federal requirements.”\n\nPressed about minor violations, the spokesman said they \"found some cases were missing documentation related to the (food stamp) recertification action.\"\n\nSTORY: Food stamp use increasing in Delaware\n\nSTORY: Correctional employees' suspension related to moving an inmate\n\n$214 million and 15 percent of the state\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food and Nutrition Service funds the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known colloquially as food stamps, in reference to the physical form the credits once took.\n\nWith origins in a food program enacted during the Great Depression, when millions of needy people didn't have enough to eat, assistance dollars today are loaded onto Electronic Benefits Transfer cards and then mailed to recipients.\n\nThe state Division of Social Services distributes those dollars to people in need and manages their cases.\n\nMUST READ:Premiums could increase by about 50% for some Delawareans, study shows\n\nThe division also manages eligibility for Medicaid, the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, and two state assistance programs.\n\nApproximately 145,000 Delawareans, about 15 percent of the state, received food stamps in July, nearly double the number in the program in 2008, before the full weight of the Great Recession descended upon Delaware.\n\nIn 2016, the program distributed roughly $214 million worth of food assistance in Delaware.\n\nFitzgerald’s team of nearly 200 case managers — working at 18 field offices in all three Delaware counties — have not been bothered by “us looking over their shoulders,” he said.\n\nBut one social worker, who spoke with The News Journal on the condition of anonymity, said some members on the new oversight team are temporary workers not sufficiently trained.\n\nStill, when asked if a malicious person could get away with stealing money with the more robust anti-fraud system in place today, the social worker said, “there is more of a chance that they would catch it now.”\n\nThe oversight team in August included 11 seasonal or temporary employees. Fitzgerald said temporary workers go through the same training as full-time employees.\n\nTemporary workers are necessary in this role because state government is operating under a general hiring freeze, he added.\n\nAsked if his division is understaffed, Fitzgerald said, “we don’t complain.”\n\nThe crime\n\nIt was a perfect storm of societal chaos that confronted the Social Services Division during the aftermath of the Great Recession, said Fitzgerald, who was deputy director of the office at the time.\n\nAn economic collapse led to surging applications for Medicaid and food stamps — at precisely the same time declining tax revenues contributed to cuts in state operations. Managers were overwhelmed.\n\nAdditionally, the Social Services Division was negotiating the rocky first years of implementation for the federal Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, said Jill Fredel, the DHSS spokeswoman.\n\n“They were getting used to this new interface, which was a pain,” Fredel said. “That computer system had problems from the get-go.”\n\nSTORY:Downtown Wilmington park clean up paves way for entertainment\n\nThose problems occurred just as the fraudsters were fine-tuning their scheme.\n\nThey started small.\n\nJust one fake account was opened in 2008, then three more in 2010 and an additional 13 in 2011.\n\nEach fake account cost taxpayers, $22 each day or $8,162 in a year on average, according to the Teracore report.\n\nSeemingly more confident as the years progressed, the social workers opened 68 cases in 2012, another 13 in 2013 and 13 more in 2014.\n\nInvestigators found no emails sent between the seven culprits documenting evidence of the theft during the time, Fredel said.\n\nIt was during a random quality-control check in the 2015 fiscal year that a supervisor attempted to pull case files but was unable to find all necessary information.\n\nOfficials became suspicious.\n\nAfter examining the electronic form of the case, the supervisor found that it had no documentation uploaded into the digital imaging system, a safeguard against fraud.\n\nThe case also had been opened and closed a number of times, and an invalid Social Security Number had been entered.\n\nCRIME:2 sought by police after skimming devices found at Seaford-area gas station\n\nA second similar case also was discovered, and the two were compared. Both listed the applicants as homeless, and consequently, the EBT cards were sent directly to Social Services field offices.\n\nEvidence mounted after supervisors noticed that, despite automated systems designed to assign social workers to cases randomly, the fraudulent files each had been worked on by only one social worker throughout their lifespans.\n\nWhen Fitzgerald was told about the evidence, initially he was skeptical of the claims. As evidence mounted, his feeling turned to sadness.\n\n“You’re disappointed that the people who work here who know the struggles that everybody’s going through in the community. You’re disappointed,” he said.\n\nFitzgerald confronted the then-suspects and presented them with an initial-suspension letter. The reactions were muted, he said.\n\n“It wasn’t like a Perry Mason moment. Nobody jumped up and said, ‘I did it.’ Mainly, they just sat there quiet, accepted the letter,” he said. “One person said, ‘Wow.’ One person said, ‘I can’t believe this is happening.’”\n\nShortly after, the workers were fired.\n\nThe seven social workers are Detrich Simmons-Heath of Chestertown, Maryland; Kamilah Laws of Wilmington; Jo Ellen Edwards of Felton; Shirlene Davis of Newark; Nicole Stevens of Dover; Allison Rivera of Dover; and Angelette Brown of Camden.\n\nEdwards was sentenced to two years in prison and ordered to pay $378,880 in restitution. The others face between one and two years of probation and also were ordered to pay restitution between $296,172, for Simmons-Heath, and 8,092, for Stevens.\n\nSuspicions and politics\n\nFrom his corner office in the Lewis Building at a DHSS complex near New Castle, Fitzgerald said that despite the anti-fraud focus, he is resigned to the possibility that some of his employees may again try to steal from the system.\n\n“I wouldn’t go on record saying this is never going to happen again because people are people. It’s just our job to try and catch them,” he said.\n\nEarlier this year, in fact, there was some sort of malicious incident, involving Social Services employees “doing things they weren’t supposed to do,” which caused a loss of hundreds of dollars, Fitzgerald said.\n\nHe declined to disclose more details, but called it a “one off.”\n\nThe offending employees had been fired, he said, adding they were apprehended because of the new oversight.\n\nThe division is focused on minimizing the risk of anyone siphoning funds from the multimillion-dollar assistance program, partially because the resulting negative press fuels political scrutiny, which could harm people who depend on the program, FItzgerald said.\n\nCRIME:Man faces 30 years to life for raping woman in Brandywine Park in Wilmington\n\nBut many conservatives say there should be fewer people using food stamps.\n\nFor years, they have argued that too many taxpayer dollars are spent on government assistance programs, such as food stamps. President Donald Trump’s first budget proposal released in May included a 25-percent cut to the program.\n\nWhite House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney noted that food stamp rolls haven’t fallen back to pre-recession levels.\n\n“Isn't it reasonable for you to at least ask the question, 'Are there people on that program who shouldn’t be on there?'” he asked.\n\nCountering those critics, Fitzgerald said, on average, between 60 and 80 percent of food assistance recipients are working-age adults and are not disabled, have a job or have worked within the past year.\n\n“People think that our benefit programs are like a giveaway,\" he said. \"They’re really not.\"\n\nFallout after the crime\n\nThe fallout from the crime was swift.\n\nDHSS officials requested help from the federal government and Teracore, the private investigative team contracted by the United States Department of Agriculture, came to Delaware.\n\nAgency Secretary Rita Landgraff \"at the time was angry,” Fredel said. “That there are people who would steal from their neighbors who are so vulnerable. That is really just the lowest of the low.”\n\nFrom April to June in 2015, the team from Teracore interrogated employees and scrubbed their workplace practices.\n\nThe News Journal requested through the Freedom of Information Act a copy of Teracore’s contract with the USDA. Federal officials provided the contract but redacted the total amount paid to Teracore for its Delaware work.\n\nOfficials from Teracore did not respond to requests to comment on the case.\n\nAlso in the wake of the discovery of the crime, DHSS officials scrambled to figure out how best to describe the situation to the public.\n\nSTORY:It’s not just you — there really are fewer homes for sale with inventory at a 20-year low\n\nA series of emails obtained by The News Journal through an open records request shows how in early 2015, USDA spokesman Chris Kelly worked with Fredel to “craft a message” about the case.\n\n“As you can imagine, this is extremely sensitive,” Fredel wrote in an email to Kelly in April 2015. “We have not made a decision on when/if to send out the release, but we need to be prepared in case news of the investigation/fraud leaks out.”\n\nDHSS employee Gwen Griffith sent an email to DHSS supervisors, including Kevin Kelley, director of the Division of Management Services, conveying to them that Social Services employees with whom she had spoken, implored top-management to immediately disclose the case to the public.\n\nThey “feel that this will be a big story when it hits given the new Congress,” Griffith said. “The department could break the story themselves, touting the documented successes of the\" auditing team.\n\nState officials never disclosed the information to the public at that time.\n\nA year after the emails, the Delaware Department of Justice issued a press release about the indictments of the seven former state employees.\n\nToday, when asked about what the public should takeaway from the story about the fraud and resulting reforms, Fitzgerald said, he doesn't want them to be distracted from the value his team brings to society.\n\n“Folks reading this article, they don’t know me, they don’t know Jill, they don’t know anybody,” he said. “We don’t want the limited resources we have for helping vulnerable people, we don’t want any bad light shed on that, so we are committed to ensure something like that doesn’t happen again. But if it does happen again, we’re committed to addressing it immediately.\"\n\nThe Teracore team in closing its report warned that thieves will become more sophisticated in the future, and therefore Delaware’s social workers must remain vigilant about protecting the integrity of its $214 million program.\n\nLimiting “fraud is not a static process. Over time, perpetrators of fraud may develop more sophisticated methods,” the report stated.\n\nContact Karl Baker atkbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.
