He also said that the candidate list would close on Monday, before a first round of voting on Wednesday. The list will then be whittled down to two, and the party’s grassroot members will be given the final say.\n\nJohnson announced on Thursday he would step down, after nearly 60 lawmakers and government officials resigned over his handling of a series of scandals, including illegal gatherings held at his Downing Street office in defiance of coronavirus lockdown rules and his failure to act on sexual misconduct allegations against his deputy chief whip.\n\nNow, with the government in tatters, bookmakers and much of Britain are speculating about his likely successor. A slew of contenders have thrown their hat into the ring – from household names to lesser-known Conservative members of parliament.\n\nAmong those to announce their candidacy are an Iraqi Kurdish refugee, the children of Indian and Pakistani immigrants and several women – reflecting efforts by the Conservative Party to field more ethnically diverse candidates for Parliament in recent years.\n\nAny candidates who run for the leadership will go through rounds of voting by Conservative lawmakers until only two remain – at which point Conservative Party members nationwide will vote. The winner will be the new party leader – and prime minister.\n\nHere’s a look at the possible contenders.\n\nShow More - (Show Less)\n\nRishi Sunak\n\nBritain's former Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Jessica Taylor/UK Parliament/Reuters\n\nThe former chancellor formally announced he was standing to succeed Johnson in a campaign video on Friday, which began with the story of his Indian parents, who both emigrated to the UK from East Africa. “It was Britain, our country, that gave them and millions like them the chance of a better future,” he said. “I want to lead this country in the right direction.”\n\nSunak was Johnson’s presumed successor for several months after he won praise for overseeing Britain’s initial financial response to the Covid-19 pandemic. But he has suffered several of his own scandals while in government.\n\nHis stock sank earlier this year after revelations that he broke Covid regulations to attend the prime minister’s birthday party on June 19, 2020, for which he later apologized “unreservedly.”\n\nHis financial and legal affairs came under scrutiny this spring following reports his wife had non-domicile status in the UK – meaning she was not liable to pay tax on overseas income – and that he held a US green card while serving as minister.\n\nHis popularity has also taken a beating in recent weeks as Britain has sufferedthe worst cost-of-living crisis in decades. Sunak has struggled to keep down spiraling inflation and has been criticized by opposition parties for what they call a slow and inadequate series of financial measures. Among the economic woes facing Britons after Sunak’s time as the UK’s chief financial minister: real wages dropping to their lowest levels in more than 21 years and inflation hitting a 40-year high of 9.1% in May.\n\nBut he is still among the bookmakers’ odds-on favorites to take Johnson’s job.\n\nSajid Javid\n\nFormer Health Secretary Sajid Javid. Leon Neal/Getty Images\n\nThe former health secretary, whose resignation set off a wave of departures from Johnson’s government, officially announced his candidacy on Sunday.\n\n“Whether it’s the cost of living or it’s low levels of growth, for me, that’s our most immediate challenge… You need someone with an economic plan from day one,” he said, adding that his economic plan would have two prongs: short-term measures to help people meet cost-of-living challenges and a longer-term plan for tax reform.\n\nPosting on Twitter on Sunday, Javid said: “The next Prime Minister needs integrity, experience, and a tax-cutting plan for economic growth. That’s why I’m standing.”\n\nThe statement echoed Javid’s resignation speech in the House of Commons in which he said that something was “fundamentally wrong” with government.\n\nThose who support Javid’s candidacy hope that he will be credited for triggering Johnson’s ultimate ouster, having been the first cabinet minister to resign – though Sunak followed him minutes later.\n\nThe MP has twice run for party leadership in the past – in 2016, after the Brexit referendum, and in 2019, when Johnson was ultimately elected. He served as chancellor from 2019 to 2020.\n\nHis family immigrated from Pakistan to the UK in the 1960s, and his father worked as a bus driver.\n\nLiz Truss\n\nUK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss. Tolga Akmen/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe foreign secretary made her leadership ambitions known in The Telegraph on Sunday. At the heart of her leadership bid is a pledge to cut taxes “from day one,” to tackle the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nLiz Truss became the chief negotiator with the European Union on the UK’s Brexit deal in December 2021 and has held multiple cabinet positions. Since voting Remain in 2016, she has since become one of the loudest Euroskeptic voices in the government, which many have chalked up to her desire for the top job.\n\nShe has a formidable and dedicated team around her – some of whom previously worked in Number 10 – which has been producing slick videos and photos of her looking thoroughly statesmanlike. She has apparently attempted to channel former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, wearing a headscarf while driving a tank, and her role in fronting the response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has also heightened her public profile.\n\nIn her comment piece in The Telegraph, she highlighted her foreign policy expertise, writing: “As Foreign Secretary, I have helped to lead the international response to Putin’s war in Ukraine and delivered a tough sanctions package that has led the world, by imposing real pain on Putin and the Kremlin.”\n\nTruss is popular among Conservative members, who would pick the eventual winner of a contest. But Johnson’s downfall could simultaneously tarnish anyone in his cabinet, meaning Conservative voters could turn to a backbencher to take the mantle.\n\nPenny Mordaunt\n\nBritain's Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt. Aaron Chown/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nThe trade minister, one of the bookmakers’ favorites to replace Johnson, announced her bid for the leadership on Sunday. A poll of party members published July 4 by website Conservative Home put her as the second favorite choice, behind the current defense secretary Ben Wallace, who has ruled himself out of the race.\n\nPenny Mordaunt first entered parliament in 2010 and later joined the cabinet under Theresa May, serving as international development and defense secretary.\n\nAfter last month’s confidence vote, Mordaunt declined to comment on whether she backed Johnson, raising eyebrows among Westminster observers when she said: “I didn’t choose this prime minister.”\n\nAnnouncing her interest in the top job, she said the party “leadership needs to become a little less about the leader and a lot more about the ship.”\n\nMordaunt, who in 2019 became the first woman to serve as defense minister, invoked Thatcher in her statement, saying the former Conservative leader “was remarkable for not just what she did but the speed she did it.”\n\n“She had a vision and a plan. So do I,” she added.\n\nTom Tugendhat\n\nCommittee chairman Tom Tugendhat. Niall Carson/PA Images/Getty Images\n\nA former British military officer who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat has been one of Johnson’s most robust critics and has called for the Conservative Party to drop its focus on “divisive politics.”\n\nLaunching his leadership bid on Thursday in The Telegraph newspaper, Tugendhat wrote: “I have served before – in the military, and now in Parliament. Now I hope to answer the call once again as prime minister. It’s time for a clean start. It’s time for renewal.”\n\nHe outlined his vision for tackling the cost of living crisis, reducing taxes and investing in neglected regions of the UK.\n\nDespite not having any cabinet or shadow cabinet experience, Tugendhat has impressed colleagues with his oratory skills and seriousness, most notably when he spoke about the fall of Afghanistan. He entered parliament in 2015 after serving in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.\n\nSome key centrist Conservatives have already been throwing their support behind the relative wildcard, but some worry that his experience is too focused on foreign affairs.\n\nNadhim Zahawi\n\nBritain's newly appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer Nadhim Zahawi. Daniel Leal/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLess than two days after he was appointed by Johnson to the role of chancellor, replacing Sunak, Nadhim Zahawi publicly called on the prime minister to resign and later launched his bid to replace him.\n\nUntil his promotion, Zahawi, who joined the cabinet less than a year ago, was considered an unlikely choice as the next leader of the Conservative Party. But his rise under Johnson has been rapid, making his mark with early success as vaccines minister amid the coronavirus pandemic and then as education secretary.\n\nIn his pitch for leadership, previewed in The Spectator magazine, he promised to lower taxes for individuals, families and business, boost defense spending, and continue with education reforms he started in his previous role.\n\nDespite voting to leave the European Union in 2016, Zahawi is widely admired among the moderates in the party. Crucially, as one Conservative source put it, “he’s not been in government long enough to have any obvious defects and, despite supporting Boris even after the confidence vote, is not too tainted by association.”\n\nZahawi was born in Iraq to Kurdish parents and came to the UK as a child, when his family fled Saddam Hussein’s regime. He is believed to be one of the richest politicians in the House of Commons, and helped found the polling company YouGov.\n\n“If a young boy who came here aged 11 without a word of English, can serve at the highest levels of Her Majesty’s Government and run to be the next Prime Minister, anything is possible,” Zahawi is set to say in a speech Monday, an excerpt of which was published by The Spectator.\n\nJeremy Hunt\n\nConservative MP Jeremy Hunt. Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\nA former health and foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt lost the 2019 leadership vote to Johnson. He has since styled himself as an antidote to Johnson and is without question the highest profile contender on the moderate, ex-Remain side of the party.\n\nHunt announced his bid to become the next Conservative leader in an interview with British newspaper The Sunday Telegraph, pitching himself as “the only major candidate who has not served in Boris Johnson’s government.”\n\nIn a statement on Twitter ahead of the confidence vote in June, Hunt said: “Anyone who believes our country is stronger, fairer & more prosperous when led by Conservatives should reflect that the consequence of not changing will be to hand the country to others who do not share those values. Today’s decision is change or lose. I will be voting for change.”\n\nTellingly, Hunt’s statement focused mainly on the Conservatives’ chances of electoral success under Johnson, rather than his policies or the partygate scandal – a decision that could be read as a pitch to the Conservative MPs and members who would decide a leadership election. However, he comes with baggage, and sources from the opposition Labour Party have told CNN they are already writing attack lines.\n\n“It can’t be Jeremy. Labour can say he was running healthcare for six years and failed to prepare for a pandemic. They can say when he was culture secretary he chummed up to the Murdochs during the phone hacking scandal. He will get crushed,” a senior Conservative source told CNN.\n\nGrant Shapps\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps. Phil Noble/Reuters\n\nThe transport secretary launched his bid for prime minister this weekend, describing himself as a “problem solver, with a proven record of delivery” in a post on Twitter.\n\nOutlining his vision for the UK in an interview with The Sunday Times newspaper, Grant Shapps said that within his first 100 days in office he would produce an emergency budget to lower tax for “the most vulnerable” and give state support to firms with high levels of energy consumption.\n\n“We have had two-and-a-half years of tactical government by an often distracted centre. This must end. We must be a strategic government, sober in its analysis, and not chasing the next headline,” the paper quoted Shapps as saying.\n\nThe MP for Welwyn Hatfield was elected in 2005 and has held several ministerial posts. He is also a former co-chair of the Conservative party.\n\nKemi Badenoch\n\nConservative MP Kemi Badenoch. Ben Cawthra/Shutterstock\n\nThe former equalities minister launched her leadership bid in an op-ed published by the Times of London newspaper, saying she wants a “strong but limited government focused on the essentials.”\n\nKemi Badenoch resigned from the government on Wednesday citing “issues” that had “come to light” and the way they had been handled.\n\n“I’m putting myself forward in this leadership election because I want to tell the truth. It’s the truth that will set us free,” she wrote Saturday. Badenoch, who voted in favor of Brexit in 2016, added she would run on a “smart and nimble centre-right vision.”\n\nSuella Braverman\n\nAttorney General Suella Braverman. Wiktor Szymanowicz/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nLast week, the attorney general called for Johnson to quit and said that she would join a leadership race to replace him, telling ITV “it would be the greatest honor.”\n\nLaunching her bid a few days later, Suella Braverman wrote in The Daily Telegraph: “I saw Brexit as the most important political decision of my life. My views are not triangulated or calibrated. They are as much a part of me as my DNA. I now realise that I cannot rely on others to take Conservatism forward.”\n\nBraverman was elected as MP for Fareham in 2015.\n\nRehman Chishti\n\nConservative MP Rehman Chishti. rehmanchishti.com\n\nAmong the biggest outsiders in the race, the newly appointed Foreign Office minister threw his hat into the ring on Sunday.\n\nBorn in Pakistan, Rehman Chishti moved to the UK at the age of six, learning English at school in Gillingham, Kent, the area of southeastern England that he has represented as an MP since 2010. He went on to become the first in his family to go to university and received his law degree.\n\n“It’s important to ensure that everyone who works hard, who’s determined, who perseveres, that they have a government that is on their side,” he said in a Facebook video announcing his candidacy, adding that he would ensure lower taxes and fresh ideas to improve people’s lives.", "authors": ["Eliza Mackintosh Luke Mcgee", "Eliza Mackintosh", "Luke Mcgee"], "publish_date": "2022/07/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/10/20/who-is-the-next-house-speaker/71258155007/", "title": "Here are the Republicans running for House speaker: What to know", "text": "WASHINGTON – After House Republicans voted to drop Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, as their speaker nominee, a mad dash for the top job has started within the deeply divided House Republican conference.\n\nAfter voting to abandon Jordan as their nominee by a vote of 112-86, GOP lawmakers headed home for the weekend to recuperate after a chaotic series of events on Capitol Hill. In the meantime, some Republicans immediately declared their candidacy.\n\nHouse Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y. on Sunday confirmed that nine Republicans will make their pitch to serve as leader in the lower chamber.\n\nHouse Republicans will hear from prospective speakers when they return to Washington for a candidate forum at 6:30 p.m. Monday.\n\nThe earliest the House could elect a new speaker is Tuesday.\n\nHere's what you need to know about who is running for speaker.\n\nTom Emmer\n\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., began making calls to run for speaker after Jordan's exit from the race, according to a source familiar.\n\nAs whip, Emmer is the No. 3 ranking House Republican. Ousted former speaker Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., endorsed the Minnesota Republican for the speakership in a huge boost for Emmer's candidacy. McCarthy still commands the respect of the vast majority of the House Republican conference.\n\n\"He is the right person for the job. He can unite the conference. He understands the dynamics of the conference. He also understands what it takes to win and keep a majority,\" McCarthy said to Punchbowl News.\n\nKevin Hern\n\nRep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., was one of the first candidates who jumped into the speaker's race, immediately announcing his candidacy to reporters after House Republicans dropped Jordan as their nominee.\n\n\"We need a different type of leader who has a proven track record of success, which is why I'm running for Speaker of the House,\" Hern said in a statement.\n\nThe Oklahoma Republican is chair of the Republican Study Committee, a caucus of around 170 GOP lawmakers making it the largest group of House Republicans.\n\nEarlier this month, Hern made calls to every single House Republican to gauge support for an earlier run but ultimately decided against it, declining to run against previous speaker nominees Jordan and House Majority Leader Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La.\n\nAustin Scott\n\nRep. Austin Scott, R-Ga., was a little-known lawmaker until earlier this month when he launched a surprise challenge to Jordan's speakership bid as a protest candidate against the conservative firebrand.\n\nScott ran against Jordan in an internal vote within the House Republican conference to select a nominee. Scott lost the nomination by a vote of 124-81. The Georgia Republican rallied behind Jordan after his loss but Jordan's exit, Scott immediately jumped back in the race.\n\n\"There's a lot of people that appreciated what we did,\" Scott told USA TODAY about his first speaker campaign.\n\nByron Donalds\n\nRep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., a member of the ultraconservative House Freedom Caucus, is running for speaker, according to a spokesperson from his office.\n\nDonalds has played a large role in key negotiations between moderate and ultraconservative GOP lawmakers. During Jordan's failed speaker elections, some GOP holdouts voted for Donalds as a protest candidate.\n\nJack Bergman\n\nAs it slowly became clear Jordan could not earn the support he needed in his quest for the speakership before he was dropped as the nominee, Rep. Jack Bergman, R-Mich., considered issuing a challenge to the Ohio Republican but did not follow through.\n\nWith Jordan out however, Bergman immediately jumped in the race announcing his candidacy.\n\n\"My hat is in the ring, and I feel confident I can win the votes where others could not. I have no special interests to serve; I’m only in this to do what's best for our Nation and to steady the ship for the 118th Congress,\" Bergman said in a statement.\n\nMike Johnson\n\nRep. Mike Johnson, R-La., vice chair of the House Republican conference, is also seeking the speakership.\n\nThe Louisiana Republican on Saturday released a letter confirming his bid and saying any leader must work to restore trust in Congress, work to grow a Republican majority and more.\n\n\"It is my greatest honor to serve with all of you in this decisive time, and I would be humbled to earn your support and, and by God's grace, lead our historic cause as your Speaker,\" he wrote, signing off the letter to his colleagues \"for freedom.\"\n\nPete Sessions\n\nRep. Pete Sessions, R-Texas, also launched a bid for speaker immediately following Jordan's exit.\n\n\"Congressman Sessions believes he can forge a positive path as a conservative leader who can unite the Conference,\" Sessions' office said in a statement.\n\nDan Meuser\n\nRep. Dan Meuser, R-Pa., also entered the race by Sunday's deadline for Republican candidates, Stefanik confirmed.\n\nBefore his official bid, Meuser shared on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, \"Should I decide to run for Speaker, my message will be focused on politics of inclusion.\"\n\n\"Every Member of the Republican Conference needs to be a part of policy making, legislation, and communications. That feeling of ownership builds a team culture, which is needed as we move our party forward,\" he added.\n\nGary Palmer\n\nRep. Gary Palmer, R-Ala., currently serves as the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, which makes him the No. 5 Republican in the House.\n\nHe also formally entered the speakership race by Sunday's deadline for lawmakers, according to Stefanik.\n\nPalmer previously supported Jordan to serve as speaker, but in the wake of McCarthy's ouster, he also immediately called on Republicans as a whole to come together. At the time, he shared in a post on X \"We have a job to do for the American people, and they deserve a unified majority focused on what's best for the nation.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/957339/dark-arts-and-dirty-tricks-how-tory-leadership-battle-descended-into", "title": "'Dark arts' and 'dirty tricks': how Tory leadership race became a mud ...", "text": "The race to replace Boris Johnson as Tory leader was turning acrimonious as the eight contenders prepared for the first-round vote today.\n\nThe Daily Mail said the contest had already become a “bitter mud-slinging battle”, with leadership hopeful Jeremy Hunt warning of the risk of recession if current favourite Rishi Sunak landed the top job.\n\nAnd Nadine Dorries accused Sunak’s camp of “dark arts” and “dirty tricks”. Dorries, who is backing Liz Truss, claimed Sunak had ensured Jeremy Hunt got the required 20 votes to remain in the leadership contest, because “polling suggests that Hunt would struggle to pick up the support of Tory members in a run-off” against the former chancellor, The Times reported.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

Sign up\n\nWestminster soap opera\n\nThe stories that emerge from Tory leadership elections are “part of Westminster folklore,” said Jon Craig, Sky News’s chief political correspondent. “These contests are top box office in the soap opera of British politics, with dirty tricks, plots, backstabbing, shocks and surprises.”\n\nDespite being the current favourite to win this leadership contest, Sunak should “beware”, said Craig: “front runners rarely win.” And while the former chancellor currently has some 45 MPs publicly declaring for him, that could all change come today’s first-round vote.\n\n“MPs often pledge support to one candidate and then vote another. Some pledge support to more than one candidate,” added Craig.\n\nRecession under Sunak, warns Hunt\n\nSpeaking to The Daily Telegraph yesterday, Sunak said he would model his premiership on Margaret Thatcher’s, as he described his economic vision as “common-sense Thatcherism”, and called for responsible tax cuts as he told his leadership rivals: “You have to earn what you spend.”\n\nAs the front-runner, Sunak is already taking flak from other leadership hopefuls, with Hunt, chair of the health select committee, warning that Sunak’s approach could lead the country into further economic woes.\n\nHunt told LBC Radio: “Rishi Sunak is… increasing corporation tax and it will be higher than not just America or Japan, but France and Germany as well.\n\n“And I’m worried that on our current trajectory, we’re heading into recession, and we’ll be there for too long,” he said. “I was very worried when he announced his budget… The thing that struck me was this slashing of the growth forecast for next year.”\n\n‘Dirty tricks’ and ‘dark arts’\n\nA further sign of how “ill-tempered” the leadership race has become is an accusation from the culture minister that Sunak’s campaign team had resorted to “dirty tricks” and “dark arts” to boost the former chancellor’s chances of winning the leadership race, said The Mail.\n\nThe Telegraph said that Dorries had “picked up on Twitter speculation”, leading her to accuse Sunak’s team of “lending votes” to Hunt so he could remain in the leadership contest – and ultimately giving Sunak a clearer run at becoming Conservative leader.\n\nDorries, a Johnson loyalist who is now backing Truss for prime minister tweeted last night: “This is dirty tricks/a stitch-up/dark arts. Take your pick. Team Rishi wants the candidate they know they can definitely beat in the final two and that is Jeremy Hunt.”\n\nThe claim has been denied by both Sunak and Hunt’s camps, with the latter telling the paper: “We are running completely independent campaigns. It’s a very dangerous game to play, and so I think most people would be very wary before doing that sort of thing. I’m not saying it never happens.”\n\nEight MPs have gone through to the first round proper of the leadership race.\n\nAlongside Sunak, Hunt and Truss, Penny Mordaunt, Tom Tugendhat, Nadhim Zahawi, Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch have secured the backing of at least 20 MPs.\n\nA first vote will begin at 1.30pm today with those who made the first ballot now looking to win backing from 30 MPs out of the 358 total to survive into the second round on Thursday.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "The Week Us", "The Week Uk", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "Harriet Marsden", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Rebecca Messina", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/07/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2024/01/09/iowa-caucuses-how-all-7-republican-candidates-could-succeed-or-fall-short-trump-desantis-haley/71919590007/", "title": "How each Republican candidate can win the Iowa Caucuses or fall ...", "text": "Iowa Republicans will caucus Jan. 15 to select their choice for a presidential nominee and kick off a contentious primary election calendar.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump, facing 91 criminal charges across four different cases, is waging an unprecedented campaign as the faraway front-runner.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis and former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, both former allies of Trump, have for weeks battled for second place, lobbing attacks at each other as they aim to position themselves as the leading alternative to Trump.\n\nAuthor and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy is running a near-nonstop campaign blitz focused on passing the baton to a younger leader of the party.\n\nAnd the remainder of the field — former Arkansas Gov.

Barring a late surge by a rival in the following early states, Trump rolls into New Hampshire and beyond looking like the all-but-assured nominee.\n\nHow he could fall short: The Trump campaign's turnout strategy flops, failing to turn out supporters in high numbers while the ground game of DeSantis or Haley or both pays off and accelerates them into competition.\n\nFailing to win the caucuses with such a significant polling lead just weeks out would be unprecedented, but even a close margin between Trump and one or both of his challengers could give them the momentum to pull off an upset in New Hampshire and turn the race upside down.\n\nA key number: 56%, the percentage of first-time caucusgoers who named Trump as their first-choice candidate in January's Iowa Poll. That's down from 63% in December, but still dwarfs the 13% support among first-time caucusgoers for DeSantis and 14% for Haley.\n\nRead more on Donald Trump:\n\nFormer UN Ambassador Nikki Haley\n\nWhere she stands: 20% first-choice support in January's Iowa Poll, second place.\n\nThe path to victory: A late winter surge continues for Haley through Caucus Day, separating her from a bitter back-and-forth with DeSantis and elevating her to a competitive position as the leading challenger to Trump.\n\nHaley's increasingly sharp attacks against DeSantis (and to a lesser extent, Trump), combined with a well-financed field operation courtesy of the Koch political network, allow her to push through criticisms from the right and prepare for New Hampshire, where recent polling has shown her chipping away at Trump's lead.\n\nHow she could fall short: The former ambassador and governor's pitch as the best option to beat President Joe Biden in the general election doesn't resonate with Iowans, and those not backing Trump instead flock to DeSantis.\n\nHaley will head to New Hampshire hoping that, in her words, which were quickly criticized by DeSantis, voters in that state \"correct\" Iowans' decision.\n\nA key number: $24 million, how much Haley's campaign said they fundraised in the last three months of 2023. It's more than double what she raised in any other quarter thus far in the campaign, a sign that her campaign has seen a boost in national attention and an indication that she aims to stick around regardless of Iowa's results.\n\nRead more on Nikki Haley:\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis\n\nWhere he stands: 16% first-choice support in January's Iowa Poll, third place.\n\nThe path to victory: DeSantis' laser focus on Iowa pays off — harnessing a massive super PAC organizing effort and connections with evangelical leaders to surge late and emerge as the Trump alternative of choice.\n\nHis ability to earn the support of some of Iowa's most prominent conservative leaders — Gov. Kim Reynolds, Family Leader CEO Bob Vander Plaats, radio host Steve Deace and others — and a near-constant campaign with visits to all 99 counties provide the last-minute break from the pack the governor has been seeking for months.\n\nHow he could fall short: DeSantis' struggle to gain traction in Iowa continues until the very end, with the support from state GOP leaders and ample spending failing to result in a competitive finish.\n\nFueled by a bump of national interest over the winter, Haley instead cements herself as the leading alternative to Trump, and DeSantis' lack of significant investment in future states makes a path to the nomination difficult.\n\nA key number: 812,000, how many homes in Iowa the pro-DeSantis super PAC says it had knocked doors on as of late December.

New race ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – House Republicans dropped Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, as their speaker nominee Friday, throwing the House into even more chaos and turmoil as GOP lawmakers must scramble to find a new candidate to unite behind.\n\nFollowing three failed speaker elections, House Republicans held an internal secret ballot vote to decide whether Jordan should remain as the conference’s nominee. Jordan was ultimately dropped as the nominee by a vote of 112-86.\n\nHouse Republicans will head home for the weekend and return to Washington to hold a candidate forum on Monday evening to hear from prospective speakers.

Steve Womack, R-Ark., told reporters.\n\nJordan lost an internal secret ballot vote to determine whether he should remain as the nominee by a vote of 112-86, according to Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky.\n\nAccording to Womack, lawmakers are heading home for the weekend.\n\nThe House will return into session next Monday at 6:30 p.m.\n\nCandidates have until noon on Sunday to declare their intentions to run for speaker.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nInternal GOP vote exclusively about Jordan\n\nThe internal vote on whether to keep Jordan as the GOP speaker nominee is a secret ballot vote according to Rep.

Ken Buck, R-Colo.\n\nThe letter originally included Buck but after the Colorado Republican noticed his signature, the letter removed Buck's name.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., one of the lawmakers who voted to remove McCarthy said it was \"some miscommunication I guess.\"− Ken Tran\n\nHouse Republicans are meeting behind closed-doors\n\nFollowing Jordan's third defeat, House Republicans are huddling behind closed doors at 1 p.m. Friday.\n\n−Ken Tran\n\n8 GOP lawmakers who voted against McCarthy offer to be 'punished'\n\nSpeaking on the Capitol steps, five of the eight GOP lawmakers who voted to oust McCarthy said the eight are offering to be punished by the rest of the House GOP conference if it would placate Jordan's holdouts.\n\nReps Eli Crane, R-Ariz., Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., Bob Good, R-Va., Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., and Nancy Mace, R-S.C., said they would accept any consequences for voting to remove McCarthy.\n\nThose consequences could include removal of committee assignments, censures and/or removal from conference.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nJordan loses third vote for House speaker\n\nJordan lost the third speaker vote, failing to garner enough support behind him and only losing more support among House Republicans.\n\nLike with the second ballot, his detractors only grew in numbers − this time to 25 − making Jordan’s path to the speakership more uncertain.\n\nIt is unclear if a fourth vote will be held and whether lawmakers will stay in session through the weekend.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHere are the 25 GOP lawmakers who voted against Jordan\n\nSome 25 GOP lawmakers voted against Jordan as speaker. Three of those votes against Jordan are new holdouts who previously supported the Ohio Republican. The 25 are:\n\nRep. Don Bacon, R-Neb.\n\nRep. Vern Buchanan, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Ken Buck, R-Colo.\n\nRep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, R-Ore.\n\nRep. Anthony D’Esposito, R-N.Y.\n\nRep. Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla.\n\nRep. Jake Ellzey, R-Texas\n\nRep. Drew Ferguson, R-Ga.\n\nRep.

Steve Womack, R-Ark.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWho are the new GOP lawmakers who flipped against Jordan?\n\nJordan lost even more support on the third ballot, with three new lawmakers opting to support another candidate after initially voting for him before. They are:\n\nRep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa.\n\nRep. Tom Kean, R-N.J.\n\nRep. Marc Molinaro, R-N.Y.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJordan on track to lose third vote\n\nThe House vote is ongoing, but Jordan is on track to lose a third time.\n\nHe has lost 25 votes so far, which is more than the 22 votes he lost in the second vote and 20 votes he lost in the first vote.\n\n− Candy Woodall\n\nClark nominates Jeffries for speaker\n\nHouse Minority Whip Rep. Katherine Clark, D-Mass., nominated Jeffries for the speakership on behalf of House Democrats. He's earned the most votes this week, but not enough to clinch the win.\n\nClark took aim at Jordan's legislative record, saying the Ohio Republican supports cutting Social Security and Medicare and noting the Ohio Republican has never voted for a farm bill.\n\nJordan, she added, is a \"true threat to our democracy and our Constitution,\" for his vote against certifying Biden's victory in the 2020 election.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nMcCarthy: Jim Jordan is a leader, a listener and a fighter\n\nIn another historic moment in the House, ousted former Speaker Kevin McCarthy nominated Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, as the representative to succeed him.\n\n\"Being the speaker is not an easy job, but especially in this conference,\" McCarthy said to a few laughs and light applause.\n\nBut Jordan is the representative for the job, he said.\n\n\"Jim Jordan is a leader, a listener and a fighter,\" McCarthy said.\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nMcCarthy defends how many bills Jordan has passed\n\nMcCarthy sought to defend the Jordan from Democratic arguments that the Ohio Republican has never passed one of his own bills with his name attached to it.\n\nThe former speaker called Jordan an \"effective legislator\" and \"selfless,\" drawing laughter and jeers from Democrats.\n\nMcCarthy also took aim at House Democrats, singling out Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Calif., for passing only one bill with his name on it, garnering applause from Republicans.\n\nBut in a display of Jordan's uphill battle towards becoming speaker, several GOP lawmakers, including Jordan's holdouts, remained seated even as the majority of the conference gave a standing ovation for McCarthy.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nJeffries: 'Jim Jordan is a clear and present danger to our democracy'\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries unloaded on the \"national nightmare\" he says his colleagues across the aisle have created in 17 days without a House speaker.\n\nThe GOP nominee who has lost the vote twice, Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, is a threat to the nation, according to Jeffries.\n\n\"Jim Jordan is a clear and present danger to our democracy,\" Jeffries said to reporters Friday morning at the Capitol.\n\nThe Democratic leader then rattled off his list of reasons, saying Jordan is a 2020 election denier and \"the poster child for MAGA extremism,\" who wants an abortion ban and to cut Social Security and Medicare.\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nJordan declines to say whether 2020 election was stolen\n\nJordan, when asked whether he thought the 2020 election was stolen, gave a non-committal answer and said he thought “there were all kinds of problems with the 2020 election.”\n\nOne of Jordan’s holdouts, Rep. Ken Buck, R-Colo., is refusing to support the Ohio Republican for speaker until he acknowledges former President Donald Trump lost in 2020.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nDemocratic leaders consider empowering a temporary speaker\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries said he hasn't met with acting speaker Patrick McHenry, but he and other Democratic leaders are open to the idea of empowering him to do the House's business.\n\n\"All options are on the table to get the House back open,\" Jeffries said, responding to a question about whether his caucus would support a plan to empower a speaker pro tempore.\n\nMcHenry has limited powers as interim speaker. It would take a majority of the House and some Democratic votes to give him expanded powers to do things like passing an aid package to Israel or negotiating to avoid a shutdown.\n\nDemocratic Whip Katherine Clark said bipartisanship is the only path forward.\n\n\"Come together,\" she said to Republicans. \"You are weakening this country, you are weakening this institution.\"\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nJim Jordan press conference today: He's not dropping out\n\nFrom his bully pulpit as chair of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, which has spent most of its time this session trying to impeach Biden, Jordan held a press conference at 8 a.m. to try and attract more support for his speaker bid.\n\nJordan said he was not backing down in his pursuit of the speakership, even as his opposition threatens to grow.\n\n\"We can't open the House without a speaker.\"\n\n−Candy Woodall and Ken Tran\n\nCrenshaw says ‘votes aren’t changing’ for Jordan\n\nLeaving a meeting held by the Texas GOP delegation, Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, told reporters the “vote’s aren’t changing” for Jordan ahead of a third speaker election that Jordan is expected to lose.\n\nWhether Jordan should drop out, Crenshaw said, is ultimately the Ohio Republican’s decision, but there’s a “growing sense” that House Republicans will have to find a new candidate to rally behind “quite soon.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nGOP lawmaker is slightly more optimistic about electing a new speaker… slightly\n\nRep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., told reporters last week he put the odds of the House electing a new speaker by last Friday at 2%.\n\nThis time around, with Jordan as the speaker nominee, he’s feeling a little more optimistic about electing a new speaker by the end of the day: he’s putting the odds at 30%.\n\n“It still isn’t 50%,” Massie quipped.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWill House stay in session this weekend to elect a speaker?\n\nJordan and his allies have hinted on social media and during a press conference Friday that the House will not take the weekend off if there's no speaker.\n\nThe House Judiciary chair said during his news conference today he hopes the lower chamber will elect a new speaker \"this weekend,\" suggesting there could be more elections to come.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhat happened to the speaker of the House?\n\nThe House has been without a speaker since Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was removed from the position more than two weeks ago.\n\nIn a move led by conservative firebrand Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., eight Republicans were joined by House Democrats in a vote to oust him. Gaetz and a handful of hardliners were angry with McCarthy for striking a bipartisan compromise to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nMcCarthy's nine-month speakership started in turmoil, outlasting 15 historic rounds of voting to be elected in January. To get the gavel, he made several concessions, including a rule allowing any one member to call for the vote to remove McCarthy.\n\nGaetz used that rule to remove McCarthy from the top position in the House with no viable plan to replace him.\n\n−Candy Woodall\n\nHouse without a speaker: Will Jordan lose again?\n\nWithout a speaker, the House has been in a state of paralysis, unable to pass any legislation. Lawmakers in the lower chamber can't take up crucial funding to avoid a government shutdown or approve aid to Israel as the war with Hamas continues.\n\nRepublicans appeared close to finally getting the House moving again Wednesday morning, as they considered temporarily empowering Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., as an interim speaker. But those plans fell through amidst wide-ranging disagreements within the GOP conference.\n\nJordan is expected to lose his third speaker election, and it is unclear whether he will drop out of the race.\n\n−Ken Tran\n\nBiden’s foreign aid package can’t pass House without a speaker\n\nBiden’s request for foreign aid to Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and the U.S.-Mexico border, which totals almost $100 billion, is unable to pass the House without a speaker.\n\nThe House, which is in its 17th day without a speaker, has been unable to take any legislative action. There is a sense of urgency to elect a new speaker among lawmakers so the House can pass a foreign aid package for Israel, a key U.S. ally, but House Republicans have been unable to coalesce behind a speaker despite the calls for decisive action.\n\n− Ken Tran\n\nWhat was the plan to empower McHenry?\n\nHouse Republicans huddled behind closed doors for over three hours to discuss a resolution from Rep. Dave Joyce, R-Ohio, that would have temporarily empowered McHenry as an interim speaker to get the House moving again.\n\nThe move would have allowed Jordan to continue building support for his speakership bid on the sidelines while the House works on crucial legislation to avert a government shutdown and address the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nBut the plans ultimately fell through as it became apparent a sizable number of members opposed the path. Rep. Jim Banks, R-Ind., who was critical of the resolution, estimated half of House Republicans were against empowering McHenry.\n\n– Ken Tran", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/20"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/955210/next-tory-leader-odds-the-favourites-to-replace-liz-truss/sajid-javid-the-rags-to-riches-to-politics-tory-leader-contender", "title": "Who is Sajid Javid?

Abdul gained employment in Rochdale, where Javid was born, as a cotton mill worker and then a bus conductor, before the family moved to Bristol.\n\nThe future politician and his four brothers were raised in a two-bed flat on Bristol's Stapleton Road, which Javid would later describe as Britain’s “most dangerous road”. It was there that his mother, Zubaida, ran a market stall selling handmade clothes before opening up her own shop.\n\nJavid attended a comprehensive school in Bristol, and told the Evening Standard in 2012 that “some people, in a friendly way, tried to lower my expectations”. Undeterred, Javid rejected the suggestion that he become a “TV repair man” and instead pursued his goal to work in the City, said the BBC. His interest in financial markets was “sparked by the Thatcher government’s privatisations”, and he reportedly became a “regular reader” of the Financial Times as a teenager.\n\nJavid was the first person in his family to go to university. He studied economics and politics at Exeter University, and met his future wife, Laura, at 18-years-old, while the pair were both working summer jobs at Commercial Union. They now have four children together.\n\nJavid has been described by Politico’s Jack Blanchard as having “fought his way up from the toughest streets in England to earn £3-million-a-year at Deutsche Bank”. After graduating, he moved to America and by 25-years-old, he had become vice-president at Chase Manhattan Bank.\n\nHe later moved to Singapore while working with Deutsche Bank, where he became managing director before he left finance for politics in 2010 – “a move which reportedly saw him take a 98% pay cut”, said Akhtar.\n\nJavid’s parliamentary career\n\nThe politician was a supporter of the Conservative Party from the early 1980s. “Despite being diehard fans of Margaret Thatcher”, he and fellow Tory MP Robert Halfon “got in a bit of trouble” at the 1990 party conference when they distributed leaflets opposing the then prime minister’s decision to join Exchange Rate Mechanism, said the BBC.\n\nTwenty years later, he was first elected to parliament. He became MP for Bromsgrove in 2010, and began his ministerial career with roles in the Treasury. He became culture secretary in 2014, and was the first person of colour to hold “one of the ‘Great Offices of State’”, said Politics.co.uk.\n\n“It was a surprise to many” that Javid called for the UK to remain in the European Union in 2016. He was “on the losing side” of the referendum, and “there was an ill-fated and very short-lived bid to succeed David Cameron” on a “joint ticket” with Stephen Crabb, said the BBC.\n\nTwo years later, Javid “put his head above the parapet during the Windrush scandal to say ‘it could have been me’”, reported the Evening Standard at the time. He succeeded Amber Rudd as home secretary following the scandal, appointed by then prime minister Theresa May, before running for the Tory party leadership in 2019. Javid came in fourth behind runners-up Jeremy Hunt and Michael Gove, and was promoted to chancellor by the contest’s victor, Boris Johnson.\n\n“His appointment is set to herald a significant fiscal loosening”, said the Financial Times at the time. He is “the ideal chancellor for creating the magic money trees we were told we were told didn’t exist”, said James Moore in The Independent. But he would hold the position for just six months. Javid resigned in February 2020 following tensions between himself and Johnson’s then-adviser Dominic Cummings. He returned to the backbenches, and took up a role at financial giant JPMorgan.\n\nJavid was appointed health secretary in June last year following the resignaton of Matt Hancock over a breach of Covid restrictions, giving up his financial pursuits in doing so. He resigned from the cabinet on Tuesday evening, and delivered a personal statement at Prime Minister’s Questions the following day in which he made apparent that he believed other ministers should follow his example.\n\nLeadership chances\n\nJavid and Rishi Sunak are among “the favourites” in the “leadership jostling”, said The Guardian. Javid “bolstered his credentials as a candidate” on Tuesday by resigning minutes before the chancellor, who could be his fiercest competition.\n\nThe MP for Bromsgrove “made an early start” in the contest when he “set out his stall to Conservative MPs” in his resignation speech in the House of Commons the following day, said the i news site. He described himself as a “team player” and said he would “never risk losing my integrity” during his parliamentary career.\n\nThe Guardian reported that MPs believe Javid is “the most organised in terms of having a team and an offering”. And though he falls slightly behind Sunak in public popularity, according to YouGov data, his constituents believe he could “do the right thing for the country”, as one Bromsgrove local told the BBC yesterday.", "authors": ["Julia O'Driscoll", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "The Week Staff", "Richard Windsor", "Felix Bischof", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "The Week Us", "Harriet Marsden"], "publish_date": "2019/07/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/12/04/haley-desantis-gop-debate-alabama/71756269007/", "title": "Haley surges as GOP contenders take the debate stage Wednesday ...", "text": "As 2023 comes to a close, the Republican presidential primary is coming into sharper focus and the field continues to shrink ahead of the Iowa caucuses.\n\nSen. Tim Scott's sudden departure days after the third debate has many given many conservative voters and donors reason to kick the tires on Nikki Haley's candidacy.\n\nHeading into the fourth GOP debate on Wednesday, the former South Carolina governor has qualified to make the stage as she appears to be the new chief rival to Donald Trump.\n\nThe Haley campaign dropped its first TV ad of the 2024 cycle on Friday, which alludes to the former president and current Republican frontrunner's political baggage.\n\n\"It’s time for a new generation of conservative leadership,\" Haley says while looking at the camera.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBut she won't be alone on stage this week in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, as other contenders remain in the race and vie to make their case before a national audience. Trump has skipped every GOP primary debate.\n\nHere's what to watch from those who make the Wednesday debate stage.\n\nNikki Haley\n\nIt's been all good news for the former UN ambassador since the last debate−and she knows it, as her team flexes their momentum.\n\nHaley last week received an endorsement from the conservative-leaning Koch political network, which is coveted in the GOP world and bound to give her a boost.\n\nNational surveys show her running in second place in the early states, including a 20% hold in a CNN/University of New Hampshire poll in November. She appears to be winning over Trump-averse Republicans fed up with the former president's antics, but her old boss still remains in a comfortable lead.\n\nHaley will likely continue to lean into her foreign policy chops to underscore how she is ready for the presidency. Also expect her to bring up President Joe Biden and emphasize polls that show her besting the incumbent in a hypothetical race.\n\nHaley's surrogates, meanwhile, are trying to poke holes in the perception of Trump's inevitability.\n\n\"Don’t look at the person you think is going to win,\" Marlys Popma, a former executive director of the Iowa Republican Party, said in a telephone town hall last month. \"Look at the person who you think is going to be the best for the country.\"\n\nRon DeSantis\n\nFlorida’s governor may no longer be considered Trump’s chief rival, but he hasn’t been sitting idly since the last debate in Miami.\n\nDeSantis received an endorsement from Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and Bob Vander Plaats, an influential evangelical leader in the Hawkeye State, where he is tied for second and attracting significant resources.\n\nWhen DeSantis first entered the race, he spotlighted his culture war battles with Democrats. Since slipping in contention, he has focused more on his record in Florida.\n\nThat might explain why DeSantis decided to debate California Gov. Gavin Newsom in an attempt to further contrast with how Democrats run government.\n\nWithout Trump as a foil to confront, many expect him to go after Haley more directly as the two have been throwing jabs.

He also won't let up on criticizing the RNC and calling on Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel to resign.\n\n\"The Republican establishment has made us a party of losers,\" he said in a Nov. 30 post on X, formerly Twitter. \"Where is the accountability for years of losing: 2018, 2020, 2022 and now 2023? Grassroots conservatives across the nation are joining me to end the culture of surrender and losing.\"\n\nGoing into Wednesday's conversation, it will be interesting to see if Ramaswamy finds a way to distinguish himself from Trump after spending months casting himself as the 2.0 upgrade.\n\nA bulk of those voters seem committed to the original, including Ramaswamy's political director who last week ditched him for the Trump campaign.\n\nChris Christie\n\nThe first order of business for New Jersey's former governor is making the debate stage by meeting the RNC's required thresholds.\n\nChristie must get at least 6% in two national polls that fulfill the party's requirements, which might explain in part why he has joined Ramaswamy in criticizing the committee for blocking unsanctioned conversations between the candidates.\n\nThat hasn't stopped him from framing this election as a referendum on Trump, saying the former president's ascension as the 2024 nominee would amount to a \"death sentence\" for Republicans.\n\nIn recent days, however, Christie has tried to play nice with Trump's voters who, like him, might regret their previous support.\n\n\"I have no issue with people who have voted for Trump. I supported him, and I was wrong,\" Christie said in a Nov. 30 post on X.\n\nThat could signal a possible pivot should he be allowed to join the other presidential contenders.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2022/07/20/sunak-truss-runoff-british-prime-minister/10107973002/", "title": "UK conservatives narrow leadership race to Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss", "text": "Jill Lawless\n\nAssociated Press\n\nLONDON — Britain's Conservative Party chose former Treasury chief Rishi Sunak and Foreign Secretary Liz Truss — a fiscal moderate and a low-tax crusader — as the two finalists in an election to replace departing Prime Minister Boris Johnson. The result came on the day the divisive, unrepentant Johnson ended his final appearance in Parliament as prime minister with the words \"Hasta la vista, baby.\"\n\nSunak and Truss came first and second respectively in a secret vote by Conservative lawmakers. Trade Minister Penny Mordaunt came in third and was eliminated.\n\nThe race, which has already produced bitter Conservative infighting, pits Sunak, who steered Britain's economy through the pandemic before quitting Johnson's government this month, against Truss, who has led the U.K.'s response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe two contenders will spend the next few weeks campaigning for the votes of about 180,000 Conservative Party members around the country, who will vote by postal or online ballot. The winner of the party leadership vote will be announced Sept. 5 and will automatically become Britain's next prime minister.\n\nSunak won all four rounds of elimination votes by lawmakers, but is less popular with the party's grassroots, partly because of his previous job as Britain's chief taxman.\n\nTruss, who has taken a tough line against Russian President Vladimir Putin — and with the European Union — is a favorite of the Conservatives' right-wing.\n\nTruss said if she becomes prime minister, \"I would hit the ground running from day one, unite the party and govern in line with Conservative values.\"\n\nSunak's campaign said, \"the choice for members is very simple: who is the best person to beat Labour at the next election? The evidence shows that's Rishi.\"\n\nThe winner of the Tory contest will not have to face Britain's general electorate until 2024, unless they choose to call an early general election.\n\nThe campaign has already exposed deep divisions in the Conservative Party at the end of Johnson's scandal-tarnished three-year reign. Truss has branded Sunak a \"socialist\" for raising taxes in response to the economic damage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Sunak has hit back, saying that rivals including Truss were peddling economic \"fairy tales\" to British voters as the country faces soaring inflation and economic turbulence.\n\nJohnson allies have been accused of lobbying against Sunak, whose resignation helped bring the prime minister down, and in favor of Truss, who remained loyal. That impression was cemented Wednesday when Johnson said his advice to his successor would be not always to listen to the Treasury.\n\nAll the contenders —- there were 11 to start — sought to distance themselves from Johnson, whose term in office began boldly in 2019 with a vow to \"get Brexit done\" and a resounding election victory, but is now ending in disgrace.\n\nJohnson quit July 7 after months of ethics scandals but remains caretaker leader until the party elects his successor.\n\nOn Wednesday, he faced derisive opposition politicians and weary Conservatives at his last Prime Minister's Questions session in the House of Commons, which adjourns for the summer on Thursday.\n\nIt was a downbeat departure, with supportive Conservative lawmakers lobbing praise and opposition politicians offering variations on \"good riddance.\"\n\nJohnson extolled what he called his accomplishments — leading Britain out of the European Union and through COVID-19, and supporting Ukraine against Russia's invasion — and declared: \"Mission largely accomplished, for now,\" before departing with Arnold Schwarzenegger's \"hasta la vista\" catchphrase from \"Terminator 2.\"\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said: \"I will miss the delusion.\"\n\nJohnson clung to office through months of scandals over his finances and his judgment, refusing to resign when he was fined by police over government parties that broke COVID-19 lockdown rules. He finally quit after one scandal too many — appointing a politician accused of sexual misconduct — drove his ministers to resign en masse.\n\nDespite remaining prime minister, he has largely disappeared from the scene, even as Britain faces a summer cost-of-living crisis and labor discontent as inflation hits 9.4%.\n\nJohnson did not attend any government emergency meetings about the heat wave that brought record temperatures of 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) to Britain this week. Last week he took a ride in a Royal Air Force Typhoon fighter jet, with \"Top Gun\"-style footage released by his office, then threw a weekend party at Chequers, the country house that comes with the prime minister's job.\n\nLondon Mayor Sadiq Khan accused Johnson of wanting to \"become Tom Cruise\" and urged him to resign immediately.\n\n\"We need a full-time prime minister looking after our country rather than somebody who's checked out,\" Khan said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/21/joe-biden-drops-out/74255359007/", "title": "Biden drops out of 2024 election, endorses Harris: Recap", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news of Joe Biden stepping aside from his 2024 presidential campaign on Sunday, July 21. For the latest news on Kamala Harris' efforts to secure the Democratic nomination, follow our live election updates for Monday, July 22.\n\nWASHINGTON − President Joe Biden said Sunday he is ending his bid for reelection amid intense pressure from Democratic leaders sounding the alarm that his path to beat former President Donald Trump in November had vanished.\n\nThe president's historic withdrawal throws the 2024 race − already roiled by a shocking attempt on Trump's life − into uncertain territory, with Vice President Kamala Harris widely seen as the Democrat most likely to take Biden's place atop the party's ticket.\n\nBiden made the announcement from his home in Rehoboth Beach, Del., where he's self-isolated since testing positive for COVID-19 Thursday night.\n\nBiden quickly endorsed Harris as the Democratic nominee in a separate statement on X. Harris responded that she's honored to have Biden's endorsement, and her \"intention is to earn and win this nomination.\" The president and vice president spoke several times on Sunday morning ahead of his announcement.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nBiden said he would speak to the nation later this week to provide more details about his decision.\n\n\"It has been the greatest honor of my life to serve as your President,\" Biden said in a letter addressed to Americans. \"And while it has been my intention to seek reelection, I believe it is in the best interest of my party and my country for me to stand down and to focus solely on my duties as President for the rest of my term.\"\n\nIn his statement, Biden reflected fondly on his four years in office, saying the U.S. has built the “strongest economy in the world” while touting efforts to lower prescription drug prices, expand health care, tackle climate change and appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson.\n\nThe decision upends the 2024 campaign 107 days before Election Day, with Democratic National Committee members now tasked with choosing an alternative nominee to take on Trump, whose polling lead has swelled while Democrats have fought internally.\n\nBiden's departure will soon mean the end of a five-decade career in Washington that began in 1972 with an upset victory for U.S. Senate in Delaware. He served as a senator for 36 years, then as Obama's vice president from 2009 to 2017. Biden returned to public life to run against Trump in the 2020 presidential election. He framed the race as a \"battle for the soul of the nation\" and defeated Trump 51%-47% in the popular vote.\n\nIt marks an extraordinary turn for Biden, who for three weeks remained defiant in the face of growing calls from Democratic lawmakers that he withdraw after a disastrous June 27 debate with Trump raised scrutiny over the president's mental fitness.\n\nKeep up with the USA TODAY Network's live updates.\n\nLouisiana Democratic delegation endorses Harris\n\nWhile President Biden's delegates at the upcoming Democratic National Convention are not formally obligated to follow his lead and back Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement at the top of the ticket, the Louisiana delegation is already onboard.\n\n\"This evening, the LA delegation to the @DemConvention met virtually, and by an overwhelming majority vote, officially endorsed Vice President @KamalaHarris to be our 2024 Democratic Presidential Nominee,\" the state party reported on X.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nCongressional Hispanic Caucus BOLD PAC endorses Harris\n\nIn a sign of coalescing Democratic Party unity around Harris, the campaign arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, BOLD PAC, announced Sunday night that it is endorsing President Biden's chosen successor.\n\nJust a few days ago, BOLD PAC stood squarely behind Biden amid growing calls for him to drop out.\n\n\"President Biden's tenure will be remembered for his accomplishments that stand among the best in history,” said BOLD PAC Chair Rep. Linda Sánchez, D-Calif., in the statement Sunday.\n\n\"As we look ahead, we know that these accomplishments would not have been possible without Vice President Kamala Harris and CHC BOLD PAC is proud to endorse her for president. This administration has led with working families in mind and shown an unwavering commitment to Latinos. There is so much work left to do and the stakes couldn’t be higher. Make no mistake, Latinos nationwide will bear the brunt of the consequences of a Trump second presidency, just like they did in the past. BOLD PAC will remain laser focused on doing what it takes to ensure that Trump remains a one-term president. Vice President Harris is the leader we stand behind at this critical moment.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nHow Harris would run against Trump\n\nA campaign ad from Harris' 2020 Democratic presidential primary campaign sheds light on how she might run against Trump if she becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\nThe ad, which was shared Sunday afternoon by a pro-Harris account on X, characterizes Harris as the antidote to Trump. It leans heavily on her work as a prosecutor and contrasts that record with Trump's alleged misdeeds.\n\n\"She prosecuted sex predators, he is one,\" the narrator notes, followed by the recording of Trump's crudely phrased statement that he grabs women by their genitals.\n\nThe ad goes on to draw similar comparisons. Whereas Harris prosecuted for-profit colleges that swindled students, Trump ran a for-profit university that was sued by former students who said they were misled by false claims. Trump agreed to a $25 million settlement\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nDemocrats raise nearly $50 million online since Biden’s exit\n\nDemocrats have raised nearly $50 million online since President Joe Biden announced his decision on Sunday to drop out of the 2024 race and endorse Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee.\n\nActBlue, the leading site processing Democratic donations, said as of 9 p.m. ET it has raised $46.7 million from supporters, making Sunday its biggest fundraising day of the 2024 election cycle.\n\nMost of the Democratic Party has coalesced quickly around Harris as the nominee, making her the strong favorite to take on Trump in November.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Manchin is considering seeking Democratic nomination\n\nSen Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., is considering switching his party affiliation from independent to Democratic to seek the party's presidential nomination after President Joe Biden announced Sunday that he will exit the 2024 race, according to Manchin's adviser Jonathan Kott.\n\nHe is the first Democrat to openly consider challenging Vice President Kamala Harris for the nomination. Manchin, 76, previously flirted with the idea of launching an independent campaign for the presidency, and at one point even floated appearing on a ballot with Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, but decided not to in mid-February.\n\nManchin is unlikely to receive much support from Democrats, given his record of bucking some of the party’s major legislative proposals and his decision to register as an independent in May.\n\n-Karissa Waddick\n\nHarris makes the rounds\n\nVice President Kamala Harris spent her afternoon working the phones, calling Democratic Party leaders and members of Congress as she sought to quickly coalesce lawmakers and potential competitors around her candidacy. Among the Democratic officials she spoke to were Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a rising star in the party who leads a must-win battleground state, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries and Congressional Black Caucus Chair Steven Horsford, according to a source familiar.\n\nHarris has plans to be in Milwaukee on Tuesday and Indianapolis on Wednesday at previously scheduled events. It was not immediately clear when she planned to hold her first campaign event after Biden's surprise dropout and endorsement on Sunday.\n\n-Francesca Chambers\n\nAOC endorses Harris for Democratic nomination\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., a key progressive Democrat, endorsed Harris for the Democratic nomination Sunday night as Harris continues to coalesces most of the Democratic Party around her bid.\n\n“Kamala Harris will be the next President of the United States. I pledge my full support to ensure her victory in November,” Ocasio-Cortez said in a statement on X.\n\n“Now more than ever, it is crucial that our party and country swiftly unite to defeat Donald Trump and the threat to American democracy. Let’s get to work.”\n\nWhile 35 congressional Democrats publicly called for Biden to end his campaign prior to his announcement, Ocasio-Cortez was among those who remained behind the president.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nTrump raises questions about the next debate\n\nIs Trump laying the groundwork to forgo a debate against Harris (or any other Democrat)?\n\nIn a Truth Social post late Sunday, Trump noted that his Sept. 10 debate with Biden \"was slated to be broadcast\" on ABC.\n\n\"Now that Joe has, not surprisingly, has quit the race, I think the Debate, with whomever the Radical Left Democrats choose, should be held on FoxNews, rather than very biased ABC.\"\n\nIn an interview with CBS News, Trump gave a somewhat equivocal answer to the debate question: \"I don’t know who I'm going to debate. So far, we haven’t determined who is going to be on that side. But I think whoever it is, I’d like to debate. Yeah, sure.\"\n\n-David Jackson\n\nTennessee Democrats become first delegation to formally endorse Harris for president\n\nTennessee’s 77 Democratic delegates voted by conference call Sunday afternoon to formally endorse Vice President Kamala Harris for the Democratic nomination, becoming the first delegates previously pledged to Biden in any state to formally back her.\n\nThe decision comes as much of the Democratic establishment, including former President Joe Biden, has quickly coalesced behind Harris following Biden’s announcement to end his 2024 campaign.\n\n“It’s very compelling to me that the president decided not to run and to endorse her,” Chip Forrester, one of the Tennessee delegates, told USA TODAY. “He has worked with her for four years. He chose her as his running mate four years ago. For the president to have that kind of confidence is important to me.”\n\nForrester said Harris also holds as strong “strategic position” because she will inherit Biden’s $240 million cash on hand that his campaign reported at the end of June.\n\nThe Harris campaign took over the Biden campaign committee following Biden’s announcement to drop out.\n\n-- Joey Garrison and Melissa Brown\n\nPotential lawsuits to keep Biden as Democratic nominee would be fruitless: election experts\n\nRepublicans argued Democrats will be ignoring 14 million voters who supported President Joe Biden in the primaries after he declined to become the nominee, but election experts said Sunday that potential lawsuits aiming to keep Biden as the nominee would be fruitless.\n\n“Democrat party bosses just proved that they have absolutely no respect for their own voters,”House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said in a statement. “After lecturing others about democracy, they just forced Joe Biden off the ticket, trashing the primary choice of 14 million of their own voters.”\n\nBut David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced election laws and is now executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said potential lawsuits from Republicans or allies of former President Donald Trump couldn’t force the Democratic Party to stick with Biden because parties choose their own nominees.\n\n“These claims are less than frivolous,” Becker said. “That would not succeed and will not succeed in any state.”\n\nBiden was not yet the Democratic nominee because the party has not yet held its convention scheduled for late August. The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in March that Colorado election officials couldn’t keep Trump off the state’s primary ballot because allowing states to set qualifications for federal office would lead to “chaos.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Who will be Kamala Harris' VP? Here's the possible contenders.\n\nJohn Kerry supports Kamala Harris as party’s next nominee\n\nJohn Kerry, former Secretary of State under the Obama administration, in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, indicated he will join in on supporting Vice President Kamala Harris as the party’s next nominee.\n\n“President Biden deserves the gratitude of every American for his extraordinary presidency…I know how difficult today’s selfless decision must have been for someone who spent his entire life in service to country,” he said.\n\nHe added that “now is the time to listen to the only person who has ever beaten Donald Trump, and join with President Biden in every effort to make Vice President Harris the next President of the United States.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nElection expert says no way to hold more Democratic presidential primaries\n\nDavid Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer who enforced elections law and who now advises state and local officials who conduct elections, slammed the door Sunday on the potential for holding more presidential primaries before the Democratic National Convention in late August, calling it a “fantasy.”\n\nPresident Joe Biden was the presumptive Democratic nominee after winning state primaries. Some political analysts, such as GOP podcaster Mike Murphy, have suggested Vice President Kamala Harris would be a stronger nominee if she beat potential rivals in a new set of primaries.\n\n“She needs to become a winner, which means winning a nomination process,” Murphy wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “That would give her a lot more strength coming out of the convention.”\n\nBut Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said states such as Arizona and Florida are still holding local primaries into September, so there is no way election officials could create a new set of primaries within days or weeks.\n\n“The idea that election officials who are already running elections could somehow put together a snap primary in days, and voters would know what to do and where to show up and to cast ballots for candidates we can’t even imagine who might be running is fantasy. There is no feasible way to hold any kind of primaries right now,” said Becker, who is also executive director of the Election Official Legal Defense Network. “There is no way to do open primaries.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nLaPhonza Butler, only Black woman serving in U.S. Senate, backs Harris\n\nCalifornia’s Laphonza Butler, the only Black woman serving in the U.S. Senate, applauded Biden’s service and urged support for Harris. Butler was tapped to serve in the seat when Biden picked Harris for his running mate.\n\n“The threat to all that progress remains, and we must now do everything we can to ensure Vice President Harris succeeds,’’ Butler, the first woman of color to head EMILY's List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, said in a statement. “There's no one better prepared for this challenge.’’\n\nHarris, the daughter of an Indian mother and Jamaican father, was the second Black woman to serve in the U.S. Senate. Others vying to make similar history praised Harris’ bid for president.\n\nAngela Alsobrooks, a Democrat and a Black woman running for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, said she is 100% behind Harris.\n\n“She will provide a clear and stark contrast to the regressive vision Donald Trump has for this country,’’ she said in a statement. “She will make this race about the future and the kind of country our children deserve to inherit.”\n\n-- Deborah Barfield Berry\n\nHarris takes over Biden campaign committee\n\nThe former Biden campaign is now officially the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe campaign formerly known as Biden for President in a filing Sunday afternoon with the Federal Election Commission changed its name to the Harris for President campaign.\n\nThe move makes Harris’ bid for the Democratic nomination official, with her campaign apparently assuming control of Biden’s campaign funds. The move also allows Harris to begin raising money for her presidential bid. Harris named Keana Spencer her treasurer.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nEmily’s List endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nEmily’s List, an organization that supports Democratic, pro-abortion rights women candidates, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n“.@kamalaharris was made for this moment,” they wrote. “Throughout her career, she has been a steadfast fighter for women and reproductive freedom — a role that is more important than ever before. We’re proud to endorse her for president.”\n\n-- Sudiksha Kochi\n\nRep. Cori Bush endorses Kamala Harris for president\n\nBush is currently in a tight primary race and said this month that her constituents had concerns about President Joe Biden’s viability as a candidate. She praised him for “prioritizing our nation’s needs” and threw her support behind Harris.\n\n“When we say trust Black women, we mean it. Black women are the backbone of the Democratic Party and it is past time for us to lead at this moment,” Bush said.\n\n— Rachel Barber\n\n'There are many questions now'\n\nShannon O'Brien, a presidential history professor at the University of Texas, called Biden's announcement \"huge:\" \"We've never had a candidate drop out willingly so late before.\"\n\nThe professor also explained how the Democratic convention could potentially function next month.\n\n\"There are many questions now. The pledged delegates for each state are bound by state rules to vote for their candidate X number of times under state law,\" O'Brien explained. \"If Biden has enough to win, then he can decline, which will throw it immediately into a brokered convention. I don't know what it means with Harris on the ticket and much of this would come down to state law on whether or not she wins those pledged delegates.\"\n\n− Darren Samuelsohn\n\nNational Ice Cream Day: A fitting day for Biden\n\nIt’s no secret: Joe Biden loves ice cream.

It had previously endorsed Joe Biden.\n\n“As vice president, Kamala Harris has been one of Gen Z’s fiercest champions,” the statement said. “Harris has presented a clear vision for our future — a vision that will undoubtedly fire up young people this election to defeat Donald Trump.”\n\n− Rachel Barber\n\nObama: Biden is ‘a patriot of the highest order’\n\nFormer President Barack Obama praised Biden’s decision to end his campaign for a second term, saying he selflessly put the country’s interests ahead of his own.\n\nBiden’s “outstanding track record” while in office gave him “every right to run for re-election and finish the job he started,” Obama said. But, “Joe understands better than anyone the stakes in this election — how everything he has fought for throughout his life, and everything that the Democratic Party stands for, will be at risk if we allow Donald Trump back in the White House and give Republicans control of Congress.”\n\nBiden, who served as vice president during the eight years of Obama’s presidency, has never backed down from a fight, Obama said.\n\n“For him to look at the political landscape and decide that he should pass the torch to a new nominee is surely one of the toughest in his life,” the former president said. “But I know he wouldn’t make this decision unless he believed it was right for America. It’s a testament to Joe Biden’s love of country — and a historic example of a genuine public servant once again putting the interests of the American people ahead of his own that future generations of leaders will do well to follow.”\n\nBiden has been “one of America’s most consequential presidents,” Obama said, and “a patriot of the highest order.\n\nObama’s statement made no mention of Vice President Kamala Harris, who is considered the frontrunner to replace Biden on the ticket.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden adviser Klain bemoans ‘donors and electeds’ who pushed the president\n\nJoe Biden’s former White House chief of staff Ron Klain called on Democrats to unite behind Kamala Harris as the Democratic nominee – and took at shot at Biden’s Democratic detractors in doing so.\n\n“Now that the donors and electeds have pushed out the only candidate who has ever beaten Trump, it’s time to end the political fantasy games and unite behind the only veteran of a national campaign — our outstanding VP, Kamala Harris! Let’s get real and win in November!” Klain wrote in a post on X.\n\nKlain, a longtime Biden aide and among the president closest advisors, had been serving as a campaign adviser for Biden.\n\n−Joey Garrison\n\nPresident of conservative think tank linked to Project 2025 calls for Biden to resign\n\nKevin Roberts, president of the right-wing think tank The Heritage Foundation that's linked to Project 2025, joined calls for Joe Biden to resign the presidency. Project 2025 is a 900-page, sweeping conservative plan for the next GOP administration.\n\n“If President Biden is incapable of running a presidential race, how can he lead our nation for another six months?” Roberts said in a statement Sunday. “In the interest of national security and the safety of our citizens, President Biden must immediately resign.”\n\n−Rachel Barber\n\nWhitmer says her job 'remains the same' after Biden drops out\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said Sunday that her role in the 2024 election is unchanged in light of Joe Biden’s decision to leave the race, though she didn't explicitly say she wouldn't seek the Democratic nomination.\n\nWhitmer’s name has risen to the top of the list of potential vice presidential nominees who could join a new Democratic ticket led by Kamala Harris.\n\nHowever, the Michigan governor said in a social media post, that her “job in this election will remain the same: doing everything I can to elect Democrats and stop Donald Trump, a convicted felon whose agenda of raising families’ costs, banning abortion nationwide, and abusing the power of the White House to settle his own scores is completely wrong for Michigan.”\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nSanders praises Biden’s tenure in office\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., thanked Joe Biden for serving the country with “honor and dignity” after the president announced he would end his reelection campaign.\n\nWhile the list of Democrats calling for Biden to exit the 2024 race grew, Sanders continued to back the president until he dropped out Sunday.\n\n“As the first president to ever walk on a picket line with striking workers, he has been the most pro-working class president in modern American history,” Sanders wrote in a social media post. “Thank you, Mr. President, for all you’ve done.”\n\n−Rachel Barber\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton endorse VP Harris for president\n\nBill and Hillary Clinton have endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee for president.\n\nThe former president and the former secretary of state, who was the Democratic nominee for president in 2016, pledged to do “whatever we can” to support Harris.“We’ve lived through many ups and downs, but nothing has made us more worried for our country than the threat posed by a second Trump term,” the Clintons said in a joint statement. “He has promised to be a dictator on day one, and the recent ruling by his servile Supreme Court will only embolden him to further shred the Constitution. Now is the time to support Kamala Harris and fight with everything we’ve got to elect her. America’s future depends on it.”\n\nThe Clintons also offered praise for Biden, saying he lifted the country out of an unprecedented pandemic, created millions of new jobs, rebuilt a battered economy, strengthened democracy and restored America’s standing in the world.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nWho will replace Biden? Harris is the immediate frontrunner\n\nKamala Harris appears to be the leading candidate to replace Joe Biden as the Democratic Party’s nominee in the 2024 election, after the president dropped his reelection bid amid rising concerns about his age following his debate with former President Donald Trump.\n\nBiden emphatically endorsed Harris to be the Democratic presidential nominee in a social media post Sunday shortly after announcing his decision to step out of the 2024 race.\n\nIf formally nominated, Harris, 59, would become the first Black woman at the top of a major party presidential ticket.

Nov. 5 cannot arrive soon enough.”\n\nJohnson said Biden’s decision to leave the race under pressure from Democrats who feared he would lose to Trump “invalidated the votes of more than 14 million Americans who selected Joe Biden to be the Democrat nominee for president.”\n\n“The party’s prospects are no better now with Vice President Kamala Harris, who co-owns the disastrous policy failures of the Biden administration,” he said. “As second in command and a completely inept border czar, Harris has been a gleeful accomplice — not only in the destruction of American sovereignty, security, and prosperity, but also in the largest political coverup in U.S. history. She has known for as long as anyone of his incapacity to serve.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nPelosi calls Biden 'one of the most consequential Presidents in American history'\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in a statement on Biden’s decision to withdraw from the race, said Biden is a “patriotic American who has always put his nation first.”\n\n“His legacy of vision, values and leadership make him one of the most consequential Presidents in American history,” Pelosi said.\n\nThe former House speaker added: “With love and gratitude to President Biden for always believing in the promise of America and giving people the opportunity to reach their fulfillment. God blessed America with Joe Biden’s greatness and goodness.”\n\nIn recent days, Pelosi had reportedly shared concerns privately to Biden about his grim prospects to defeat Trump and that his candidacy could doom Senate and House Democratic candidates.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nPotential VP nominee Beshear says Biden's decision in “best interest” of country\n\nKentucky Gov. Andy Beshear called Joe Biden’s decision to drop his 2024 reelection bid in the “best interest of the country and party,” in a statement Sunday.\n\n“President Biden will be remembered as a consequential president. Along with Vice President Harris, he led us through the aftermath of the January 6th attack on our Capitol and steadily steered us out of a global pandemic,” Beshear wrote.\n\nHe is among a handful of Democratic governors believed to be on the short list to now join the Democratic presidential ticket.\n\n“Now it’s time for our nation to come together,” Beshear added in the post. “We need to dial down the anger, rancor and noise.\"\n\n−Karissa Waddick\n\nHakeem Jeffries: 'We are forever grateful'\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Rep.

We are forever grateful,\" he said.\n\n− Kathryn Palmer\n\nDNC chair says Democrats will launch process of choosing new candidate\n\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Jaime Harrison said in the coming days Democrats will “undertake a transparent and orderly process to move forward as a united Democratic Party with a candidate who can defeat Donald Trump in November.”\n\nHarrison said the process will be “governed by established rules and procedures of the Party.”\n\n“Our delegates are prepared to take seriously their responsibility in swiftly delivering a candidate to the American people,” Harrison said, adding that the American people will hear “in short order” from the Democratic Party on the next steps in the nomination process.\n\nThe DNC convention is set for Aug. 19 to 22 in Chicago, but Democratic National Committee leaders have planned for a virtual roll-call vote before Aug. 7 to satisfy concerns with ballot deadlines in several states.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nJosh Shapiro calls Biden a 'patriot'\n\nPennsylvania Gov.

Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi shared similar concerns to Biden.\n\nMore than 30 congressional Democrats had called for Biden to bow out. Former President Barack Obama reportedly also relayed fears privately to Democratic allies about Biden's prospects of beating Trump. Democratic donors from Hollywood to Wall Street also came out against Biden continuing his reelection bid.\n\nBiden, 81, has battled Americans’ concerns over his age since he took office but it turned into panic for Democrats after last month's first debate with Trump, the Republican nominee. Biden's voice sounded faint, he struggled to complete sentences and finish thoughts, and he failed to rebut many of Trump's claims on the debate stage.\n\nBiden's campaign was in a free fall over the past few weeks with his future in doubt. Instead of focusing solely on Trump, Democrats spent as much time and energy debating whether Biden could even defeat his predecessor.\n\nFundraising for the Biden campaign took a dramatic hit. And Biden not only fell behind in key battleground states that will decide the election, but his growing unpopularity seemed to put recent Democratic strongholds like Virginia in play for Trump.\n\n−Joey Garrison and Swapna Venugopal\n\nBiden becomes first incumbent not to seek reelection since LBJ\n\nBiden becomes the first incumbent president not to seek reelection since Lyndon B.

Sign up\n\nThe “fizz and chatter, for now at least, is about Penny Mordaunt”, said Chris Mason at the BBC. If she were to win, Mordaunt would be “the most little-known prime minister on assuming office of modern times”.\n\nSo, who is Penny Mordaunt?\n\nMordaunt and her twin brother, James, were born in the Devon resort town of Torquay in 1973, but lived in Portsmouth from the age of two. The children of a former paratrooper and a special needs teacher, the twins “did everything together” and had an “idyllic” early childhood packed with extra-curricular activities including ballet, canoeing and football, said The Sunday Times.\n\nBut “tragedy struck” when Mordaunt’s mother died from breast cancer when the twins were just 15. “I was a carer from the age of 13, and looked after my family until my father remarried when I was 18,” then defence secretary Mordaunt told the paper in 2019.\n\nAfter leaving school, Mordaunt worked in a Romanian orphanage for a year before becoming the first person in her family to go to university, studying philosophy at Reading. She supported herself with various jobs including work at local factories by day and as a magician’s assistant at night.\n\nMordaunt’s parliamentary career\n\nShe began her political career as a press officer for the Conservative Central Office. The then head of research encouraged her to stand for Parliament, after noticing that Mordaunt “was head and shoulders above all the bright young things in the building”, said The Sunday Times.\n\nShe failed in her first attempt to win the Portsmouth North seat from Labour, in 2005, but went on to win five years later with a swing of 9%. She won again in 2015, 2017 and 2019, each time with an increased majority.\n\nIn 2014, she joined the Cameron-Clegg coalition as the parliamentary under secretary of state for communities and local government. That same year, Mordaunt made national headlines by taking part in now-defunct reality TV series Splash!, starring Tom Daley. She later said that her appearance raised money for projects in her constituency.\n\nMordaunt subsequently held various roles in government including under secretary of state for the armed forces, minister of state for disabled people, health and work, and secretary of state for international development.\n\nIn 2017, at the height of the Yemeni civil war, Mordaunt was “instrumental” in encouraging the Saudis to keep the port of Hodeidah open, said The Sunday Times. “Widely regarded as a determined operator”, Mordaunt was praised for her negotiating savvy following a meeting with the Saudis. A source at the British embassy in Riyadh told the paper that her performance “was the most impressive they had ever seen from a British government minister”.\n\nFor the following two years, Mordaunt was the minister for women and equalities, and was outspoken about abortion laws in Northern Ireland that she described as “the most appalling thing”.\n\nIn 2019, following the sacking of Gavin Williamson, she became the UK’s first female defence secretary. “It is a post that seems more suited to her background than her previous job as international development secretary,” The Guardian said at the time.\n\nAfter just 85 days, however, she was “unceremoniously returned to the backbenches” for “the crime of backing the wrong horse in the leadership contest”, said PoliticsHome, referring to her decision to support Jeremy Hunt over Johnson.\n\nMordaunt was appointed minister for trade policy in September last year. She also continues to be a Royal Navy reservist, lately promoted to honorary captain.\n\nChances for leadership\n\nMordaunt is a passionate Brexiteer and was one of the leading faces of the Vote Leave campaign. One senior Conservative MP and ex-minister said this means she can “appeal to the staunchly pro-Leave wing of the party” as well as attracting the “self-styled moderates in the One Nation and Tory Reform Group caucuses”, reported PoliticsHome.\n\nBut Oliver Duff at the i news site warned that “the Tory Squid Game” is “about to get even more ruthless”. After “surging into second place”, Mordaunt can expect “days of hostile briefings” as Truss and Sunak supporters try to “topple her campaign”.\n\nLord Frost, the former Brexit negotiator, has already told Talk TV he would have “grave reservations” about Mordaunt winning the race. He claimed she “wasn’t fully accountable or always visible” when she served as his junior as the UK left the EU.\n\nHer new status as a feasible contender is certainly “bringing intense scrutiny”, said the Daily Mail. She is facing questions on issues such as “whether she had changed her ‘woke’ views on trans rights in order to win support”.\n\nOne former permanent secretary also said: “I doubt you’ll find a single civil servant who’s worked closely with her who thinks she is prime ministerial material.”\n\nThe comment came after Mordaunt described Whitehall as “broken”, said the Financial Times, adding that her team “strongly dispute” the former mandarin’s claims.", "authors": ["Kate Samuelson", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "The Week Uk", "Sorcha Bradley", "Peter Weber", "Harriet Marsden", "Arion Mcnicoll", "Rebecca Messina", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/01/18"}]}

'A moment I'll never forget'", "text": "PALM DESERT, Calif. — About 125 miles east of Los Angeles, in front of a crowd of 9,494 at Acrisure Arena, the home of the Coachella Valley Firebirds, a minor league hockey team, is where it happened.\n\nLeBron James and his son Bronny took the court together Sunday night at the start of the second quarter of the Los Angeles Lakers’ preseason game against the Phoenix Suns.\n\nThey became the first father and son in NBA history to play in the same game.\n\nOn Bronny’s 20th birthday, no less.\n\n\"It's definitely a moment that I'll never forget,'' LeBron said.\n\nAll things Lakers: Latest Los Angeles Lakers news, schedule, roster, stats, injury updates and more.\n\nBut Bronny looked far more serious than celebratory after the game.\n\n“It's a lot of stuff going around, just trying to focus on what my job is and what I'm supposed to be doing,’’ Bronny said. “I feel like that's the thing that keeps me grounded.\"\n\nStatistically, the four-minute stretch during which father and son shared the court was not how the script was supposed to go for Bronny. He had three turnovers and an offensive foul and missed his only shot – a 3-pointer after his father fed him a short pass.\n\nLeBron fared better during that stretch, making a 3-pointer and a layup while getting fouled (yes, he converted the free throw) and grabbing two rebounds. And would have relished the assist if Bronny had made the 3-pointer.\n\n“Only shot one shot, so there's not much to say about that,’’ Bronny said of his 25-footer that clanked off the back of the rim when asked about his shooting ability. “But yeah, just again, just trying to find my role and play as hard as I can.’’\n\nBronny finished the night scoreless, attempting only the one shot, with two rebounds and four turnovers in 13 minutes. In the preseason opener, Friday against the Minnesota Timberwolves, he had two points on 1-for-6 shooting and had a game-high three blocks along with a rebound, an assist and a turnover.\n\nAfter the Lakers fell to the Suns, 118-114, those statistics seemed like an afterthought when LeBron addressed the significance of the night.\n\nLess than 15 months ago, after all Bronny suffered a cardiac arrest.\n\n“Even with the situation last year, he came out of that and continue to work, continue to put himself in a position where he can even be drafted and it's just work in progress,’’ LeBron said. “Wants to continue to get, continue to learn and he's doing it every single day. So it was great to see.’’\n\nLeBron, who will be 40 in December, looked about a decade younger. Held out of the Lakers first preseason game, he had 19 points on 8-of-12 shooting, five rebounds and four assists in only 16 minutes.\n\nBut ultimately, the numbers were an afterthought after the game when he was asked about being on the court with his oldest son.\n\n“It's pretty cool for both of us and especially for our family,’’ LeBron said. “It's cool. You just think of (LeBron's wife) Savannah watching home, the thoughts of your entire extended family.’’\n\nWhen asked what it meant to him as a father, LeBron made reference to his having grown up fatherless in Akron, Ohio.\n\n“I mean, for a father...it means everything,’’ he said. “For someone who didn't have that growing up, to be able to have that influence on your kids and have influence from your son to be able to have moments with your son. And then ultimately, to be able to work with your son, I think that's one of the greatest things a father could ever hope for.’’\n\nYet Bronny seemed far more focused on basketball than on history. As he’s attempting to carve out a role on the team under the watch for first-year Lakers coach J.J. Redick.\n\n“J.J. has really emphasized that defensive end and being a pest on defense, so that's just what I've been trying to focus on when I'm stepping on the floor,’’ he said.\n\nHe heard something else from Redick before the game. Tonight would be the night for father and son to share the court together.\n\n“I'm thrilled that I get to be a part of this,’’ Redick said. “I really am. ...I think it speaks to LeBron's, certainly longevity, but also his competitive stamina that he's able to still be doing this in year 22 (in the NBA).\n\n“It speaks to the work that Bronny has put in to get to this point, and really just the fatherly care and love and certainly the motherly care from Savannah as well. Bronny, he's such a great kid and he's a pleasure to be around.’’\n\nOh, and that shot Bronny took.\n\n“I was really hoping that wing three on the little side… had gone in,’’ Redick said. “That would've been a cool moment. But they'll have a lot of moments together, I'm sure.’’\n\n(This story was updated to add new information.)", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/draft/2024/06/27/nba-draft-tracker-second-round-picks-trades-bronny-james/74230842007/", "title": "2024 NBA draft tracker: Bronny James joins dad LeBron with Lakers", "text": "NEW YORK — Bronny James heard his named called in the NBA draft, and history was made.\n\nWith the No. 55 pick in the second round, the Los Angeles Lakers selected James.

He’ll have to continue to polish his jump shot, but his quickest path to the court is as a willing, pesky defender in a “3-and-D” role. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nNo. 54 Boston Celtics, Anton Watson, Gonzaga\n\nThe reigning champion Boston Celtics are adding Anton Watson to their squad with the No. 54 overall pick. He averaged 14.5 points, 7.1 rebounds and 2.6 assists last season. Watson led the Bulldogs in steals per game (1.5). — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 53 Detroit Pistons, Cam Spencer, Connecticut\n\nLikely the best 3-point shooter in the draft, Spence shot 44% from deep during the national championship season. He’s better suited as a shooter coming off screens and he has great vision in finding the right spots to get open. He averaged 14.3 points, 4.9 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game last season. — Jordan Mendoza\n\n∎ The Pistons traded the No. 53 pick to the Grizzlies, via the Timberwolves, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 52 Golden State Warriors, Quinten Post, Boston College\n\nPost is a true big that can dominate near the basket with his frame, but what’s remarkable is his 3-point shooting ability; last season, he shot 43.1% from beyond the arc. He isn’t fast and can be exploited if he has to defend around the perimeter, but he gives Golden State another possible scoring threat off the bench. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 51 New York Knicks, Melvin Ajinça, Saint-Quentin (France)\n\nAnother French player is off the board. The Knicks picked up Ajinça, a 6-8 wing that shot 30.9% from three last season on Saint-Quentin. He averaged 13.6 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.1 assists. — Cydney Henderson\n\n∎ The Knicks traded the No. 51 pick to the Mavericks, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 50 Indiana Pacers, Enrique Freeman, Akron\n\nThe Pacers are looking to solidify the glass. After ranking 28th in the league in rebounding last season, Freeman should find minutes by collecting boards. He led the country with 12.9 rebounds per game, but he can also contribute on offense with high energy; last season, he tied the NCAA Divsion I single-season record for double-doubles (31). He is the first Zip to be drafted since 1987 and just the second to go in one of the first two rounds. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nNo. 49 Indiana Pacers: Tristen Newton, Connecticut\n\nThe leader of the back-to-back national champion Huskies, Newton led UConn in nearly every statistical category, including points (15.1) and assists (6.2) per game. He was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Final Four and one of his strengths is driving to the basket. There are concerns about his age and outlook, but he continued to grow in every college season. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 48 San Antonio Spurs, Harrison Ingram, North Carolina\n\nIngram is an impact player and spot-up shooter, shooting 43% from the field and 38.5% from three. He nearly averaged a double-double last season, with a career-high 12.2 points and 8.8 rebounds. He was named third-team All-ACC team. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 47 Orlando Magic, Antonio Reeves, Kentucky\n\nThis is a pick made with scoring and experience in mind. As a senior, Reeves averaged 20.2 points per game, but it wasn’t just his pure 3-point stroke. Reeves can score from different levels on the floor, though going 44.7% from beyond the arc should get him instant playing time. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\n∎ The Magic traded the No. 47 pick to the Pelicans, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 46 Los Angeles Clippers, Cam Christie, Minnesota\n\nLakers second-year player Max Christie is getting company in Los Angeles. His younger brother Cam Christie was drafted by the Los Angeles Clippers. The younger Christie is a threat from beyond the arc, shooting 39.1%. He averaged 11.3 points, 3.6 rebounds and 2.2 assists at Minnesota last season. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNo. 45 Sacramento Kings, Jamal Shead, Houston\n\nThe leader of a dominant run at Houston, Shead was a menace for one of the best defensive teams in Division I as he was named 2023-24 Naismith National Defensive Player of the Year. He will be able to handle most defensive assignments in the perimeter despite being just 6-foot. Shead dished the ball effectively on offense and can be a pass-first guard. — Jordan Mendoza\n\n∎ The Kings traded the No. 45 pick to the Raptors, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 44 Atlanta Hawks, Pelle Larsson, Arizona\n\nThe Atlanta Hawks selected Pelle Larsson out of Arizona with the No. 44 overall pick of the 2024 NBA draft. Last season, the Swedish basketball player averaged a career-high 12.8 points, 4.1 rebounds and 3.7 assists, which led the Wildcats. — Cydney Henderson\n\n∎ The Hawks traded the No. 44 pick to the Heat for the No. 43 pick, which was the Hawks’ selection from an earlier trade with the Houston Rockets for AJ Griffin, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 43 Miami Heat, Nikola Đurišić, Serbia\n\nHe’s a candidate to be stashed in the G League, but Đurišić is a versatile wing who thrived as a playmaker, though his play most closely resembles something seen in a traditional 2-guard. He has pure shooting mechanics, but he will need to work on his defense at the next level. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\n∎ The Heat traded the No. 43 pick to the Hawks for the No. 44 pick, which was the Hawks’ selection from an earlier trade with the Houston Rockets for AJ Griffin, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 42 Charlotte Hornets, KJ Simpson, Colorado\n\nNEW YORK — Simpson is a 6-0 guard who can score, rebound and pass. He averaged 19.7 points, 5.8 rebounds and 4.9 assists – just one of five Division I players to average at least 19-5-4 in 2023-24. He also shot 43.4% on 3-pointers and averaged 1.6 steals for the Buffaloes. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nNo. 41 Philadelphia 76ers, Adem Bona, UCLA\n\nA player all about hustle, Bona makes his presence known on the defensive end with his long, athletic frame, and he can bring explosiveness inside the paint on the offensive side. He was the Pac-12 Defensive Player of the Year and led the Bruins in blocks with 1.8 per game. He will give Philadelphia a true big to come off the bench for Joel Embiid and bring intensity to the second unit. Something he will need to develop in the pros is his discipline as he dealt with foul troubles throughout his two years at UCLA. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 40 Portland Trail Blazers, Osasere Ighodaro, Marquette\n\nIghodaro is a versatile big man that can score in a number of ways, averaging 13.4 points, 6.9 rebounds and 2.9 assists last season. And Portland is in desperate need of scoring. Portland, who finished with the third-worst record (21-61) in the league, was also second-to-last in field goal percentage (43.9%) last season. — Cydney Henderson\n\n∎ The Trailblazers traded Ighodaro to the Suns, per ESPN. Ighodaro is returning home — he’s from Mesa, Arizona, and attended high school in Phoenix.\n\nNo. 39 Memphis Grizzlies, Jaylen Wells, Washington State\n\nThe Grizzlies are joining the trend of taking athletic wings and stashing them. Wells led the Cougars in 3-point percentage last season at 41.7%, but he’s more than just a shooter. Wells chipped in on the glass, grabbing 4.6 rebounds per game. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nNo. 38 New York Knicks, Ajay Mitchell, UC-Santa Barbara\n\nNEW YORK — Mitchell is an efficient offensive player – he averaged 20 points 50.4% shooting from the field, 39.3% on 3-pointers and 85.8% on free throws in 2023-24. The 6-3 guard also averaged 4.0 rebounds and 4.0 assists. He was the 2022-23 Big West player of the year. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\n∎ The Knicks traded this pick to Oklahoma City who will acquire Mitchell, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 37 Minnesota Timberwolves, Bobi Klintman, Sweden\n\nKlintman played one season at Wake Forest before going to Australia to play for Cairns Taipans. He had a productive season in the Australian National Basketball League with 9.7 points and 4.8 rebounds per game. Klintman can space the floor and he is excellent in transition. His defensive prowess is another plus. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 36 Indiana Pacers, Juan Núñez, Ratiopharm Ulm (Germany)\n\nNúñez has excellent court vision, is a great passer and a threat on the pick and roll. Núñez averaged 10.8 points, 3.6 rebounds and 5.7 assists last season at Ratiopharm Ulm, a professional club in Germany, where he played with Pacome Dadiet, the 25th overall pick of the 2024 NBA draft. — Cydney Henderson\n\n∎ The Pacers traded Núñez to the Spurs for the No. 35 pick, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 35. San Antonio Spurs, Johnny Furphy, Kansas\n\nFurphy, who played his junior basketball in Australia, runs the court well, finishes in transition and can knock down spot-up 3s. He was one of 21 players to receive an invite to the green room for the first round, but did not hear his name called. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\n∎ The Spurs traded Furphy to the Indiana Pacers for the No. 36 pick, per ESPN.\n\nNo. 34, Portland Trail Blazers, Tyler Kolek, Marquette\n\nNEW YORK — A playmaker and scorer, especially off the dribble, Kolek sees the court well, operates with savvy in the pick-and-roll and is clever with his finishes at the rim. He had six double-doubles in points and assists this season. He averaged 15.3 points, 7.7 assists, 4.9 rebounds and 1.6 steals and shot 49.6% from the field and 38.8% on 3-pointers. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\n∎ The Trail Blazers will send Kolek to the Knicks for future second-round picks, a person with knowledge of the deal told USA TODAY Sports. The person requested anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly until the deal was official.\n\nNo. 33 Milwaukee Bucks, Tyler Smith, G League Ignite\n\nA versatile stretch-four that can shoot from just about anywhere on the court. He shot 36% from 3-point land last season, a big boost for a Bucks team that was a top 10 3-point shooting team. Smith started his professional career as a 16-year-old and opted to skip the final two years of high school. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nNo. 32 Utah Jazz, Kyle Filipowski, Duke\n\nFilipowski averaged 16.4 points, 8.3 rebounds and 1.5 blocks last season. Filipowski is a versatile low-post big who can pull up for a three or drive to the bucket. He will also add a defensive boost to the Jazz, who finished dead last in the league in defensive rating. Filipowski will team up with Lauri Markkanen, who Filipowski says he models his game after. — Cydney Henderson and Jeff Zillgitt\n\nNo. 31 Toronto Raptors, Jonathan Mogbo, San Francisco\n\nThe Raptors start the second round with some experience, taking Mogbo, a senior forward. Mogbo is a two-way player who is comfortable in transition with the ball in his hands and is a double-double machine. He averaged 14.2 points and 10.1 rebounds per game last season, though he is not a 3-point threat. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nBronny James is not among green room guests\n\nNEW YORK — Bronny James was not among the 10 green room attendees, per the NBA. But that doesn’t mean Bronny is not at ESPN’s Seaport studio in lower Manhattan where the second round of the draft is taking place.\n\nDuke’s Kyle Filipowski and Kansas’ Johnny Furphy, who were first-round green room attendees and not drafted on Wednesday, are not expected to attend the second round in person. — Jeff Zillgitt\n\nThe 10 green room players for the second round:\n\nAdem Bona, UCLA\n\nCam Christie, Minnesota\n\nNikola Djurisic, Mega (Serbia)\n\nBoogie Ellis, USC\n\nOso Ighodaro, Marquette\n\nHarrison Ingram, North Carolina\n\nBobi Klintman, Cairns (Australia) Taipans\n\nJuan Nunez, Ratiopharm Ulm (Germany)\n\nKJ Simpson, Colorado\n\nJaylen Wells, Washington State\n\nHow to watch the NBA draft\n\nThe second round will be broadcast on ESPN.\n\nWhen is the NBA draft?\n\nThe second round is Thursday at 4 p.m. ET\n\nHow to stream the NBA draft\n\nThe draft will be streamed on ESPN+, YouTube TV and fuboTV.\n\nHow many rounds are the NBA draft?\n\nThe draft has two rounds.

It also may have something to do with his namesake’s future employer.

Read our analysis of all 30 picks and catch up with these highlights:\n\nNBA draft first-round picks\n\nOpinion: Hawks don't need a savior in Risacher. They just need him to be good\n\nATLANTA — It would be difficult to have a strong opinion about Zaccharie Risacher, the NBA’s newly-minted No. 1 overall draft pick, unless JL Bourg of the LNB Élite league was somehow part of your basketball viewing menu last season. But there’s a reason that the people who actually get paid to pay attention to this stuff — and whose jobs depend on getting it right — have liked Risacher since he was 16 years old.\n\nIn the modern NBA, tall wings who can shoot from the perimeter and defend multiple positions are among the rarest commodities. Just ask the New York Knicks, who are about to pay OG Anunoby more than $200 million despite never averaging more than 17.1 points per game and just gave up a ransom of draft picks for Mikal Bridges. Read Dan Wolken's column.\n\nOpinion: Knicks taking big swings. Risk is worth it\n\nNEW YORK – The day before the first round of Wednesday’s NBA draft and just hours before the draft began, the New York Knicks dominated the league’s headlines.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Knicks acquired Mikal Bridges from the Brooklyn Nets, and the following day, they reached a five-year, $212 million deal with OG Anunoby, their own free agent, to remain with New York.\n\nThe opening of NBA free agency is Sunday, and the Knicks’ front office, led by former player-agent Leon Rose, sent a message: the Knicks are going for it. They see a window to play for an NBA championship, and they’re taking a big-league swing. That should be commended.

France has had an unprecedented run of success in getting players drafted in the first round. No team made more selections than the Washington Wizards, who came into the night with two but aggressively added another in the middle of the round, and now they appear to have infused talent onto a roster that badly needed it. Read our winners and losers from the first round of the 2024 NBA draft here.\n\nThree biggest surprise picks from first round\n\nNEW YORK — The first round of the 2024 NBA draft produced expected results − a pair of French players in Zaccharie Risacher and Alex Sarr, for example, were selected in the first two picks.\n\nBut the first round also yielded picks that were total surprises, ones that drew audible reactions from the crowd in attendance at the Barclays Center after Commissioner Adam Silver read off their names.\n\nWhether it was teams in win-now mode drafting prospects who are projects, or players seemingly taken too high, here are the three biggest surprise picks from the first round of the 2024 NBA draft. Read story. — Lorenzo Reyes\n\nHistoric draft for France\n\nIt’s been a big day for France with one of its most successful drafts in NBA history.\n\nWith Zaccharie Risacher and Alex Sarr the first two picks in the draft, it’s the first time two Frenchmen went 1-2 in the NBA draft.\n\nOn top of that, with Tidjane Salaun taken sixth overall, it’s the first time three Frenchmen were selected in the top 10. It’s also the first time a country other than the U.S. has had three players drafted in the top 10. — Jordan Mendoza\n\nESPN cameras show incorrect player when displaying graphic\n\nDalton Knecht is at the 2024 NBA draft with his family and Tennessee coach Rick Barnes as he waits to live out a childhood dream of hearing his name called by NBA commissioner Adam Silver. But for a brief second ESPN's broadcast showed someone other than the Vols forward — the second production error for the network this week after missing the Florida Panthers hoist the Stanley Cup on Monday.\n\nDuring the introduction of players at the 2024 NBA draft at the Barclays Center on Wednesday, ESPN broadcast a lower-third graphic with Knecht's name. However, the camera was trained on French forward Tidjane Salaun instead of Knecht. Salaun would go No. 6 overall to the Charlotte Hornets. — John Leuzzi, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nDonovan Clingan honors mom at draft\n\nDonovan Clingan has dedicated his basketball career to his mother, and he made sure to have a piece of her with him when he was selected by the Portland Trail Blazers.

James received five votes from his peers. Stephen Curry, Anthony Edwards and Jrue Holiday each got two votes, while Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis, Kawhi Leonard and Bam Adebayo each received one.\n\n“That’s what I told my brother after the first day, I was like, dude’s 40 and he’s the best player on the court,” Houston Rockets forward Amen Thompson said.\n\nThompson received a vote because he participated in camp as a select team member. Meanwhile, 17-year-old phenom and future Duke Blue Devil Cooper Flagg got the most votes among select team members, with nine.\n\nLeBron James stats at the Olympics\n\nJames skipped out on the Rio Olympics in 2016 and did not play in the 2020 Tokyo Olympics — which were pushed back, to 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. He helped lead the USA to 8-0 finishes and gold medals in 2008 and 2012. He was on the 2004 Team USA roster that went 5-3 and finished with the bronze medal.\n\nThe 2008 team was nicknamed the \"Redeem Team\" after a worse-than-expected performance in the 2004 Olympics. The team, which also featured Bryant (a captain), Chris Paul, Wade, Bosh, Anthony Carlos Boozer, Dwight Howard, Jason Kidd, and Deron Williams, among others, went 5-0 in a group stage play and then defeated Australia, Argentina, and Spain in the tournament to reclaim gold.\n\nHere's a look at James' stats during the three Olympics he has played in:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2024/06/28/lebron-james-bronny-james-lakers-nba-draft/74245101007/", "title": "It's take your kid to work day everyday for the Lakers", "text": "This is For The Win’s daily newsletter, The Morning Win. Did a friend recommend or forward this to you? If so, subscribe here. Have feedback? Leave your questions, comments and concerns through this brief reader survey! Now, here’s Mike Sykes.\n\nGoooood morning, folks! Welcome back to the Morning Win. Happy Friday! Can you believe July 4th is next week? What in the world? It was just March. Thanks so much for reading the newsletter today.\n\nFrom the very beginning, it has always been an inevitability that Bronny James would join his dad, LeBron James, with the Los Angeles Lakers. LeBron has always made it clear this was his intention, even if some strings needed to be pulled to get it done.\n\nRegardless, it's done now. And LeBron certainly seems happy that it's finally happened. But, of course, there's been a backlash to it because there's a backlash to almost everything LeBron does these days.\n\nSome fans were here for it. Others? They complained about nepotism and LeBron manipulating the Lakers to make this happen. That's probably what you're expecting this column today to be about. The whole Adrian Wojnarowski weird nepotism rant of it all, right?\n\nWell, sure. I do have thoughts on that and the state of the Lakers organization as a whole. And maybe one day soon I'll share those thoughts with you.\n\nBut the questions I have today are a bit more, uh, let's call them granular.\n\nI want to know how this whole arrangement between Bronny and Bron is going to work. Like, what does this look like? In fact, I have five specific questions I need answers to.\n\nWhat on Earth does Bronny call LeBron now? I've never worked with my dad, but I can't imagine that if I did work with him, I'd call him \"dad\" at work. That's weird. He can't call him that, right? But ... are they on a first-name basis as parent and child? Does Bronny just call him two three? I don't know, man. Again: This is weird. What happens on the road? I'm not saying LeBron is out here acting a fool on the road, but I'm not not saying that either. Bronny is also 19 years old on an NBA team. He's for sure going to act a fool on the road. Do they avoid each other like the plague then? Who tells Savannah somebody was acting out first? What happens when one of them messes up? What if Bronny mistimes a cut or bricks a wide-open 3-pointer off a pass from his dad? Savannah is definitely going to hear about that one. Do they room together? There's no way they room together. They can't room together, right?!? There's no way. Bronny, I hate this for you, brother. Which teammate does LeBron make passive-aggressive tweets about to get Bronny more playing time? This is happening. It's definitely happening. My vote is on D'Lo.\n\nThis season is going to be so weird for you, Lakers fans. Good luck.\n\nWelp. USMNT is still USMNT\n\nFolks got their hopes up for the U.S. Men's National soccer team after it played Brazil to a tough draw a few weeks ago. They thought this team might actually be serious for once.\n\nAs it turns out, it is still a completely unserious team that we should never have taken seriously in the first place.\n\nThe USMNT lost to Panama on Thursday, 2-1, after a late goal in the 88th minute basically ended the match. Now, the USMNT's path to the quarterfinals of the Copa América is in deep question.\n\nIt wasn't that 88th-minute goal that lost the U.S. the match — it was this silly red card from Tim Weah. He clocks a guy in the back of the head and gets ejected. USMNT essentially played the entire match down a man.\n\nWeah will also be suspended for the next match against Uruguay, which USMNT will probably need to win to advance to the quarterfinals.\n\nWhat a shame, man. What a shame.\n\nIs ... is Novak Djokovic actually going to play at Wimbledon?!?!?\n\nNovak Djokovic tore his meniscus just a few weeks ago at the French Open. He had surgery on his knee to repair it on June 6. It felt pretty safe to assume he might be down for a minute.\n\nI mean, at 37 years old, recovering from a torn meniscus can't be the easiest thing in the world, right? I thought we might actually be seeing Djokovic hit the beginning of the end here.\n\nYet, here we are, just three weeks later, and Djokovic is not only practicing against world No. 1 Janik Sinner but is also giving the thumbs-up to be included in the Wimbledon draw.\n\nHe's playing, folks. Novak Djokovic has somehow made it to Wimbledon.\n\nDepending on the draw, he'll likely have a match on Monday or Tuesday. As the No. 2 ranked ATP player in the world, Djokovic can't see Sinner until the final. But he could still match up against reigning champ Carlos Alcaraz a bit sooner, who is currently ranked No. 3.\n\nThat doesn't even really matter, though. Djokovic feeling well enough to play in this tournament is quite the achievement alone.\n\nHopefully, he holds up.\n\nPhoto Friday: Lord Stanley in all its glory\n\nI just love pictures with the Stanley Cup. Here's Aleksander Barkov celebrating with it as fireworks explode in the background. What a pic.\n\nQuick hits: Jewell Loyd is TOUGH ... NBA Draft grades ... and more\n\n— Jewell Loyd dropped 34 points on the Fever with one eye closed. Yes, that happened. Meg Hall has more.\n\n— Charles Curtis has draft grades for every team in the NBA\n\n— Caitlin Clark made a little WNBA history through 19 games. Here's Charles again with more.\n\n— Meet Macklin Celebrini, the No. 1 prospect in the NHL Draft. Cory has more here.\n\n— Here are 8 NHL vets with sons currently in the draft. Wow, we're old. Blake Schuster has more.\n\n— Prince Grimes asks if Bronny James will play for the South Bay Lakers. He probably should.\n\nThat's a wrap, folks! Thanks so much for reading. Have a fantastic weekend.

James finished with four points, shooting 2-for-9 from the field, 0-for-3 from three and 0-for-2 from the free-throw line, in addition to two assists, two rebounds and one steal in 21 minutes of play.\n\nJames was held scoreless in the first quarter, missing his first two shot attempts. He scored his first points at the 5:51 mark of the second quarter on a driving layup to the basket that tied the game 31-31.\n\nAlthough LeBron James couldn't attend his son's first NBA Summer League game as he prepares for the 2024 Paris Olympics with Team USA in Las Vegas, the father of three is still keeping tabs.

In the second quarter, James intercepted a pass from Sacramento's Yves Pons and pushed it up the floor in transition to Blake Hinson, who connected with Kyle Mangas for an easy layup.\n\nThe Lakers cut the Kings' lead to five with 8:37 remaining in the game before Sacramento responded and ended up with a 14-point victory. The Kings collectively shot 61.9% from the field, compared to the Lakers' 43.2%.\n\nBlake Hinson led the Lakers with 17 points off the bench. Tommy Kuhse was close to a double-double with 15 points and eight assists, while Maxwell Lewis added 14 points.

Their stories are different in their particulars but strikingly similar in their broad strokes.\n\nLast summer, at a basketball skills academy, Doug McDermott met Ray McCallum, who plays for his father at Detroit Mercy. They hit it off instantly. \"We found out a lot of our stories match up,\" Doug says.\n\n\"It was really fun to talk to Doug,\" says McCallum, who's team holds the No 2 seed in this week's Horizon League Tournament. \"You can always tell a coach's son. The way they play the game, the way they talk about the game. They have a high basketball IQ.\"\n\nBilly Baron, who plays for his father Jim at Canisius, watched reams of McCallum on tape before Canisius played at Detroit this season (Detroit won 83-78 in late December). \"We play a lot alike,\" Billy says, \"like looking in a mirror.\"\n\nBefore Ron Hunter brought in son R.J. to play for him at Georgia State, Ron talked a great deal to the elder Ray McCallum about the joys and challenges of mixing off guards with offspring. That's typical: Coaches whose rosters intersect with their family trees tend to seek scouting reports from those who've gone before.\n\nJim Baron remembers talking about all this with the late Al McGuire years ago: \"Al told me, 'Your son has to be the best player on the team, or the worst player on the team, can't be in between.' \"\n\nMcDermott, McCallum, Hunter and Baron are their teams' best players. The secret is not acting like it.\n\n\"Doug's teammates, from day one, embraced him as one of the guys, not the coach's son,\" Greg McDermott says. \"I think anyone watching us practice would have a hard time telling that Doug is my son. That's the way I want it, and the way he prefers it.\"\n\nA small window\n\nAllie McGuire remembers the recruiting trip he took to North Carolina in October of his senior year of high school.\n\n\"I got home and I said to my father, 'Looks like I'm going to North Carolina,' \" Allie says. \"And he said, 'Ah, it gets hot down there.' I said, 'Yeah, I know it gets hot down there, but that's the summer.' And he was like, 'Well, let's think about this. Let's not rush into this.' \"\n\nThen, Allie says, his father played his high card: \" 'If you go there, your mother won't be able to see you play.' \"\n\nThat's when Allie knew he'd be going to Marquette to play for dear old dad.\n\n\"I was so close to going to North Carolina,\" Allie says. \"But I wound up playing for my father and I never questioned it. Your destiny is where you end up.\"\n\nAllie started at guard as a sophomore, in an era when freshmen could not play varsity. George Frazier, another sophomore guard, thought he was just as good as Allie and told Al that. Al famously told Frazier that to beat out his kid he'd have to be better — or, in some versions, twice as good.\n\nAllie takes an interest in watching coaches' sons and thinks they're often the kind of playmakers who see the game two chess moves ahead. \"Even Maravich, with his 40 points every night, everyone remembers how he could pass,\" Allie says.\n\nNo one had to tell Pistol Pete to shoot more, but Al coaxed Allie: \"Once, before a game, my father said, 'When you get to half court I want you to drop-kick the ball and see if you can make it.' At first I didn't know if he was serious. Then I realized what he meant: 'I want you to shoot.' \"\n\nTheir time together as coach-player deepened their father-son bond for the rest of their lives. \"It's such a small, little window, three years,\" Allie says. \"You have to savor every moment.\"\n\nRecruiting at the breakfast table\n\nThere's an old joke about why coaches who coach their sons have such a big recruiting advantage. The punch line: \"I sleep with his mother.\"\n\nGreg McDermott has heard that one. \"Yeah,\" he says, \"I've heard most of them.\"\n\nAnd yet the truth is that it isn't always so easy to recruit the kid on the other side of the breakfast table. Doug was originally going to play at Northern Iowa, before his father left Iowa State for Creighton. And Billy Baron chose Virginia rather than play for his father at Rhode Island.\n\nBut Billy decided as a freshman to transfer to Rhode Island to play where his brother Jimmy had starred for their father. And then Billy wasn't sure what to do when his father was fired after last season.\n\n\"My father told me in the car and I'll never forget that moment,\" Billy says. \"We cried for a while. \"\n\nIt would get worse. His mother had open heart surgery weeks later. Billy's first inclination was to stay and play at Rhode Island. But, his mother says, he soon felt unwelcome there. Then he took visits to Providence and Purdue as college's version of a free agent, since sons of fired coaches typically get waivers to transfer without sitting out a year.\n\n\"Deciding what to do was hard for Billy,\" says Cindy Baron, his mother. \"It was hard for all of us. Trying to work out that balance tore the family apart.\"\n\nBilly remembers the turning point. His brother Jimmy, who plays pro basketball in Russia, sent an email with a link to a photo of the McCallums embracing after Detroit won last season's Horizon League championship and its automatic NCAA tournament bid.\n\n\"That's the one moment I missed out on playing for my father,\" Jimmy says. \"Every day, I regret that. And I told Billy, 'You wanted to come from Virginia to play for dad, not play for Rhode Island.' That's the same decision I made to play for him, no matter where he would have been at. And I told Billy, 'This picture, this is what you want.' \"\n\nAnd so Billy chose Canisius, which is to say he chose his father, meaning he's gone from the Atlantic Coast to the Atlantic 10 to the Metro Atlantic, even with the Big Ten and Big East beckoning.\n\n\"That picture of Ray and his father really stuck with me,\" Billy says.\n\nDouble trouble\n\nTheresa McDermott says watching games as a wife and as a mother can be double trouble.\n\n\"It makes me nervous as heck because it's not just your husband and his job but now it's your son and his career, too,\" she says. \"So you have double stress and double intensity. It's great when you're winning, but when you lose it's a double loss.\"\n\nAnd at home she's a double-agent.\n\n\"Sometimes Doug will vent to me and he knows I won't share that with Greg,\" she says. \"Greg has always been good about not bringing work home. But once in a while he'll say, 'Your son didn't play good defense in practice.' \"\n\nShe laughs and adds: \"It's 'your son' when he does something wrong.\"\n\nThe joy, Greg says, is watching his son grow as a player and as a person; the trick is when to back off.\n\n\"As much as I love my father,\" Greg says, \"I'm not sure I would have wanted to see him every day in college, so it's important that I give Doug some space.\"\n\nMorgan State coach Todd Bozeman, when he's tough on his players, used to tell them, \"My own kids don't like me sometimes.\" That line doesn't work as well now that son Blake plays for him.\n\n\"Blake calls me 'coach' on campus,\" Bozeman says, \"and he calls me 'dad' at home.\"\n\nSteve Alford played high school basketball for his father. \"When I was a freshman and sophomore, they booed when he put me in,\" Alford says. \"When I was a junior and senior, they booed when he took me out.\"\n\nThat sort of scrutiny steeled Alford for his playing career at Indiana and his coaching career at four stops, most recently at No. 11 New Mexico, where son Kory is a redshirt freshman and where son Bryce, a high school senior, will also play next year.\n\nKory is thinking about a career in coaching. Perhaps he will coach his own son some day, extending the Alford family business to a fourth generation.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/2023/06/17/nepotism-playing-favorites-happens-in-youth-sports-heres-what-to-do-ask-coach-steve/70329452007/", "title": "Nepotism, playing favorites happens in youth sports. Here's what to do", "text": "Dear Coach Steve,\n\nMy daughter has been playing softball for several years, with this being her last year in 8U before moving on to a more challenging and complex 10U. She is probably in the top 10% in the local 8U association. She hasn't always played at this level. In fact, up until last season she was always in the bottom 10% far as talent goes. But from the 2021 season to the 2022 season something happened – it’s as if a switch inside of her was flipped she improved drastically between seasons. Kamryn played lights out last year and made the All-Stars, although she still had lots to learn and improve on. Now it's the end of the season, All-Star selection time, something she's been waiting for. And we were informed she didn't make it but our coach’s daughter, who is 4th or 5th on our team, did make it. Her dad is also this year’s newly elected president of the league.\n\nI'm not upset that Kamryn didn't make it, as long as the ones who did actually deserved it based on play and sportsmanship. The part that bothers me is if she finds out and knows that some made it because of who their parents are, that she loses her drive and motivation to improve her skills to get better because it doesn't pay off like I've always told her it does. I tell her if you want something you work for it or if you want to get better at something you have to practice it, which is not the case in this matter. What are your thoughts?\n\nThanks, Steven\n\nLife (and often youth sports) isn't fair, but you can always benefit from the experiences\n\nDear Steven,\n\nAll-Star season can be one of the most exciting periods for Little Leaguers. It can also be one of the most crushing.\n\nPlayers who make the select All-Star squads for their Little Leagues have a chance to compete for a state championship in different age categories. If they are 12-year-olds, they have a chance to make it all the way to the Little World Series. However, strong players are passed over for these teams every year, sometimes when they don’t even deserve to be passed over.\n\n“It’s an unfortunate reality that, in some cases, favoritism does exist when it comes to tournament team selection,” Dan Velte, senior operations executive of Little League International, told USA TODAY Sports, “and I would say not just in Little League, but any youth sports.”\n\nFrom my own coaching experience, favoritism — which often takes the form of outright nepotism by a parent coach — is the ugly underbelly to all of the positive life lessons youth sports provide. Rewarding a child solely because of your fondness for or family association with him or her undercuts all of those lessons and leaves a child with one in particular: Life isn’t fair.\n\nStill, if your suspicion is true, there are steps you can take on Kamryn’s behalf. More importantly, there are positives you can find from this situation that could ultimately strengthen your daughter’s resolve for softball or whatever endeavor she pursues.\n\nHave a question for Coach Steve that you want answered in a future column? Email him! sborelli@usatoday.com\n\n1. Strong and direct communication. Transparency is crucial\n\nThe subject of All-Star selections can be an elephant in the room for players, coaches and parents all season. It doesn’t have to be.\n\nIf you’re a coach, coordinate with league officials on a clear selection process ahead of the regular season. Before the season starts, share details with all of the families in the league about how the All-Star selection process will be conducted.\n\n\"Local league officials, they do have a responsibility, if a parent has a question, to talk them through that,\" Velte says. \"And as long as they’re consistent with their process — 'before the season, this is what we told you this is what we’re going to do' — then parents are gonna have to accept the roster that the team has selected.\"\n\nLittle League offers suggested steps for how to choose these tournament teams. Velte, who has worked for Little League International for 22 years and is a Little League dad himself, has found the best selection method is to let players throughout the Little League select the balance of the team.\n\n“Every kid has that dream of making it to the World Series ... and they know who the best players are in the league,\" he says, \"and the kids are gonna select the best players because they want to make it to the World Series. And so we always will recommend to local leagues that they select the team, then have the coaches fill in some spots.”\n\nYou can use this line of thinking with Kamryn’s situation. Regardless of his method for selecting his All-Star team, was this coach transparent about how he selected it? Did he let players throughout the league vote on the team? If he has nothing to hide, he should give you a reasonable explanation for your daughter’s omission.\n\nDocument what he tells you about his selection process. If you don’t get a satisfactory answer, take what he tells you to your district administrator. This step will at least pave the way for a fairer process next season.\n\n2. Focus on the season-long experience, not just what happened at the end\n\nSometimes the experience itself is the teacher. But don't take my word for it. Listen to Greg Olsen, Pro Bowl tight end, lead analyst for NFL games on Fox and father to a fourth-grade basketball player.\n\nDespite his career status, Olsen admitted he's not an expert on sports parenting and youth sports. So, he started Youth Inc Podcast as a teaching tool for himself and others on the precarious subject.\n\n“I’ve made a lot of mistakes,” he told USA TODAY Sports. “I don’t pretend to have all the answers.”\n\nOver the winter, Olsen helped coach his daughter’s basketball team. The team didn’t win a game and yet, at the end of the school year, when his daughter and her classmates were asked to paint a picture of their most memorable moment of fourth grade, three girls (including his daughter) painted themselves after a basketball game with the team.\n\n“There were games we didn’t score a point, and here they are, they’re like, ‘We can’t wait to do it again,’ ” Olsen says. “So like that was really cool.”\n\nThe required Diamond Leader training that Little League tournament coaches go through doesn't emphasize winning or competing at the All-Star level. Instead, the program focuses on the social an emotional aspect of sports, such as building confidence, working as a team and learning from failure.\n\nTalk to Kamryn about her season as a whole and what she remembers about it, especially the moments she shared with teammates in victory and defeat. These core lessons are what youth sports are supposed to be about.\n\nThen think about a moment in life where you didn’t get something you thought you earned, and share the story with your daughter. Ask her about what she has learned about her All-Star experiences. You can even use it as motivation for her.\n\n3. Learn from the moment, and then let it roll off your back\n\n“Your role as a volunteer Little League coach is more important than you may realize,” ESPN personality Jessica Mendoza, a two-time Olympic softball medalist and Little League mom says in the Diamond Leader training video for coaches. “It goes far beyond the actions that happen on the field. The influence that you have as a role model in the young lives of these children will be one that will impact their lives for years to come.”\n\nLittle League admittedly leans heavily on its local volunteers. It’s not a perfect system, as some of those volunteers want only what’s best for their kids. But when you don’t truly earn your place on a team, where is the life lesson? Being left off can prove much more profound.\n\nWhen I coached my son's basketball team in a fourth grade rec league, I didn’t select him for the league's All-Star team because we had players more deserving than him. He pouted at the time but is now playing competitive basketball as a seventh grader. My older son was never invited to play Little League All-Stars. He pouted at the time, but he is now playing on his high school baseball team.\n\nKamryn has so much in front of her. It sounds like she is a strong player and has every reason to keep working to get better.\n\nBy emerging from this situation, perhaps she has even taken the first step toward separating herself from the pack in the future.\n\nSteve Borelli, aka Coach Steve, has been an editor and writer with USA TODAY since 1999.

They chanted, bounced cars up and down and screamed in jubilation.\n\nKatie Marks and Aaron Jarvi were among the droves of Lions fans celebrating there in the hours after the game ended.\n\nHaving made the trip to Detroit from Marquette, Sunday’s victory was one well worth celebrating.\n\n“It was unreal, it was indescribable,” Marks said as a procession of cars honked in celebration.\n\nFans stood on tailgates, singing “Them Lions won again!”\n\nJarvi said it was a feeling he couldn’t even dream of.\n\n“I would’ve never thought it.”\n\nIn the view of DJ Degree, this win gives Detroit hope.\n\n\"It's a big, big deal for us...even if ends next week, we still had a hell of a season,\" said Degree, 29, of Detroit.\n\n\"It gives us hope. We haven't had a winning team in a while. That's all sports, basketball, baseball, hockey. Just to see us turn it around and be going in a positive direction, it's really fun.\n\n-- Arpan Lobo and Dave Boucher\n\nA win away from the Super Bowl, Lions fans are dreaming\n\nFor lifelong Lions fans, Sunday’s win against the visiting Buccaneers felt euphoric – the kind of win that doesn’t even feel real as you exit the stadium.\n\n\"I've been waiting my whole life for this,” said Nick Haddad, of Livonia. “I was born in ‘95, I have literally never seen a playoff run before.”\n\nFor Haddad, the excitement was palpable.\n\n“I work in the area, and I could tell just leading up to the game, there’s an energy around here,” he said. “Everybody’s getting together behind the Lions.”\n\n-- Arpan Lobo\n\nAt halftime, 'I trust Dan Campbell all the way'\n\nAfter the Bucs put together a commanding drive to end the first half, the tie game could leave some fans worried.\n\nNot Sam Nawrocki.\n\n\"I trust Dan Campbell all the way,\" said the 35-year-old Detroit native, enjoying a beer on the concourse in between the second and third quarters. \"We're going for it in the second half, no doubt.\"\n\nHer friend, Laura Borruiker, 47 of Redford, felt a little less confident. But they were doing everything they could to help: both said they wore the exact same outfits they'd chosen last week, when the Lions defeated the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nThey thought the atmosphere was a little more intense during the last game, but trusted the fans would do their part in the second half.\n\n-- Dave Boucher\n\nOthers see confidence shaken\n\nSome other Lions fans, however, weren’t so sure. Derek Kirby, of Flint, wanted to see more of the Lions' trademark grit in the second half, something he said was lacking on Tampa Bay’s final drive of the first half.\n\n“They better get their stuff together,” Kirby said, standing in the concourse near his gate. “They got real soft at the end to let them score in the last two minutes.”\n\nStill, Lions fans felt if they stayed true to what propelled them to the divisional round, a berth in the conference championship was still on track.\n\n“Honestly, I feel like we can pull this off,” said Reed Cortright, 27. Cortright, of Clawson, said the Detroit defense needs to do what it can to limit Tampa Bay to field goals, as he backed the Lions offense to power through in the second half.\n\n-- Arpan Lobo\n\nFather and son travel from Kentucky for their first Lions game\n\nIt's almost 550 miles from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, to Detroit, but Jacob Morningstar and his son Gavin had to make the trip. They could not pass up the chance to experience their first Detroit Lions game, with a birth in the NFC championship on the line.\n\n\"Everything inside, I feel like I'm lifted up, man. Honestly, I feel like there's helium inside of me,\" said Jacob, 33, as they walked into the stadium around 2 p.m.\n\n\"I try not to buy into the hype that the Lions will crush, crush, crush, because I don't want to jinx anything. But man, these Lions are... solid this year.\"\n\nGavin, 7, and Jacob's brother James Morningstar, 27, of Big Rapids, died their hair blue and styled it into mohawks for the game. They're hoping the move propels the Lions to victory.\n\n\"There's no tradition here, but it might be a tradition now,\" James said.\n\n-- Dave Boucher\n\nFans hope to break Ford Field sound record once again\n\nRon and Randi Trombetti, both 36, have been Lions season ticket holders since 2010. They attended the Lions win against the Rams when notably, an ear-splitting crowd set a new record for decibel levels during a Lions game, checking in at 133.6 decibels.\n\n“We’re going to break it again,” said Ron Trombetti.\n\nMore than an hour before kickoff, the concourses around Ford Field were already shoulder to shoulder with fans. Spontaneous chants of “Let’s go Lions” broke out frequently, and anyone brave enough to don Buccaneer gear was greeted with a serenade of boos.\n\nFor longtime fans like the Trombettis, this playoff run still doesn’t feel quite real.\n\n“This is history in the making,” said Ron Trombetti. This week, there’s expectation, but it’s still new for us.”\n\n“I never could have imagined that in my lifetime.”\n\nFor Randi Trombetti, rooting for the Lions is a family tradition. She wore a vintage Lions jacket she said belonged to her grandfather, who was also her namesake. While her grandfather isn’t here to see the Lions playoff run, Randi Trombetti said this team has sparked fond memories already.\n\n-- Arpan Lobo\n\n‘Brand new Lions’ playoff run reminding fans why they love this team\n\nDetroiters Shannon Green and Wayne Gardner weren’t attending Sunday’s game but made sure to get down to Ford Field to tailgate. For Green, this “unprecedented” Lions run has her reminiscing about why she became a Lions fan in the first place.\n\n“It’s just different for me,” she said. “I’m a Lions fan because of my dad. We used to talk about the games, I took him to a few games. He’s not here anymore to see this, but it’s like, we have to win for him. I think about that, I’m nostalgic.”\n\nBefore the Lions’ victory in the Wild Card round, Detroit hadn’t won a playoff game since the 1991 season. They haven’t won two playoff games in a single season since 1957 – before the Super Bowl even existed.\n\nA win against Tampa Bay would send Detroit to the NFC Championship game against the San Francisco 49ers. Gardner didn’t have any nerves about the visiting Bucs though, those went away after the Lions sealed a win against Stafford and the Rams last weekend.\n\n“I’m a Lions fan since birth,” Gardner said. “I’m ecstatic, man.”\n\n-- Arpan Lobo\n\nPredictions:Tampa Bay a tough but winnable matchup at home for Detroit Lions\n\nLongtime fans cautiously confident\n\nLongtime fans Jason Clinton and his crew were cheery and comfortable, sheltering with a handful of propane heaters, several canopies and a fully stocked bar. The 45-year-old from Milford says he's been a season ticket holder his entire life and feels cautiously confident – if a little nervous – about the Lions' chances against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n\"Any given Sunday, right? Anything's possible. But no, Campbell will have them ready to go. Am I nervous? Yeah, just because you should be,\" Clinton said.\n\n\"Just gotta handle business today. Definitely nervous about that, I mean, how could you not be.\"\n\nShelby Berger, 42, of Birmingham said this level of success from Detroit is a bit surreal. But he's excited to join the 65,000-faithful fans a few rows back from midfield to cheer on his home team today.\n\n\"This is unchartered territory, in terms of how good the squad is. We're looking forward to today,\" Berger said.\n\n-- Dave Boucher\n\nDC-area family makes consecutive trips to see Lions in playoffs\n\nLions fans traveled from near and far to catch Ford Field’s second-ever home playoff game – Jake Van Woerkom and his family attended Detroit’s 24-23 victory over the Rams in the Wild Card round, and once again made the trip from the Washington D.C. metro area back to their native Michigan to see the Lions’ divisional matchup against Tampa Bay.\n\n“It was crazy. It was one of the loudest games I've ever been to,” Van Woerkom, originally from Grand Haven, said before Sunday’s game. Van Woerkom and family members were tossing a football around at the Rosa Tailgate north of the stadium.\n\nAfter the Lions put away the Rams, Van Woerkom knew his family needed to come back again – a home game with a trip to the NFC Championship on the line was too good to pass up.\n\n“Right after we won, we're like ‘okay, guess we're coming back.’”\n\nVan Woerkom was confident the Lions won’t overlook Tampa Bay, who is coming to Detroit fresh off a blowout win against the Philadelphia Eagles, and said he expected a dominating win.\n\n“They’re a different team, they’ve been on fire lately. But we’re a different team too,” he said, recalling the Lions' 20-6 win in Tampa in Week 6.\n\n-- Arpan Lobo\n\n'It's almost like every playoff game is a Super Bowl'\n\nDespite the premier league soccer blaring from televisions at Thomas Magee's Sporting House, the bulk of the more than 100 people packed inside sported Detroit Lions gear. The bar, near Eastern Market and a few blocks from Ford Field, is the go-to pre-game tradition for Cortez Fulton and Richard L. Robinson, Jr., who ate quesadillas at the bar a few hours before kickoff.\n\nNeither of the 35-year-old Detroiters are season ticket holders, but after enjoying the electric atmosphere of the Lions' first playoff win in decades last week, they had to spring for seats today.\n\n\"It's almost like every playoff game is a Super Bowl. The atmosphere is so great, and you know, I wouldn't want to miss it,\" Fulton said.\n\nRobinson said he traveled to two away games this year, in Baltimore and New Orleans. Even as a lifelong fan, he's never felt more invested in any Lions team.\n\n\"I've been watching these games, and we were losing when I was younger, and I would still watch the game every Sunday. Every Sunday. This means a lot,\" Robinson said.\n\nNeither thought the Lions would suffer a letdown this Sunday, crediting Campbell with ensuring his team was ready. In fact, Robinson was already exploring ways to make it out to California for a possible match-up with the San Francisco 49ers – if the Lions win.\n\n-- Dave Boucher\n\nComerica Park hosts raucous pregame party\n\nHundreds of Lions fans piled into Tiger Hall at Comerica Park for pregame food and drinks. The venue was hosting a free watch party for fans not going to the game, but also had a party-like atmosphere as the anticipation for kickoff grew.\n\n“The vibe is great,” said Nate Bazydlo, 28, of St. Clair Shores. He was attending the game and predicted a two-score Lions victory.\n\nInside the venue, Trick Trick and Eminem’s 2001 hit, “Welcome 2 Detroit,” blared on speakers. The event’s emcee, DJ Bleau, made sure to get the crowd going.\n\nLike Bazydlo, Donna Yaldo, 39, also predicted a Lions victory. She wasn’t stopping at just beating the Bucs, Yaldo went all the way and predicted a first-ever Lions Super Bowl.\n\n“I’m mad, I’ll be on a cruise and will miss the Super Bowl,” said Yaldo, of Detroit. “I want to celebrate in Detroit.”\n\n-- Arpan Lobo\n\nNerves? What nerves?\n\nEven in a sea of Lions fans, David Hauer’s outfit managed to stand out – Hauer stepped into a fan event in Comerica Park in a Honolulu blue suit adorned with the Lions logo from head to toe.\n\nHe’s been a Lions fan for 45 years. Hauer grew up in Eastpointe, but made the trip to Detroit from Cleveland for Sunday’s game. Having seen plenty of Tampa Bay quarterback Baker Mayfield during Mayfield’s time with the Cleveland Browns, Hauer admitted to being a bit nervous.\n\n“I’ve been a Lions fan since kindergarten, I just think I’ve seen us lose too many big games,” Hauer said. “Baker feeds into this stuff.”\n\nStill, despite the nerves, Hauer said he was proud of his team. He said back in Cleveland, he tells friends and coworkers of how Campbell has turned around the perception of the team.\n\n“I was in 11th Grade when we last won a playoff game,” he said. “It’s validating, we can do this.”\n\n-- Arpan Lobo\n\nGiant helmet is one fan's new superstition\n\n\"Where are you sitting!\" the woman yelled at Scott Shephard, looking at the 36-year-old in awe.\n\nShephard, smiling underneath a massive home-made Detroit Lions helmet, smiled.\n\n\"Right in front of you!\" he yelled, the pair laughing.\n\nShepard and his wife, Brittany, 36, both of Willis, were a hit at the Eastern Market tailgate scene. Fans constantly stopped the pair, wearing blue and silver overalls similar to those seen on the famous Big Boy mascot. Others wanted a picture with Scott and his helmet.\n\n\"A buddy and I made it. It used to be for U of M, we painted it for the Lions game,\" Scott Shephard said. \"We wore it last weekend, and that's why they won.\"\n\nThe pair planned to watch the game at a nearby bar, and had total confidence in their team.\n\n-- Dave Boucher", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/uwgb/2018/11/29/uwgb-basketball-retiring-jeff-nordgaards-number-once-unthinkable/2148146002/", "title": "UWGB basketball: Retiring Jeff Nordgaard's number was once ...", "text": "GREEN BAY – Jeff Nordgaard was ready to pack up and leave town after his redshirt freshman season for the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay men’s basketball team.\n\nBefore even playing a game, he determined he wasn't good enough to be an impact player for the Phoenix.\n\nNordgaard asked his father, John, to help him find a school where he could play football.\n\nIt made sense, considering he was a prolific quarterback at Dawson-Boyd High School in Minnesota, which had 47 kids in his graduating class.\n\nBut he never was heavily recruited for the sport, with South Dakota State the only one that offered a scholarship before giving it to somebody else.\n\nSo, if he couldn’t get a scholarship while dominating the high school ranks, Nordgaard realized the offers probably wouldn’t be much better a year into his collegiate basketball career.\n\nSo, he stuck it out. He stuck it out and became one of the greatest players in UWGB history.\n\nNordgaard is the second player in team history to have his number retired, an honor that will take place at halftime of the Phoenix’s game against Belmont at 1 p.m. Saturday at the Resch Center.\n\nHis No. 33 will be retired alongside the No. 25 that Tony Bennett wore.\n\n“It’s an honor that is pretty unique with Tony being the only one retired previously at GB,” Nordgaard said. “It’s pretty elite company. He, in my opinion, was the best player to play here, so it’s a great honor to be able to be hanging up there with him.”\n\nNordgaard, 45, remains all over UWGB’s career leaderboard. He ranks fourth on the scoring list (1,911), second in field goals (773), sixth in scoring average (15.9), seventh in rebounds (701) and eighth in free throws made (352).\n\nHe was the Midwestern Collegiate Conference player of the year in 1995-96 and helped lead the Phoenix to the NCAA tournament in each of his final three seasons.\n\nA few years after he doubted his basketball future, Nordgaard became nationally known in 1994 after he scored 24 points to help the Phoenix pull an upset over the University of California and future NBA stars Jason Kidd and Lamond Murray in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\n\nTied at 57 with just over 35 seconds remaining, Nordgaard buried a jumper that gave the Phoenix the lead for good in the 61-57 win.\n\n“Something clicked,” Nordgaard said. “I was able to go from being a not very good role player to being the go-to guy.\n\n“One thing that did happen was that I had knee surgery between my freshman and sophomore year. I don’t blame any of my average or below average play as a freshman on knee issues, but that is one thing that did happen.”\n\nAnd the other thing?\n\n“John Martinez was injured, so he wasn’t part of that,” Nordgaard said of his first season. “Not taking away from whoever the point guard was that year, and I can’t even remember, but that next year he came back. Not at full strength, he never was full strength again because of knee problems, but he created easy shots for me.\n\n“With that, it gave me confidence. It was kind of a springboard to saying, ‘Hey, OK, let’s look to Jeff as our leader, as our scorer.’ ”\n\nNordgaard has told this story before, but he recalls a game during his sophomore season when everything changed. It happened at home against a bad Western Illinois team in January 1994.\n\nThe Phoenix was losing at half and threatening to be embarrassed, and all Nordgaard could think about was figuring out how to get out of the Brown County Veterans Memorial Arena after the game without anybody seeing or talking to him.\n\nHe ended up scoring 23 points in the final 20 minutes and helped his team avoid a loss, and everything took off for him from there.\n\nNordgaard averaged 15.6 points that sophomore season and 18.6 as a junior. It was nothing compared to his senior year, when he averaged 22.6 points, 6.3 rebounds and shot 55.4 percent.\n\nHe was drafted by the Milwaukee Bucks in June 1996 and is one of five Phoenix players to be selected by an NBA team. The list includes Tom Anderson (1978), Ron Ripley (1979), Bennett (1992) and Alec Brown (2014).\n\nThere were plans being made by former UWGB athletic director Otis Chambers after Nordgaard graduated to retire his number, but he was with the Bucks and then got sent down to the CBA, and it didn’t work out.\n\nChambers eventually was let go by the school, Nordgaard played overseas until 2009 and the jersey retirement just never happened.\n\nUntil now.\n\n“We are fortunate we get to recognize everything he has accomplished on and off the court,” UWGB AD Charles Guthrie said. \"His years as a student-athlete, professional basketball player and leader within the greater Green Bay community makes us proud and ecstatic that we can celebrate his legacy.\"\n\nSince retiring from basketball, Nordgaard has worked as a sales representative for BSN. He lives in De Pere with his wife, Alexis, and sons Dawson and Langdon.\n\nDawson is a sophomore basketball player at West De Pere, while Langdon plays for his middle school team.\n\nNordgaard helps coach youth basketball and uses a lot of what his former coach, Dick Bennett, taught him.\n\n“We are teaching things that none of us coaches learned until college,” Nordgaard said. “That influence that he had helps me become a better coach, but looking back when I was playing, at the time, you don’t realize the effect that he has. You know he’s able to put together a group of Division II players and beat the best of Division I, but you also recognize he’s pushing you harder than you think you want to be pushed and telling you things you don’t really want to hear.\n\n“But at the end of the day, when you look back at the successes and the time we had at GB, I’m thankful that I had Coach Bennett leading us.”\n\nThe last player to wear No. 33 at UWGB will be junior forward Cody Schwartz, which is fitting considering he’s one of the best players in West De Pere program history and a player Nordgaard helped a bit when Schwartz was with the Phantoms.\n\nIt’s also fitting for another reason.\n\n“My son brought home their uniform that they just got handed out the other day,” Nordgaard said. “He’s wearing No. 33, which is the exact jersey that Cody wore in his last game (at West De Pere).\n\n“I’m not someone that is going to say, ‘Hey, nobody should wear (my number at UWGB) because it’s retired.’ It’s fun to see that number out there. … I joked with some of the people at GB when they asked if Cody could wear it for the rest of his career. I said absolutely, as long as he lets my kid wear No. 33 at West De Pere if they retire his.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/29"}]}

More than 300 people, mostly burly middle-aged men in shorts and t-shirts, crowd the courtyard, drinking, dancing and laughing as a drag queen lip-syncs disco from a small outdoor stage and shirtless dancers twirl tie-dye flags on a balcony overhead.\n\nOn this evening, as it is almost every Sunday, Oscar’s Café and Bar is a joyful place. Week after week, Oscar's is maybe the loudest and proudest spot in Palm Springs, a colorful cultural beacon that stands out even here, one of the gayest towns in America.\n\nBut behind the scenes, this beloved restaurant is reeling from the worst crisis it has faced since it opened four years ago.\n\nAnd – depending on whom you ask – Oscar's has been stolen.\n\nOver the past year, Oscar’s has been nearly torn apart by a tug-of-war between two businessmen, founder Jeffrey Schmitz and current operator Daniel Gore, both of whom claim they are the rightful owner of the restaurant. Each man has accused the other of theft, fraud and unfair business practices both in and out of court. Their dueling lawsuits continue today with no end in sight.\n\nAnd all this has taken a toll on Oscar’s, which was deep in debt even before the infighting began. Since last August, the restaurant has lost a liquor license, been repeatedly burglarized, had its Facebook presence erased and twice run short on supplies because of an act of alleged sabotage. At least three employees have reported that Schmitz has harassed or intimidated them and that the owners’ rivalry has jeopardized their jobs and even forced them to briefly apply for unemployment benefits. The conflict peaked last month when Riverside County prosecutors filed misdemeanor charges against Schmitz for allegedly violating a court order to stay away from Gore. There is currently an active warrant for Schmitz’s arrest.\n\n“I guess I’ve won … but it’s sad to me,” Gore said earlier this month, sitting in his empty restaurant before it opened. “This was a dying business. It wasn’t something we should have fought about.”\n\nTo understand the scope of the fight over Oscar’s, Desert Sun journalists reviewed more than 500 pages of court records, financial agreements and internal documents, then whittled down the abundant allegations to only those backed by sworn court statements or supporting documentation, uncovering a surprisingly complex squabble from which Gore appears to have emerged the victor.\n\nAs of today, he has wrested control of the restaurant away from its original owner. Gore says he has spent tens of thousands to dig the business out of debt, but admits he has never paid a cent directly to Schmitz for Oscar’s ownership.\n\n“He got nothing to put in his pocket,” Gore said.\n\n“But he also walked away from here with no debt.”\n\nOscar’s Café and Bar, a pet-friendly brunch place, opened on a corner in downtown Palm Springs in 2013. It quickly became a hotspot in the city’s gay nightlife scene, best known for a weekly “tea dance” party that packed the large courtyard with men, drinks and music.\n\nOn Sunday nights, maybe nowhere in Palm Springs is busier.\n\nBut the tea dance alone, apparently, was not enough to sustain Oscar’s. By the end of last summer, the restaurant had amounted more than $150,000 of debt and was facing eviction. The owners – Schmitz and his silent partner Gene Switzer – were looking to sell but torn between two offers.\n\nThe first had come from an outside buyer who’d offered $125,000 but had plans to rename and restructure the restaurant, possibly shutting down the tea dance, Schmitz said.\n\nThe second offer was a more complicated deal with Gore, a drag show producer who had been managing a performance at Oscar’s for about a year and a half. Gore wanted to keep the Oscar’s name and the tea dance. He insisted, based on the Sunday crowds, he could turn Oscar’s into a success.\n\nSchmitz chose Gore. It’s a decision they both have come to regret.\n\n“I didn’t want to see Oscar’s change or go away,” Schmitz said. “I figured that if somebody else can make it work, that’s great. Instead, it’s really just sad.”\n\nGore and Schmitz inked a deal that worked like this: Gore would become the “exclusive manager” of Oscar’s from mid-August until the end of the year, working to pay off the restaurant’s debt but keeping the money if he actually turned a profit. While Gore was in charge, Schmitz promised not to visit Oscar's without his permission and not to take any free food or alcohol even though he still owned the place. After four months, Gore would have the option of buying Oscar’s for $100,000, payable in installments over three years.\n\nIdeally, Schmitz would escape a failing restaurant with years of a dependable income. Gore would get a great price on a restaurant with dedicated customers. Both men would win.\n\nInstead, the deal began to fall apart even before it was signed.\n\nThe first signs of trouble came from Daniel Powell, then a bartender at Oscar’s, who was chatting with Schmitz shortly before the deal was final.\n\nPowell told Schmitz it was a shame that he was leaving a business he had put so much time and money into. Schmitz allegedly responded that he “wasn’t worried about it” because he was going to “get it back anyway,” according to a court declaration by Powell, filed a year later under penalty of perjury.\n\n“It was then that Jeffrey (Schmitz) told me that he planned to let Dan Gore get Oscars ‘all cleaned up,’ including pay off all the outstanding vendors,” Powell said in the court declaration.\n\n“And then Jeffrey was going to refuse to transfer the liquor license to Dan Gore so that the business would fail and then Jeffrey would take it back.”\n\nIt was Nov. 21 when Gore turned in court paperwork with a strange request – he wanted Schmitz to be forbidden from entering a bar that he technically still owned.\n\nThree months had passed since Gore had taken the helm of Oscar’s, and management was not going as planned. First, he immediately started getting angry texts from Schmitz, who didn’t like a new Oscar’s logo. Second, less than a week after Gore had taken charge, Schmitz returned to Oscar’s to take bottles of champagne and alcohol without paying, according to sworn statements by Gore and another bartender, Aaron Piercy. Schmitz had already broken two rules from the management agreement – no free drinks and don't come on the property without permission.\n\nBut the larger issue, Gore said, was that Schmitz had never handed over control of the restaurant's Facebook page. The page was essential to promoting Oscar's tea dance and drag shows, but Gore claims Schmitz was using it to spread the word about competing shows at other venues.\n\nSo Gore filed a court petition seeking a restraining order against Schmitz, hoping that a little legal muscle would put the issue to rest. He told a county judge that Schmitz had “harassed and intimidated” employees though text messages and hampered the business through “Facebook manipulation.”\n\n“Please stop interfering with the business or its employees you relinquished,” Gore wrote on the court petition, hoping the judge would repeat his words in the restraining order.\n\nA judge scheduled a hearing on the petition about two-and-a-half weeks out.\n\nTwo days before that hearing, the \"interference\" got worse.\n\nOn Dec. 7, Schmitz sent text messages to Oscar’s liquor vendor, Southern Glazer’s Wine & Spirits, cancelling an order and leaving the restaurant with no alcohol. According to a printout of the text messages, filed in court as part of a lawsuit, Schmitz told the vendor it should not give Oscar’s any more alcohol until all of the restaurant’s debts were paid.\n\nAs of then, Oscar’s owed Southern Glazer nearly $14,000.\n\n“Absolutely nothing until paid,” Schmitz texted. “This is Jeffrey, the owner of Oscar’s. The money is coming, but I want it to go to your company. Not some drag shit.”\n\nTwo days after this text message was sent, a Riverside County judge approved Gore’s request for a restraining order, forbidding Schmitz from coming close to Gore or his roommate, Jose Esparza, who was working as the manager of Oscar’s. The order didn't prevent Schmitz from texting other Oscar's employees and he wasn't technically barred from the restaurant, but he couldn’t go there when either Gore or Esparza were on the premises, which would be almost always during business hours. Schmitz was also ordered to give Gore access to the Oscar's Facebook page.\n\nIn his own lawsuit and interview, Schmitz has argued that this restraining order was the centerpiece of Gore’s plan for a “hostile takeover” of the restaurant.\n\nSchmitz said he began texting employees and vendors after the August deal because he worried Gore would drive Oscar's further into debt, then opt not to buy the restaurant, leaving Schmitz in an even deeper hole than when he started. However, once the restraining order barred him from his property, Schmitz was unable to protect Oscar’s from Gore, who “wanted to steal the company, not pay for it,” the lawsuit states.\n\nEven now, Schmitz is still adamant the restaurant is his.\n\n“I’m just dumbfounded that he got away with this,” Schmitz told The Desert Sun. “Right now he is sitting on my property. You can’t just come into somebody’s house and say everything inside is mine.”\n\nOne unexpected endorser of this theory is Esparza, the former Oscar's manager, who left the restaurant after it could not afford to pay him and no longer lives with Gore.\n\nDuring an interview, Esparza said he felt the restraining order petition was unnecessary and exaggerated even though he was one of the victims who supposedly needed protecting. Esparza’s name was put on the petition without his knowledge, he said, and Gore didn’t tell him about it until the day it was approved.\n\nGore claimed Esparza had to be included because they were roommates, he said.\n\n“That was the first time I ever knew about it. I didn’t ask for that, but my name was on there,” Esparza said. “But I didn’t have any reason. (Schmitz) and I never had a confrontation. We never had an altercation.”\n\nGOT TIPS?

Read more here\n\nBy the start of 2017, Oscar’s was still $110,000 in debt and caught in a power struggle. Dan Gore said he was the owner, even though he hadn’t paid for the business. Jeffrey Schmitz said he was the owner, even though he couldn’t step foot in the restaurant. Both men considered the other an impostor.\n\nThe tug-of-war had begun.\n\nGore’s official claim of Oscar’s ownership began on Dec. 29, 2016, when he says he took the option to purchase the restaurant that had been negotiated four months earlier.\n\nHowever, over the next month, Schmitz continued to present himself as the owner, according to a sworn statement from Gore. First, Schmitz canceled another vendor order – leaving the restaurant without beer. Then, he tried to cancel an Oscar's mixer hosted by the Palm Springs Front Runners, a running and walking club, three days beforehand.\n\nInfighting continued like this for another two months, until March 2, when it appeared that Schmitz and Gore cut a new deal in an effort to make peace and finalize the sale of Oscar’s.\n\nUnder the new agreement, the price for Oscar’s would drop from $100,000 to only $45,000, paid to Schmitz in installments of $5,000. Gore would also deposit enough money in the Oscar’s bank account to close it out, then open all new accounts in his name. Finally, Gore promised to cancel his restraining order against Schmitz.\n\nIn return, Schmitz would pay off $31,000 in debt that Oscar's owed to the California Board of Equalization and another $8,600 owed to the IRS. He would also sign paperwork transferring the liquor license to Gore and issue a written statement to vendors confirming he was “no longer an owner.” Schmitz agreed to relinquish control of the Oscar’s Facebook page, and make “every reasonable effort” to transfer the restaurant’s other social media accounts to Gore. The men appeared so confident that they had worked out their differences that Schmitz even signed a “confession of judgment,” a pre-negotiated legal settlement saying if he didn’t uphold his end of the bargain, he would pay $50,000 to Gore.\n\nLess than a month later, a Twitter account ruined the peace.\n\nOn April 1, when the first payment to Schmitz was due, Gore refused. Gore says he had just gotten control of the Oscar’s Facebook page, only to discover the entire post history was deleted, and he still couldn’t access the restaurant’s Twitter or Instagram pages. Schmitz hadn’t upheld his half of the deal, Gore decided, so he wouldn’t either. He kept the restraining order in place and halted the first payment of $5,000.\n\nLater that night, a burglar slipped into Oscar’s after hours, swiping $2,000 from a desk drawer, according to an email Gore sent to Palm Springs police. Three weeks later, the restaurant was burglarized again.\n\nThis time, security cameras got footage of a man rifling through the restaurant. Gore knew his face.\n\nThe burglar appeared to be Chris Munje, who had been hired by Schmitz and fired by Gore a few months prior. Gore suspected they were in cahoots.\n\n“I truly believe the two of these people are working together,” Gore wrote in his email to police.\n\nMunje was arrested after the second burglary and has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Court documents filed in the case draw no link between Munje and Schmitz. In his own court filing, Schmitz called the allegations “false” and said they were designed to “disparage” him.\n\nBy the end of April, Oscar’s had a bigger problem than burglaries – no booze.\n\nAfter Gore refused to make his first payment, Schmitz withdrew his consent to transfer the liquor license to Gore, leaving the restaurant unable to serve alcohol. Without liquor, Oscar’s fell on its toughest times since the infighting began, Gore said, missing out on hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue over the next three months.\n\nEven the most loyal customers lost interest.\n\n“It’s a great place to go have a couple of cocktails, dance your ass off, and have fun and then kind of be home by 8 to go to bed,” said Brock Saucier, who had attended the tea dance regularly for two years but stopped when the license was revoked. “I definitely missed Oscar’s.”\n\nGore tried to sustain the tea dance with free burgers and hot dogs, but with no alcohol the party was doomed. He suspended the tea dance and started opening Oscar's only on Fridays for a drag show. Employee work hours were scaled back so drastically that three bartenders were approved for underemployment benefits, according to sworn declarations filed in court.\n\nEach of those bartenders then received texts from Schmitz, who accused them of breaking the law.\n\n“Unemployment … that is gone. Illegal,” Schmitz texted to bartender Kathleen Bryan. “Bye Kate … you lose.\"\n\nSoon after Schmitz backed out of the liquor license transfer, Gore began pursuing a new license, hoping to get Oscar’s back to normal and the tea dance bustling again.\n\nGore applied to the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, where Schmitz presented yet another roadblock, filing a protest founded on a circular argument. Schmitz said that his name, not Gore’s, was on Oscar’s lease, so the application was erroneous. Schmitz had actually signed an agreement transferring the lease to Gore months earlier, but the transfer was conditional on Gore getting a liquor license. Gore needed a lease for a license and a license for a lease.\n\nEventually, the actual owner of the Oscar’s building, developer Michael Braun, had to step in. On Aug. 1, Braun issued a letter clarifying that his tenant was Gore, not Schmitz.\n\nOne month later, Oscar’s got its new liquor license. Drinks started flowing again. The following Sunday, the tea dance came back.\n\nNowadays, Oscar’s is bustling again under Gore’s control, but the fight over the restaurant continues in court, where dueling lawsuits appear far from resolved.\n\nSchmitz sued Gore alleging breach of contract, fraud and embezzlement in May. Gore responded with a lawsuit of his own, accusing Schmitz of deceit, unfair business practices, slander and libel. Schmitz has also sought to undo the “confession of judgment” he agreed to in March and petitioned for his own restraining order, trying to eject Gore from Oscar’s, which Schmitz claims he is still the rightful owner of. A judge denied the request.\n\nSeparately, in September, prosecutors charged Schmitz with willfully disobeying a court order, a misdemeanor crime, because of an incident back in May when he allegedly violated Gore’s restraining order. Schmitz was seen filming Oscar’s with his phone from the frozen yogurt shop across the street. Judge Anthony Villalobos issued a warrant for Schmitz’s arrest on Sept 22. As of Wednesday, it is active.\n\nMore than anything else, this warrant – the most severe consequence faced by either Gore or Schmitz – encapsulates how prolonged and bitter the battle over Oscar’s has become.\n\nIn separate interviews, both owners said they regretted ever making a deal. Even Gore, who ended up with the restaurant, said in an exhausted voice that he sometimes fantasizes about a peaceful parting where Schmitz is still a proud part of Oscar’s history.\n\nNow, he says, that legacy had been ruined.\n\n“Instead of me saying wonderful things about the person who started it, I don’t even mention his name, if I can,” Gore said.\n\n“Now, as far as anyone is concerned, I started Oscar’s. Because they put me through too much hell.”\n\nReporter Brett Kelman can be reached by phone at (760) 778-4642, by email at brett.kelman@desertsun.com, or on Twitter @TDSbrettkelman.

Clientele have diversified over the years, but the bar's decor remains rich with history. A military uniform hangs from the ceiling, World War II knives are on display, and photos, pins, patches and other memorabilia have filled the walls over the years — most of which have been brought in by patrons. The building itself was reportedly built in 1923 as a service station.\n\nOverstreet and his wife, Julie, still own The Old Miami and live nearby. While there are no fancy drinks and frills here, the bar doubles as a music venue that hosts local, national and international artists. You'll find a live show here every Friday and Saturday. The backyard and patio are incredibly spacious and feature an outdoor bar, a koi pond and bonfire area. Pool is free on Mondays, you can bring in and spin your own records on Tuesdays and cornhole is on Wednesdays. Pinball and darts are available as well.\n\nLocation: 3930 Cass Ave. Detroit\n\nHours: Noon to 2 a.m. every day\n\nThe Bronx Bar in Detroit\n\nThe Bronx Bar is an establishment that was considered much more \"divey\" before renovations, said bartender Bradly Edmundson. However, this bar remains a staple in the neighborhood, known for their burgers, cheap beers, and cheap shots — located near Wayne State University in Detroit's Cass Corridor. Paul Howard has owned the establishment since 2002, however the bar first opened in 1937.\n\n\"So many generations come through here now,\" Edmundson said. Years ago, the neighborhood was \"sketchy\" enough to deter young people, but today, college students, and even parents dropping them off or visiting, come in here for a quick bite, drinks or a game of pool. Two juke boxes are available, as well as pinball and an outdoor patio.\n\nLocation: 4476 2nd Ave., Detroit\n\nHours: 11:30 a.m. to 2 a.m. on Monday and Thursday 3 p.m. to 2 a.m. on Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday\n\n\n\nJumbo's Bar in Detroit\n\nLocated on Third Street, Jumbos is another long-standing dive bar in Cass Corridor. Steve Demoff, nicknamed Jumbo, opened the watering hole in 1940. His daughter, Cindy Furkovich, runs the establishment today, along with her daughter Stephanie. The bar does not offer food; it is your typical shot and beer bar with no air conditioning or even windows.\n\n\"I'm still here, it's been in the family all these years,\" Furkovich said.\n\nJumbo's features an easily identifiable green brick exterior, a bathroom adorned with graffiti art, an operating vintage cigarette machine, a pool table and pinball. The mural outside is a recent addition, painted around 5 years ago.\n\nLocation: 3736 3rd Ave., Detroit\n\nHours: 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. every day\n\nCutter's Bar and Grill in Detroit\n\nRight in the middle of all the warehouses and butcher facilities of Eastern Market is Cutter's Bar and Grill. Owned by Charles Nolan for 19 years, Cutter's is known for their delicious steak bites, wings, loaded baked potatoes and especially their juicy burgers. The bar was formerly known as Joey's Meat Cutters.\n\n“We use fresh hand-patty burgers that we get from the Eastern Market right here. We’ve been getting our hamburger meat from there for 19 years,\" said general manager Chimika Harris. \"We have an 8 oz., a 16 oz., and a 32 oz. burger.”\n\nIn the late 1960s/early 1970s, the bar was under the ownership of the infamous Purple Gang. The proof is there to this day; you'll find photos of the gang displayed inside. While it was long regarded as a genuine dive bar, such categorization might be contested now, as Cutter's underwent a recent remodeling following a fire incident in April 2022. Today, the bar boasts a jukebox, numerous TV screens, and ample indoor seating.\n\n“One of our most popular (drinks) is our Cutter’s punch, and margaritas,\" said Harris. “We do $5 long islands, long beach, and blue MFs every day, all day.”\n\nLocation: 2638 Orleans St., Detroit\n\nHours: 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Monday 11 a.m. to 11 p.m. Tuesday through Thursday 11 a.m. to midnight Friday and Saturday Closed on Sundays\n\n\n\nDetroiter Bar in Detroit\n\nThe Detroiter Bar, owned by Evan Cossette, is the perfect mix for those after a good ball game or a delicious Greek meal. Tyler Tocco, the general manager, said they have a mix of both Greek food and bar food.\n\n\"We are relatively really close to Greektown, so we have a lot of Greek-infused menu items like saganaki, a classic Greek salad with Niki’s dressing, then we have all kinds of gyro meats and stuff like that,\" Tocco said. “Over the years, we trended more towards a sports bar atmosphere compared to a strictly Greek dive bar. We do have a lot of burgers, chicken sandwiches, stuff like that more than we used to.”\n\nWhen Cossette purchased Detroiter Bar in 2014, an additional 14 draft lines were added. The space, now with 20 beers on tap, primarily uses Michigan brands. Happy hour is from 2-6 p.m. daily. Beers such as Summer Shandy, Dirty Blonde, Oberon, and Blue Moon are available for $3. Well-liquor drinks are also $3. The bar even offers free shuttle services to local sporting events and major concerts. While free, tips for the driver are encouraged.\n\nLocation: 655 Beaubien Boulevard, Detroit\n\nHours: 11 a.m. to midnight Sunday through Thursday 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays\n\n\n\nYe Olde Tap Room in Detroit\n\nYe Olde Tap Room in Detroit's east side has been in operation since the 1910s. The business served as a tavern for only one year before Prohibition was implemented in Michigan.\n\n\"Ye Olde Tap Room owes its existence to Prohibition,\" according to their website. Anticipating the ratification, the tavern \"was built at the end of the trolley tracks to operate as a blind pig.\"\n\nIllegal activity echoed throughout the whole building as Ye Olde Tap Room adapted during Prohibition. Drinks were discreetly served from the basement, the first floor transformed into a trolley line comfort station, the second floor functioned as a gambling area and the third floor housed a brothel. Today, the bar operates out of a part of the building that housed one of Detroit's first pigeon clubs, and the second and third floors have been turned into apartments.\n\nLongtime owner Russell Mack died in 2022; once he took over in 1972, the bar began offering more than 250 specialty beers from 23 countries, and more than 32 Single Malt Whiskies. Mack's son, Russell Mack Jr., has since taken over the business but has kept things intact — vintage tap handles collected by his father remain on display, beer labels cover the small room with a dartboard in the back, newspaper articles and beer posters can be seen throughout the entire establishment, and all customers are served free peanuts every day. Happy hour is from 4:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. and specials vary each day in order to get customers to try something new, said manager Nick Weredick.\n\nLocation: 14915 Charlevoix, Detroit\n\nHours: 4:30 p.m. to 2 a.m., every day\n\nMarshall's Bar in Detroit\n\nMarshall's Bar, owned by siblings Katie Tomlian and Mike Kappy, is also located in Detroit's east side. The bar was originally purchased by their father in 1974 and has since stayed in the family. Kappy said Marshall's has always been a drinks-only place with prices cheaper than other places.\n\n“Every day is happy hour here. We’re cheaper than most bars around here,\" said Kappy. “Most of our beers are like $3. We have some that are $2.50, and some that are $1.50. Whiskey could be from $3 to $9 depending on what it is.”\n\nThey have a large variety of beer and seltzer options ranging from classics like Budweiser and Modello to seltzers such as Topo Chico's and White Claws. While the bar doesn't serve food, customers are encouraged to bring in their own from local restaurants. Both indoor and outdoor seating are available. The outdoor patio is located right on the Fox Creek Canal, where kayakers often travel and dock at the location, stopping in for a cold beer or two. Kappy said the patio is a customer favorite in the summer, and they like to host bonfires and have an occasional barbeque.\n\nIndoors, the space has a dart board and a jukebox. They also have trivia every Monday night and an occasional band makes an appearance for a performance. Tomlian said they plan to host a Rummikub tournament in the near future, as customers often play the game and enjoy doing so.\n\nLocation: 14716 E Jefferson Ave., Detroit\n\nHours: Noon to 2 a.m. every day\n\nMore:Buddy's Pizza coming to Michigan Stadium, Crisler Center, Yost Ice Arena in 5-year deal\n\nWhiskey in the Jar in Hamtramck\n\nThe building that houses Whiskey in the Jar today was built in the 1910s and was originally a textile dye shop. Although the exact date of its transformation into a bar is uncertain, the current owner, Tom Jankowski, estimates it was in the early 1930s.\n\n\"I grew up across the alley from the bar and my mother told me it was there since before the war, which was World War II,\" he said.\n\nPreviously operating as Mr. Joe's Bar, the establishment has been known as Whiskey in the Jar since the year 2000, when Jankowsky bought the place. Polish beer and Polish blackberry liquor are highly favored at this Hamtramck bar, and well drinks are always $3. Patrons can play a game of pool or enjoy a drink on the patio that fits more people than the bar itself.\n\nIf you're looking for a place to spend Paczki Day each year, Whiskey in the Jar hosts an annual party for customers to celebrate with food and drinks.\n\nLocation: 2741 Yemans Avenue, Hamtramck\n\nHours: 4 p.m. to 2 a.m. every day\n\nNew Dodge Lounge in Hamtramck\n\nThe New Dodge Lounge is a two-story dive bar in Hamtramck, owned and operated by Happy Life Hospitality since June 2022 — an official hospitality group in Michigan. The bar has been around since the 80s, and although it is under new ownership, the original name has been retained, said Director of Operations Matthew Zacklan.\n\nYou won't find a food menu, but cocktails, draft and canned beer, and an array of spirits keep the place busy. Thursday through Sunday, The New Dodge Lounge showcases live music, hosting an array of local bands spanning various genres, including punk rock, metal, R&B and more. Unique features such as vintage arcade games, skee-ball and an art gallery featuring local artists sets this dive bar apart from the rest. Reportedly, a Prohibition tunnel can even be seen from the men's restroom.\n\nLocation: 8850 Joseph Campau Ave., Hamtramck\n\nHours: 6 p.m. to midnight Thursday through Sunday Closed Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday\n\n\n\nBumbo's Bar in Hamtramck\n\nBumbo's Bar is not your typical shot and beer bar in Hamtramck. This neighborhood establishment offers great cocktails without the cocktail bar vibe or prices, it is \"a true best-of-both-worlds scenario that I think we do well,\" owner Tia Fletcher said. \"We have a fun, approachable cocktail menu, a thoughtful beer list and 15 fun, rotating non-alcoholic menu options.\"\n\nPrior to Fletcher purchasing the bar in 2015 with Brian Krawczyk, it was the longest family owned and operated bar in Hamtramck, known as K. Hanks Lounge. Fletcher has been the sole owner since 2019 and recently received Detroit News clippings of the bar being raided during Prohibition in 1923 — the earliest available records of the bar’s history. The original tin ceilings, wooden coolers, decorative bar mirrors, neon bar sign, subway tiled bathrooms and other features are all still intact.\n\nYou'll find a pool table, an analog jukebox and Turner Classic Movies always playing on TV. Bumbo's spacious, plant filled, covered patio has become a little oasis in the city, Fletcher said. As for food, the bar is trying out popups throughout the summer; currently, Pietrzyk Pierogis are stationed outside Bumbo's every Monday, from 7-11 p.m.\n\nLocation: 3001 Holbrook Ave, Hamtramck\n\nHours: 7 p.m. to 2 a.m. every day\n\nRustic Cabins Bar in Grosse Pointe Park\n\nRustic Cabins Bar has been around for more than 100 years and is owned by Bob Conlin.

It was built as a pool hall and blind pig in 1923; the Purple Gang supplied liquor here through a tunnel in the basement during prohibition. Its founder, John Bozymowski, along with several family members, lived in the building until a tragic fire broke out in the late 1960s. After the fire, everyone moved out and the bar expanded.\n\nToday, Gold Star Bar is owned by Joanne Christoff and her husband, Dan. Bozymoski's granddaughter, Valorie Trusewizc-McGraw, still works the bar a couple days a week and is close friends with the owners.

I saw some of my Facebook friends naming their favorite albums for every year they've been alive. Cool, right? You can get neat ideas from social media.\n\nThen I saw some other folks start joining in. And before long, I was seeing Facebook groups getting into it. In a very short time, it seemed to become a minor viral event.\n\nAnd it got me thinking about my favorite albums, from 1980 to 2015. Boy, it is difficult. Some years had so many fantastic albums. Other years, well ... Yeah, they were easier.\n\nIt took me a while. I had to look at charts, I looked for lists of album releases. You wouldn't believe how incomplete and patchy they can be. You have to be a detective to start piecing things together just to make a list that doesn't completely overlook genres like country, hip-hop and some alternative albums.\n\nAfter I'd made my list, I was kind of surprised at how relatively predictable it was. But you know what, we like what we like. I make no apologies for the music I love.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nI started thinking about how this would make a great column. That I could talk about each album, discuss why it made the cut, do a miniature review for each one.\n\nThen I started to face some realities. There are 36 albums on this list. If I did two paragraphs for each one, I'd have this massive story that would eat up too much real estate in the print world. And for online, I'd feel like I'd only brushed on things and would want desperately to build on it.\n\nThus, inspiration led to a special project. I allowed myself to really stretch out and tackle this idea in a special online presentation. It is too large for print, so the Times won't be reproducing it in the newspaper.\n\nWith this special package, you'll get my album reviews, with some album art and a video for each. Yup, I just might eat up your afternoon. Or maybe you'll want to space it out over the weekend.\n\nAnd I want to stress that this is about favorite albums, not best albums. In some cases, you'll often find that there's a superior artistic expression, or a more controversial or critically acclaimed work in the mix ... but it doesn't trump an album that you just like better, for whatever reason. To thine own self, be true.\n\nIn any event, I enjoyed seeing so many people get into this idea on Facebook. And I want to give special props to a musician, music fan and music columnist who I feel fortunate to consider a friend. Thanks, Jon Hunt, for being one of the sparks that got me launched on this project. Music you love is always best shared with people you enjoy.\n\nAfter reading my picks, maybe you would enjoy making your own list. Maybe this will give you some ideas. Or heck, maybe this is a good conversation starter as you get together with your families for the holidays. Maybe it'll make some fun office talk. \"Say, what was your favorite birth-year album?\" For you, my fellow music fans, I hope you have a ball. You may agree with some of the picks, you may disagree, you'll no doubt have your own thoughts. Share them! Let's jaw a bit about our favorite music.\n\nAnd with that, let's get to the fun. I hope you enjoy it, and that it inspires you to think about your favorite music over the years.\n\nThis is the opinion of music enthusiast and audio addict Chris Shields. Contact him at clshields@stcloudtimes.com and follow him on Twitter @clshields1980. Read more of his columns at www.sctimes.com/cshields.\n\nWhen I listen to music, I hear details that make a difference, that leave a mark. If a song isn't particularly amazing in terms of songwriting or construction, genuine feeling and zeal can still elevate it. Take \"Tutti Frutti\" for instance. There's a great hook to it, but what sells it? Little Richard's vocal investment. \"A wop bop a loo bop,\" indeed.\n\nBob Dylan's \"Saved,\" if nothing else, is a triumph of conviction. And by nothing else, I only mean that some will dismiss it for the direction of the content. As the middle of the \"Born Again\" albums (sandwiched between \"Slow Train Coming\" and \"Shot of Love\"), \"Saved\" often gets ignored. \"Slow Train Coming\" has great songs, sounds great and was something new as Dylan \"reinvented\" himself yet again. And \"Shot of Love\" features \"Every Grain of Sand,\" one of Dylan's finest songs.\n\nConviction, I say, and conviction I mean. Listen to Dylan's voice. His earnestness. He is invested in these songs. His passion was righteous, the words and beliefs sincerely conveyed. The gospel stylings he encourages and invests into album opener \"A Satisfied Mind\" gets things going. Hums and affirmations abound, and show that Dylan really is identifying with this sound, with these feelings.\n\nAt the time of release, Dylan often spoke of his belief that Jesus' return was nigh, that the end times were upon us and that any moment we'd face Armageddon. There's fear, there's guidance, strong declarations of faith and stirring warnings in this music. And you'd better believe that Dylan puts everything he has into this album. He sounds so committed, you can't help but believe the dedication. It's potent stuff, no matter your religious outlook.\n\nYou don't have to share the beliefs to appreciate the sincerity, or even to be moved by the outpouring of faith. You'll get portions of devotion and grace with condemnation and hellfire. And Dylan tends to work some magic when he is properly motivated. Considering the uneven quality of Dylan's 1980s albums, it is worth noting the high quality with which he started the decade.\n\nI think one reason \"Saved\" gets little love is that it tends to go unrepresented in compilations, and the period hasn't really gotten any love in the \"Bootleg Series\" collection so far. But some artists don't work well in a \"greatest hits\" or \"best of\" situation. In Dylan's case, there are precious few actual \"hits\" but so many high-quality compositions and performances. So maybe \"Saved\" also gets lost in the shuffle because of so many wonderful records. But with such great songs as \"Pressing On\" and \"In the Garden\" among the tracks, this is an album that really deserves reappraisal. This material is inspired, his performances top notch.\n\nI know, I know, reading about and listening to \"Christian music\" isn't always the cool thing to do. But I encourage you to listen to Dylan's take on the gospel/faith genre. When he tackled this material, it wasn't to tap into a solid commercial base. If anything, it put him on dangerous financial grounds. The guy refused to do his best-known songs in concert and would only perform his new, Christian-aligned material. Hard to entice old and new audiences with that. But artists follow their inspirations and instincts. Even if it was a path Dylan would soon abandon (at least in a direct musical fashion), it took great courage to pursue higher truths and find spiritual, personal fulfillment.\n\nAnd it led to a great album.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1980\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nBilly Joel's \"Glass Houses.\"\n\nQueen's \"The Game.\"\n\nAC/DC's \"Back in Black.\"\n\nABBA's \"Super Trouper.\"\n\nJohn Lennon & Yoko Ono's \"Double Fantasy.\"\n\nSome concept albums can feel overblown. Pretentious. Bloated.\n\nAnd taken at face value, a concept album that charts the successful opening and the eventual dilapidated closing of Chicago's Paradise Theatre, and also incorporates elements to mirror the evolving social and economic realities in contemporary times, certainly sounds like it could be, er, well ... overreaching.\n\nBut it is one of those rare marvels, a single-record concept album that works AND carries the concept throughout with enjoyable music, memorable melodies and some bombastic choruses.\n\nWhen I was growing up, we had three Styx albums in the house: \"The Grand Illusion\" and \"Pieces of Eight\" on vinyl, and \"Paradise Theatre\" on cassette. And while I spent most of my time with Beatles records, hearing the bombastic and catchy-as-heck music by Styx definitely grabbed my attention.\n\nWhen my father loaned me some of his cassettes, I was curious about the \"Paradise Theatre\" tape. I recognized a couple of songs (like \"Too Much Time on My Hands,\" \"The Best of Times\" and \"Snowblind\"), but the others? Brand new. And I remember my first listen. I was sitting next to my bed, with my dad's headphones on. When \"A.D. 1928\" started up, I had to check the cassette lineup. Isn't this \"The Best of Times?\" Nope! But it established the narrative musical thread. And it segues directly into \"Rockin' the Paradise,\" a very cool li'l rock track.\n\nI'm an unabashed Styx fan. I love the pure pop confection of \"Lorelei.\" I really dig the almost Beach Boys-esque arrangement of \"Mademoiselle\" (if you think about the \"20/20\" and \"Sunflower\" era of the Beach Boys, maybe you'll dig where I'm coming from). I think that all members of the band, but most especially Dennis DeYoung, Tommy Shaw and James Young, were able to tap into a spirit that is so American — bold, brash, occasionally dramatic but with an embrace for the good things in life. And \"Paradise Theatre,\" a No. 1 album for the group, should have helped establish the group's legacy in American music. And maybe it did, for those listeners who don't get too hung up on what's \"hip.\"\n\nBut maybe the album is better known for its controversy. If you Google backward messages and Styx, I'm sure you'll find everything you'd want to know about the Parents Music Resource Center and the allegations of satanic messages in the music, particularly \"Snowblind.\" It's a fun story, popular, but it just isn't true — Styx wasn't trying to warp minds with unholy images and messages. But I'm betting the headlines didn't hurt the band get some sales from curious younger (and older) listeners.\n\nStill, Styx is Styx. Bad headlines, bad reviews, bad impressions, polarization of fans in a \"Dennis camp\" or a \"Tommy Camp,\" Styx seems to regularly find itself on the receiving end of misfortune. It's a shame. But that's where I can let the music speak for itself.\n\nUnfortunately, good music or not, some bands seem easier to dismiss. As I've written before, Styx is one of those bands people say they just don't like. But if you give them a chance, and \"Paradise Theatre\" in particular, you might just hear a few songs (or a whole album) that you'll find refreshing. Set aside popularity contests, unburden yourself of the need to diss \"uncool\" music and give yourself permission to embrace the pop-rock goodness of Styx.\n\nOr just groove to \"Rockin' the Paradise\" in the safety of your car, bedroom or office.\n\nSo, whatcha doin' tonight?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1981\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Hard Promises.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Sorry Ma, Forgot to Take Out the Trash.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Shot of Love.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Tattoo You.\"\n\nJoan Jett & The Blackhearts' \"I Love Rock 'n Roll.\"\n\nI read about it before I ever heard the record.\n\nI'm sure I was reading a John Lennon biography and I'd gotten to the post-murder material, when reactions and tributes were discussed. No doubt there was a mention of the track \"Here Today\" on \"Tug of War,\" Paul McCartney's first album to follow Lennon's death.\n\nThe curiosity was planted. Obviously, I knew some of McCartney's solo stuff. You couldn't be a big Beatles fan like I was and not have been exposed to \"Band on the Run\" and other material. But the only connections I had to most of the \"Tug of War\" material came from some of the songs being featured in McCartney's feature film \"Give My Regards to Broad Street\" (though in re-recorded form).\n\nHearing the album the first time, I was struck by the variety of styles and how McCartney's gift as a tunesmith hadn't been hurt by the loss of his friend and former songwriting partner. Even the oft-mocked \"Ebony and Ivory\" holds its own (yes, the white keys and black keys on a piano might actually lead to more dissonance than harmony, but Paul and Stevie Wonder still get the noble point across).\n\nTwo of my favorites on the album, \"Wanderlust\" and \"Ballroom Dancing,\" are pure McCartney — I can't imagine anyone else writing them. \"Wanderlust\" is a cousin to \"Mull of Kintyre,\" this irresistible melody that feels somehow timeless. \"Ballroom Dancing\" more fits the mold of \"When I'm 64,\" \"Your Mother Should Know\" and \"You Gave Me the Answer.\" It's the kind of song that would appeal to moms and grandmas, but with a bouncier track. Fun for the sake of fun.\n\nAnd what can be said about \"Here Today\" that hasn't been said over the years? Paul sings to John, and he is holding back the tears no more. If you've seen Paul perform the song in concert the last several years, he often does tear up, choke up, the emotions are palpable. Paul lost a brother, a partner, a rival, an important figure in his life. The song conveys that in every possible way.\n\nReally, when it comes right down to it, there aren't any songs I dislike on \"Tug of War.\" The title track and \"Take It Away\" are pure Paul at his best. And the album's other duet with Stevie Wonder, \"What's That You're Doing,\" basically lays the groundwork for Michael Jackson's \"Thriller.\" Stevie's scatting at the end is ... odd, but fun.\n\nThere are link tracks, brief interludes. Maybe some folks would call them scraps, or would find them jarring. Me, I find them to be emotional and creative transitions.\n\n\"Tug of War\" is an album that justifies every view of McCartney as a musician, for good or bad. It stands as a synthesis of McCartney's skills as a Beatle, as a solo artist and as the leader of Wings. And \"Tug of War\" climbed to No. 1. It established itself as a classic, one that sets a standard that all following McCartney albums have had to measure against.\n\nPaul weathered the storm after Lennon's untimely death, and emerged from the darkness with an album that still stands the test of time today. He endured his own internal and external tugs of war, and came out on top. You gotta respect that.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1982\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nRichard and Linda Thompson's \"Shoot Out the Lights.\"\n\nQueen's \"Hot Space.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"The Nylon Curtain.\"\n\nPrince's \"1999.\"\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Thriller.\"\n\nYou can learn a lot about a person when you talk about favorites. And you can learn a lot about Pink Floyd fans from their favorite albums.\n\nI honestly have different favorites based on my moods. Sometimes I want \"Wish You Were Here,\" sometimes I want \"Meddle,\" sometimes I want \"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn,\" etc.\n\nBut one album that I always find myself putting on the list, at No. 1 or No. 2, is \"The Final Cut.\"\n\nThe last studio album to feature Roger Waters, \"The Final Cut\" also is the first Pink Floyd album not to credit Richard Wright as a member. Tensions were high, creative differences had forced some unpleasant ultimatums, and group members David Gilmour and Nick Mason were shunted to the side and used basically as session players. Gilmour, who'd been one of the primary vocalists of the group from 1968-1977, had seen his vocal presence (and artistic input) diminish in the group as Waters took on more of the vocals and asserted himself as the creative force of the band. On \"The Final Cut,\" Gilmour contributes some tasty guitar lines, but he only features as the lead vocal on one track: \"Not Now John.\"\n\nThe drama aside, the narrative of the album is one of the group's strongest. It builds upon themes expressed in \"Dark Side of the Moon,\" \"Animals\" and \"The Wall.\" The struggle to live life in a world controlled by corporate and military forces, humans treated as pawns in a global chess game, the loss of family, isolation, etc. You get it — not the cheeriest content. And how does the album end? \"Two Suns in the Sunset\" might give you all the clues you need. (No? Nuclear annihilation.)\n\nWaters' vocals are strong and expressive. The lyrics are personal, and illustrative. The album unfolds in such a cinematic fashion. And the production? Wow.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" polarizes fans. Some see it as Waters seizing ultimate control for his own glory, and attempting to tank the band. Some see it as the most powerful and focused album in the group's catalog. But with songs like \"Your Possible Pasts,\" \"The Hero's Return,\" \"The Gunner's Dream,\" \"The Fletcher Memorial Home,\" \"Southampton Dock\" and \"The Final Cut,\" it's impossible to dismiss it as artistically bankrupt.\n\nMy younger brother and I got into the album after we'd devoured \"The Wall.\" We were in our mid teens and that kind of power, that kind of imagery, that kind of angst was impossible to ignore. It was passionate. It was fearful. It was angry. And sadly, the themes of the album were still relevant. And they still are.\n\nArt endures, right? And while some of the references may have dated, the sense of betrayal to those who make the ultimate sacrifice, to the families who lose loved ones, to the people who work hard to live their lives only to have \"the powers that be\" control (and end) them, well ... I imagine many of us can understand that anger and identify with the emotional outpouring.\n\n\"The Final Cut\" may have been Waters' final work with Pink Floyd, but what a way to go. You can't ask for a better exit than this.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1983\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Police's \"Synchronicity.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"An Innocent Man.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Swordfishtrombones.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Infidels.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"Hearts and Bones.\"\n\nJohn Lennon was brutally killed on Dec. 8, 1980. He was shot outside of his home. And with his death, many of the dreams and hopes that had taken shape in the 1960s and had endured the 1970s came to an abrupt end. No possibility of a full Beatles reunion. No more collaborations with Paul McCartney. No more concerts. No more songs that were so personal and somehow universal at the same time. No more lyrical gobbledygook that captured the imagination.\n\nNo more Lennon songs.\n\nA couple weeks before his murder, Lennon had released \"Double Fantasy,\" a collaborative album with wife Yoko Ono. The album seemed to celebrate a mature outlook on life, a more domestically inclined point of view. Songs like \"(Just Like) Starting Over,\" \"Woman\" and \"Watching the Wheels\" were welcome additions to Lennon's output, and his song for son Sean — \"Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy)\" — is touching beyond words. But not everything was flowers and rainbows. \"I'm Losing You\" taps into a bit of anger and desperation, and \"Cleanup Time\" is pretty forward looking in how it was time to clear the slate and get moving again.\n\nThe album certainly set the stage for a follow up, one that could build on the positives established in \"Double Fantasy.\" And the material existed, as another album was being worked on simultaneously with \"Double Fantasy.\"\n\nComing in early 1984, a full three years after Lennon's death, \"Milk and Honey\" gave fans some of the final fruits of Lennon's studio labors. And the songs on this new album were fun. Vital. Maybe even a little more scattered or casual. Obviously, the final polishing and mixing with Lennon's cooperation had never been done before his death. But the energy and off-the-cuff looseness of some of the performances make his songs on \"Milk and Honey\" easily the equals of those on \"Double Fantasy,\" and possibly even superior.\n\n\"Nobody Told Me\" may have been meant for Ringo Starr's \"Stop and Smell the Roses\" album, but Lennon's engaged vocal and the snappy arrangement make it one of my favorite late Lennon tracks. \"I'm Stepping Out\" has such a groove, and gives a few clues that Lennon's \"househusband\" role wasn't one he always embraced (just check out his vocal ad-libs near the end at the fade). \"I Don't Wanna Face It\" and \"Borrowed Time\" seem somehow ... foreboding, but without darkness or depression. It's like Lennon had a premonition that the end was near. Listen to the songs, tell me I'm wrong.\n\nAnd then there's \"Grow Old With Me.\" Oh, beautiful. Simple, and showing its home recording demo roots, the song was envisioned to become the kind of standard that people would play at weddings. It is beautiful, touching, sweet without being saccharine, and devastating considering Lennon's death.\n\nOno's contributions to \"Double Fantasy\" and \"Milk and Honey\" are pretty progressive, and show some skill. Ono will always have her detractors, but her songs work to both enhance Lennon's and also to provide artistic contrasts that may have been more commercially viable in the early 1980s than Lennon's own songs. Her talent should not be denied, nor should the loss she faced.\n\nThese albums stand as monuments to Lennon's life, his hopes for the future and for the love he had in his heart. There would be more posthumous releases, but \"Milk and Honey\" and its Lennon songs send the man off on a high note. The rock-and-roller, the guy with the mischievous twinkle in his eye, he was still there. And then he was gone.\n\nThe parting after \"Milk and Honey\" certainly was some sweet sorrow.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1984\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1984 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nVan Halen's \"1984.\"\n\nQueen's \"The Works.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"The Pros and cons of Hitch Hiking.\"\n\nSpinal Tap's \"This is Spinal Tap.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"Born in the U.S.A.\"\n\nPrince's \"Purple Rain.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Let It Be.\"\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Valotte.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Like a Virgin.\"\n\nThe Meat Puppets' \"Meat Puppets II.\"\n\n\"Sometimes I think life is just a rodeo / The trick is to ride and make it to the bell.\"\n\nKnow my first memory of John Fogerty's \"Centerfield\" album? It isn't the use of the title song at baseball games. It's of mowing.\n\nI'd been a fan of Creedence Clearwater Revival's music for, well, pretty much my whole life. I can remember hearing the songs on the radio as a very young boy. One of the first cassettes I owned (a gift from my grandmother) was of CCR's \"Chronicle\" album, a great selection of the group's hits. Fogerty's voice is one of the greats in rock and roll.\n\nSo what does mowing have to do with \"Centerfield?\"\n\nI'd done some reading about Fogerty and CCR that mentioned the acrimony of the group's split. And I remember reading about the comeback that was Fogerty's 1985 album. So I got curious. I picked up a bargain bin copy of the album on cassette. I popped it into my Walkman and got on the riding lawnmower and started to mow.\n\nAnd wow! What an album. What a good, solid, punchy record.\n\nThe album starts off with a sound that is pure Creedence. \"The Old Man Down the Road\" has that classic Fogerty sneering drawl, a ridiculous guitar hook and a jumping rhythm. Apparently others thought it sounded like pure Creedence, too ... almost too pure. Fogerty was sued by the owner of Fantasy Records, the label CCR recorded for. It was alleged that Fogerty had plagiarized his own earlier work, ripping off \"Run Through the Jungle.\" Eventually the case closed in favor of Fogerty. But forget that. Just listen to the song, It cooks!\n\nAnd then there's \"Rock and Roll Girls,\" the song that opens with the lyrics I quoted at the start of this chapter. Fogerty's voice comes across so high and clear, a blast of summer sunshine and hope. \"Hey, let's go all over the world.\" It puts a rainbow in my mind, for sure.\n\nAnd of course, there's the title track. \"Centerfield\" and baseball, the song and the sport belong together. And when Fogerty performs the song in concert, he even uses a guitar shaped like a Louisville Slugger baseball bat. It's a history lesson and a vibe that all fans and participants of the sport can appreciate, can feel.\n\nThere are sounds that put this album clearly in the 1980s, but if you listen to the songs, if you listen to Fogerty as he sings and whoops, you could be forgiven for thinking this album slots in at the end of the 1960s, maybe between \"Willy and the Poor Boys\" and \"Cosmo's Factory.\" That's no faint praise, \"Centerfield\" is that solid, it's that classic sounding.\n\nSome voices in music just have the right feel. A little sandpaper here, a little smoke, the right amount of power and an absolute sense of purpose. Fogerty has one of those voices. His vocals reach you all the way out in center field, and his songwriting just tends to feel comfortable. Lived in. Real. Like an old ball glove, perfectly worn, battle tested and trustworthy.\n\nIt'll be several months until green grass pokes through and we're enjoying another season of baseball.\n\nBut that's OK. We have \"Centerfield.\" And say, do you smell something? I swear, it smells just like freshly cut grass ...\n\nHonorable mentions, 1985\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Southern Accents.\"\n\nDire Straits' \"Brothers in Arms.\"\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Dare to Be Stupid.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Rain Dogs.\"\n\nThe Jesus and Mary Chain's \"Psychocandy.\"\n\nWhen you hear \"Graceland,\" what's the first thought that comes to your mind?\n\nElvis Presley, maybe?\n\nI'd understand that. And hey, Elvis, the King of rock and roll. The man who inspired so many major artists of the 1960s. The swiveling hips, the curling lip. You ain't nothing but a hound dog!\n\nSo if an artist names an album \"Graceland,\" maybe you'd expect ... what? A tribute album? An album in the style of Elvis? Or at the very least, maybe a record recorded at the site?\n\nBut if you're giving Paul Simon's \"Graceland\" a spin, you aren't gonna get that. Any of that. Sure, the title track mentions Elvis' estate. The narrator (Simon) is traveling with his son. For reasons he can't explain, some part of him wants to see Graceland (in Memphis, Tennessee). But after that? Not much Big E.\n\nBut that's OK. In fact, it's more than OK. Paul Simon may have wanted to find something new. He may have wanted inspiration. He may have wanted to visit the site of Elvis' home, to try to plug into the spirit that may have once moved him, but this new album and the songs on it are a big departure. His muse took him to South Africa. Rhythms, complex vocal arrangements, energy ... \"Graceland\" has all the promise and mystery and soul one might expect from Presley's manor, but it all comes in an unexpected direction. Elvis grew up with gospel and soul music, American \"black\" music. Simon comes back with mbaqanga and isicathamiya, South African \"black\" music.\n\nYou get the parallels?\n\nOK, OK, so let's get to the music. It's fresh. It's fantastic. The record came out in 1986 and it still feels so different than what we hear so regularly on TV, radio, the Internet, etc. While the genre of \"world music\" has grown, I still don't expect that I could just spin a dial on the Minnesota AM/FM spectrum and come across Ladysmith Black Mambazo unless it is one of the \"Graceland\" songs the group sings on.\n\nDepending on who you are, that isn't necessarily a good thing. But for me? It opened my ears to different music. Not just genres, like rap or country or rockabilly. Hearing music made in different styles, with different instruments, in arrangements we wouldn't consider conventional because of our Western mindset, it was (and still is) kinda exciting.\n\nOh, \"The Boy in the Bubble.\" THE SOUND. You can be completely consumed in that track. \"These are the days of miracle and wonder,\" indeed. Then there's the title track (I just love the lyric \"the Mississippi Delta was shining like a national guitar\" ... not only because it refers to resonator guitars, but because you can also consider the Mississippi River and the music that has grown out of the blues traditions around it to be a national treasure, a national emblem).\n\nI figure just about everyone knows \"You Can Call Me Al,\" even if you haven't heard any of the other songs. And the video with Simon with Chevy Chase is pretty fun. But what about the other gems on the album? \"Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,\" \"Under African Skies,\" \"Homeless\" and \"That Was Your Mother\" are so vital. And ... can you hear country music in the background? Is that a hint of rockabilly? Sweet lord, that guitar is cooking. Rock and roll!\n\nI guess it doesn't matter if you are visiting Elvis' Graceland or if you're just drawing inspiration from it, maybe there's something transcendent in the experience. Something motivational in the place, in the man, in his music. Maybe it takes you on a search, until you find just the right something, the right sound, the right instrument, the right collaborators. Something that encourages a kind of musical alchemy, a combination of cultures and sounds that leads to vibrant, beautiful sound.\n\nThe music hits us in different ways, takes us down different paths. The journey is what's important, and what you take from it. An appreciation of other cultures? A love for new sounds? What you find on the path is all that matters. And I've reason to believe we all will be received in \"Graceland.\"\n\nHonorable mentions, 1986\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nPeter Gabriel's \"So.\"\n\nQueen's \"A Kind of Magic.\"\n\nMadonna's \"True Blue.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys' \"Licensed to Ill.\"\n\nBob Geldof's \"Deep in the Heart of Nowhere.\"\n\nYou know, I really had no idea that \"Got My Mind Set on You\" was George Harrison.\n\nOh, don't get me wrong. I know he didn't write it. But that sound, that song, that voice ... I'd heard it all over the radio. I remember hearing older kids singing bits of it when I was 9 or 10. That hook. \"I got my mind / SET ON YOU.\" Sure, now that I'm older and pay attention to things like voices, of course it's George Harrison.\n\nBut when I picked up my first copy of \"Cloud Nine,\" I really had no idea.\n\nI picked up a used copy of a CD after The Beatles' Anthology project wrapped up. I'd loved a lot of George's Beatles music, and I owned a couple of the solo albums (\"All Things Must Pass\" is an essential album, gotta have it), but I had never really made an effort to pick up his solo works.\n\nBig mistake.\n\nHere's the thing: John Lennon and Paul McCartney get all the credit for The Beatles. I get it, they were two of the greatest songwriters of the 20th century, one of the most powerful songwriting partnerships. But the sound? That took the whole group. And after The Beatles broke up, Lennon went one way with his sound and McCartney went another. But Harrison? Listen to his music. I often think that George may have been the musical glue of the group. When I listen to \"Cloud Nine,\" I hear what The Beatles could have sounded like had they gotten together in 1986 to start putting a record together. The Rolling Stones had \"Dirty Work,\" and I think this sound could have easily skunked that.\n\nBut this isn't about The Beatles, It's about Harrison's last album released while he was still alive. And it is song after song of great quality. Yes, the album \"suffers\" from the 1980s production and Jeff Lynne's bright touches (as you can probably tell, I don't think the album \"suffers\" at all ... I like the lively sound).\n\nThe opening track is also the song from which the album takes its name, and I love that bass sound, the funkier feel. Starting off the album with this kind of track is brave, in that it isn't a sure-fire hook-driven ear grabber, but it is a wonderful song. Then you launch into other terrific songs. \"That's What It Takes,\" \"Fish on the Sand,\" both songs I really got into.\n\nBut the big songs? \"This Is Love\" is catchy and strident; you feel the breeze behind you. \"When We Was Fab\" recalls \"I Am the Walrus\" and certainly comes across as a tribute to the fallen Lennon. And if you don't love \"Devil's Radio,\" well ... maybe you just like your gossip too much.\n\nAnd there's the last song on the album ... \"Got My Mind Set on You.\" It has that 1980s sound, but with a real feel. The singing is true, and you buy into the music. Go on, listen. If you're not tapping your toe, bobbing your head, snapping your fingers or singing along, maybe your ears aren't working.\n\nThere would be some music released posthumously, and there was the Traveling Wilburys music as well, but \"Cloud Nine\" was the last album of original material to bear George's name while he still walked the earth. And what a joy it is, what a revelation. It feels so good, it makes you feel good. In a way, it puts you on your own cloud nine. Nice when the music lives up to its name, isn't it?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1987\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nU2's \"The Joshua Tree.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"Radio K.A.O.S.\"\n\nThe Replacements' \"Pleased to Meet Me.\"\n\nMichael Jackson's \"Bad.\"\n\nR.E.M.'s \"Document.\"\n\nAll things considered, I'm a relatively recent convert to Beach Boys / Brian Wilson fandom. But as happens with so many converts, I have a tremendous zeal and loyalty now that I'm in the tent.\n\nAnd when I was first digging into Brian Wilson's solo catalog, there wasn't a lot to track down. At the time, the only legitimate releases were Brian's self-titled solo debut, the \"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\" soundtrack, the \"Imagination\" album and his \"Live at the Roxy\" release. (The Van Dyke Parks collaboration \"Orange Crate Art\" is quite good, but Wilson contributes only vocals to it). And the only one of the bunch I could actually buy in stores at the time was \"Imagination.\"\n\nI think \"Imagination\" gets a bad rap. For me, it is one of those perfect summer albums. And I listened to it a lot in the summer of 1998.\n\nBut the summer of 1999? I spent it with Wilson's 1988 effort.\n\nIf you've seen this year's \"Love & Mercy\" film starring Paul Dano and John Cusack, it is this album that Brian is working on with Eugene Landy when Melinda (played by Elizabeth Banks) tries to help Wilson break free.\n\nStrip away the history and the drama (and some of that late 1980s production), and you get some pretty great songs. \"Pet Sounds '88\" might be a bit of a stretch, but it was still the finest collection at the time of Brian Wilson tunes since 1977's \"Love You\" (or 1968's \"Friends\" album).\n\nFrom 1997-99, I was hitting eBay regularly. I bought a lot of Beach Boys / Brian Wilson material (legit and bootleg). And my first copy of Wilson's debut album was an eBay purchase. I remember the excitement I had as I ripped open the mailing packaging to find the CD looking up at me. (I still dig the cover art ... I feel oceans and darkness and light in it).\n\nAs for the music: Want a timeless ballad, with a lot of spirituality and heart? You get \"Love and Mercy.\" Want a cool rock tune? \"Walkin' the Line\" (and its footstep percussion) might get you where you want to go. Want some lovely vocals and that traditional Beach Boys harmony? You have got to try \"Melt Away.\" That's three-for-three in great tunes, and all at the front of the album.\n\nIf you like something a bit more challenging, a bit more progressive, something more \"pocket symphony\" like the \"SMiLE\" music, give \"Rio Grande\" a shot.\n\nMy favorite track on the album is \"Meet Me In My Dreams Tonight.\" The arrangement, the sounds, the sleigh bells! It's Brian freaking Wilson, man! Here he is! He's still got it. And is that a little bit of \"Wouldn't It Be Nice\" in there? Shhhhh ... (And before I forget, I've gotta give a lot of praise to producer, musician, singer and songwriter Andy Paley for meeting the challenges, collaborating with Brian, getting the best out of him, giving Brian the immediacy and versatility he demands in the studio).\n\nWhen the album came out, it received a lot of praise from critics. And the Brian Wilson faithful rallied around it. But it was a different Beach Boys-related project that got the success. \"Kokomo\" came out and it became the sound of The Beach Boys, the song of the summer and the major hit.\n\nYou can say what you want about \"Kokomo\" (and EVERYBODY has an opinion), but none of it changes the fact that Wilson's solo debut is a work of tremendous talent and skill. It feels like an old friend. And that's because the music is from an old friend. An old friend who saw a world full of sex and violence and upheaval, and offered up a little hymn that gives everyone a little bit of what they need — a comforting helping of love and mercy.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1988\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nLeonard Cohen's \"I'm Your Man.\"\n\nKeith Richards' \"Talk Is Cheap.\"\n\nFreddie Mercury's and Montserrat Caballe's \"Barcelona.\"\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys' \"The Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1.\"\n\nSonic Youth's \"Daydream Nation.\"\n\nMy first introduction to The Beastie Boys has nothing to do with \"Paul's Boutique.\" But we'll get to the album soon, I promise.\n\nMy introduction didn't even come from the ubiquitous \"(You Gotta) Fight for Your Right (To Party!).\" No, even that came later.\n\nI got introduced to The Beasties from the unlikely source of \"Beavis and Butt-head.\" At least, that's my memory. I remember my brother and I enjoying some parentless cable TV time and watching a \"moron-a-thon.\" And in one of the episodes, I seem to recall one of the music videos showing this really cheesy, 1970s-influenced cop schtick scene. But that music was so insistent. There was nothing schtick about it.\n\nThe song was \"Sabotage,\" and it is still one of my favorite Beastie Boys songs. But we always tend to have special feelings for our firsts, right?\n\nIt was in the later 1990s, after high school graduation, maybe even during my freshman year of college, when I heard bits of Beatles songs being worked into this, well, audio collage. What the heck is this?\n\nAnd that, my friends, was how I found \"Paul's Boutique.\"\n\nThe Beastie Boys made heavy use of samplings in their music. What makes \"Paul's Boutique\" so special over many other artists and albums that feature the same technique is that The Beasties were very, very, very unfettered in their use of other people's music. And The Beatles' material had never really seen that kind of use in anything before. It maybe even led to some artists and companies to re-examine their policies and restrictions, because of lawsuits (and threats of lawsuits) from the blatant sampling.\n\n(As a brief aside: A lot of the music sampled actually did have permission given for use. But The Beastie Boys paid a lot less for the samples than would become the standard. It is unlikely you'd see people being able to sample Beatles music in such a way again, because it would be so cost prohibitive.)\n\nI don't think it'd be unfair to suggest that \"Paul's Boutique\" changed the industry and shook up hip-hop. It wasn't just in the sampling, either. There are references, musically and lyrically, that work together to create these huge messages and homages. And the variety! This isn't \"thrown in a blender and see what happens\" material. Nor is it noise, for the sake of sound. This is an elaborate aural tapestry, where everything has its place.\n\nThe lyrics are still pretty great today. Consider this material, from \"Shadrach\":\n\n\"It's not how you play the game, it's how you win it / I cheat and steal and sin and I'm a cynic.\n\n\"For those about to rock, we salute you / The dirty thoughts for dirty minds we contribute to.\n\n\"I once was lost but now I'm found / The music washes over and you're one with the sound.\"\n\nThese guys knew what they were doing, from the sampling and to the allegations of how they were contributing to the delinquency of younger listeners, but it also revels in this music. Not just their music, but the music that came before them, the music that they use to contribute to their own sound. Ya know, if it wasn't for the rapping and sampling and the arrangements, this follows a lot of the folk tradition of appropriation.\n\nLet that sink in for a minute ...\n\nOne of the issues I see in classifying music under any kind of genre is that it is package-to-sell labeling. And if you are packaging to sell, you also are packaging to avoid. \"I don't like rap, and that is in the rap section, so I won't like it.\" Ditto country, rock, metal, etc.\n\nBut if you listen to \"Paul's Boutique,\" you get a lot of styles. It's not just hip-hop. It's not just using The Beatles or following usual hip-hop tropes of being \"bad\" or substance abuse or violence. There's complexity, sophistication. Would it go too far to say this material is literate, skilled? No. It'd be totally fair. What's even cooler is that it isn't pretentious, it isn't beating you over the head with a \"look how clever we are\" vibe. It's just, simply, great.\n\nGive The Beastie Boys their due, they were true MCs. They'd do more albums, including the \"Ill Communication\" album that features the song \"Sabotage,\" but my favorite remains \"Paul's Boutique.\" I get something new every time I listen to it.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1989\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1989 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nLou Reed's \"New York.\"\n\nMadonna's \"Like a Prayer.\"\n\nTom Petty's \"Full Moon Fever.\"\n\nThe Cure's \"Disintegration.\"\n\nThe Stone Roses' \"The Stone Roses.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Flowers in the Dirt.\"\n\nNirvana's \"Bleach.\"\n\nDon Henley's \"The End of the Innocence.\"\n\nThe Rolling Stones' \"Steel Wheels.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Oh Mercy.\"\n\nBefore I get to the actual assessment of the They Might Be Giants' album \"Flood,\" I really have to apologize.\n\nIn high school, a good friend of mine tried to get me to give the album a chance. But I was really heavily into The Beatles at the time, and I considered everything else inferior music. And not just inferior, but irrelevant.\n\nTo my friend: I am sorry.\n\nI'm sorry I didn't listen to the music with open ears. There's some fun stuff here! (\"Dead\" is one heck of a trip.) There's some serious stuff cloaked as fun stuff, too. (\"Your Racist Friend\" is some great social commentary.) There's some classic singalong goofiness. (\"Birdhouse in Your Soul\" is just so oddly compelling.) There's a great cover song. (\"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\" is catchy and fun, the kind to crank loudly in the car.)\n\nI'm sorry I didn't appreciate the variety. There's brevity (\"Minimum Wage\" and its whip, ha!), there's comic book hijinx (\"Particle Man\") and great grooves (\"Whistling in the Dark\").\n\nAnd I'm sorry that I was so caught up in the greatness that IS The Beatles that I couldn't appreciate that other music was also great, on its own terms. It took a while, but I got there. I learned that fun music, and pop music, and all kinds of music, are all as important and vital as anything \"serious\" or \"classic.\"\n\nSo ... about the album \"Flood.\"\n\nIt's pretty darn good. It is the kind of album you can love as a 9-year-old or as a 19-year-old or as a 29-year-old. Different jokes hit you as funnier when you have your own experiences. And some remain oddly touching. I first heard \"Particle Man\" as a boy, in an episode of \"Tiny Toon Adventures,\" the spinoff of \"Looney Tunes.\" The lyric seemed so easy, and the animation of the cartoon suited it so well. So when I hear the song today, I remember watching the cartoons with my younger brother, and I remember that video. Funny how we can be sentimental about such light fare.\n\nHow often do you laugh out loud at music that isn't parody, or that isn't strictly comedy music? Because this is real music. And it isn't all laughs and grins. It just doesn't take itself too seriously. The group, the songs, the album all have this open-door communication that is almost childlike without being childish. Sounds and textures and words that come out as these very colorful expressions.\n\nAhhhh, \"Dead.\" Coming back as a bag of groceries? How'd TMBG get there? No idea. But bless the quirkiness. Sometimes off-the-wall is just what you need. Let the world wash away for a bit with \"Flood,\" you'll come out of the album feeling refreshed.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1990\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nWilson Phillips' \"Wilson Phillips.\"\n\nBob Geldof's \"The Vegetarians of Love.\"\n\nDread Zeppelin's \"Un-Led-Ed.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"The Rhythm of the Saints.\"\n\nThe Traveling Wilburys' \"Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.\"\n\nConsidering that Freddie Mercury was dying, and that he knew he was dying, and that his bandmates knew he was dying, \"Innuendo\" could have been a very dark, very sad, very downbeat album.\n\nAnd while the album certainly has its reflective and introspective moments, songs that touch on mortality, \"Innuendo\" is one of the best Queen albums released in several years. It was the last Queen album released before Mercury's death in late 1991, and it sounds like a return to the progressive hey-days of the 1970s albums like \"Queen II,\" \"A Night at the Opera\" and \"A Day at the Races.\" Whereas the 1980s seemed to latch on to R&B, dance music and middle-of-the-road chart pleasers (and I'm not knocking any of that), the edge and energy and charisma in the music was lacking.\n\nSongs like \"The Show Must Go On\" and \"These are the Days of Our Lives\" cannot be seen in any other context than through Mercury's impending death. But the former is active, raging at the dying of the light. \"I'll face it with a grin, I'm never giving in, on with the show!\" I get chills. And the latter is touching, a love song, a song that finds peace in the immutable truth that we all go someday, to enjoy the days we have. \"I still love you.\" Freddie's last four words of the song drive it home.\n\nThe title track recalls the days when the band would construct elaborate multi-section songs, like \"March of the Black Queen,\" \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" and \"The Prophet's Song.\" And the song, written and intended as a sort of homage to Led Zeppelin's \"Kashmir,\" succeeds as a modern Queen epic. It is masterful, powerful and fabulous.\n\n\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\" seems an exercise in bizarre one-liners, and \"Delilah\" is really just a charming ode to one of Freddie's favorite cats (you won't find another song with the lyric \"And then you make me slightly mad / when you pee all over my Chippendale suite\").\n\nWant something a little more rock and roll? \"Headlong\" is more of a traditional rocker, and certainly would have made a concert staple had Mercury been healthy and the band had toured.\n\nAnd the beauty of \"Bijou\" ... rather than being a Queen track that's mostly vocal with a guitar solo, the guitar is the main presence and Freddie's vocal is the solo. And the singing and lyrics are so touching, so wonderful, that I ache every time I listen to the song:\n\n\"You and me, we are destined / you'll agree ...\n\n\"To spend the rest of our lives with each other / the rest of our days like two lovers ...\n\n\"Forever, yeah forever ...\"\n\nFreddie knew he was dying, and he puts his heart into that short lyric. It is electrifying, crushing and breathtaking all at once.\n\nThat's the album in a nutshell: Electrifying, crushing and breathtaking. Every element that had made Queen so great, so alluring, so fun and fabulous, is right here on this album. It was a grand, eclectic, satisfying work with which to bow out.\n\nThere'd be more music after Freddie passed, including the \"Made in Heaven\" album that featured Freddie's last works before he succumbed to AIDS. There'd be live albums issued, and so many compilations of the band's work. Queen's legacy will never fade, the music retains its power and catches new generations by storm with regularity.\n\nFreddie went out on a high note, and who could ask for anything more?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1991\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Gish.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Into the Great Wide Open.\"\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Help Yourself.\"\n\nNirvana's \"Nevermind.\"\n\nMy Bloody Valentine's \"Loveless.\"\n\nEven if it was only \"Drive\" on this record, \"Automatic for the People\" would top my list for the year.\n\nWith \"Drive,\" I was unexpectedly pulled out of contemporary sounds and was rocketed back to ... when? I don't know. Some 1850s Western setting? A 1950s Western TV show? The song has this guitar progression and effect that brings to mind cowboys. It kind of reminds me of Bon Jovi's \"Wanted Dead or Alive,\" but I prefer R.E.M.'s take.\n\nBut the song has transitions and a build in strings, it has processing, it's kind of a throwback sound with a futuristic process. Make sense? No? Just listen.\n\nAnd \"Automatic for the People\" isn't limited just to the glory of \"Drive.\" As far as the well-known songs are concerned, it also boasts \"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite,\" \"Everybody Hurts,\" \"Man on the Moon\" and \"Nightswimming.\" That's a veritable greatest hits collection right off the bat (even if some, like \"Everybody Hurts,\" got overplayed and overexposed to the point where it's hard to listen to the music without an automatic groan).\n\nThe first copy of \"Automatic for the People\" that I owned came in used condition from a store I worked at, and it came into my possession years after the album was recorded. And though it kind of embarrasses me to admit it, I bought it because of the \"Man on the Moon\" song, which had been used as the title song to an Andy Kaufman movie starring Jim Carrey. I liked the song, I got curious, I looked for the original album (avoiding the film's soundtrack). When I found which album the song was on, and saw some familiar song titles rounding out the album, I pulled out my wallet.\n\nYou ever have that one album that is just bliss on a first listen? Where every song seems to hang together, weaving some kind of beyond-words perfection? \"Automatic for the People\" was that kind of record for me. Even when \"Everybody Hurts\" had its turn in the sequence, I was amazed at how much I actually enjoyed hearing it in the album context. It hung as part of the record's fabric. Whereas radio listens never did much for me, hearing it as a part of the greater whole made a kind of sense to me.\n\nAnd of course, I was transfixed by opening track \"Drive.\" I grabbed my brother and played it for him, and we both saw it as an incredibly picturesque, vivid soundscape with a vocal that struck something inside us. I STILL don't know whythat song resonates with me, but it does. \"Drive\" remains one of my all-time favorite R.E.M. songs, and it feels like a major piece just waiting for the right exposure to become a mammoth anthem. The album only came out in 1992, there's still time ...\n\n\"Automatic for the People\" has its big majestic moments, but largely feels more intimate, more pared down. It is music that demands to be taken seriously, with lyrics that insist upon being heard. Everyone has their favorite R.E.M. records, but I don't think the group has ever topped the glory or the beauty of this record.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1992\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1992 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nGreen Day's \"Kerplunk.\"\n\nThey Might Be Giants' \"Apollo 18.\"\n\nRingo Starr's \"Time Takes Time.\"\n\nSonic Youth's \"Dirty.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies' \"Gordon.\"\n\nRoger Waters' \"Amused to Death.\"\n\nSugar's \"Copper Blue.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Bone Machine.\"\n\nBlind Melon's \"Blind Melon.\"\n\nDr. Dre's \"The Chronic.\"\n\nEvery time I listen to \"In Utero,\" I get a tingle of electricity down my spine.\n\nEvery time.\n\nThere's something in the music, something in the sound, something in Kurt Cobain's voice and in the band's collective presence. Something primal and pure, it strikes right at the nervous system.\n\nThere's no doubt that \"Nevermind\" is the group's commercial masterpiece, but \"In Utero\" is my favorite. It's a more organic record, it's got such a punk discipline in sound. The songs feel immediate, even now, more than 20 years after the album's release. Every note, every jagged shot of feedback, every howl feels so precisely perfect on a record that was to be the antithesis to precise perfection.\n\nI've written about Cobain and Nirvana before, and touched on my love for the \"In Utero\" album. But sometimes words fail to convey the power that music holds on you, emotionally and spiritually.\n\nIsolate that bassline to \"Heart Shaped Box\" and tell me that isn't the most supremely wicked, fascinatingly dark sound you can conjure. (You can tell me otherwise, but I'll disagree with you.) I think you could release just that bassline for Halloween CDs and it'd be massively popular in its own right.\n\nListen to that overblown surf guitar sound on \"Serve the Servants.\" Surf guitar sound? How so? Man, imagine Dick Dale in plaid, with emotional baggage, more than a little anger and the commercial clout to do whatever he wants. Then get back to me. The guitar skips and dives, runs up and down, it jitters and it conjures frantic power. 'Nuff said.\n\nListen to the words of \"Dumb.\" \"I think I'm just happy.\" I mean, doesn't that say something to you? Have you ever been able to relate to a mindset where something negative might actually be positive, or vice versa? Sniffing glue? Floating on clouds? The lyrics maybe sound like teenage foolishness, but dig the sound with it. The song is like a burned-out daydream.\n\nOh, \"Pennyroyal Tea.\" How many people did I know when I was growing up who tried to make this concoction? And how many songs do you know that manage to work \"cherry-flavored antacids\" into the lyric? And that sound ... Desperation? I don't know, but it has a soothing quality to it.\n\nWhen I think of all the great work Nirvana did, all the excellent material recorded in the various incarnations of the group, and I reflect on what was lost when Cobain died, the first thing that comes to mind isn't the immortal \"Smells Like Teen Spirit,\" or the baby in the swimming pool cover of \"Nevermind.\" It is the power and depth of \"In Utero.\"\n\n\"In Utero\" was everything that was scary and unfettered and powerful in Nirvana. It was everything honest and dishonest and playful. \"In Utero\" is power and introversion, combined, a sonic and emotional powerhouse that darn few can claim to approach in quality. John Lennon's \"Plastic Ono Band\" is the only album that I'd put above \"In Utero\" for the complete catharsis and pain and psyche examination found in the music.\n\nNot bad for a record recorded at Pachyderm Studio in Minnesota's own Cannon Falls.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1993\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nBob Geldof's \"The Happy Club.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Off the Ground.\"\n\nAerosmith's \"Get a Grip.\"\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Siamese Dream.\"\n\nBilly Joel's \"River of Dreams.\"\n\nI was driving back from a Boy Scouts camping trip when my friend asked, \"Do you listen to much Johnny Cash?\"\n\nI didn't. As I've written elsewhere, my parents weren't big on country music. But I knew some of the big Cash songs, like \"Ring of Fire,\" Walk the Line\" and those early hits. So I told my friend, \"I know a couple songs, but not enough to call myself a fan or anything.\"\n\nHe said, \"Oh, you have to try out this album. It is track after track of good stuff.\" And he handed me a copy of Johnny Cash's \"American Recordings.\"\n\nI admit, I didn't get to it right away. I imagine you've been in the situation where people loan you music, encourage you to try it, piling adjective upon adjective so that you'll listen to it ... but you're just really not that interested. It is no reflection on that music itself, it's more of your state of mind.\n\nAfter a couple weeks, I had nothing going on and was starting to feel bad that I was still borrowing the album and hadn't even tried it. So I popped it in.\n\nWhat can I say? I liked it. But I didn't love it. It sounded good, I liked the variety. \"The Beast in Me\" and \"Drive On\" were pretty cool, and \"Thirteen\" was a dark classic. I enjoyed pretty much all of the songs, but none of them made me want to drop what I was doing and devote my full attention to the record. So I returned the CD to my friend, thanked him, offered a few bland compliments (\"Boy, he sure sounds good on this album\") and moved on.\n\nFast forward five or more years, to when I was living in St. Cloud. Mick Hatten and I were having one of our many music talks, and the discussion turned to Johnny Cash in general and the American albums, in particular. Beyond having heard the first album and then enjoying some of the songs on \"IV,\" I had nothing much to contribute. So Mick loaded me up and my education began.\n\nWhile the \"American Recordings\" album in its own right isn't my favorite of the series, it is nonetheless a landmark album and a treat from start to finish. It is a record that tends to feel like an old friend, a record you enjoy spending time with whenever you put it on. Listening to Cash's voice soar on \"Down There by the Train\" is a treat, and his recitation of \"Delia's Gone\" is by turns sorrowful and regretful, then plainspoken and matter-of-fact.\n\nWithout the \"American Recordings\" album and the series of records under the American label, Cash's legacy would still have been strong and defined by a number of hits and stylistic evolutions. However, the American albums created a foundation for a new image, perhaps even a new myth, of the man in black. The quality was supremely high, the content varied, the myriad styles somehow all brought under the sound of Cash's guitar and voice. He proved himself the master of song, of any song.\n\nAnd that is made abundantly clear on the first record of the American series. For that reason alone, \"American Recordings\" should be feted.\n\nWhat about Tom Petty?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1994 is Tom Petty's \"Wildflowers.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1994\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1994 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nThe new Beatles, man! The biggest thing to hit music since Elvis! The best songs since (insert artist here) gave us (insert song here)!\n\nGet the point?\n\nOK, all those qualities may be exaggerations, but in 1995 all the hyperbole was in the air, on TV and in the trades. It sure felt true, at the time.\n\nAnd \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" was the album that sealed it. Whether or not you liked Oasis, you couldn't have gone through the 1990s without hearing \"Wonderwall\" or \"Champagne Supernova.\" It sounded enough like 1960s pop that oldies stations would play it, and it was a bright pop sound, so it did well on contemporary stations.\n\nI was 15 at the time, and my devotion to The Beatles was nearing its peak. What was this blasphemy? A new Beatles? Hadn't this label been used before? (The Knack come to mind.) Was music so creatively bankrupt that soundalikes were the only way to make it big?\n\nAh, but then, I hadn't heard any of the music. And judging any artist or album without hearing the music for yourself is always bad policy (beware of tastemakers who encourage you to skip something on their say-so ... you have your own ears).\n\nSo I gave the album a listen, and I loved it. The next Beatles? Yes, that was an exaggeration. But darned if the album didn't sound really good. My favorites were \"Don't Look Back in Anger\" (which truly does sound Beatles-esque) and \"She's Electric,\" which to this day is one of my favorite Britpop songs. \"There's lots and lots for us to do / she is electric, can I be electric too?\" Gets me every time.\n\nIn the 1990s, if you were into the Britpop sound, you tended to either be in the Oasis camp or the Blur camp. I didn't listen to Blur much, and I still haven't. I'm sure Damon Albarn and company are great, but ... I had Oasis. I was pretty comfortable with that selection.\n\nOf course, the band's lineup changed over the years. And then brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher had yet another huge falling out (shades of The Kinks and their brothers, Ray and Dave Davies) and Oasis split.\n\nConsidering the \"next Beatles\" label that Oasis itself was pinned with, I won't go so far as to say that we'll never see the like of Oasis again. But records like \"Definitely Maybe\" and \"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\" reflect just how good it was to have the band while it was here. And if you haven't already, check out \"Don't Believe the Truth\" and \"Dig Out Your Soul,\" the band's last two albums. The band went out the way it came in, with two excellent albums and a high bar set for its contemporaries.\n\nSo if you enjoy some good British pop music, with a solid back beat and catchy guitar solos and plenty of \"that sounds like ...\" hooks, you can do far worse than revisiting this Oasis classic. As their song \"Roll With It\" suggests, \"don't let anybody get in your way.\" The album was big for a reason, no shame in enjoying it now. Who cares what some might say?\n\nHonorable mentions, 1995\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1995 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nRadiohead's \"The Bends.\"\n\nSupergrass' \"I Should Coco.\"\n\nAlanis Morissette's \"Jagged Little Pill.\"\n\nThe Presidents of the United States of America's \"The Presidents of the United States of America.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"Clouds Taste Metallic.\"\n\nShane MacGowan and the Popes' \"The Snake.\"\n\nGreen Day's \"Insomniac.\"\n\nThe Smashing Pumpkins' \"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.\"\n\nThe Rentals' \"Return of the Rentals.\"\n\nQueen's \"Made in Heaven.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 1.\"\n\nWhen I first heard Weezer's \"Pinkerton,\" I hated it. Like, HATED it.\n\nMy best friend got me into Weezer, with their debut album, and it took me a while to get into it. But once I got there, I really enjoyed it. Songs like \"The World Has Turned and Left Me Here\" left a big mark on me, and I had a set belief in how the band should sound and the kinds of songs it should perform.\n\n\"Pinkerton\" took those notions and tossed them into the trash.\n\nThe sound was raw, dark. Where were the peppy, geeky kind of songs? I sure didn't hear them in the mix of songs about sex, lesbians and Japanese girls.\n\nAfter the success of Weezer's debut album (known affectionately as the \"Blue Album\"), group leader and main songwriter Rivers Cuomo went to Harvard. He wrote about some confusion, some anger, some physical ailments (walking with an old man's cane), and it all took this kind of anguished, introverted atmosphere.\n\nIf you wanted more \"Buddy Holly,\" you didn't get it. Instead, you got the grandfather of emo records. \"Getchoo\" maybe puts things in the proper perspective: \"This is beginning to hurt, this is beginning to be serious.\" The sound is live, the bass thrums and guitar lines are jagged. Cuomo gives some of his best tuneful howls, and \"Pinkerton\" becomes this great flood of passion and pain.\n\nBut on the first few listens, it just seemed like noise. Melodic noise, anthemic noise, but noise nonetheless.\n\nI think my younger brother caught on to it before I did, really. He listened to it with more regularity, and stuff started to sink in. I started to get into songs like \"The Good Life\" (a song I'll always associate with my brother), and I enjoyed the intricate lyrics of \"Across the Sea.\" And album closer \"Butterfly\" has such a wistful tune and ends with the words \"I'm sorry,\" in a straight-from-the-heart voice.\n\nAnd I think that kind of emotional and stylistic purity is what keeps \"Pinkerton\" so fresh and important to me. Strip away the Ric Ocasek production from the first album, get back to a sound more like a live experience, then dig deep into affairs of the heart and mind and then let loose as microphones pick up the crashing drums, the angry guitars and the exasperated vocals.\n\nThis, my friends, is all your growing-up angst and all those late-at-night-and-in-the-dark thoughts, thrown onto an audio canvas.\n\nAfter I'd finally given in and gave up my prejudices on how Weezer music should sound, I got heavily emotionally invested in the record. Bitter disappointment on the love front? Sure, I can relate. A general feeling of isolation and loneliness? Heck, who doesn't feel that from time to time? Feeling like you're a million miles away from someone who could make everything feel better? Oh, sure, if you've got a romantic stripe in you, you've had to have felt that sometime in your life.\n\n\"This is beginning to hurt,\" indeed. But thanks for hanging in there, Weezer. The pain led to a masterpiece.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1996\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1996 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\n\"Weird Al\" Yankovic's \"Bad Hair Day.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 2.\"\n\nSuperdrag's \"Regretfully Yours.\"\n\nThe Wallflowers' \"Bringing Down the Horse.\"\n\nSquirrel Nut Zippers' \"Hot.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Songs and Music from 'She's the One.'\"\n\nVarious artists, the soundtrack for \"That Thing You Do!\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Anthology 3.\"\n\nWilco's \"Being There.\"\n\nJohnny Cash's \"Unchained.\"\n\nI came to Radiohead's \"OK Computer\" in an unusual way.\n\nI was a sophomore in college and I was playing an online game, and one of my friends on the game was a fella from Australia. We were talking about music, and I was undoubtedly gushing about Pink Floyd (my musical obsession at the time). He asked me about what I liked about Pink Floyd's music. I undoubtedly went into long rhapsodies about the song constructions, how some of the music has an organic buildup, that I could get washed away in blankets of sound, that the lyrics had an odd way of peering into neglected nooks and crannies that other music never penetrated.\n\n\"I think I know what you mean,\" he said. \"You've got to give Radiohead's 'OK Computer' a try.\"\n\nI'd heard, and even liked, other Radiohead material before this recommendation. But \"OK Computer\" was virgin territory for me.\n\nCurious, I eventually wandered out to a store and picked up a copy.\n\nAnd I really wasn't sure how I felt about it, even after a handful of listens. How did my love of Pink Floyd music lead me here?\n\n\"OK Computer\" and its lyrics weren't necessarily personal, they were more abstract. But there was this probing quality to them.\n\nThe music was, well, layered and atmospheric, collages of sounds that would flow together and then there'd be a tension that'd give way to something in a lyric or a vocal.\n\nI wasn't really quite sure how much of \"OK Computer\" was deliberately produced, or how much of it was a product of chance, of pure serendipity.\n\nAnd maybe that was the real hook for me. The music kept me guessing, it kept me involved. The song titles were a mix of standard fare and peculiar (the former including \"Let Down,\" \"No Surprises,\" \"Lucky\" and the latter featuring \"Paranoid Android,\" \"Subterranean Homesick Alien\" and \"Exit Music (For a Film).\"\n\nThe lyrics, the sounds, the song titles, they all appealed to different parts of my head.\n\nI tend to think that music is a very personal experience in life. Sure, you have massive hits that everyone buys and become global anthems. But what we hear in the music, what we feel from the music, what we respond to in the music are very personal. And when you move away from the big hits, the chart toppers, and you're listening to music that is more soundscape than guitar-hero hijinx, it's all about what you find and what you feel and what you take away from it.\n\nI guess I can see the Pink Floyd connection, after all. The material gets into all those nooks and crannies, organic buildups and all.\n\nI may need to track down my Aussie friend and thank him. It's long overdue.\n\nWhat about Paul McCartney?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1997 is Paul McCartney's \"Flaming Pie.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1997\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nElliott Smith's \"Either/Or.\"\n\nSupergrass' \"In It for the Money.\"\n\nJohn Fogerty's \"Blue Moon Swamp.\"\n\nOasis' \"Be Here Now.\"\n\nBob Dylan's \"Time Out of Mind.\"\n\nThe more things change, the more things stay the same.\n\nAn online pal got me into \"OK Computer,\" and another online pal got me into \"Head Trip in Every Key.\"\n\nI think it was around 2013 that a Facebook friend (hi Becknar!) asked me what I thought about Superdrag.\n\nOddly enough, the Superdrag albums I had been exposed to were not their biggest records. Go figure.\n\nA guy I roomed with in college had gotten me into the band a little, and I had copies of \"In the Valley of Dying Stars\" (which I really liked), \"Greetings from Tennessee\" (which was OK) and \"Last Call for Vitriol\" (another excellent record).\n\nBut I had never heard \"Regretfully Yours\" or \"Head Trip in Every Key.\"\n\nBecknar, the passionate gent that he is about music, found copies of both albums at basement prices on eBay and sent me the links. Days later, I had these albums in my hands. Headphones ready, I dug in.\n\nBefore I start talking \"Head Trip,\" let me just say this: If you love 1990s power pop and alt rock, you owe it to yourself to get these two records. Part of me wants to say that Superdrag is almost the Cheap Trick of the 1990s (and in case you have mixed feelings on what that could mean, take it as a compliment).\n\nAs for the music? Oh, man. Think about the 1967 era of The Beatles, like \"Sgt. Pepper\" and \"Magical Mystery Tour,\" with sitars and orchestrated hooks and lush backing tracks. The vocals are crisp, there are tasty hooks and everything sounds so punchy and vibrant. Getting the Cheap Trick angle, yet?\n\nBut Superdrag's members aren't just copying a sound or replicating a style. The best music can pay homage to a sound while also creating something distinctive and refreshing.\n\nLooking for hits or key cuts? You won't find any. The album is a triumph of studio use, but it isn't a collection of radio hits or chart toppers. If you've heard any of the songs on the record, it's likely it was \"Do the Vampire.\" But don't be dismissing the album because you don't recognize the song titles or haven't heard the tracks. \"I'm Expanding My Mind\" has to be one of the great leadoff tracks on a 1990s album, and the group's purpose for the album is right there in the title. Imagine you're outside on a hot day, and you step into an air-conditioned sanctuary. That woosh of refreshment, that sudden relief, an immediate comfort. That's the opening track. Comfortable, engaging, getting you ready for more.\n\nHats off to you, Becknar. How'd I miss this back in the day? It only took me 15 years, but now I'm in love with one of the late 1990s great lost albums. No drag in that.\n\nWhat about Madonna?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 1998 is Madonna's \"Ray of Light.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1998\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nJulian Lennon's \"Photograph Smile.\"\n\nLucinda Williams' \"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.\"\n\nBarenaked Ladies' \"Stunt.\"\n\nThe Beach Boys' \"Endless Harmony Soundtrack.\"\n\nElliott Smith's \"XO.\"\n\nWhen I first moved to St. Cloud in late 2004, I made a number of new friends. With new friendships came exposure to music I hadn't tried. I knew some Nine Inch Nails material, but it took a copy editor friend to get me into \"The Fragile.\"\n\nIt goes something like this. The copy desk was talking about key albums and artists that meant a lot to them for whatever reason. I talked about Brian Wilson and his recently released \"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE,\" and others were contributing their favorites. The copy editor, a good dude named Ryan, spoke of \"The Fragile.\" Excited discussions were had, and this led to people burning CDs of albums to introduce everyone else to the music.\n\nAnd folks, the proper etiquette when sharing favorites with each other always is to at least try the favorites given by others in the conversation. That give-and-take is part of the fun.\n\nSo I popped in \"The Fragile,\" sat in a comfy chair and started to listen.\n\nSome music, you're just going to dislike for whatever reason. If you hate rap, you hate rap. If you hate country, you hate country. If you hate industrial music, you hate industrial music. And Nine Inch Nails is heavily rooted in industrial music, but it has a heavy rock vibe to it. If you like pop or lighter fare, this is probably not for you.\n\nBut oh, seriously, just listen. This isn't the usual NIN (if NIN can ever be described to be \"usual\"). It's avant garde, artsy, multifaceted, complex, almost symphonic, a truly layered work. Is this prog rock? Maybe?\n\nWhat I know for sure is that it is experimental and pushes the envelope of what Trent Reznor had done on previous albums. It can alternate from airy to suffocating, chillingly isolated and then overheated and claustrophobic. I mean, how do you zigzag like that, sometimes just one moment to the next on the same track? It's like capturing wind and trying to shape something from it, powerful and frightening and then gone. And it's angry. It is so angry.\n\nBut let you think this is some atmosphere album, no, it has songs. It has lyrics. While all the pieces fit together as a disjointed and compelling whole, you can pull out individual tunes. But it almost feels a disservice to talk about individual songs when the impact of the album is from its totality. You can thrash and wail, or you can hug yourself and chant. You feel eerily alienated and disturbingly understood.\n\nSound frightening? It is. But the best art grabs you and doesn't let you go. And \"The Fragile\" refuses to let you go, it lingers, and it draws strength over the years. It isn't that it is lyrically inventive or sonically original, but there's this cumulative effect that blows you away. It isn't for the faint of heart, but it is an album worth experiencing.\n\nHonorable mentions, 1999\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (1999 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nEminem's \"The Slim Shady LP.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"Echo.\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' \"Californication.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"The Soft Bulletin.\"\n\nThe Rentals' \"Seven More Minutes.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' \"Fly.\"\n\nThe Magnetic Fields' \"69 Love Songs.\"\n\nPaul McCartney's \"Run Devil Run.\"\n\nCrosby, Stills, Nash & Young's \"Looking Forward.\"\n\nBeck's \"Midnite Vultures.\"\n\nMy first impressions of Eminem's \"The Marshall Mathers LP\" came from selling it.\n\nIn the summer of 2000, I was working at a store that sold music, movies and books. I really enjoyed that job and the people I worked with, and we had our regulars as customers — the folks who'd come in every day and would chat about their favorite music, concerts they'd gone to, celebrities they'd met, that kind of thing.\n\nOne day, one of our regulars (a guy in his early 40s) came in wearing a Led Zeppelin T-shirt, and he headed right over to the music section. I figured there'd be some classic rock or maybe some metal coming up to the register with him. Nope.\n\nHe had a copy of Eminem's latest release, \"The Marshall Mathers LP.\"\n\nI asked him about it. Was he a fan? What got him interested in buying the album? Had he heard much Eminem before?\n\nIt turns out that he'd never heard an Eminem song before, but he was buying it for his son and had heard and read that it was a very strong album, with adult themes and language, but that it also was very artistic and intriguing. Fair enough. He bought it, and that was that.\n\nI hadn't actually heard the record. In fact, it would take another year before I'd hear more than a few tracks (you couldn't really get away from \"Stan\" or \"The Real Slim Shady,\" as they were on TV and everyone was listening to them). I had friends who listened to hip-hop regularly, and they talked about how revolutionary the record was, and they played me select tracks.\n\nAs a narrative piece, the album hangs together really well. Eminem's conflicts with authority, with fame and with his wife and mother, as well as his anger, his drug use and his violent outlook, didn't come across as gimmicks or stereotypes. Sincerity is a quality that can add quite a bit to art, and you'll find quite a bit of sincerity throughout this record — some of it quite scary.\n\nBut there's a lot of humor (sometimes dark, but humor nonetheless) on this album. The themes jump from the kind of material that could make horror movie fodder or content for a \"CSI\" episode, then jump to songs that deflate the situation and basically ask the listener, \"Are you actually taking this seriously?\" I find him refreshing, provocative, intelligent, surreal.\n\nIf you have a preconceived notion of Eminem as a violent, foul-mouthed thug, \"Stan\" still stands as one of the best challenges to that image. It gives you a glimpse behind the public face, demonstrating the fan expectations, the pressures of fame and the downsides of adulation brilliantly. Eminem knows who he is, and what he is.\n\nHe's the real Slim Shady, sometimes. He's Marshall Mathers, sometimes. He's who he needs to be, what he has to be, and this album is just an early part of an important musical and cultural legacy.\n\nHe's released some great albums since, too. And if you've never seen his film \"8 Mile,\" give it a shot. Give all his records a shot. Maybe you'll glean some understanding from all the material. Or maybe you'll be entertained. Or maybe you'll find it disturbing, or vulgar, or obscene.\n\nI'm sure Eminem would welcome any of those views. He's heard it all, been called it all. That's just the way he is.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2000\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe White Stripes' \"De Stijl.\"\n\nColdplay's \"Parachutes.\"\n\nVarious artists, the soundtrack for \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n\nRadiohead's \"Kid A.\"\n\nPaul Simon's \"You're the One.\"\n\nAfter being introduced to Weezer's \"Blue Album\" and taking a while to really embrace sophomore effort \"Pinkerton,\" I was finally primed for a new Weezer release when it was announced that a third album was on the way.\n\n\"Would it be as dark and personal as 'Pinkerton?' \" I asked myself. \"Oooh, or maybe it'll be some new rock opera, some artful new expression of frustration!\"\n\nWhat we got was quite the opposite of that.\n\nPower pop, huge bursts of guitar riffs and catchy hooks, an album seemingly created to be a summer masterpiece. This was what Weezer gave us for album No. 3.\n\nAnother self-titled effort, like the group's debut, this one has taken to being called the \"Green Album\" because of the vivid green background on it. Also like the debut, the group members are lined up on the cover (though the band's personnel had changed, with a new bassist in the group).\n\nBut that's about where the similarities end. Whereas \"Blue\" had an alt-rock feel with some pop sensibilities, \"Green\" is pure pop sweetness with a tendency to rock.\n\nAnd \"Green\" is short; it runs less than 30 minutes. \"Blue\" has \"Only in Dreams,\" which is more than eight minutes by itself.\n\nIn the end, though, the length didn't matter, nor did the style. I didn't find myself disappointed by \"Green.\" In fact, I was pretty happy with it. It came out in the middle of May 2001, and I bought my first copy after finishing a couple of my more-challenging college finals of the school year. The relief I felt at being done with those classes was nicely boosted by the mostly happy feeling to the majority of the songs. Even the sadder sounds felt upbeat.\n\n\"Photograph\" was so much fun ... \"If you want it, you can have it / but you're gonna have to reach out there and grab it.\" So simple, but so true. Nothing wrong with simplicity, folks. And then there's the Sumo wrestlers in \"Hash Pipe\" (and that song has a wicked groove, I still get grabbed by it). \"Island in the Sun\" definitely grabbed a lot of ears (hip hip), and \"Crab\" is some singalong fun.\n\nMy favorite from the album then, as now, is \"Smile.\" A little different production or a little different approach and the track could have easily slipped on to \"Blue\" or \"Pinkerton.\" An off-kilter love song, I'll grant you, but I love it. \"The way you wanna wrap me up inside your smile,\" a wonderful idea.\n\n\"Green\" is probably the easiest of Weezer albums to play for new listeners, as it is fun, catchy and not terribly challenging. Beyond the drug references in \"Hash Pipe\" or the word \"knickers\" in the song \"Crab,\" it is the kind of music that 8-year-olds and 80-year-olds would find pleasing to the ear.\n\nSound awful? Sound like a sellout? Sound like commercial fluff? Bah. Get over it. Pop it in a player, crank it up and have some fun. You might just find that you like it. Maybe you'll find that it makes you feel better. Heck, maybe it will even make you feel happy. Who knows? Maybe it'll make you feel so fine, you can't control your brain. (Hip hip.)\n\nWhat about Bob Dylan?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2001 is Bob Dylan's \"Love and Theft.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2001\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe White Stripes' \"White Blood Cells.\"\n\nSuper Furry Animals' \"Rings Around the World.\"\n\nSlipknot's \"Iowa.\"\n\nElton John's \"Songs from the West Coast.\"\n\nThe Strokes' \"Is This It.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks get a lot of crap thrown at them. Too pop to be country. Too country to be pop. The George Bush and \"Shut Up and Sing\" stuff. Their brashness, their fierce \"we don't care what you think or what you want, we'll be us and you can take it or leave it\" stance on things (which would likely be celebrated if they were men instead of women ... but that's a topic for another time).\n\nBut damn, do they have a sound. Whether it is Natalie Maines' vocals or the combined instrumental and harmony sounds with bandmates Emily Robison and Martie Maguire, there's a powerful combination of sweetness, determination, mischief and joie de vivre that is as compelling as the guitar strums and fiddle flourishes.\n\nI was walking between two dorms on the University of Missouri campus in autumn 2002 when I first heard them. It was this bouncy (and laid back, at the same time) track, it almost reminded me of Civil War music but was way, way too modern. What the heck was it?\n\nI was talking to a friend about songs we liked, and out of the blue she played \"Travelin' Soldier.\"\n\nThat was IT. That was THE SONG.\n\nWell, forget the Civil War. A bus, Army greens, this was definitely a more modern setting (Vietnam). But the sound and sentiment leaps generations, and the words ring true no matter the age. \"Our love will never end, waitin' for the soldier to come back again / never more to be alone when the letter said, 'A soldier's coming home.' \"\n\nOK, so I knew the song. I knew the artist. Now to add the album to my collection. I hit a music store, and there it was: \"Home.\" That was the album. Picked up, purchased, mine. Mission accomplished (I trust you'll forgive the situational humor). And it was love from first listen.\n\nIt sounded so natural. It had more of a folk and bluegrass leaning, heavy on acoustic instrumentation and sounding fantastic. Honestly, it sounded like a classic album that had been around for decades but was freshly discovered somehow. It was warm and comfortable and exciting, something I hadn't really thought possible for a country music album at that time.\n\nCollege is a good time for getting over biases. With \"Home\" and my exposure to Johnny Cash's \"American Recordings,\" I started to set aside biases of songs about pickup trucks, drinking and \"she done me wrong\" stereotypes and started to acknowledge the depth and artistry within the genre. And \"Home\" by itself was quite an education.\n\nThe Dixie Chicks even took on Fleetwood Mac's \"Landslide\" and covered it admirably, standing tall right up there against Stevie Nicks' own definitive performance.\n\nAnd the instrumental \"Lil' Jack Slade,\" wow, really, that's a headphones track. I enjoy every listen.\n\nSure, on \"Home\" you still get some traditional country music references (song titles like \"White Trash Wedding\" and \"Tortured, Tangled Hearts\" sound tailor-made for jukeboxes at honky tonks), but I like that. It's history, it's part of the genre, it's part of the tradition. It's fun, it pulls on nostalgic heartstrings that you may not even know you had until the sounds pluck them.\n\n\"Home\" is damn good music. Setting aside the politics and the situation, this is a great American album, an important entry in country music and is my favorite Dixie Chicks album by a wide margin (and I've since picked up and enjoyed all the Maines-era Chicks records).\n\nTurn it on, let it play. See if you'll shed a tear with the pretty little girl with a bow in her hair.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2002\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (2002 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nThe Streets' \"Original Pirate Material.\"\n\nWilco's \"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.\"\n\nEminem's \"The Eminem Show.\"\n\nThe Flaming Lips' \"Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.\"\n\nMy Chemical Romance's \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"The Rising.\"\n\nInterpol's \"Turn on the Bright Lights.\"\n\nTom Petty and The Heartbreakers' \"The Last DJ.\"\n\nJohnny Cash's \"American IV: The Man Comes Around.\"\n\nGeorge Harrison's \"Brainwashed.\"\n\nGosh, is there anyone older than 18 who hasn't heard \"Seven Nation Army?\" I'd be inclined to guess not.\n\nFor quite a stretch there, it seemed to be everywhere. It's one of The White Stripes' signature songs, and it kicks off their 2003 album \"Elephant\" with insistent, undeniable, unavoidable energy. And it is one of those earworms that you just cannot get out of your head. I know. I've tried.\n\nIt isn't a bad song. In fact, it's a pretty cool song. But like all cool songs that have been overplayed, one may find oneself skipping the track to get to other goodies. The blessing of \"Elephant\" is that there are many goodies worth skipping to.\n\nMy personal favorite is their cover of \"I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself,\" the Burt Bacharach / Hal David song that has been recorded by such greats as Dusty Springfield and Dionne Warwick. And with all respect to those versions, The Stripes' rendition is my favorite. It has a snarling, carnal quality that is both seductive and bombastic. And the video, well, it didn't hurt things either.\n\nOne of the cool touches on \"Elephant\" is the use of antiquated equipment during the recording and production of the album. No computers, no modern processes. What does this mean to the casual listener? Maybe not a whole lot (though I suspect you'll sense some undefinable something that you can't articulate). For dedicated students of sound and those who spend some time with headphones, the old equipment adds a dimension and sonic quality that conjures the live energy and excitement of earlier recordings. There's a spark, a crackle, a fuzz, not an imperfection but an enhancement, a \"you are here\" buzz that can suck you right into the music.\n\nAt least, that's how it feels to me.\n\nEarlier White Stripes albums had several good songs, and the garage rock sound was well established. But \"Elephant\" was where Jack and Meg White really kicked things up a notch, cranked the volume to 11 and blew the doors off garages near and far. And it set the stage for \"Get Behind Me Satan,\" my favorite Stripes album.\n\nIf you like you rock a bit loud and bluesy, if you like some slashing guitars and your drums to feel like thunder, \"Elephant\" has those qualities in spades. You want things a bit more toned down, intimate, you want to be coaxes through songs? \"Elephant\" has that too. There's such a variety of styles, I never get bored with \"Elephant.\" No one-trick pony, The White Stripes.\n\nAnd if all else fails, there's always \"Seven Nation Army.\" It's one of the 14 great songs on the album, and every single one's got a story to tell.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2003\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nRingo Starr's \"Ringo Rama.\"\n\nAvenged Sevenfold's \"Waking the Fallen.\"\n\nWarren Zevon's \"The Wind.\"\n\nThe Beatles' \"Let It Be ... Naked.\"\n\nAlicia Keys' \"The Diary of Alicia Keys.\"\n\nIn 2004, My Chemical Romance was nowhere near my radar. I had college graduation, my first newspaper job in North Carolina, my first car that was all mine and then the move to St. Cloud. And Brian Wilson released two albums that year, so I was pretty preoccupied.\n\nAnd to be honest, I don't know if I'd have paid any attention to My Chem even if the rest of the variables weren't in play. The band looked like the goth guys you maybe avoided in class. And songs about vampires and zombies and ghosts and ... well, there you go.\n\nBut then I discovered \"The Black Parade,\" and everything changed. I learned the ever-popular (and generally true) creed of not judging books by their covers.\n\nAfter I got hooked on \"The Black Parade,\" I started filling in the past releases. The excellent 2002 debut \"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\" is a much rawer effort than \"The Black Parade,\" and makes one wonder if the 2004 sophomore effort \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" would bridge the harder punk sounds and the smoother rock opera touches.\n\nNope. \"Three Cheers\" is a polished effort, too. And that's OK, because it's a great polished effort at that.\n\nWhen I started listening to \"Three Cheers,\" I got swept away by the variety of textures and by the operatic sweep of the sound. My first thought was, \"This band has to have been inspired by Queen.\" My second thought was, \"This is really freaking good.\"\n\nAnd it is. It is really freaking good. \"Helena,\" \"You Know What They Do to Guys Like Us in Prison,\" \"I'm Not Okay (I Promise),\" \"The Ghost of You,\" \"Thank You for the Venom,\" \"Cemetery Drive\" and \"I Never Told You What I Do for a Living\" ... all great! Yes, this is a band influenced by horror movies, by comic books, by classic rock albums and punk rock albums and by old movies ... and dang it, that's great! If you enjoy that kind of stuff, if you have similar tastes and influences, isn't it great to see (or hear) a band that combines it all so well and makes music you can relate to?\n\nAnswer: Yes, it is.\n\nCall me a sucker for liking soaring vocals and catchy guitar riffs, but there is some dimension to this music. Chiming guitars, propulsive drum fills, bass notes that bubble up, all combining into a layered sound and complexity that tickles the ears.\n\nOh, and all the videos released to promote the singles are pretty sweet too. \"I'm Not Okay\" is like a trailer to a film, \"Helena\" is a funeral (with some epic dancing), but my favorite is the retro \"The Ghost of You,\" with its World War II era vibe. Good stuff.\n\nSet aside the goth clothing, ignore the hairstyles, pay attention to the situations, the stories, the performances. Once you've jettisoned your prejudices (just as I had to do), there's something altogether human, quirky and enjoyable to this music. Allow yourself to bask in the outsider mentality a bit (it may be no stranger to you, anyway). An open mind can take you places, from the Old West to Omaha Beach.\n\nIf you like your music dramatic, My Chemical Romance and \"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\" may be right up your alley.\n\nWhat about Brian Wilson?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2004 is Brian Wilson's \"Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2004\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Killers' \"Hot Fuss.\"\n\nMatt Sharp's \"Matt Sharp.\"\n\nArcade Fire's \"Funeral.\"\n\nIf \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" doesn't come up in a conversation about Paul McCartney's best solo work, then the people in that conversation need to give it another try (and use their ears this time). Simply put, it isn't just one of McCartney's finest solo albums, it is one of his finest albums. Period.\n\nThe guy who really flowered on The Beatles' \"Revolver\" and gave us \"Eleanor Rigby,\" \"Here, There and Everywhere\" and \"For No One\" is right here. That's no hyperbole, my friends. Emotional music, introverted, personal. For folks who think Sir Paul is only good for catchy melodies and grandma music (and shame on you if you're one of them), \"Chaos and Creation\" will put you in your place.\n\nThat isn't to say the music isn't tuneful. Of course it is. But it tends to be more intimate, with Paul singing of topics in a first-person narrative that transcends the \"silly love songs\" for which he tends to be known. A more reflective, from-the-heart bend is found in these songs.\n\nWhen I bought the album, I didn't have a lot of high expectations. Obviously, I'd dearly loved \"Flaming Pie\" when it came out, and I enjoyed \"Run Devil Run\" quite a bit when it was released. But I find the bulk of 2001's \"Driving Rain\" lackluster, abysmal, tedious. The album was littered with good song ideas, but mostly the performances lacked any kind of spark or energy that would lift the songs from middle-of-the-road compositions to lively or engaging favorites.\n\n\"Chaos and Creation\" was the first release after \"Driving Rain,\" so I was curious (and more than a little worried) to hear what Paul would give us next. Would there be a new direction, or would he be settling into a \"well, this is good enough\" mindset and give us a \"Driving Rain II?\"\n\nRelief, friends. Sheer relief. From the strident piano of opening track \"Fine Line\" to the looped sounds on \"How Kind of You\" to the playful whimsy of \"English Tea\" and the aching beauty of \"Too Much Rain,\" there were many standout tracks. Many? Try all. ALL. No lie. Sure, some songs bear stylistic similarities to past glories (you'll no doubt note that \"Blackbird\" and \"Jenny Wren\" sound like the cousins they are), but there's a maturity and emotional fullness to the new pieces that lifts them from being recreations or homages. Some songs start out in one style and then deftly transition to a different style entirely, in completely unexpected ways (\"Promise to You Girl,\" for example).\n\nThe album is one reward after another, an artistic achievement followed by another artistic achievement, and all while staying accessible, melodious, friendly to the ear.\n\nAnd some credit must be given to producer Nigel Godrich, who has coaxed sounds and feelings out of Radiohead's best works as almost an auxiliary band member, using the studio to bring out textures in the music beyond those created with instruments and computers. Godrich would challenge McCartney, he'd set goals, he'd discuss the emotional qualities and anthemic possibilities, he'd slow down songs, he'd add sounds, all while keeping Paul very much Paul. In fact, most of the instrumentation on the album is played by McCartney himself (shades of \"McCartney\" and \"McCartney II\" in the mix).\n\nIn the final assessment of the album, it is one of the most well-rounded, sincere and inclusive McCartney records released, to date. You'll still get pieces of good-time Paul, and balladeer Paul, and romantic Paul ... and you SHOULD. I've said it before, and I'll say it again: I think the best music is music with sincerity, and Paul is sincerely that kind of musician. But he's also a human, a man who has had losses, has suffered setbacks, has fought for what he has, and knows that not everything is wine and roses. And nowhere is Paul more reflective (while also being colorful and stirring and inventive) than he is on \"Chaos and Creation.\"\n\nPost Beatles, post Wings, McCartney has some great albums. And with \"Tug of War,\" \"Flaming Pie\" and 2013's \"New,\" \"Chaos and Creation in the Backyard\" is at the top of the heap. It is a genuine classic, and I hope it grows in stature as more and more people give it a try. It took emotional and creative courage to put this material out there, to buck some of the expectations McCartney has just for being Paul McCartney, and it is a rewarding listen time after time. If you don't feel a tug within you, a recognition of yourself in the music of \"Too Much Rain,\" well, do some living.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2005\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut:\n\nThe Fiery Furnaces' \"EP.\"\n\nWeezer's \"Make Believe.\"\n\nOasis' \"Don't Believe the Truth.\"\n\nThe White Stripes' \"Get Behind Me Satan.\"\n\nNeil Diamond's \"12 Songs.\"\n\nOver the course of my time as a music columnist, one of the genuine delights I've encountered has been email conversations with folks out in the real world about music. One of the most regular and insightful has been area columnist Dennis Dalman. His love for Bob Dylan, his deep interest in Dylan trivia and his pool of anecdotes have been interesting and enjoyable over the last year.\n\nWe've talked about Dylan's evolution, his different styles and personas, and we've discussed the merits of many of the albums about which I've written. From \"Love and Theft\" to \"Blood on the Tracks\" and discussions about Dylan's speed-induced electric years, it's been fun to trade notes.\n\nOne album we haven't talked much about has been \"Modern Times,\" the 2006 album that picks up where \"Love and Theft\" left off.\n\nIf you enjoyed the bluesy tones and rockabilly charms of \"Love and Theft,\" then \"Modern Times\" will be right up your alley. You can look up the controversy about lyrical and musical influences and uncredited contributions, but Dylan has long been a man who has made use of old folk songs, old blues songs and standards in his music. To me, what matters is the performance, the personal investment in the material.\n\nAnd with \"Modern Times,\" Dylan is in fine performance form. There are some excellent later-period vocals, jauntiness on more upbeat songs and a reservedness to the ballads (of which there are a few). When an album features such fine pieces as \"Thunder on the Mountain,\" \"Rollin' and Tumblin',\" \"Someday Baby,\" \"Workingman's Blues #2,\" \"Nettie Moore\" and \"Ain't Talkin',\" it is going to be worth your while. (Truth be told, I prefer the version of \"Someday Baby\" on \"The Bootleg Series Vol. 8: Tell Tale Signs: Rare and Unreleased 1989–2006,\" but that's a conversation for another time.)\n\n\"Modern Times\" was the first Dylan album released after I'd moved to St. Cloud, and my first impression was that it is a very long record. Though only 10 songs, the album lasts more than an hour. Brevity apparently wasn't on Dylan's mind. But rather than feeling bored or distracted by the longer songs, I enjoyed that you had time to absorb and digest the songs. Like with blues and jazz albums, the journey is at least half of the experience; it isn't about the instant payoff or the standard verse-chorus-verse construction.\n\nTake \"Ain't Talkin',\" for instance. That's a journey song if ever there is one. We're with the narrator as he wanders, as he tries to do good, and we see when the narrator falters and how he is distracted into darkness. That's not the kind of song you sum up in three minutes with the chorus repeated four times.\n\nOver the years, I've grown to enjoy \"Modern Times\" as a worthy successor to \"Love and Theft.\" \"Love and Theft\" may be my favorite of the two, but in a world where you can have both, why not indulge in the greatness of the pair of albums?\n\nConsidering the streak that started with at least \"Time Out of Mind\" and led to \"Love and Theft\" and then \"Modern Times,\" it is hard to deny that Dylan was on one heck of a hot streak. If only we could all be so lucky at age 65. Here's hoping ...\n\nWhat about My Chemical Romance?\n\nMy actual favorite album for 2006 is My Chemical Romance's \"The Black Parade.\" But I've already written about that album, and I didn't want to repurpose copy for this project. I figure if you good folks are taking the time to read my words, I could at least give you fresh material.\n\nHonorable mentions, 2006\n\nThe following albums almost made the cut (2006 was an exceptionally excellent year):\n\nYeah Yeah Yeahs' \"Show Your Bones.\"\n\nEagles of Death Metal's \"Death by Sexy.\"\n\nBruce Springsteen's \"We Shall Overcome: The Seeger Sessions.\"\n\nRed Hot Chili Peppers' \"Stadium Arcadium.\"\n\nDavid Gilmour's \"On an Island.\"\n\nThe Dixie Chicks' \"Taking the Long Way.\"\n\nThe Decemberists' \"The Crane Wife.\"\n\nThe Killers' \"Sam's Town.\"\n\nFoo Fighters' \"Skin and Bones.\"\n\nTom Waits' \"Orphans: Brawlers, Bawlers & Bastards.\"\n\nStart with a little R.E.M. Toss in a bit of Bruce Springsteen. Add a pinch of Roger Waters. Mix it up, and you get some music resembling Arcade Fire's \"Neon Bible.\"\n\nDon't you hate trying to describe how a group or an album sounds to someone who hasn't heard it? What you hear, the similarities or echoes, may hit others differently. \"Th", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/11/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/ozarks/2017/05/27/man-who-reinvented-meth/330877001/", "title": "The Man Who Reinvented Meth", "text": "Thomas Gounley\n\nNews-Leader\n\nJohn Cornille had been with the Drug Enforcement Administration for seven years. Yet he couldn't wrap his head around what his informant was describing.\n\nIt was November 1992, and the man was talking about a visit to a home in Reeds Spring, Missouri. He said he'd been forced at gunpoint to use methamphetamine manufactured there. But something was off. The informant didn't mention beakers, flasks, Bunsen burners — none of the complex glassware Cornille was taught were part of meth labs.\n\nInstead, the informant reported an unusual scene: Black trash bags stuffed with empty boxes of cold medicine. A mason jar full of kerosene, with something resembling a hockey puck settled at the bottom. Starter fluid. And a cookie sheet in the oven, with a yellowish cake on it.\n\nCornille, like other DEA agents, had made meth himself, under controlled circumstances, as part of his official duties. It was standard practice; the agency knew it meant he'd have more credibility when he asked a court for a search warrant or filled out a probable cause statement recommending criminal charges. It was important that prosecutors see him and other agents as experts on the manufacturing of illegal drugs.\n\nAs Cornille sat down to request a warrant for the Reeds Spring home, he couldn't be that authoritative. He needed another source, someone who could credibly link common household items with the production of meth, a highly-addictive substance known for its energy boost. He called a chemist working for the DEA in Chicago.\n\n“I still remember what he said, because I wrote it down word for word,\" Cornille recalled in a recent interview. \"He said, ‘There’s a basis for such a formula in literature, but it’s not been seen in the United States.\"\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since the investigation, but that's not the only comment that remains lodged in Cornille's memory.\n\nAt some point, as the informant was describing the unusual lab in Reeds Spring, Cornille asked him if the meth was any good. If the answer was no, he figured, the situation might not be that big a deal. Low-quality stuff was unlikely to spread.\n\nThe informant, however, had five words for him:\n\n\"Best dope I ever had.\"\n\nThree months later, in Springfield, Cornille sat across from a recently-arrested 49-year-old man.\n\nWith a voice recorder rolling, Cornille introduced himself for the record, then moved on to his guest.\n\n“With me today is Mr. Bob Paillet,” Cornille said, according to a transcript. “Mr. Paillet has agreed to talk to me and explain to me different methods of manufacturing methamphetamine. One using the sodium metal and anhydrous ammonia and then a couple others.”\n\nCornille told Paillet — pronounced “Pie-ay” — that he wanted \"just to sit down and talk to you about those different methods.\"\n\n\"How you discovered them, and so forth,” Cornille said.\n\nPaillet began by saying he'd always been interested in chemistry and physics and that he'd \"just played around with my chemistry set.\" Then he got detailed. He talked about molecules, replacement reactions and acetic acid, about catalysts, synthesis and hydroxyl groups. Scientific terms flowed with minimal prompting.\n\nAbout halfway through the conversation, Paillet made a remark that fell somewhere between a suggestion and a prediction.\n\n“You’re gonna have to send all your agents back to school and learn chemistry … There’s people out there that are going to great lengths to avoid getting caught,” he said.\n\nCornille responded. “Well, see I went to school to learn how to manufacture methamphetamine and to …”\n\nPaillet cut him off.\n\n“All the old ways,” he said.\n\nCornille joined the DEA in 1985 after serving on the local police force in Washington D.C. He spent the remainder of the decade in the nation's capital, fighting the crack epidemic. In 1990, he was transferred to southwest Missouri. At that point, Cornille recalls now, meth ranked about third on the agency's local priority list. Cocaine and marijuana were much more prevalent.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the number of meth labs seized by the authorities drastically increased, first in Missouri, and gradually in other communities around the country. Before the decade was out, as the public and the media sought answers as to how the drug shifted from a problem to a crisis — how it grew powerful enough to ravage entire communities — law enforcement would point to Paillet by name.\n\n\"He brought it to life for this area,\" Springfield police Cpl. Dan Schrader told the News-Leader in 1998.\n\nPaillet essentially converted the process of producing meth from a complex formula — one that required the so-called \"cook\" to have a chemistry background — to a simple recipe that could be followed by the masses. DEA and court records indicate Paillet taught his method to others, who in turn taught it within their own respective circles. The man behind the unusual meth lab in Reeds Spring learned the method from one of Paillet's friends, Cornille said.\n\nPaillet wasn't a drug lord; he didn't control a network of associates. In fact, he did the opposite, spawning a generation of cooks by unintentionally democratizing an illegal industry. One textbook released in 2014 called Paillet \"arguably the Johnny Appleseed for the spread of local meth production throughout the Midwest.\" Journalist Frank Owen, in his own book released in 2007, wrote that Paillet “effectively decentralized the local meth trade … broadening the appeal of the drug.\"\n\nIn other words, Bob Paillet reinvented meth.\n\nHow did he do it? The story he told law enforcement revolves around the Springfield campus of Missouri State University, which at the time was known as Southwest Missouri State.\n\n“Bob claims he went to SMS’ library, and in a research manual he found this method of converting pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine using sodium metal as one of the catalysts,\" Cornille said. \"He claimed that at the top of the page was a swastika.”\n\nThus the moniker: The new process was the \"Nazi method.\" The new stuff, \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“I really believe that his method, here in Springfield, was the bounce to get meth spread throughout the rest of Missouri and the United States,\" said Nick Console, who ran the DEA's Springfield office from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nDespite Paillet's pioneering role in an American drug epidemic, relatively little has been known about him. In the later years of his life, he appears to have avoided public scrutiny, as well as further trouble with the law. He died in Texas, age 72, on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nPaillet's death and the passage of time have obscured some details. Other key elements — like his recipe's alleged connection to the Third Reich — have taken on the characteristics of urban legend.\n\nCourt documents obtained by the News-Leader shed light on his arrest and the early spread of the Nazi method. Interviews with family members and a key associate, none of whom have previously spoken publicly, paint a picture of a man with an obsession who left public officials scrambling to respond for years.\n\nThe probable cause statement used to charge Paillet, written by Cornille, traces his arrival on law enforcement's radar to Jan. 24, 1993 — just over a week before he was arrested.\n\nThat day, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office arrested two Springfield residents, Christopher Fricks and Kimberly Lee Duncan, for possession of a controlled substance and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.\n\nIt's not clear from court documents how or why Paillet's name came up as the two were taken into custody. What is clear is that they told deputies of two places where Paillet stored materials he used to make meth.\n\nThe first was a room in a house Fricks was renting in Joplin. Authorities searched it on Jan. 28. The second was a property near the small town of Morrisville, where Paillet previously lived. One of his ex-wives allowed law enforcement on the property on Feb. 1. Both tips were substantiated.\n\nThen, on Feb. 2, a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper and Polk County deputies headed to Paillet's apartment on West 3rd Street in Battlefield. Paillet wasn't home, but his current wife was, and she began speaking to the men. She mentioned her husband would sometimes disappear for up to three weeks at a time, telling her he was working in Kansas City.\n\nMidway through the conversation, Paillet drove up in a tan 1983 Chevy Cavalier. He walked inside, and set an unzipped black duffel bag on the floor. The grip of a pistol stuck out from the top, and the trooper quickly moved to secure the gun. It was loaded: Nineteen rounds, one in the chamber. Paillet said he'd traded for it.\n\nThe trooper and the deputies asked Paillet to talk outside. He said sure.\n\nThey walked out and the officers read Paillet his Miranda rights. According to court documents, Paillet “stated he was glad to see them and glad that it was over.”\n\nThen he began to talk.\n\nStanding outside his Battlefield, Missouri, home with a state trooper and several sheriff's deputies, Bob Paillet gave the men consent to search his vehicle.\n\nHe knew why they were there. Before they could open the door of his Chevy Cavalier, he told them what they'd find: methamphetamine, inside a small white pill bottle in the trunk. Once the drugs were retrieved, Paillet led the officers back inside and pointed out the two sawed-off shotguns under a bed.\n\nThe same day — Feb. 2, 1993 — the trooper and the Polk County deputies drove Paillet to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's regional headquarters on Kearney Street. There they were joined by John Cornille, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent based in Springfield.\n\nAuthorities found a note in Paillet's pocket, with a chemical formula written out. They also found two receipts, from trips to Walmart.\n\nShortly before dusk, after speaking with investigators, Paillet led the men to Room 431 of the American Inn Hotel in northeast Springfield, where he showed them the meth-making materials he had stashed there. Then they all drove across town to a storage facility in Battlefield, where he kept a second stash.\n\nThe News-Leader reported the bust two days later, with the headline \"Police nail 'Nazi Dope' laboratory in Battlefield.\" The authorities said chemical disposal workers wearing special suits and protective gloves spent about three hours clearing the storage unit. They estimated disposing of the chemicals would cost the federal government $35,000.\n\nThe story noted that, nationwide, the number of meth lab busts had declined in recent years. But it also quoted the head of a local drug task force, with a premonition that would turn out to be spot on.\n\n“This Nazi dope is definitely new to this area, and it could be the first in the U.S.,” said Steve Whitney, also the sheriff in nearby Christian County. “I still think we may see this more and more.”\n\nAlthough credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of producing meth — and opening the door to an era of amateur meth labs across the Midwest — Paillet himself has remained something of a mystery.\n\nNews stories and a handful of books published in the decades since his 1993 arrest have presented scant detail: He moved from California to Missouri in the 1980s and, upon finding meth was more expensive than he was used to out west, set out to make it himself. He researched chemistry at the library at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was arrested. He moved to Texas.\n\nThat narrative covers just a portion of his life.\n\nBorn on March 4, 1943, Robert Paillet was 72 when he died Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nHe left behind two daughters. In an email to the News-Leader, the oldest offered a theme for his biography:\n\n\"My father is a classic case of what PTSD does to a brilliant mind.\"\n\nSpeed. Crank. Dope. Ice. Zip. The poor man's cocaine.\n\nWhatever you call it, meth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system.\n\nIt's odorless, typically white and can be found in powder and crystal forms. In the United States, it has for decades been a schedule II substance, which means it has some very limited accepted medical uses — for conditions like attention deficit disorder and obesity, under the trade name Desoxyn — but also a high potential for abuse, as well as psychological or physical dependence.\n\nOne of the things that sets meth apart from other illegal substances is its means of production.\n\n\"Unlike other major drugs of abuse, methamphetamine is a synthetic drug, and as such, is manufactured in a laboratory,\" the DEA wrote in a 2016 report. \"Methamphetamine does not rely on a plant as its main source and is not affected by drought, flooding, growth cycles, or other natural elements that affect production. Instead, methamphetamine production relies on the ability of traffickers to obtain precursors and other essential chemicals.\"\n\nMeth is most commonly smoked, snorted or injected. Its use causes an increase in energy and alertness and a decrease in appetite. Meth also produces an intense euphoric rush, and can make users hypersexual. Cornille said the high from crack cocaine lasts for a matter for minutes. With meth, the high lasts for hours.\n\nMeth can cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, tremors and convulsions and — particularly with repeated use — depression and motor and cognitive failure. Users also tend to not sleep for extended periods, which leads to additional detrimental effects.\n\nBob Paillet's death certificate lists his birthplace as San Diego. His oldest daughter, now 48, said her father was actually born on Canada's Vancouver Island, although his parents had previously lived in California.\n\nLisa Paillet — who spoke to the News-Leader on the condition that her real first name not be used — said Bob's father, Francis \"Fred\" Paillet, was a Vermont native and worked as a carpenter and master gardener. His mother, Quebec native Louise Marie Paillet, was a maid and cook.\n\nThe family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Bob was in junior high, then to the small town of Exeter, Missouri, about 60 miles southwest of Springfield, several years later. After graduating from Exeter High School in 1961, Bob enlisted in the Navy and was sent to California's Bay Area. He was taking forestry classes at the University of California-Berkeley when, in 1964, he was deployed to Vietnam on the aircraft carrier USS Ranger.\n\nLisa said her father returned to the United States with \"debilitating migraines and a jaundiced view of the world,\" after a commanding officer \"rode one of his crew members so hard\" that he committed suicide. She believes Bob had post-traumatic stress disorder, although he was never formally diagnosed. For the most part, Lisa said, her father avoided talking about his time at war.\n\nUpon his return home in 1965, Bob Paillet married Lisa’s mother, whom he met in Berkeley prior to his deployment. They briefly lived in Oakland before embarking on a year-long trip around the United States, ultimately ending in Kansas City. Over the next five years, Bob and his wife bounced back and forth between there and the Bay Area. Bob never returned to college.\n\nLisa was born in California in 1968. She said her father had an assortment of jobs over the years. Sometimes he flipped houses, or built new ones. He liked to purchase and restore antique cars, a lifelong passion of his, for resale. He wasn't always self-employed, however. When Lisa was born, he worked as a lineman for the phone company.\n\nAround 1970, the family of three was living in Kansas City, where Bob worked for a fiberglass company. One day, he saw a friend and co-worker get electrocuted. It's a moment that \"damaged\" her father, Lisa said.\n\nThe family moved back to California, where Bob reconnected with a friend who was using meth. At some point, Lisa said, the friend got hold of a bad batch and became sick.\n\n\"So my father went to the Berkeley public library and the university library and started researching chemistry books,\" Lisa said.\n\nWhy chemistry books? Bob \"wanted him to have clean drugs.\"\n\n\"That’s my father’s logic,\" she said. \"Not get him off the drugs — but make them better.”\n\nWithin a few years, Lisa said, Bob became \"really flaky and moody.\" Around 1973, at Bob's request, Lisa's mother gave her husband a year to travel and find himself. He took two. When Bob came back, the couple divorced.\n\n\"After that, I saw him off and on for camping trips, hiking, or things like roller skating,\" Lisa said. \"It was a good compromise. I got to see him when he was in the mood to play. If he was not, he was not around. This basic relationship carried us through life.\"\n\nThe extent to which Bob used or produced meth in the ensuing years is unclear. Sometime during the two-year break, Lisa said, Bob met the woman who would become his second wife. His youngest daughter, Gena Paillet, was born in the Springfield area in 1978.\n\n\"I can remember I grew up terrified of him, because he would be one happy person one minute and literally in a second go to this terrifying person,\" Gena said.\n\nBy the time he was arrested with methamphetamine in the trunk of his car in 1993, Bob Paillet was on his third marriage.\n\nHe had fathered two children, born 10 years apart, in different states, to different women. The lives of his daughters, to this day, have had relatively little overlap.\n\nBoth women, however, have memories of living with their father on a plot of rural land along Highway JJ, not far from Morrisville, Missouri. The town of about 400 is 25 miles north of Springfield.\n\nThe remote venue in the anonymous rolling hills of the Ozarks appears to have been one place where Paillet refined the work that would later turn the meth trade on its head.\n\nGena Paillet, Bob's youngest daughter, lived there in the mid-1980s. She and her father had recently moved back to Missouri from California. Her mother, Bob's second wife, stayed behind in the Golden State for a year to work. Gena and her father lived in a modified school bus while Bob began building a house.\n\nIt was a simple setting. The bathroom for a time was an outhouse. But the property gave Gena, who says she grew up fearing her father, what she calls \"some of the best memories of my life.\" There were dense woods to explore, and the property abutted the Little Sac River.\n\n“We’d go swimming in that all the time and catch crawdads, things like that,\" Gena said. \"I’ve thought about going back to that property.\"\n\nWithin a couple years, however, Bob and his second wife separated. Gena said her father was unfaithful and verbally abusive. She and her mother went to live in Morrisville.\n\nNot long after, in 1987, Bob's oldest daughter, a product of his first marriage, arrived at the property.\n\nLisa Paillet — the first name is a pseudonym — grew up in California, where she was born in 1968. She saw her father only occasionally, but at times felt his presence even when he wasn't around. In high school, Lisa said, adults would sometimes show up and \"imply that they knew my father and were supposed to watch out for me.”\n\nLisa came to live with her father as she prepared to attend Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was footing the bill.\n\nThree decades later, Lisa remembers the property as a place where her father experimented. Bob never said exactly what he was doing, and Lisa sensed it might be best if she didn't exactly know. She recalls helping her father hook together motors and going on shopping trips to Walmart to buy cold medicine.\n\n\"He would buy tons of that stuff, and he said it was easy for him to break down to get the chemicals he wanted,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob coached Lisa not to give her name to people. If somebody came looking for her father, she was supposed to deny that she knew him. Instead of guard dogs, the property near Morrisville had guard geese. The animals tend to raise a racket when they're disturbed.\n\n\"If you heard the geese and it was dark outside, you hit the lights and you hit the floor,” Lisa said.\n\nThere is some overlap in Lisa and Gena's memories. Both recall a room on the property where they weren't supposed to go. Gena distinctly remembers hiding behind a tree one day, on a weekend visit sometime after her parents separated, and watching her father go inside.\n\n\"I just remember seeing this one huge table ... with beakers and pots and things smoking and, you know, tubes going from one to the other,\" she said. \"I didn’t know what it was, but I knew he was up to something. And by his behavior becoming much more erratic, we knew something was wrong. We just didn’t know what.”\n\nBy the 1980s, the U.S. meth trade — both manufacturing and distribution — was largely run by outlaw motorcycle gangs. In some places, it was the Hell's Angels. In Texas, it was the Bandidos.\n\nNick Console, a Louisiana native now living in Ash Grove, joined the DEA in 1983, and was soon working out of the agency's Houston office.\n\nIn an interview, Console said that meth labs back then were primarily located in out-of-the-way, rural areas, so the rotten egg smell produced during a cook wouldn't give the operation away. They were full of glassware, not unlike a scene from the hit TV series \"Breaking Bad.\" The labs churned out batches of the drug measured in pounds.\n\nBusts by the authorities would sometimes lead to shoot-outs. At times, cleaning up a lab consisted of dumping the chemicals in the nearest ditch, Console said. The Environmental Protection Agency had yet to sound the alarm. Nobody thought to wear a respirator.\n\n“These labs, they were out in west Texas, they might be out in the boonies in an old mobile home, but everything in that mobile home was a lab,\" Console said.\n\nMeth was big business for the bikers, and it required a specialized workforce, he said. The gangs employed their own chemists, who generally used what is known as the P2P method, in reference to its incorporation of phenylacetone, a chemical often used for industrial cleaning or photo processing purposes.\n\nBack then, Console said, “you had to be a chemist to make meth.”\n\nThe meth trade's biker era bled into southwest Missouri. In 1987, Glennon Paul Sweet, a local member of the Hell's Angels-affiliated Galloping Goose motorcycle club, gunned down Highway Patrol Trooper Russell Harper during a routine traffic stop just outside Springfield. It was later determined Sweet, who was ultimately put to death, was transporting meth.\n\nThe wooded hollows of southern Missouri once attracted moonshiners. By the late 1980s, the region's rural nature and sparse law enforcement presence were seen as ideal for making meth. DEA officials reported that manufacturers were buying or leasing farmhouses and converting them into P2P labs. Still, they were few and far between; Cornille said agents typically came across a couple of labs per year.\n\nAfter being transferred from Houston, Console worked for the DEA overseas in Turkey, then in San Francisco. In the fall of 1994, about a year and a half after Paillet's arrest, he arrived in Springfield as the DEA's new resident agent in charge.\n\n“When I got here, it was the beginning of the spike in meth labs,\" he said.\n\nLisa Paillet doesn't believe her father was ever in a motorcycle gang. But Bob definitely associated with some shady types.\n\n\"I know that when I was in circles of people that I would consider very bad people, he was known in California,” she said.\n\nLisa also said her father \"would have hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash sometimes, and then he would have nothing.\"\n\nEither way, Paillet had no prior criminal record when, in January 1993, he became a person of interest to law enforcement agencies in southwest Missouri. The authorities had encountered a new type of meth lab — using what became known as the \"Nazi method\" — in the town of Reeds Spring just a couple months earlier.\n\nIn DEA records reviewed by the News-Leader, Paillet said he was the one who discovered the new process, but never specifically stated when that happened. Evidence suggests, however, that it was years before his arrest.\n\nThe Reeds Spring lab wasn't the first of its kind. A Nazi method-style lab was found in 1988 in a trailer park in Vacaville, California, according to a 1990 article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Authorities later came to believe Paillet was behind the lab — a conclusion that appears supported by his numerous connections to the state.\n\nThe Nazi method starts with the compound pseudoephedrine, which, chemically speaking, is one oxygen atom removed from methamphetamine. Pseudoephedrine is the active ingredient in cold medicines sold under brand names such as Sudafed.\n\nHere’s how a former DEA chemist described the ensuing process:\n\nTo make meth, the manufacturer pulverizes the pseudoephedrine pills in a coffee grinder, creating a fine powder that is placed in a coffee filter. Methyl alcohol, in the form of something like windshield washer fluid, is poured over it, and then evaporated out.\n\nThe cook then adds ether, anhydrous ammonia - a compound commonly used by farmers as fertilizer – and sodium metal or lithium metal, which can be stripped from commercial batteries. That produces a liquid called meth oil.\n\nMore ether is added, and the solution is put through another coffee filter. A bubbler is then used to convert rock salt and other material to hydrogen chloride gas, which converts the meth oil into a white powder. Meth.\n\nThe Nazi method is also sometimes referred to as the Birch method because it builds upon the Birch reduction, a reaction first reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch.\n\nThe significance of the Nazi method was how simple it was. When DEA agent John Cornille gave talks to community members, he'd compare it to baking a cake.\n\n“Bob made meth a recipe anyone could follow,” he said.\n\nThe Nazi method produced small amounts of the drug, not the big batches typically cooked up in rural \"superlabs.\" But unlike previous manufacturing methods, Nazi dope didn't require an open heat source. It involved fewer steps, and took less time.\n\n\"From start to finish, you could probably do it in an hour,\" Cornille said.\n\nAdditionally, the chemicals involved were legal, and often easy to obtain. It takes hundreds of pseudoephedrine pills to make a half ounce of meth. But purchasing cold medicine in vast quantities didn't raise eyebrows in the early 1990s.\n\n\"At that time, if someone came in and bought 10 boxes of pseudoephedrine, Walgreens was happy,\" Cornille said.\n\nBob Paillet ordered a pecan waffle with extra butter and a glass of milk, then settled into the booth at a north Springfield Waffle House. He was wearing a wire.\n\nAfter being arrested on Feb. 2, 1993, the Springfield-area resident told the authorities that he'd taught his new recipe for methamphetamine — the so-called \"Nazi method\" — to a friend. Now, less than 24 hours later, Paillet, 49, was killing time reading the newspaper, waiting for that man to arrive. Drug Enforcement Administration agent John Cornille and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper were listening from a van parked nearby.\n\n\"Hey, late as usual,\" Paillet said as Mike Poplawski, 34, arrived.\n\nA transcript of the conversation that took place over breakfast — obtained from the DEA under the Freedom of Information Act — is heavily redacted, with Poplawski's comments completely blacked out.\n\nBy the time they parted ways, however, Poplawski had given Paillet 279 milligrams of meth, according to court documents. The wire caught everything.\n\nThe next day, Cornille and the trooper showed up at Poplawski's home on South Newton Street.\n\nPoplawski was cooperative. He invited the officers in, and, when told there was an ongoing investigation that involved him, admitted that he cooked meth, according to court documents. He showed the trooper a baggie of the drug inside his wallet, and then took them to another apartment where he stored lab equipment and precursor chemicals.\n\nLater, at the DEA office, Poplawski confirmed he'd been taught by Paillet how to make meth using the Nazi method.\n\nIn a recent interview, Poplawski, now 59, said he first met Paillet in 1979.\n\nRollerskating was the thing to do back then, and \"we were both hotdoggers,\" Poplawski said, using a term for those fond of showing off. The pair — 35 and 21 years old — met at a north Springfield rink. Poplawski said they were among the first in the city to purchase jogger skates, basically tennis shoes with big, brightly-colored wheels.\n\nPoplawski said he believes Paillet might've smoked a little pot back then, and he drank, but he didn't do anything harder. Then Paillet left for California. When he returned, he was into meth. And Poplawski was, too.\n\nHe attempted to describe his relationship with Paillet back then.\n\n\"Friend?\" he said. \"No. Associate. Close associate.\"\n\nIt's unclear from court records when Paillet taught Poplawski the Nazi method. Poplawski declined to clarify the timeline.\n\nPoplawski did state that, sometime in 1992, there'd been what might be called a misunderstanding between the pair. Paillet asked Poplawski to stop giving meth to a mutual friend of theirs. Poplawski complied. The friend complained to Paillet, who by that point had forgotten his earlier directive and became angry at Poplawski. The two stopped talking.\n\nThen six or eight months later, there was a phone call. And a request to meet at the Waffle House along North Kansas Expressway. From Poplawski's perspective, it seemed an effort to repair the rift.\n\nSitting in the living room of his east Springfield home, Poplawski briefly looked over the redacted transcript of the conversation that day. Some of it was small talk, he said. Mostly, Paillet was \"crying about hurting, wanting some speed.\"\n\nIt's been nearly a quarter century since the conversation, and Poplawski doesn't have a single positive thing to say about Paillet.\n\nThe man was chauvinistic, he said. A shorter guy with \"a big man's want for power,\" someone who walked around \"like a bantam rooster.\" A guy who \"hit on every woman that he come across, no matter what.\" And a man whose defining obsession — all speeders have one, Poplawski said — was \"his process,\" the way he made his dope.\n\n\"He experimented on people,\" Poplawski said. \"He’d change the formula a little bit and then give it to junkies he knew’d take it and ask no questions, and then watch their reactions. This is the guy that DEA worked with.\"\n\nAs Poplawski looked at the transcript, he wouldn't even agree with Paillet's remark that he showed up to the Waffle House late.\n\n“I’m more on time than anybody I know,” he said.\n\nThe authorities didn't stop with Poplawski.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. on July 26, 1993, Cornille and three other law enforcement officers parked their vehicles in rural Webster County, with a barn in sight. They were investigating the latest appearance of Nazi dope. Cornille remembers hearing coyotes howl.\n\n\"Having moved from D.C. to here, it was a bit of a change for me,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, an informant told a Springfield police detective that a man named Frank Wright was planning to cook meth at the barn, which was owned by an associate, Gary Davis. The men would start once the sun went down, the informant said, to take advantage of lower humidity levels. The informant indicated Wright drove a green Dodge van. It was parked by the barn.\n\nInvestigators would later learn that, earlier that afternoon, Davis heard that a friend with a similar vehicle was stopped by the DEA. Davis became nervous and told Wright to \"burn the barn\" if agents showed up.\n\nAround 10 p.m., the van started up. It drove off the property, headed west. Cornille and the others followed and initiated a traffic stop.\n\nWright agreed to a search. The van was clean. But the officers found a cigarette pack with a small amount of meth on Wright himself. They read him his rights.\n\nWright admitted to the authorities that he was planning to cook meth, and said he was placing supplies inside the barn. It was to have been something of a trade, court documents indicate. Davis, in exchange for providing the setting for the cook, was to receive two \"eight balls\" — the term for an eighth of an ounce — and be allowed to assist in production, so as to learn the new method himself.\n\nWright was arrested. The barn, by all accounts, escaped unharmed.\n\nDavis contacted the DEA a week later. He admitted to knowing about plans for the cook and said he'd participated in an earlier one.\n\nWright, in turn, contacted the DEA in mid-August. He said he'd been introduced to meth about 18 months prior when he was at Poplawski's home. Paillet showed up to deliver the drug. Wright said he started doing work on Paillet's vehicle, and his involvement gradually grew, until he was loading and unloading chemicals and driving Paillet around while he distributed meth.\n\nWright told the DEA that Poplawski taught him to make meth. He described it as a somewhat formal process that entailed assisting with three cooks. (Poplawski, in a recent interview, denied ever teaching anyone the Nazi method).\n\nThe hardest ingredient to obtain was sodium metal, Wright told the DEA, so he figured out a way to manufacture it himself, using lye, an electric stove, jumper cables and a 12-volt car battery.\n\nHow did Wright come up with the workaround? Perhaps his time with Paillet influenced him.\n\n\"In late June, 1993, or early July, 1993, Wright did research into the manufacture of sodium metal at Southwest Missouri State University,\" court documents say.\n\nPaillet, Poplawski, Wright and Davis were indicted by a federal grand jury on Oct. 8. 1993, along with two others, Kenneth and Sybil Allen. Court documents say Poplawski sold meth to, and purchased meth from, the couple. The charge against Sybil Allen was later dropped.\n\nNone of them were rich, at least as far as the court knew. Financial affidavits indicate that Poplawski was the only one employed in a traditional sense, bringing home $280 a week. Paillet and the others were listed as self-employed or unemployed, with minimal assets.\n\nThree of the men had a record. Poplawski had been convicted in 1978 of felony robbery in Phelps County. Two others had stealing and drug offenses.\n\nThe men all initially pleaded not guilty and bonded out of jail. Dates were set for jury trials. Behind the scenes, however, negotiations were being made for plea agreements.\n\nBetween mid-December and early January 1994, all five pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth. In exchange, additional charges against some of them, for physically manufacturing or possessing the drug, were dropped.\n\nWith Paillet and his co-conspirators rounded up, the authorities could have been excused for thinking they'd nipped the nascent meth-making boom in the bud. But they were soon disappointed. The recipe for Nazi dope was no longer a secret.\n\nThe inaugural class of those involved with \"Nazi dope\" was sentenced in Springfield in the spring of 1994.\n\nThere was Bob Paillet, who told authorities he was the pioneer behind the new meth labs popping up in southwest Missouri; Mike Poplawski, to whom Paillet taught his new method; Frank Wright, who said he learned it from Poplawski; Gary Davis, who arranged to learn it from Wright; and Kenneth Allen, who bought meth from, and sold meth to, Poplawski.\n\nAllen, who tested positive for using drugs while on bond, was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nDavis also used meth while on bond and traveled without permission out of the state. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nPoplawski was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.\n\nIf the sentencing guidelines at the time were followed, Wright would've faced something similar — between six to seven years behind bars. Prosecutors, however, told the judge he provided \"substantial assistance\" in the prosecution of Poplawski. So he was sentenced to about three years in prison, followed by a similar amount of probation.\n\nThen there was Paillet, who received the best deal of them all.\n\nUsing the sentencing guidelines, prosecutors calculated Paillet's \"total offense level\" to be 31. That would correspond with nine to 11 years behind bars. The prosecutors, however, wrote that \"defendant agreed to fully cooperate with the government.\" He was credited with assisting in obtaining the guilty pleas of the others: Poplawski, Allen, Wright and Davis.\n\nAdditionally, the prosecutors wrote that Paillet \"provided significant information concerning the origin of this particular method of making methamphetamine.\"\n\n\"Defendant fully admitted that he first devised this method of making methamphetamine, and it was through him that the method was related to other 'cooks' in the southwest Missouri area,\" they wrote.\n\nPaillet was sentenced to five years of probation. He also attended a drug treatment program. While there, he received a letter from his oldest daughter, living in California.\n\n\"Surprise, Surprise,\" she wrote. \"If I would have known you could do things like that I would have asked for help with my chemistry homework.\"\n\nNearly a quarter century later, Poplawski doesn't understand how Paillet didn't spend a day in prison.\n\n“This was the man that experimented on people, and the DEA worked with him,\" Poplawski said. \"I’m a little burnt about that, still. It still rises my anger a bunch. Not that I was interested in working with them myself, don’t get me wrong, and not that I wasn’t involved, don’t get me wrong there. But I was not the man on top. I was not the man to hit for the heavy sentence.”\n\nPoplawski was implicated when Paillet wore a wire to their meeting at a north Springfield Waffle House. Poplawski told the News-Leader the pair never spoke after that day, except for one comment when they found themselves in the same courtroom.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" Paillet told the man who had once been his friend. Poplawski, flabbergasted, didn't respond.\n\n\"If I could’ve shot lightning out of my eyes, he’d have been a pile of flesh, a pile of ash, in a heartbeat,\" Poplawski said. \"He just cost me five years. He cost me five years.”\n\nThere's something about calling a drug recipe the \"Nazi method\" that attracts attention.\n\nA few days after Paillet was arrested in February 1993, the News-Leader wrote about the bust. A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration was quoted saying that \"people give their drugs all kind of names.\"\n\n\"Just because it was made by German soldiers during World War II and now is called 'Nazi drugs' has no meaning to us,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It's a nothingness. It only means that the producers don't have to use the usual ingredients, that they can make it without the regular methods. It's dangerous, no matter what you call it or how you make it.\"\n\nThere's a problem with the spokeswoman's response — one that's been replicated in many subsequent discussions of the Nazi method. It implied there's a direct link between Paillet's recipe and the Third Reich. But is there? After reviewing the available evidence, the News-Leader found the connection, while compelling, is tenuous.\n\nResearchers have delved into German use of meth during World War II. Temmler, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company, introduced meth in pill form under the brand name Pervitin in 1938, according to a 2005 report in the news magazine Der Spiegel. By 1940, millions of pills were being shipped to the front lines, resulting \"in a Blitzkrieg fueled by speed.\"\n\nGermany wasn't alone in exploiting new substances with minimal consideration for side effects. The United States and British supplied service members with tablets of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, during the same period. Both were viewed as particularly valuable for pilots, who needed to remain alert on long bombing raids.\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of Pervitin pills in German factories, however, stands in stark contrast to Paillet's method, which resulted in small amounts of a powdered version of the drug. Which raises the question: If the method wasn't the same, how did meth produced in southwest Missouri end up referencing a fascist state?\n\nIn an interview, DEA agent John Cornille said that Paillet told him he learned the Nazi method by researching in the library at what was then Southwest Missouri State University. Cornille said Paillet indicated he came across a book or a document with a swastika on it.\n\nThose two particular claims aren't found in the hundreds of pages of federal court and DEA records reviewed for this story. The DEA records, which were heavily redacted, do include one conversation in which Cornille asked Paillet if he looked \"this stuff up in a book or something.\" The response, however, contradicts the notion that there was one all-important document.\n\n\"OK, I have a lot of books,\" Paillet said. \"I have gone through the library, many libraries and read lots of books, hundreds of 'em. Ah, involving many phrases of chemistry.\"\n\nCornille asked what books \"originally kinda gave you this idea that maybe this thing could work.\"\n\n\"I can’t say that it was any one in particular,\" Paillet responded.\n\nCornille told the News-Leader he believes most of the backstory Paillet gave regarding his discovery. However, he said the DEA tried to determine the exact book that contributed to Paillet's breakthrough, but came up empty-handed.\n\n“I believe he found it in a book at SMS,\" Cornille said. \"But the swastika thing — they looked far and wide.”\n\nThe man who did the searching says it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nTerry Dal Cason retired from a 40-year-career as a forensic chemist with the DEA in 2011. He told the News-Leader that, back in the mid-1990s, his colleagues in the world of meth lab analysis didn't talk vaguely about a cook in southwest Missouri coming across a book or document with a swastika on it, as Cornille does now.\n\nInstead, Dal Cason said, they specifically mentioned a \"Nazi patent.\" Some of his colleagues stated as fact that the cook came across a patent that contained the exact recipe for Nazi dope. But Dal Cason wanted proof.\n\n\"People kept talking about this patent, and I was trying to get a copy of it,\" he said.\n\nDal Cason ended up with two theories. In 1997, he laid them out in an article for a little-known DEA publication called Microgram.\n\nTheory one:\n\nDal Cason wrote that \"one of the earliest groups\" to make Nazi dope compiled packets of documents that included instructions for the method, and hid them away from their lab sites. If the lab was busted, the hidden packets insured they'd still have a written copy of the recipe somewhere, Dal Cason wrote.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the name? \"The top page of the synthesis 'packets' was a photocopy of a drawing from the cover of a video cassette case of the Third Reich propaganda film, 'Triumph des Willens,'\" Dal Cason wrote.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will,\" the English translation of the title, was commissioned by Hitler. The drawing Dal Cason referred to shows an eagle clutching a wreath containing a swastika.\n\nDal Cason wrote in 1997 that \"it is relatively easy to postulate how the seizure of these packets could present an opportunity to misinterpret a relationship between the most recognizable of NAZI symbols and the Li (or Na)/NH3 reduction procedure contained in the packets.\"\n\n\"From this point it is easy to imagine a 'word of mouth' genesis of the 'Nazi patent' myth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe documents and court records reviewed by the News-Leader do note materials seized in connection with the investigation of Paillet and his associates, but don't mention the German propaganda film. Dal Cason told the News-Leader he didn't recall the specific individuals who apparently hid the packets. The footnotes of his Microgram article reference cases filed in federal court in 1996, years after Paillet was arrested and the Nazi dope moniker was first used.\n\nTheory two:\n\nDal Cason also asked a colleague in the United Kingdom to search German patents. Those published from 1932 to 1945 were topped with the \"Imperial Eagle,\" a coat of arms depicting an eagle perched on wreath containing a swastika (similar, but not identical, to imagery on Triumph Des Willens).\n\nLeslie King, head of the Forensic Science Service's Drugs Intelligence Laboratory, wrote Dal Cason in October 1996, and said he failed to find a patent for the technique Paillet used.\n\nThere were, however, patents that were somewhat related. Dal Cason said the packets mentioned in his first theory contained not just a recipe for the Nazi method, but also instructions for another process using methcathinone.\n\nDal Cason said King found a German patent from 1936 which provided techniques for synthesizing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine using methcathinone.\n\n\"The chemical names 'Ephedrinen' and 'Pseudoephedrine' are easily recognized among the German wording of the patent,\" Dal Cason wrote. \"Misinterpretation of the patent's content, combined with a clandestine laboratory having chemicals appropriate for the Li(Na)/NH3 method, might easily lead to the assumption that this process was described in the patent.\"\n\nTo be clear, however, the patent wasn't describing the method Paillet used. And to Dal Cason's knowledge, no one ever found a copy of the German patent in connection with a lab bust — it's something for which Dal Cason had to search.\n\nThe audience for Microgram, where Dal Cason's article appeared, was largely limited to law enforcement. An editor's note attached to the piece read: \"If anyone has hard evidence that a 'NAZI' patent does exist, please contact the Microgram editor.\" Dal Cason never heard from anyone.\n\nPoplawski, for his part, offered a third theory.\n\nIn an interview, he said Paillet \"wasn't smart enough to invent\" the method, and that he must have gotten the recipe from someone else. Poplawski also said he never heard Paillet or any of his associates use the phrases 'Nazi method\" or \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“The first time we heard it the DEA threw it out there, and we had no idea what they were talking about,” he said.\n\nWhy does all this matter? Words stir emotion. Dan Viets — a defense attorney based in Columbia, Missouri — told the News-Leader that, by the late 1990s, prosecutors were brandishing the Nazi method moniker \"as a weapon\" in front of juries, taking advantage of the average person's extreme dislike of Nazis.\n\nViets considers the term \"obviously prejudicial,\" particularly given the the lack of an established connection between Paillet's method and actual Nazis.\n\n\"The cops liked to say that as many times as they could in a courtroom,\" he said.\n\nThe sentencing of Paillet and his associates didn't stop use of the Nazi method.\n\nInstead, the opposite occurred. The small-scale labs began to proliferate.\n\nAt first, most state and local officials, such as the average rural county sheriff's office, didn't have the training to safely deal with meth labs. Instead, they'd call the DEA. As the 1990s progressed, Cornille says he began feeling like a firefighter, rushing from small blaze to small blaze without time to investigate their causes. Instead of fires, of course, it was meth labs — although the explosions the labs sometimes prompted could end up blurring the distinction.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol, contacted by the News-Leader this fall, could only find records regarding the number of meth lab incidents in the state annually dating back to 1996. That year, according to the patrol, there were 121 labs found.\n\nThat figure increased to 319 in 1997. Then 480 in 1998. Then 615 in 1999.\n\n\"Once everything got rolling, it spread like wildfire,\" said Nick Console, who led the DEA's Springfield office for about a decade starting in 1994.\n\n(A meth lab doesn't have to be operational when it is discovered to be counted in state or federal tallies of \"meth lab incidents.\" Those tallies generally also count situations when authorities seize materials used to make meth, or find sites where lab waste material has been discarded.)\n\nCornille said he recalls Paillet telling him that he taught five people his method for Nazi dope.\n\n“My initial thought was if we could get those five, we could make an impact,\" Cornille said. \"But it didn’t work. Maybe we didn’t get one or we didn’t get to them fast enough.”\n\nConsole said he spent the mid-to-late 1990s trying to warn DEA leadership in Washington D.C. that what was happening in southwest Missouri was a serious situation, one that could get worse if unchecked. He says the leaders didn't feel a sense of urgency.\n\n\"We’re trying to tell them — it’s not heroin, it’s not cocaine,\" Console said. \"It’s not a major organization, like a biker gang, that’s producing large amounts of methamphetamine. It’s Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith down here, and the Johnsons over here, making a half ounce. In their eyes, that wasn’t a problem. That was a local problem. It wasn’t a national problem.\"\n\nThe spread of the Nazi method meant that a drug once manufactured in large quantities by \"superlabs\" situated away from populated areas was now being produced on a small scale within towns and cities.\n\nConsole said he can tell stories all day about unusual busts.\n\nThere was the time agents executed a search warrant and noticed bullet holes in the ceiling of a bedroom. When they asked the home's resident why, the man said he knew the agents were monitoring him from his attic, so he shot at them while he laid in bed. The agents hadn't been to the house previously.\n\n“Think about being up without sleep for seven days,\" Console says. \"Think about it. Where would your mind be, where would your body be? So they’d become very paranoid.”\n\nThere was the man in Joplin whose lab exploded, the force of it enough to embed sodium metal in his skin. Sodium metal reacts when it comes in contact with water. When someone went to clean the man's body with a saline solution at the hospital, the sodium metal exploded — the \"pops\" sounding like a miniature fireworks display.\n\nThen there were the deformed chickens. Agents responded to a farm in Christian County where large tanks of anhydrous ammonia were buried in the barn. The stuff wasn't being used as fertilizer.\n\n\"He had chickens with double beaks, he had chickens that were a foot growing out of another foot,\" Console said. \"All the chemicals they were using — they were making meth there for a long time — were being dumped all over the area where the chickens were being raised.\n\nIn 1998, the man credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of methamphetamine production was contacted by a News-Leader reporter.\n\nBob Paillet had moved to Texas from southwest Missouri several years prior, not long after being sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute the drug. He was still on probation.\n\nIt appears to be Paillet's only published interview. He expressed regret to reporter Laura Bauer.\n\n\"I never thought it would spread like this,\" he said. \" ... I don't travel in those circles anymore.\"\n\nIn the years after his arrest, Paillet also wrote several letters to — and once spoke on the phone with — John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated him.\n\n\"I can remember him expressing remorse that he had started 'this mess,' as he referred to it,\" Cornille said.\n\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Nazi dope was no longer a Missouri-specific phenomenon.\n\nIn north Texas, the commander of an 11-county narcotics task force told a magazine in 2001 that the unit came across its first Nazi lab three years prior. By the following summer, the task force was busting one every week.\n\n\"It has exploded on the scene so quick, it's so easy to do, and there are so many people involved in manufacturing it, that it has completely overtaxed our capabilities,\" the commander said.\n\nIn Illinois, a state police representative said in November 2000 that meth labs were \"getting to the epidemic stage.\" He cited the fact that the state was on track to have 400 lab busts by the end of the year. Within four years, Illinois would be logging more than 1,500 labs annually.\n\nIn California, the Modesto Bee reported in 2000 that officials in the Central Valley had encountered eight labs using the Nazi method, and that \"five of them were traced to a man from Missouri who had moved into a trailer park near Fresno and was teaching this method.\"\n\nOfficials in numerous other communities around the country reported a version of the same thing.\n\nNick Console, the former head of Springfield's DEA office, said top agency officials did little to respond to the growth in small-scale labs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, he said, that began to change, as politicians representing affected communities began putting pressure on the agency.\n\n“It took ‘em a good eight to 10 years,\" Console said. \"And the damage was already done, it’d already spread.”\n\nThe Nazi method didn't just spread cook to cook. Its rise coincided with the early days of the modern internet and anonymous forums like The Hive, where users traded information about illegal substances.\n\n\"There were a number of really good dope sites,\" said Terry Dal Cason, a retired DEA forensic chemist who investigated the origins of the Nazi method moniker.\n\nSince 2002, the DEA has published an annual report called the \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" which details the prevalence of illegal drugs in the United States.\n\nEach year, the agency asks various state and local law enforcement agencies what they consider the \"greatest drug threat\" in their community. In 2003, 33.1 percent of agencies selected cocaine. Methamphetamine was second, with 31 percent.\n\nThe report stated that meth was widely available in the western and central United States and gradually becoming more available in the eastern United States. It concluded, however, that “despite the rising threat, methamphetamine is not likely to surpass the overall threat posed to the United States by powder cocaine and crack in the near term.”\n\nTwo years later, it did.\n\nThe 2005 report read: \"According to state and local law enforcement agencies, the threat associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has increased sharply since 2002 and now exceeds that of any other drug.\"\n\nTo be clear, the Nazi method wasn't the only way meth consumed in America was produced. In its annual reports, the DEA largely focused on other sources.\n\nFirst, there was the foreign supply; meth was smuggled into the United States from Mexico and, to a much lesser extent, southeast Asia.\n\nThen there were the domestic \"superlabs\" — those capable of producing 10 pounds of meth in a single day. In 2001, federal authorities seized 303 of them, two-thirds of which were located in California. The California labs alone likely produced more meth than all other domestic laboratories combined, the DEA wrote.\n\nThere was regional variation, however. In 2002, the agency wrote that \"local independents account for as much as 80 percent of retail methamphetamine distribution in some areas of the country,” specifically the central United States. The Nazi method was a key process used, but there were also other recipes, like the \"Red-P\" method named for the required red phosphorous.\n\nThe DEA struggled to accurately detail the problem. In 2004, the agency wrote that meth use and distribution in the Midwest was \"very high\" in rural and suburban areas, but \"less so in metropolitan areas, where most drug consequence data are collected.\"\n\n\"Therefore, available drug consequence data for methamphetamine use in the Central States likely under-represents the problem, perhaps significantly,\" the agency wrote.\n\nSmall labs accounted for much of the drug's impact on communities, which was felt in burn units and mental health clinics, courtrooms and cemeteries. While the Nazi method simplified meth production, it didn't make it foolproof. The more labs, and the more cooks, the more opportunities for something to go wrong, and the greater the cost of cleanup.\n\nIn 2003, there were 361 reported fires and explosions at meth lab sites, and 255 law enforcement officers were injured responding, according to the DEA. The agency spent $16.3 million on laboratory cleanup that fiscal year, eight times more than it spent less than a decade earlier.\n\nThat same year, the DEA reported that 893 children were present when meth labs were seized. About two-thirds tested positive for toxic levels of chemicals in their bodies. The agency said \"child neglect and abuse are common within families whose parents or caregivers produce or use methamphetamine.\"\n\n“The devastation and the damage to kids … I understand why Bob had regret,\" Cornille said.\n\nNationwide, meth lab busts peaked in 2004, when there were nearly 24,000 seizures.\n\nAlmost 3,000 of them were in Missouri. Two years earlier, the number of meth lab busts in the state passed those in California — the birthplace of the methamphetamine industry — for the first time. Since then, Missouri has led the nation most years, never dropping below third in annual busts. In some parts of the country, the area code for southwest Missouri, 417, is said to be slang for meth, or a particular type.\n\nCornille and Console both acknowledge that if Paillet hadn't introduced the Nazi method, someone else might have done so a short time later. Just like any legal industry, there is a steady pace of innovation in the world of illegal drugs, typically in response to some government crackdown.\n\nTo combat meth in the early 2000s, laws were implemented requiring medications containing pseudoephedrine to be sold from behind the counter. In 2007, fewer than 7,000 meth labs were seized across the country.\n\nBut makers and users adjusted, developing what became known as \"one-pot\" or \"shake-and-bake\" meth production, in which just a couple of pseudoephedrine pills are mixed in a 2-liter soda bottle for smaller batches. The new method led to another spike — 15,000 national meth lab busts in 2010.\n\nConsole said he views these newer methods as just continued innovation. The Nazi method was the truly critical shift, he said — the one that turned meth consumers into producers.\n\nAfter they were sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth, those indicted alongside Paillet struggled to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nKenneth Allen, who was given three years probation, ended up behind bars after he repeatedly tested positive for meth; he was also arrested for driving with a revoked license and failing to support his dependents.\n\nMichael Poplawski, sentenced to nearly six years in prison, later completed community service for patronizing a prostitute in the early 2000s, according to online court records. He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, with intent to distribute, in 2012.\n\nGary Davis, sentenced to five years in prison, briefly escaped in August 1994 from the Kansas facility where he was incarcerated. His sentence was later reduced for aiding in the prosecution of two others, but he ultimately ended up back behind bars. Davis is currently serving time in a federal penitentiary in Texas for, among other things, stealing explosive materials and conspiring to use them to rob a bank, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCourt records indicate that Paillet never violated parole. There is no evidence he got in trouble with the law during the rest of his life.\n\nPaillet found work after he moved to Texas in the mid-1990s. His youngest daughter said he was a CNC programmer, developing the programs that run automated machining equipment. His oldest daughter, however, said Paillet did sales and technical installations for a company.\n\nBy the end of the decade, health problems prompted him to go on disability, and he talked about having dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by uncontrollable and sometimes painful muscle spasms.\n\nCourt records indicate Paillet divorced his third wife in 2008. He spent the final years of his life living with another woman in a trailer park in Sherman, a city of about 40,000 an hour north of Dallas.\n\nIn 2014, Stephanie Denton, 37, moved into the unit next to Paillet. Within a few months, she and Paillet — now in his early 70s — were drinking coffee together every morning.\n\nDenton was having issues in her relationship, and her son was having legal troubles; Paillet encouraged her to be more positive, she said. From what Denton could tell, her neighbor didn't really have close friends.\n\nPaillet didn't talk about his past very much, Denton said. She knew he was a Vietnam vet — Paillet talked about the war being pointless — and that he'd been involved with drugs to a degree. She said he claimed he'd sold drugs to raise money for a school for disabled kids.\n\nPaillet was more inclined to talk about the government, with a bent more paranoid than partisan. Denton said he repeated a well-known conspiracy theory that claims the Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to imprison citizens in camps after the imposition of martial law. Paillet's minimal online presence included posts about a group advocating for the secession of the state of Texas.\n\nPaillet also had an extensive rock collection and talked and posted online about searching for gold on a claim in Colorado. He appears to have become obsessed with the process, not unlike his days of manufacturing meth.\n\n“He first really started talking about gold mining after he was arrested,\" his oldest daughter Lisa Paillet said. \"One of the things that he was really very interested in doing was separating gold from rock, so not mining in the river, but using chemistry to remove gold from rock without requiring massive amounts of water.\"\n\nLisa said her father's health issues worsened during the final years of his life, and that he appeared to be struggling with dementia at times. In what would end up being her last conversation with her father, he talked about his will.\n\nBob Paillet didn't leave a suicide note.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of Jan. 1, 2016, the 72-year-old drove his red Dodge truck from the mobile home park where he lived in Sherman, Texas, to a nearby hospital. It was a little over a mile. Then, he took a gun — \"he had a lot of guns,\" said his daughter Gena — walked to the front of the vehicle, and shot himself in the head. He died minutes later in the emergency room.\n\nPaillet's family held a memorial service after his death. To the outside world, however, the only acknowledgement of his passing can be found on the website of a Denison, Texas, funeral home. It's not really an obituary, just a name and a pair of dates.\n\nThere's a guest book option on the site. One person — Paillet's second wife, Gena's mother — has left a message: \"We had a lot of happy years together. You will be missed. Your pain is over, ours now begins.\"\n\nOtherwise, there was nothing in the public record acknowledging that the man credited with reinventing methamphetamine production in the U.S. was dead. All in all, it probably turned out about how Paillet would have wanted it.\n\nIn 1998, he spoke briefly with a News-Leader reporter, the only time he was ever quoted in the media. At the time, meth lab busts were drastically increasing across the central United States. Authorities were blaming the phenomenon on the ease of the \"Nazi method,\" and said Paillet pioneered it while living in the Springfield area.\n\nIn that interview, Paillet expressed regret, as well as a wish regarding his future.\n\n\"I hope my name is forgotten or it's put in the back of people's minds,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps Paillet found some measure of peace. In an interview, Gena said that, while growing up, she was not allowed to talk or ask about the concept of a God around her father. In his later years, however, Bob Paillet softened on that view.\n\nIn 2008, he wrote on online message boards that \"I was an atheist, then agnostic, and now I believe that there is a God.\" He also said that he believed in evolution, and expressed a degree of incredulity that there are individuals who do not.\n\n\"He was still a scientific man, but he found his version of God,” Gena said.\n\nGena, 38, came of age in a world that her father helped create.\n\nGrowing up in Morrisville, she \"never really fit in,\" she said, and started drinking at an early age. When Gena and her mother moved to Springfield, she \"immediately just fell in with the wrong crowd.\" She graduated from Springfield's Parkview High School in 1996.\n\n\"A lot of people believe that addiction is genetic,\" Gena said. \"I am my father's daughter, not just in that way, but every way that there is.\"\n\nGena said she used meth for the first time at age 15. Two years later, she met Steven Joseph Brown, the man who would become her husband.\n\n\"He used needles, and he shot me up for the first time with heroin, and it was pretty much over from there,\" she said. \"It was always either that or meth. There was like a two-year period where I probably never slept. It’s been a struggle for me ever since.\"\n\nBrown — who died in February 2016 — was 16 years older than Gena. Prior to meeting her, he gave Gena's father precursor chemicals in exchange for meth, she said. At one point, he was even arrested by John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated Bob.\n\n“My husband kind of ended up learning my dad’s recipe,\" Gena said. \"Not anywhere near as good as my dad.”\n\nGena, who said she grew up fearing her father, first got in trouble for drugs when she was 17. She thought her father was going to kill her. Instead, she said, he \"became my best friend ever, because we understood each other.\"\n\n\"My mom — I love my mom — she’s never done a drug in her life,\" Gena said. \"She’s had maybe one speeding ticket, and I think she even got that dismissed. Really this connection grew between him and me that was just amazing. I could really do no wrong in his eyes.”\n\nGena said that between her late teens and late 2015, she was only \"clean\" for extended periods twice, when she became pregnant. \"But I always went pretty much right back.\"\n\nIn late December 2015, Gena said, she overdosed on heroin. Gena's mother, who she lived with at the time, kicked her out of her house. Gena called her father, who paid for a motel room for a week, and indicated she should come live with him in Texas.\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to go to your parole officer and start getting everything transferred down here and I want you to come back here,' and he said, 'I will get you through this,'\" Gena said.\n\nTwo days later, she got the call that her father was dead.\n\nGena said she traveled to Texas to attend her father's memorial service, but got in a dispute with the woman Bob was living with at the time of his death, and ended up leaving beforehand (Lisa Paillet described her half-sister as \"high as a kite\" at the time). Gena expressed regret that she didn't receive something her father wanted her to have — \"this metal container thing that his very first successful batch of stuff was made in.”\n\nIn August, Gena said she put herself through treatment after returning from Bob's memorial service. She said she had been clean since Jan. 25.\n\n\"It really hurts me that my dad never got to see me get my life together,\" she said.\n\nBy November, however, Gena was back in a three-week rehab program. She attributed the relapse to her depression, and said she \"wasn’t managing it with medication like I should have been.\" In early May, she said she had stayed clean since completing the program.\n\n\"It’s still hard a lot of days,\" Gena said. \"And it’s hard to stay away from the people that kind of want to push it on you.”\n\nLisa Paillet, who asked that her first name be changed for this story, graduated in 1991 from then-Southwest Missouri State University with a degree in theater — which she said her father \"paid for, I’m pretty sure, with drug money.\"\n\nShe returned to California, where she grew up, and gradually drifted away from theater-related work. When her father, then on probation in Texas, found a job that made machining equipment, he paid for her to go to school to get a machinist's certification. She was hired by a company she described as being in the military aerospace research sector, which paid for her to get a bachelor's degree in engineering.\n\n“That’s when our conversations about science really took off, and we would talk for long periods of time,” she said of her father.\n\nRegarding her sister, she said Gena's \"world is very, very different from mine.”\n\n“He and Gena had a very, very different relationship than he and I had ... I think he treated her far more like a child than he ever treated me,\" Lisa said. \"And because he didn’t really raise me, he didn’t have rules for me … I think even though I went down his road a little bit when I was very young, I think my upbringing with my mother definitely was not the same.”\n\nLisa said her father's decision to take his own life wasn't entirely unexpected. Suicide was something he mentioned casually over the years, she said.\n\n\"He knew he was going to commit suicide if he ever got too sick, and I knew it a long time ago,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob Paillet's parents died in the 1980s. They are buried in a cemetery in Exeter, Missouri, where they lived and where Bob spent his high school years.\n\nLisa said her father, who became obsessed with gold mining in the later years of his life, requested his ashes be scattered at his gold claim. However, she's has been unable to find it. When Lisa called Colorado, she was told he didn't have a claim in the state.\n\nThough Paillet appears to have avoided run-ins with the law late in life, the process he pioneered continued to occupy authorities.\n\nSome states responded to the rise in small-scale meth labs by requiring prescriptions for purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine.\n\nMissouri didn't, but over time dozens of communities within the state instituted their own prescription laws. City leaders in Springfield debated doing the same in 2013, but the effort wasn't without controversy.\n\nThat fall, Councilwoman Cindy Rushefsky — a former prosecutor who supported the measure — asked Springfield's police chief to provide monthly reports detailing meth lab activity in the city. She pitched it as a way for council to stay informed on the issue. Councilman Doug Burlison, a libertarian who opposed the prescription requirement, described it as \"an attempt to educate us to have different opinions.\"\n\nThen a funny thing happened. The police chief's monthly reports consistently described fewer and fewer meth labs being found in the city. In July 2014, the prescription bill was tabled indefinitely.\n\nThe situation wasn't unique to Springfield. The number of small meth labs seized in the United States has declined in recent years, from about 15,000 in 2010 to about 4,500 in 2016.\n\nIt's not that the drug has lost its presence in the United States. Last year, when state and local law enforcement agencies were asked to name the greatest drug threat in their area, heroin received the most votes. The agencies that selected it, however, were strongly concentrated in the Great Lakes and northeast regions of the United States. In the western part of the country, more agencies chose meth.\n\nMost of that meth is produced in Mexico and smuggled across the border.\n\nIn a 2016 report, the DEA attributed the decline in domestic labs to the wide availability of high-purity, high-potency meth from Mexico, as well as the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, a federal law enacted in 2006 which placed restrictions on the meth precursors ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.\n\nNick Console, who spent about a decade as the top DEA official in Springfield, said Paillet's Nazi method may have prompted the cartels to become more involved with production of meth.\n\n\"Why? Because you had a huge addiction problem here in the United States to methamphetamine,\" he said. \"Supply and demand.”\n\nConsole retired to a farm in Ash Grove. John Cornille, the DEA agent most involved with investigating Paillet, still works for the agency.\n\nMike Poplawski — who was taught the Nazi method by Paillet himself — has served his prison sentence. He understands how the statute of limitations works, double jeopardy and all that.\n\nAsk him about the early days of Nazi dope, however, and he chooses his words carefully. He's convinced that saying certain things could get the DEA interested in him again. He says he's been at the same job for 15 years, together with his wife for 25 years.\n\n\"I’ve got grandkids that love me, step-kids that love me, extended family that love me,\" he said. \"You look from the other side — the law enforcement side — I’m a bad man.”\n\nIn an interview in his Springfield home, Poplawski, 59, said the people he considers meth's Nazi dope generation are \"all in jail or dead,\" and that those currently involved with the drug aren't self-starters. He voiced frustration at seeing \"bangers shooting each other, shooting up neighborhoods, doing dope and falling asleep in their cars with the kids in the cars and s---- like that.\"\n\n\"I want to go around with a .22 starter pistol and start capping people,\" he said. \"I can still find the houses. They’re not the same houses. But a speeder can always recognize another speeder.\"\n\nAsked about his own actions, Poplawski said \"if I knew then what I knew now, I would’ve done things different.\"\n\n\"I like to think that I had the ability to make a change,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"there's always going to be an addiction.\"\n\n\"The hole’s always there,\" Poplawski said. \"And once it got filled by meth, we had the meth crisis ... Now you’ve got [a] prescription drug crisis and you’ve got [a] heroin crisis hard. Meth’s bad. I don’t think heroin’s an improvement.\"\n\nReached at a federal prison in Texas, Gary Davis — the only other individual indicted alongside Paillet still living — declined to be interviewed without compensation. In a brief email, he did include one comment.\n\n\"Meth is a scourge on society,\" Davis wrote. \"I wish I would have never messed with it.\"\n\nPaillet expressed similar sentiments years before his death.\n\n\"I wish I never started it,\" he told a News-Leader reporter in 1998. \"I would never do it again.\"\n\n\"I caused a lot of trouble with a lot of people.\"\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nReporter Thomas Gounley began working on this story in the wake of Bob Paillet’s death in January 2016.\n\nThe events leading to the arrest of Paillet and his co-conspirators are detailed in federal court records. Additional information regarding Paillet was obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nInterviews with Paillet’s family members and one-time associates, along with current and retired law enforcement personnel, were conducted between August 2016 and May 2017. One of Paillet’s daughters, citing concerns regarding how this story could affect future job prospects, agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her first name be replaced with a pseudonym. Editors agreed to that request.\n\nThe photos of Bob Paillet in this story were provided by his daughters. Booking photos of those indicted alongside Paillet were obtained from the Greene County Archives and Records Center. Center staff said they did not have a booking photo of Paillet himself.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/04/28/iconic-circle-rock-roll-fight-firefly-lottery-news-around-states/50151855/", "title": "Iconic Circle K, rock 'n' roll fight: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPelham: New public access areas will be available later this year at Alabama’s largest state park, which is growing with the purchase of more than 1,600 acres of land in metro Birmingham. The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources plans to expand biking, hiking and horse-riding trails at Oak Mountain State Park with the addition of acreage acquired through the Forever Wild Land Trust, the agency said in a statement. The park, located in heavily populated Shelby County, will encompass more than 11,000 acres with the additional land, most of which is forested. “We’re still doing the environmental and biological assessments to identify those areas where we want to keep the public from disturbing threatened and endangered species,” said Commissioner Chris Blankenship. “So we’ll be looking to open up more public access later in 2022.” The land being added to the park was one of the largest undeveloped tracts near Birmingham along U.S. 280. It was owned by EBSCO Industries. Forever Wild has acquired 285,000 acres of land around the state, and nearly all of it allows public access for outdoor activities.\n\nAlaska\n\nHomer: A trailer containing mail intended for a dozen communities on the Kenai Peninsula caught fire and was destroyed. The driver of the truck hauling the trailer was not injured in the Tuesday incident, the Homer News reports. The cause of the fire is under investigation, the U.S. Postal Service said in a statement. The contract truck left a processing center in Anchorage and caught fire near Mile 38 of the Seward Highway, or just north of the intersection of the Seward and Sterling highways, near Tern Lake. Mail in the trailer was intended for Kasilof, Clam Gulch, Ninilchik, Anchor Point, Homer, Fritz Creek, Halibut Cove, Nanwalek, Nikolaevsk, Port Graham, Nikiski and Seldovia. Anyone who believes they were affected by the lost mail should contact the Postal Service. If a lost package was insured, a claim can be filed online. “The Postal Service regrets this unfortunate situation and any inconvenience it may cause,” USPS wrote in a copy of the letter attached to the press statement. “If you are questioned by a mailer, creditor or correspondent regarding mail or packages that may have been destroyed in this fire, feel free to use this letter as explanation.” The Postal Service should be able to identify lost mail or packages that had tracking numbers by Wednesday, said James Boxrud, an agency spokesperson.\n\nArizona\n\nTempe: Whoa. The Circle K that plays an important part in “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure” is closing, according to employees there. The store is where Keanu Reeves, who plays Ted in the 1989 film, utters the line: “Strange things are afoot at the Circle K.” Employees at the store, at 1010 W. Southern Ave. said they had been notified the store is closing May 19. Circle K’s ownership did not respond to requests for comment. Other Valley locations where the film was shot include Metrocenter Mall – already gone – and Golfland Sunsplash water park. In the film and its sequels, Bill and Ted are high school friends with a band, Wyld Stallyns. They’re also miserable students, and if they don’t pass an upcoming history exam, Ted’s father will send him to military school, breaking up the band. That can’t happen, though, because Wyld Stallyns will eventually unite the world in a utopian society. So George Carlin visits by way of a phone booth time machine to take them back to meet historical figures to help them pass. The Circle K is where Carlin first meets Bill and Ted. And now it’s going away. Sounds bogus.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain View: Authorities say they’ve identified a person of interest in connection with the fatal shootings of four people last week in a rural community. Arkansas State Police say the person is now jailed on unrelated charges. Police did not release that person’s name or say how they may be connected to the deaths last week in rural Stone County, about 75 miles north of Little Rock. According to state police, 77-year-old Shirley Watters and her 55-year-old son, James Watters, were found dead the afternoon of April 21 by a family member. State police said both had gunshot wounds. About eight hours later, investigators were called to a nearby home where William Clinton Trammell, 75, and his wife, Sharon Trammell, 72, were found dead, also with gunshot wounds, state police said. “While area residents should continue to be vigilant at their homes and while traveling through the area, the state police has not found any evidence to indicate an imminent threat related to this particular investigation,” state police said in a statement Tuesday night.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The spiraling number of overdose deaths and hospitalizations among prison inmates in the state fell dramatically during the first two years of a program that uses prescribed drugs to treat more incarcerated addicts than any such program in the country, officials said Tuesday. The rate of overdose deaths dropped 58% after the program began in 2020. Hospitalizations were 48% lower among those receiving the anti-craving drugs than among those waiting to begin treatment. The promising results show the program was effective even after accounting for restrictions during the coronavirus pandemic, according to doctors and researchers with the state corrections system and the federal official who oversees medical care in California prisons. The report said the large scale results “are trending in a positive direction,” and officials are “cautiously optimistic.” The findings come as Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration seeks $126.6 million in the next fiscal year and $162.5 million annually thereafter to expand treatment. The report said expanding the state’s latest expensive attempt to curtail the prisons’ pervasive drug problem is “at the highest priority level,” given the impact on prisoner health, community safety upon inmates’ release, and drug trafficking and violence it brings to prisons.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The head of the state’s parks and wildlife agency has been placed on paid leave after he reportedly referred to a Black colleague across a room as being “in the back of the bus” while on stage during a recent conference. Dan Prenzlow will be replaced by acting director Heather Dugan while a “fact-finding investigation” is conducted, said Dan Gibbs, the executive director of the Colorado Department of Natural Resources, which includes Colorado Parks and Wildlife. Gibbs did not explain what Prenzlow was accused of doing, only noting that he had received several complaints last week about “inappropriate comments and interactions” at Colorado Parks and Wildlife’s Partners in Outdoors Conference in Vail. According to Alease “Aloe” Lee, the agency’s statewide partnership coordinator and the conference’s organizer, Prenzlow asked 600 attendees to turn their attention to her as she was standing in the back of the room, The Denver Post reports. “There she is!” Prenzlow said, according to Lee. “In the back of the bus, Aloe!” In an open letter to Gov. Jared Polis, Lee said people’s heads turned in shock, and she ran into the arms of another Black woman, crying. Lee also wrote about her experience encountering a lot of people in the outdoor conservation industry “who do not value a Black woman in power.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state moved closer Tuesday toward placing tougher restrictions on marijuana advertising, including barring ads from cross-border retail cannabis establishments such as the billboard ads that have popped up along the border with Massachusetts. A bill that cleared the House of Representatives on a 98-48 vote prevents anyone without a Connecticut cannabis-related license from advertising the product or cannabis services within the state. The same bill also bars Connecticut licensees from using images of the cannabis plant, advertising on an illuminated billboard between 6 a.m. and 11 p.m., or advertising within 1,500 yards of a school or church. These new restrictions would be in addition to the state’s original rules for cannabis advertising that were included in the legalization law that passed last year. While residents over age 21 can legally possess up to 1.5 ounces of marijuana in Connecticut, retail recreational cannabis establishments are not expected to begin operating in the state until late 2022 at the earliest. Rep. Mike D’Agostino, D-Hamden, said that rather than an outright ban on the advertising, which would raise constitutional issues, the legislation provides “very reasonable time, place and manner restrictions” while also requiring those who advertise to hold Connecticut licenses.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A man who spent nearly half of his life behind bars before convincing the state Supreme Court that the 2008 murder trial that imprisoned him was unfair still hasn’t been able to leave prison. The court agreed last year that new evidence in the case of Mark Purnell, 32, “creates a strong inference that he is actually innocent.” That ruling discredited much of the evidence that convinced a jury to convict Purnell but left the door open for prosecutors to retry him for the 2006 murder of Tamika Giles in Wilmington’s Quaker Hill neighborhood – an opportunity prosecutors said shortly after that they intended to take. Nearly 10 months later, Purnell remains in prison. Prosecutors for the Delaware Department of Justice are arguing that he is too dangerous to be released on bail while also dangling immediate freedom in front of him if he would accept a deal to plead guilty to a lesser crime than murder, according to statements in court. His attorneys say that Purnell is determined to clear his name; that prosecutors likely won’t have a “single credible witness” to testify against him in a new trial, now scheduled for August; and that his continued imprisonment is an “outrage.” They are asking a judge to toss out the case against Purnell entirely or at least allow him out of jail to await a future trial.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Rapper Pharrell Williams made an appearance at Ballou High School on Tuesday, alongside Mayor Muriel Bowser, to help highlight summer events in D.C., including his own “Something in the Water” music festival. The festival – formerly held in Virginia Beach, where Williams grew up – will instead happen on the National Mall over Juneteenth weekend, WUSA-TV reports. Tickets for the three-day event June 17-19 go on sale Saturday at 10 a.m. Williams said the weekend chosen is no coincidence, meant to highlight the efforts that led to Virginia recognizing Juneteenth as a paid holiday in 2020 and “recognize that something that has been flowing through the country’s soil for over 400 years.” He has previously said he is moving the festival out of Virginia Beach due to how the city handled the investigation into the shooting death of his cousin by a police officer, according to the Associated Press. “When we hit challenges, you can either stop and stay stagnant, or you rise above it and go onwards and upwards,” Pharrell said. “We chose to take our festival to the highest grounds, in my opinion, in this entire nation: our National Mall.” Williams also said everyone in the room at Ballou would be given tickets to the festival, which will include performances by Calvin Harris, Pusha T, Chloe x Halle, Dave Matthews Band, Ashanti & Ja Rule, Lil Baby and more.\n\nFlorida\n\nPace: A sheriff invited a homeowner who shot at a would-be robber to attend a gun safety course to “learn to shoot a lot better” and “save the taxpayers money.” Santa Rosa County Sheriff Bob Johnson made the comments during a news conference last Thursday regarding the arrest of a 32-year-old man who was breaking into houses in Pace, in the Panhandle near Pensacola. Multiple residents called 911 on April 20 to report the break-ins, and deputies quickly set up a perimeter, Johnson said. The suspect was jumping over fences and breaking into homes as deputies tried to catch him. “We don’t know which homeowner shot at him. I guess they think that they did something wrong, which they did not,” Johnson said. “If someone is breaking into your house, you’re more than welcome to shoot at them in Santa Rosa County. We’d prefer that you do, actually.” He added that the sheriff’s office conducts a gun safety course every other Saturday. After shots were directed at the man, deputies eventually caught up to him, already inside another home. As they broke through a door he was trying to block, the man went head-first through a window to escape, cutting himself on the glass. He had active felony warrants for his arrest at the time of his capture and is being held on a $157,500 bond, facing multiple charges, records show.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Board members abruptly fired the leader of the state’s third-largest school system Tuesday, creating further questions about the district’s direction. DeKalb County School Board members voted 4-1 in a virtual meeting to fire Cheryl Watson-Harris immediately, after less than two years on the job in the 93,000-student district. Watson-Harris was DeKalb County’s sixth superintendent in a decade, having worked as first deputy chancellor in New York City’s sprawling school system before coming to Georgia. Watson-Harris said in a statement Wednesday that she was “blindsided” by her firing. “I was unaware that my contract or employment would be discussed during yesterday’s meeting as I was not notified and it was not identified on the meeting notice,” she said. Vasanne Tinsley, formerly deputy superintendent of student support and intervention, was named interim superintendent. The firing came hours after board Chair Vickie Turner appeared to blame Watson-Harris for poor conditions at one of the district’s high schools in a letter to state Superintendent Richard Woods. However, Turner and the majority of the board said in a statement that its “relationship with Mrs. Watson-Harris had been deteriorating for some time to the point the association became irreconcilable.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige said Tuesday that the state has agreed to pay $328 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed by 2,700 Native Hawaiians who languished on a waitlist to receive homestead leases. Ige said the Legislature must approve the funds for the settlement, and then a Circuit Court judge must sign off on its terms for it to be final. The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 was meant to provide economic self-sufficiency to Hawaiians by supplying them land. Those with at least 50% Hawaiian blood quantum can apply for a 99-year lease for $1 a year. But Hawaii has been slow to award leases. An estimated 28,000 people are on the waitlist. The lawsuit stems from a 1991 law allowing Native Hawaiians to file claims against the state for losses incurred while waiting for a homestead lease from 1959 to 1988. The Legislature created a panel to address claims, but the existence of the panel wasn’t extended past 1999. So the plaintiffs sued. The Hawaii Supreme Court in 2020 voted to allow the class-action lawsuit to continue and for damages to be awarded. Carl Varady, an attorney who has represented the plaintiffs, didn’t immediately return a voicemail message seeking comment.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The trial for a former state lawmaker accused of raping a 19-year-old legislative intern began Tuesday with a prosecutor telling jurors the case was about power imbalances and the defense saying the sex was consensual. Aaron von Ehlinger was charged with rape and penetration with a foreign object, both felonies, last year after the young Statehouse staffer reported a sexual assault in March 2021. “This case is about power – power wielded in the wrong hands,” Ada County Deputy Prosecuting Attorney Katelyn Farley told the jury. “The defendant, Mr. von Ehlinger, wielded that power against a 19-year-old intern,” Farley said, telling jurors that they would hear several ways in which the intern tried to resist the lawmaker’s advances. Von Ehlinger’s attorney, John Cox, told jurors the intern and his client had passionate consensual sexual contact. He said the intern stayed at von Ehlinger’s apartment for a time after the sexual contact. The allegations first came to light during the 2021 legislative session after the intern told a Statehouse supervisor that von Ehlinger raped her at his apartment after the two had dinner at a restaurant. At the time, von Ehlinger was a representative from Lewiston, but he resigned after an ethics committee unanimously agreed he engaged in “behavior unbecoming” and recommended he be suspended without pay for the rest of the session. Von Ehlinger, 38, has pleaded not guilty to the charges, which carry maximum penalties of life in prison.\n\nIllinois\n\nCrestwood: A former suburban Chicago mayor was sentenced Monday to a year in federal prison for taking $5,000 to help a red-light camera company. Louis Presta, 72, resigned as Crestwood’s mayor in November when he pleaded guilty to felony counts of official misconduct and other crimes. According to his plea agreement, Presta took the money in exchange for helping the company, SafeSpeed LLC, put more cameras in the southwest suburb as well as increase revenues from existing cameras by approving more violations. Presta, a Democrat first elected mayor in 2013, held back tears as he spoke to the judge, apologizing to his wife and residents. “I’m so sorry for bringing this scandal to the village of Crestwood,” he said. “I never thought that I’d be a criminal defendant.” U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin said the corruption damaged Crestwood. He could have ordered a longer sentence but noted Presta’s ailing health and several letters of support. Omar Maani was an executive at SafeSpeed. He was cooperating with the FBI, and the exchange of cash was recorded on a camera. “SafeSpeed had no knowledge of this criminal conduct, and SafeSpeed certainly did not authorize it and does not condone it,” the company said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department has suspended the officers involved and launched two investigations after a man in custody died after being hit with a stun gun. The department’s Critical Incident Response Team responded to the scene of the incident early Monday on the city’s northeast side to conduct a criminal investigation. The department’s Internal Affairs department is conducting a separate investigation, IMPD said. The civilian-majority Use of Force Review Board will conduct a separate review after the other two investigations are complete. Officers were told by a father that his son, Herman Whitfield III, 39, was experiencing a mental health issue and needed an ambulance, police said. Officers requested an ambulance after they saw Whitfield moving through the home naked, sweating and bleeding from his mouth, police said. He moved to parts of the home where officers lost sight of him several times. Officers had tried negotiating and using de-escalation tactics for more than 10 minutes when Whitfield moved quickly toward an officer, police said. “The officer activated the Taser twice and the man continued to resist,” police said in a new release. Officers handcuffed the man, but medics received no response from him, and they began CPR, police said. Whitfield was transported to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead shortly after arrival.\n\nIowa\n\nAltoona: A former rides manager at Adventureland told state investigators probing last year’s fatal accident on the amusement park’s Raging River that “duct tape and bubble gum, basically,” were being used to keep rides operating. The spinning Tea Cups children’s ride was propped up with bits of 2-by-4s. The Falling Star “leaked oil and started on fire.” Access hatches popped open on the Lighthouse drop tower. The safety restraints on the Outlaw and the Tornado roller coasters broke. Bolts came out of the Himalaya coaster “all the time.” Adventureland maintenance crews were “using duct tape and bubble gum basically to keep those rides afloat,” Melvin McCollum told Iowa Division of Labor officials in a telephone interview, one of a series of recorded conversations with park employees, witnesses and others in connection with the accident that killed a Marion boy. “It’s such a beautiful park, and I just hope that maybe by me saying something that the accident that tragically happened will never happen again,” McCollum said. A lawyer for the park’s then-owners disputes the allegations and McCollum’s basis for making them. “I’m sorry, but these uninformed sensational comments by Mr. McCollum are untrue,” attorney Guy Cook wrote in an email.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly’s campaign to axe the food sales tax ran into a political meat grinder Tuesday when Republican legislators voted down a procedural move from Democrats to advance a plan that has been blocked by GOP leadership since January. House Democrats attempted to force action on HB 2487, Kelly’s plan to cut the state sales tax on groceries to 0% starting July 1. The bill has been stuck in a tax committee, where it never received a vote. The procedural motion from Rep. Jim Gartner, D-Topeka, to pull the bill to the House floor failed 48-74. Ten Republicans sided with Democrats. “What are you doing with that sales tax on food? Are you going to get it done this session?” Gartner said constituents asked him during the three-week legislative break. “I hope we eliminate it totally.” A Republican plan to gradually reduce the food sales tax could still come from the legislative sausage factory. The proposal would wait until after Election Day to make the first installment in cutting the rate to 0% in 2025. That bill, HB 2106, was drafted by a group of six lawmakers in a conference committee after senators indicated that GOP leadership opposed a large cut this summer. It cannot be amended on the floor of either chamber.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear cleared the way Tuesday for a cannabis research center to open as he reviews whether he has the executive authority to single-handedly legalize medical marijuana in the state. The governor revealed his action on a bill authorizing the research center at the University of Kentucky. The measure won overwhelming approval from lawmakers on the final day of this year’s legislative session earlier this month. In his review, the governor preserved the language creating the center. He said he used his line-item veto authority to broaden the center’s work and allow more leeway in picking an oversight board. The Democratic governor’s line-item vetoes will stand since the Republican-dominated Legislature won’t reconvene until January 2023 for its next regular session. In the final weeks of this year’s session, key lawmakers resisting the legalization of medical cannabis pushed for the research center as an alternative. It would allow more time to study the effectiveness of marijuana in treating certain ailments, they said. A separate bill to legalize medical marijuana passed the state House but died in the Senate this year. The legalization bill would have strictly regulated the use of cannabis for a list of eligible medical conditions, including cancer, multiple sclerosis, chronic pain, epilepsy and chronic nausea.\n\nLouisiana\n\nHouma: Move over, Memphis and Cleveland. Louisiana’s rock ’n’ roll roots run deep, from New Orleans to Shreveport to Ferriday, and state Rep. Tanner Magee wants to lay claim to what he contends is rock ’n’ roll’s true birthplace. Magee’s House Bill 889 would create America’s Rock and Roll Museum in New Orleans, aligned with the legendary Dew Drop Inn hotel and nightclub on LaSalle Street. Black musicians stayed and performed at the inn from the 1940s until it closed in the ’70s. “You could argue the Dew Drop is where the birth of rock ’n’ roll took place,” said Preston Lauterbach, author of “The Chitlin’ Circuit and the Road to Rock ’n’ Roll.” “The New Orleans culture mixed with the touring artists who were coming through. That’s what really made it a special place.” A second measure from Magee, House Bill 895, would create the LaSalle Cultural Corridor for neighborhood development, anchored by the museum and the under-renovation inn. Magee, a rock ’n’ roll history buff with a dizzying array of albums at his home in Houma, notes New Orleans favorite son Fats Domino recorded “The Fat Man” in 1949, two years before Ike Turner’s “Rocket 88” was cut at Memphis’ Sun Records studio. Sun and other sources cite “Rocket 88” as the first rock ’n’ roll record. “This is categorically untrue,” Magee said.\n\nMaine\n\nEliot: After fending off death, a critically injured common snapping turtle that became a viral sensation after being struck by a motorist last year has been released back into the wild. The Center for Wildlife in Cape Neddick has been treating and rehabilitating the wounded male reptile since late last year, when he was admitted after being found by a mother and daughter on the side of an Eliot road last September. A video of the animal – which sustained a major fracture of his shell and wounds that stretched into his organs – cautiously drinking water last year at the Center for Wildlife quickly went viral on social media. For a substantial period of time, Center for Wildlife employees would carry him from a tub into a private room with a sink so he could take sips of water. The reptile’s deep wounds meant he could not be submerged because he could essentially drown if water seeped into his shell. Two surgeries and several months of incremental progress later, he’s back in an outdoor freshwater setting. Center for Wildlife Executive Director Kristen Lamb said the turtle weighs about 20 pounds and is likely about 40 years old. Before Tuesday’s release, Lamb said, the patient had become a bit more “grumpy” with staff, occasionally snapping in their direction when tending to him. “That means he’ll be ready and do a good job protecting himself,” Lamb said before his release.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: The decade­long process to finalize the location of the third span of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge is over, with the site chosen to be within 2 miles of the current Bay Bridge. The Maryland Transportation Authority announced in 2019 that 14 proposed locations had been narrowed down to three. Mounting infrastructure concerns and spot repairs have led to a crescendo of support for the new span, namely from Gov. Larry Hogan, as traffic is only expected to increase on the outdated bridge. While some Eastern Shore residents have decried the amount of potential additional traffic, especially through residential areas while using apps like Google Maps, others welcome the boon for tourist-dependent locations such as Ocean City and Rehoboth Beach. The need for a third span, the transportation authority said, is clear given that summer weekend traffic on the bridge is typically more than 118,600 vehicles. Non-summer weekends dip to more than 68,000 vehicles. By 2040, those totals are expected to balloon to 135,300 vehicles on summer weekends and 84,300 vehicles on non-summer weekends. The selected location runs along the existing Bay Bridge corridor on Route 50/301 to Route 50 between Crofton and Queenstown.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPittsfield: The Berkshires, one of the state’s most popular touríst destinations, will be easier to reach for the next two summers with the launch of seasonal Amtrak service from New York City. The Berkshire Flyer service will start July 8 and operate on weekends during the summer with a Friday afternoon departure from New York’s Penn Station to Pittsfield, with several stops including Albany, New York, and a return trip Sunday afternoon, officials said Monday. The service is a collaboration among Amtrak, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation, and the New York State Department of Transportation. The goal is to boost tourist access to the world-renowned museums, concert venues and outdoor activities in the region, officials said. “Western Massachusetts and the Berkshire region offer a whole host of cultural and recreational opportunities during the summer and we hope this pilot service will encourage even more visitors to this part of our state,” Gov. Charlie Baker said in a statement. The service will be evaluated after the two-year pilot program to determine its long-term feasibility. Tickets will be available starting next month.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A Saginaw doctor has been charged with a federal hate crime for allegedly intimidating Black Lives Matter supporters in a series of actions involving nooses and threatening messages left for Starbucks employees across the state, the Department of Justice announced Wednesday. According to court documents, Kenneth Pilon, 61, an optometrist, called nine Starbucks stores across the state in 2020 and told the person who answered the phone to relay a specific message laden with hate slurs to any Starbucks employees wearing a BLM T-shirt. He also allegedly told one employee he wanted to lynch a Black person. Pilon left the messages in the summer of 2020, two days after Starbucks announced it would provide 250,000 BLM T-shirts to employees who wanted to wear them during their shifts, according to the documents. One month after making those calls, court records show, Pilon left nooses in Kroger and Walmart parking lots in Saginaw, including one he tucked inside a beverage cooler at a 7-Eleven store with a hand-written note attached that read: “An accessory to be worn with your ‘BLM’ t-shirt. Happy protesting!’ ” Pilon is charged with six counts of interfering with federally protected activities, a misdemeanor punishable by up to one year in prison.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: The Minneapolis Police Department has engaged in a pattern of race discrimination for at least a decade, including stopping and arresting Black people at a higher rate than white people, using force more often on people of color, and maintaining a culture where racist language is tolerated, a state investigation launched after George Floyd’s killing found. The report released Wednesday by the Minnesota Department of Human Rights following a nearly two-year investigation said the agency and the city would negotiate a court-enforceable agreement to address the long list of problems identified in the report, with input from residents, officers, city staff and others. The report said police department data “demonstrates significant racial disparities with respect to officers’ use of force, traffic stops, searches, citations, and arrests.” And it said officers “used covert social media to surveil Black individuals and Black organizations, unrelated to criminal activity, and maintain an organizational culture where some officers and supervisors use racist, misogynistic, and disrespectful language with impunity.” Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero said during a news conference after the report was released that it doesn’t single out any officers or city leaders. “This investigation is not about one individual or one incident,” she said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state needs to update its Supreme Court districts to ensure Black voters have a chance to elect a candidate of their choice in a state with a history of racially polarized voting, Black plaintiffs said in a lawsuit filed Monday. Mississippi’s three districts for its high court are all majority-white, and they were last updated in 1987 over the objection of Black legislators, the lawsuit said. It alleges the districts violate the Voting Rights Act and the U.S. Constitution by diluting Black voting strength. About 38% of Mississippi residents are Black. Eight of the nine current justices are white, and one is Black. Four Black justices have served on the Mississippi Supreme Court – never more than one at a time. The American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Mississippi, the Southern Poverty Law Center and the New York-based law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett filed the lawsuit in federal court in Greenville on behalf of four Black residents of Mississippi. Ty Pinkins of Vicksburg, one of the plaintiffs and an attorney who works in the majority-Black Mississippi Delta, said it’s important that his relatives and neighbors feel they are fairly represented at all levels of government, including in the judicial system.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The GOP-led state House on Monday voted to limit the public high school sports teams on which transgender athletes can compete. House members voted 93-41 to require transgender students to compete only on teams that match the “biological sex” listed on their birth certificates. The provision was added to Republican Rep. Kurtis Gregory’s bill on public school busing – a tactic often used to pass legislation as the end of session nears. Lawmakers face a May 13 deadline to send bills to Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s desk. Amendment sponsor GOP Rep. Ron Copeland said he wants to ban transgender girls from competing on girls’ sports teams but doesn’t care if transgender boys compete with other boys, although his proposal would prevent both. “As a father, my daughters should not have to play against a male in sports,” Copeland said. Democratic Rep. Ian Mackey, who is gay, cautioned lawmakers about how a vote against transgender athletes will be perceived in the future. “Your vote on the record will last forever,” Mackey said. “And I can guarantee you that while not all of you will regret it, I know that some of you looking at me right now will. Do the right thing.”\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: The latest season of “Yellowstone,” filmed near Missoula and the Bitterroot Valley, brought $72million of qualified spending to the state in 2021. The report produced by the University of Montana’s Bureau of Business and Economic Research showed the state’s economy with “Yellowstone” resulted in 527 more jobs, $25.3 million in annual personal income, and $85.8 million in additional gross receipts to Montana businesses and organizations. It also resulted in $10.6 million of revenue to the state government. The MEDIA Coalition of Montana and the Paramount Network paid for the study. Another benefit of “Yellowstone” that was not included in the economic impact study but mentioned in the report is the free advertising Montana gets from the show. “The visual depiction of our state that increases exposure and awareness of our physical landscape, culture and history to audiences that are potentially global. While it is difficult to quantify, the image of Montana that is projected to mass audiences through film production is arguably important in selling the state as a place to visit or even relocate,” the report said. The report comes as the Legislature’s Interim Revenue Committee considers drafting legislation to raise the state’s film tax credit.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The city will pay $497,500 to a woman who says she was injured when police fired rubber bullets during racial justice protests in May 2020. Elise Poole, now 20, alleged in a lawsuit that she was fleeing from tear gas fired by law enforcement officers at protesters near downtown Lincoln on May 31, 2020, when she was hit by a rubber bullet. She required emergency surgery to reattach her nose and will require further surgery to regain normal breathing, according to her attorney. Daniel Gutman, an attorney litigating the case on behalf of the ACLU of Nebraska, said the lawsuit successfully held law enforcement accountable for responding to peaceful protests with dangerous weapons, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. City Attorney Yohance Christie said officials don’t know what caused Poole’s injury. He said that gasoline, fireworks and other dangerous objects were thrown at officers during the May 29-June 1 protests and that more than two dozen officers were injured.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The consensus Republican front-runner for governor drew attention and applause from a GOP luncheon audience Tuesday when he used an expletive to deride Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak’s decision to enact a state-managed public health insurance option. Answering a question about homelessness, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo expressed frustration about people who don’t or won’t accept help from public services. He said he wanted to stop the Clark County jail from being the “No. 1 facility” for mental health services in Nevada. “A very small percentage are homeless due to circumstances out of their control,” said Lombardo, who served two terms as nonpartisan elected head of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. “You have to hold them accountable and, unfortunately, society is turning a blind eye to that issue. The governor can make that a priority,” he said, referring to Sisolak. “He said his priority is health. And he’s talking about bull---- things like the public option.” Last year Sisolak signed Nevada’s public health care option into law, amid projections it will lower insurance premium costs 15% for participants by 2026. Sisolak campaign aide Reeves Oyster responded to Lombardo’s comment with a statement saying 350,000 Nevada residents will benefit from the law, pointing to the coronavirus pandemic, and accusing Lombardo of siding with “big insurance over Nevada families in need of health care.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Lawmakers in the state House will vote next week on a congressional map built around the Interstate 93 corridor despite opposition from Gov. Chris Sununu. The House Special Committee on Redistricting voted 8-7 on Wednesday to recommend a plan that creates a new, Republican-leaning 1st Congressional District by clumping together towns and cities along I-93 in the southern half of the state, with the 2nd District reaching up and around it on both sides. Sununu has promised to veto an earlier plan passed by both the House and Senate and has indicated the new one falls short as well. Both seats are held by Democrats, but the new plan would put both their hometowns in the 1st District. It also would move several current candidates for the GOP nomination in the 1st District to the 2nd. Candidates are not required to live in the district they seek to represent. The map’s creator, Rep. Ross Berry, said he did not take incumbency into account but focused on achieving as even a population split as possible, keeping counties intact, and grouping together communities with similar economic interests. The current map hasn’t changed drastically since 1880, but Berry argued it should be abandoned because it was drawn to dilute the Catholic vote. Democrats – who favored moving just a single town, Hampstead, from the 1st District to the 2nd – noted that every map since 1880 has been created by Republicans.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Residents of a pollution-choked neighborhood said Tuesday that they’re tired of their community being used as a dumping ground for projects that foul their air yet exclude them from the economic benefits of industry. In an online public hearing, residents of Newark’s Ironbound section denounced a plan by a sewage treatment facility to build a backup gas-fired power plant designed to keep the treatment plant operating when the power goes out. The Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission is seeking a state environmental permit to build the largest portion of the $180 million backup facility. The nation’s fifth-largest sewage treatment plant accepts liquid waste shipped from communities ranging from Maine to Virginia and is the largest single-site user of electricity in New Jersey. But it has become a cause célèbre among community activists and a key test of an environmental justice law that Gov. Phil Murphy signed in 2020. The law is designed to prevent communities already overburdened with pollution from having to accept additional contamination sources. “I have a hard time breathing on a lot of days, and a lot of it comes from your plant,” said Lenny Thomas, who lives in the Ironbound, which got its nickname from the railroad tracks that surround it on three sides. “This has been going on for decades. It’s not just, it’s not right, and it’s not fair.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Native American leaders said Tuesday that they were excited about a series of meetings this week with land managers as the Biden administration considers prohibiting new oil and gas development on hundreds of square miles of federal land in northwestern New Mexico that several tribes consider sacred. Top officials with the All Pueblo Council of Governors said during a virtual briefing that they will reiterate their support for the proposal during tribal consultations. The meetings are part of the public outreach being done by the U.S. Interior Department as it considers the withdrawal from nearly 550 square miles around Chaco Culture National Historical Park. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, from Laguna Pueblo, cited the cultural significance of the area surrounding the national park when she first proposed the 20-year withdrawal during a visit in November. She has said many tribes in the Southwest, including her own, have a connection to the area. Randall Vicente, governor of Acoma Pueblo, said tribes were ready to band together to ensure more permanent protections are adopted for lands outside park boundaries. He said the remnants of stone dwellings, ceremonial kivas, pottery sherds, petroglyphs, shrines and the other cultural resources that dot the high desert around Chaco Canyon were left there by the ancestors of today’s pueblo people. “Together, this area is one irreplaceable, sacred, interconnected landscape unlike any other. We remain tied to those resources,” he said, describing them as “the footprints and fingerprints of our ancestors.” A World Heritage site, Chaco park is thought to be the center of what was once a hub of Indigenous civilization.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Meaningful changes could be implemented within days at the troubled Rikers Island jail complex, the head of New York City’s jails told a federal judge Tuesday. The city has insisted that years of failed reforms could be overcome without the court taking control of the nation’s second-largest jail system. “You will see change,” Department of Correction Commissioner Louis Molina promised Judge Laura Taylor Swain. Molina said he’s “in alignment” with recommendations from Steve Martin, a monitor tasked with reporting on changes that are needed at a jail system which includes Rikers Island, where about 5,500 inmates are held. In a recent report, Martin said about 30% of the workforce at the jails was not coming to work or not available to work with inmates. On Tuesday, he said of Molina: “Every time I’ve called on the commissioner for a remedy or attention, he has stepped up.” Sixteen inmates died at Rikers last year, and three have died so far in 2022. Molina spoke after he was ordered to appear by the judge after she received a scathing letter about the jails from prosecutors, who suggested Molina appear before the court as they warned that court oversight of the jail system might be necessary.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A loaded gun was found in U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn’s carry-on bag at an airport security checkpoint Tuesday – the second time he has been stopped with a gun at an airport in the past 14 months, officials said. When Cawthorn went through checkpoint D at Charlotte Douglas International Airport with the 9 mm Staccato C2 about 9 a.m., Transportation Security Administration officers notified Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police officers on standby in the area, TSA spokesperson R. Carter Langston said. Responding officers identified the 26-year-old Republican as the owner of the bag where the gun was found, police said in a statement. Cawthorn acknowledged the gun was his and cooperated with officers, authorities said. He was issued a citation for possession of a dangerous weapon on city property, a misdemeanor. Cawthorn was released, but police held on to the firearm, as is routine. The infraction is punishable by civil penalties, including a fine of up to $13,900 depending on certain factors, such as whether a firearm is loaded and the presence of multiple offenses, Langston said, noting this was the second time in recent history that a gun was found in Cawthorn’s carry-on bag. The first was at an Asheville Regional Airport checkpoint in February 2021.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s oil industry wants lawmakers to change the framework for taxing crude production that abolishes the price-based triggers that have been in place for decades. Unless oil prices suddenly decline, North Dakota’s treasury may start reaping the benefits of a tax increase on drillers that could bump state tax collections by tens of millions of dollars in the current two-year budget cycle. The present situation with high crude prices is in contrast to just a few years ago when low oil prices threatened to trigger a tax break for drillers that would have cost the state lost revenue. Abolishing oil-tax triggers gives drillers certainty and keeps the industry’s jobs and revenue flowing, said Ron Ness, president of the North Dakota Petroleum Council, a group that represents several hundred companies working in the state’s oil patch. Companies could leave North Dakota, the nation’s No. 3 oil producer, and focus drilling in other states that have a better and more certain tax climate, he said. “Taxing oil more gets you less,” said Ness, who wants a flat tax on oil production. “The roller coaster prices we’ve seen really mean that we need to be concerned about keeping investment (in North Dakota), “ he said. “Predictability where possible is key.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: A federal jury has rejected allegations that police used excessive force when they fatally shot a man in 2016 during an undercover operation, an episode that led to heightened criticism of actions by Columbus police. The city has said 23-year-old Henry Green, who was Black, ignored commands to drop his gun by Officers Zachary Rosen and Jason Bare, who are white. Court documents and depositions say Green shot at the undercover officers, who then returned fire. Green’s family has argued Green fired after police shot at him. Columbus, the state’s largest city, has experienced multiple protests in recent years over the killing of Black men and children, including last year’s fatal shooting of 16-year-old Ma’Kiah Bryant. A grand jury declined to indict the white officer who shot Bryant as she swung a knife at a young woman. The officer said he feared for the other woman’s life. A grand jury had also declined to indict officers Rosen and Bare in Green’s killing, and an internal Columbus police investigation cleared them. A federal judge dismissed the excessive force lawsuit brought by Green’s family in September 2019, finding it was reasonable to use deadly force under the circumstances. But a federal appeals court reinstated it a year later, determining a jury could “reasonably conclude” there wasn’t justification for the officers to use force in this context. The first trial ended in a mistrial in November 2021. On Monday, a unanimous jury sided with the city after a short deliberation, acquitting Rosen and Bare of excessive force and assault and battery allegations.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt signed a bill Tuesday explicitly prohibiting the use of nonbinary gender markers on state birth certificates, a ban experts say is the first of its kind in the nation. The bill followed a flap last year over the Oklahoma State Department of Health’s agreement in a civil case allowing a nonbinary option. The birth certificate in that case was issued to an Oklahoma-born Oregon resident who sued after the agency initially refused the request. People who are nonbinary do not identify with traditional male or female gender assignments. News of the settlement prompted outrage among Republicans, including Stitt, who along with fellow conservatives in a number of GOP-led states has been engaged in a culture war over issues like restricting LGBTQ and abortion rights that drive the party’s base in an election year. Stitt’s appointee to lead the agency abruptly resigned the next day, and the governor then promptly issued an executive order prohibiting any changes to a person’s gender on birth certificates, despite the settlement agreement. A civil rights group has challenged the executive order in federal court, but the state has not yet responded. Many states only offer male or female gender options on birth certificates, but Oklahoma is the first to write the nonbinary prohibition into law, according to Lambda Legal, the civil rights group suing Oklahoma.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: Two areas off the state’s coast are being targeted to host offshore wind farms as the Biden administration seeks to ramp up renewable energy production. The U.S. Department of the Interior announced Wednesday that the locations being identified to potentially host wind farms are about 12 nautical miles offshore Coos Bay and Brookings. The areas comprise about 1.16 million acres in total. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland described the upcoming steps taken toward possible leasing off the coast of Oregon as “another opportunity to strengthen the clean energy industry while creating good-paying union jobs.” Any offers to lease waters off the Oregon Coast would require environmental review and consultations with local, state and tribal governments. The agency is seeking public comments on how wind development would affect marine life and other ocean uses, such as commercial fishing in the areas, until June 29, 2022. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports this is the first big regulatory step toward bringing an offshore wind project to the Pacific Northwest state. Late last year, Interior said that the Oregon Coast was being targeted by the agency for offshore wind energy production because it has some of the best wind resources in the country.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Police arrested a man Wednesday who is accused of at least two sexual assaults, including one reported Sunday aboard a subway train. A police spokesperson said late Tuesday in an email that officers were looking for 28-year-old Quintez Adams in relation to two assaults this month. Police announced Wednesday afternoon that Adams was taken into custody and had been taken to a hospital for evaluation. Court records did not contain current charges or information on an attorney who could speak on Adams’ behalf. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority officials confirmed its officers are reviewing surveillance video as part of a police investigation into Sunday’s assault. Police did not release many details of the assault, which came about six months after a much-publicized rape on a commuter train in October while other passengers were present. Fiston Ngoy, 35, is charged with rape and related offenses in that attack. It was unclear whether other passengers were on the train Sunday. Adams was wanted in relation to a reported sexual assault the afternoon of April 4 at 7th and Market streets and in the Sunday assault, which happened shortly after noon. Only one of the sexual assaults happened on SEPTA property, spokesperson Andrew Busch said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee announced Wednesday that he has appointed Lt. Col. Darnell Weaver to be the next superintendent of the Rhode Island State Police, making him the first person of color to command the department. Weaver will assume the rank of colonel during a swearing-in ceremony Friday at the State House. He takes over from Col. James Manni, who is retiring to become town manager of South Kingstown. Manni was appointed by former Gov. Gina Raimondo in 2018. Weaver, who is Black, is a Marine Corps veteran who has been with the state police for 28 years, according to the governor’s office. “Lt. Colonel Darnell Weaver has a proven record of public service and strong leadership,” McKee wrote in a tweet. As deputy superintendent and chief of field operations, he oversees patrol, detective and administrative bureaus, the specialty units and the Department of Public Safety, according to the state police website. He has previously served in all the state police barracks and as night executive officer and assistant patrol commander of the Hope Valley and Wickford barracks. He has been a district commander and the officer in charge at the State Police Training Academy.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Several civil rights groups are suing the state over conditions at its juvenile lockups, alleging that children in state custody are subject to violence and isolation while deprived of educational or rehabilitative programs. The lawsuit filed in federal court Tuesday comes less than two weeks after officials at the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice agreed to make changes at its main detention center following a federal investigation that found the state was violating the civil rights of youths housed there. But that agreement doesn’t go far enough because it only addresses issues at the Broad River Road Complex in Columbia, the groups said in their complaint, arguing that the Department of Juvenile Justice also needs to fix conditions at four other facilities across the state. Echoing findings by federal and state investigators in recent years, the complaint describes routine youth-on-youth violence and violence by staff against the youths that agency employees often ignore or enable. Children who commit minor infractions are also placed in isolation for up to 23 hours a day. One officer told a 16-year-old who was assaulted by three other children earlier this year to stay away from facility cameras so he would not be seen bleeding, the complaint alleges. Another child was beaten and choked by five members of the agency’s police force while handcuffed and shackled over accusations of robbing staff; he was then hogtied and blocked from filing a grievance, according to the complaint.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Ranchers say moisture from recent scattered rains is a welcome addition but nowhere near the amount needed to get South Dakota pastures back on track for normal production. The South Dakota Grassland Coalition is urging ranchers to plan ahead. Bart Carmichael, of Faith, a coalition board member, said part of his drought plan included selling half of his cow herd over the last year. “Not planning is a plan to fail; I really believe that,” Carmichael said. Almost 90% of the state remains in severe or moderate drought or is considered abnormally dry, according to the latest U.S. Drought Monitor. Ryan Beer, a rangeland management specialist with the Natural Resources Conservation Service in Bison, said up to 150% of normal rainfall would be needed in May and June to get back to normal forage production. Carmichael said he looks at drought as a way to improve his management skills, in part by ranking his cows from most to least desirable. Once you put a cow in the cull group, he said, it takes the emotion out of selling them. “It’s hard to look at drought making things better, but that’s our outlook on it,” Carmichael said.\n\nTennessee\n\nGatlinburg: The annual lottery to view the synchronous fireflies in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park opens Friday. Every year in late May to early June, thousands of visitors gather near the Elkmont Campground to observe the Photinus carolinus, a firefly species that flashes synchronously. Since 2006, access to the area has been limited during the eight days of predicted peak activity in order to reduce congestion and minimize the disturbance to the fireflies during their peak mating period. This year, park scientists predict that period will be June 3-10, according to a park news release. Those wishing for a vehicle pass can enter the lottery on the recreation.gov website. A total of 800 vehicle passes, 100 passes per night, will be issued. All lottery applicants will be charged a $1 application fee. Successful applicants will automatically be awarded parking passes and charged a $24 reservation fee.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A Texas National Guard member who drowned on the U.S.-Mexico border while on duty was not equipped with a flotation device when he jumped in the Rio Grande to help a migrant who was struggling to swim across, state officials said Wednesday. Spc. Bishop Evans, who was missing three days before search crews found his body Monday, was among the more than 6,100 Guard members stationed on the border as part of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s massive border security mission known as Operation Lone Star. The mission has 43 flotation devices for Guard members who are assigned to boat missions, Maj. Gen. Thomas Suelzer said. Evans was not a boat crew member. Requests for more flotation devices were first made in February but have been delayed by supply chain issues, Suelzer told lawmakers in the Texas Capitol while facing questions about Evans’ death, low morale and equipment shortages that have rattled the yearlong mission. Guard leaders defended not issuing all soldiers flotation devices, saying many are stationed on land. Suelzer said that since Evans’ death, Guard members have been instructed not to go in the water unless they have special training. “(He) was a human being,” Suelzer said. “He saw a human being drowning, and he jumped in the water to save them.” Evans is at least the fifth Guard member who has died during the mission, a number that included suicides, said state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, a Democrat has called for an inquest into the deaths.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Zion National Park is seeking pets for its newest ranger recruitment. The B.A.R.K. Ranger program, already in place in national parks including Yosemite, Acadia and Glacier, is touted as part of an effort to “protect you, your pet and the park while you are here.” “The park mission is to get folks out here, to preserve the resources that we have and to encourage enjoyment and education and inspiration,” Lead Ranger Ben Gibson said. “And with B.A.R.K. Ranger is just one more way that we can get folks out into the park and better educate them on how to do so safely and responsibly.” B.A.R.K. stands for a reminder to dog lovers in the great outdoors: Bag your pet’s waste. Always leash your pet. Respect wildlife. Know where you can go. With extreme summer temperatures bringing scorching pavement, other unpredictable weather, crowding and cyanobacteria in the Virgin River, Zion officials are hoping the program will help people strategize when and how to bring their pets. “The park is learning a lot about the cyanobacteria issue as the days weeks, months and years go on, and whatever we can communicate to folks just so they can be aware and be safe with their pets in the park is one of the primary goals,” Gibson said. Cyanobacteria, a harmful algal bloom in the Virgin River, was first reported in July 2020 with the death of 6-month-old puppy Keanna after she played in the river along the Pa’rus Trail, the only trail in the park that allows pets.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Police say they are investigating a broken window at the office of an organization dedicated to the health and safety of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer people as a possible hate crime. Police say surveillance video showed an individual approach the office of the Pride Center of Vermont just after midnight Tuesday and throw two objects. Officials at the Pride Center discovered a broken window in the center’s door when they arrived Tuesday morning. Mayor Miro Weinberger said he was troubled to learn about the vandalism. “Our city is using its full resources to investigate who committed this crime and why,” Weinberger said in a statement. “Acts of hate have no place in Burlington.” Burlington’s acting police chief, Jon Murad, said officers are investigating the vandalism “with an eye toward the very real possibility that it was motivated by malice related to the Pride Center.” Police said that when a crime in Vermont is determined to have been maliciously motivated, it may be enhanced as a hate crime, which means the perpetrator can be given additional penalties at sentencing.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The University of Virginia has renewed an order banning an organizer of the Unite the Right rally from the school’s grounds, a university police spokeswoman said. The department issued a no-trespassing order against Jason Kessler in 2018 after a clash with students at the School of Law library and renewed the order last week, The Daily Progress reports. In the original order, police cited reports that Kessler threatened students based on protected characteristics and said he intentionally misled police about his torch march held at the university the night before the rally. The new superseding notice was issued April 20 for the same reasons, the university said in a statement Tuesday. It will be in effect until further notice. These orders can be reissued before the four-year expiration if a person is “engaged in ongoing conduct that threatens the health, safety, or property of a member of the university or its Medical Center community, a patient or visitor at the Medical Center, the educational process, or for other reasons.” Kessler, a UVa graduate, appealed the order in 2018, accusing students “of being evidence of Jews following him around and harassing him” and saying he was the victim of racial harassment. But an independent consultant upheld the university’s decision that Kessler had intentionally misled police about the march, which ended in violence and turned deadly the next day when a self-avowed admirer of Adolf Hitler rammed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A civilian oversight board says some police officers routinely – and illegally – ignored state and city mask mandates during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and refused to obey direct orders from the chief to comply. The Seattle Times reports that a recently released review by the Office of Inspector General exposed a “serious cultural issue” within the city’s police department. The report says the agency was fined $17,500 last year after receiving two notices of “serious violations” of the Washington Administrative Code over officers’ refusal to comply with the mandates after inspections by the state Department of Labor and Industries. The report noted it was difficult for command staff to demand officers comply with the regulations because some captains and assistant chiefs didn’t mask up, either. L&I concluded the police department “did not provide a workplace free from recognized hazards that are causing, or likely to cause, serious injury or death.” The department’s OIG, one of three civilian-run police oversight agencies, said the police chief gave officers “clear direction” and “explicit orders” about mask-wearing as early as March 2020 – followed by a string of increasingly stern reminders.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A political candidate who was not a registered Republican when he filed papers to run for a House of Delegates seat in the upcoming GOP primary said Tuesday that it was a simple oversight and that he plans to continue with his campaign. Bob Fehrenbacher is running against incumbent Del. Roger Conley in the May 10 primary for the District 11 seat representing portions of Wood County. Forms that candidates fill out to run for office must be signed and notarized. They specifically require candidates to attest to their party affiliation. Fehrenbacher said in an interview that when he signed his candidacy papers in January, “I thought in good faith that I was registered as a Republican. Much to my surprise, I was not. And as soon as that came to my attention, I immediately went into the West Virginia secretary of state’s system and changed it. I should have checked, and I did not do that.” The West Virginia Republican Party said in a statement that Fehrenbacher instead was an unaffiliated voter when he filed his papers and did not register as a GOP voter until late March. “Simply put, lying on a sworn statement is not acceptable behavior for those who wish to be elected officials,” GOP chairman Mark Harris said in the statement, calling on Fehrenbacher to withdraw from the race “for the good of the West Virginia Republican Party and our voters.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nKewaunee: One of the state’s largest dairy farms is suing the Department of Natural Resources over changes to its wastewater permit that require the operators to limit the size of their herd and begin monitoring groundwater in an area where nitrate contamination has occurred. Kinnard Farms in Kewaunee County said in its complaint that the business will be harmed if it isn’t allowed to expand its herd and will be burdened by the cost of a groundwater monitoring system. Farm operators say the monitoring system will cost tens of thousands of dollars initially, plus the fees indefinitely paid to experts to sample, analyze and interpret data from the wells. The Kinnard operation includes 16 industrial farms with about 8,000 cows. It has struggled with agricultural pollution for years as contaminants began showing up in private wells. In a statement Tuesday, the Kinnard family said it remains committed to regenerative agriculture practices and sustainability. “On-farm practices such as planting cover crops, limited soil tillage (known as no-till), sand and water recycling and more demonstrate our dedication to protecting groundwater in our community,” the family said. “We continue to invest in cutting-edge innovation to protect our environment.” The permit changes are seen as a big win for area residents, who said they felt like it was the first time the DNR had listened to their concerns about their water in public hearings and submitted testimony.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: The state Department of Transportation says work has been bumped up on a highway slide-stabilization project after a weekend rockslide, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. According to K2 Radio News, members of a varsity soccer team from Powell stopped on their way back from a game and helped to move rocks from the roadway.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/pika-magazine/2018/09/30/pika-best-guam-2018-food/1365233002/", "title": "Pika Best of Guam 2018: Food | Entertainment | guampdn.com", "text": "Best American Food, Salad/Salad Bar: Ruby Tuesday\n\nRuby Tuesday has taken the title of \"Best American Food\" and \"Best Salad/Salad Bar\" again this year, and it is easy to see why.

A new secretive nuclear program. Copies of dozens of never-before-seen letters between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nThose are just a few of the jarring details included in \"Rage,\" a new book written by veteran Washington Post journalist Bob Woodward about Trump's tenure. It's the second book Woodward has written about the president, but for this one, he interviewed Trump 18 times and included audio of their conversations.\n\nThe book is set to hit shelves next week. Here are some of the most extraordinary details included in the book, according to CNN and The Post, which obtained early copies:\n\n'Playing' down COVID-19\n\nTrump told Woodward in a recorded interview that despite knowing how \"deadly\" and serious the coronavirus pandemic would be for Americans and the world, he wanted to \"play it down\" and wanted to continue to do so.\n\n\"I wanted to always play it down,\" Trump said to Woodward on March 19, according to the outlets. \"I still like playing it down because I don't want to create a panic.\"\n\nMore:Trump knew the coronavirus was 'deadly stuff' but chose to downplay it, according to recordings revealed in new Woodward book\n\nBoth CNN and The Post included audio of the president's remarks to Woodward, where he explains that \"startling\" examinations found the virus was also affecting younger people.\n\nMore than a month before the March 19 remarks, Trump told Woodward on Feb. 7 about how much \"more deadly\" COVID-19 would be than the flu, a startling juxtaposition from the president's public remarks at the time and in the months since about the pandemic, its lethality and its spread.\n\n\"So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on,\" Trump wrote on Twitter to his millions of followers in March. \"At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!\"\n\nTrump boasts about new secretive nuclear program\n\nDuring their conversations, Trump told Woodward about a new nuclear program that Woodward says he later asked anonymous officials about. The officials were surprised to learn Trump disclosed the program to the journalist, according to The Post and CNN.\n\n\"I have built a nuclear – a weapons system that nobody’s ever had in this country before,\" Trump told Woodward, according to the outlets. \"We have stuff that you haven’t even seen or heard about. We have stuff that Putin and Xi have never heard about before. There’s nobody – what we have is incredible.”\n\nWoodward said other unnamed sources confirmed the program's existence, though details on it are not included.\n\nTrump and Kim Jong Un's 27 letters\n\nWoodward's book not only includes the first-ever published excerpts from letters written by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to Trump, it also says the two leaders exchanged at least 27 of them, according to CNN.\n\nTrump would not allow Woodward to see copies of letters he sent to the North Korean leader, who he'd had a rocky relationship with that led to threats of war before he became the first U.S. president to step inside the country last year. Trump said the contents of his letter to Kim were \"top secret,\" though he told the author Kim called him \"Excellency\" and that the authoritarian leader \"tells me everything.\"\n\nThe Post notes that included an account of how Kim had his uncle killed.\n\nRelated:Donald Trump says he got another 'beautiful' letter from North Korea's Kim Jong Un\n\nMore:Donald Trump meets Kim Jong Un in DMZ, steps onto North Korean soil\n\nIn one of the letters to Trump, Kim wrote that he found Trump's \"excellency reminiscent of a scene from a fantasy film\" and their meeting was a \"precious memory.\" In another, he wrote about their historic meeting when he and Trump shook hands at the Korean demilitarized zone and stepped into North Korean territory, writing about \"that moment of history when I firmly held Your Excellency’s hand at the beautiful and sacred location as the whole world watched with great interest.\" He added that he hoped to \"relive the honor of that day.\"\n\nMattis found Trump 'dangerous' and 'unfit'\n\nFormer Defense Secretary James Mattis prayed about the fate of the USA under Trump, Woodward writes. Mattis told former Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats that Trump was \"dangerous\" and \"unfit,\" with \"no moral compass.\" Coats said Trump was incapable of telling \"the difference between truth and a lie.\"\n\n\"There may come a time when we have to take collective action,\" Mattis told Coats, according to Woodward.\n\nMore:Trump's former defense secretary Mattis blasts president as a threat to American democracy\n\nMattis reportedly told Coats he resigned after Trump announced he was pulling U.S. troops out of Syria because \"I was basically directed to do something that I thought went beyond stupid to felony stupid.\"\n\nDuring his tenure, Coats repeatedly rebuffed Trump's efforts to downplay the intelligence community's conclusion that Russia tried to sway the 2016 election in his favor. According to Woodward, Coats is still suspicious about the nature of Trump's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nFauci: Trump's 'sole purpose is to get reelected'\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, described Trump's leadership on the pandemic as \"rudderless.\" Woodward reported that Fauci said Trump \"is on a separate channel\" and his \"attention span is like a minus number.\"\n\n\"His sole purpose is to get reelected,\" Fauci said, according to an excerpt cited by the Post.\n\nAccording to Woodward, after one news briefing where the president made false statements, Fauci said at an Oval Office meeting with Trump present, \"We can’t let the president be out there being vulnerable, saying something that’s going to come back and bite him.”\n\nTrump uses vulgar term to question military leaders' resolve\n\nAccording to Woodward, an aide to Mattis once heard Trump say to White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, \"my f------ generals are a bunch of p------.\" Woodward wrote that Mattis urged the aide to document the comment in an email, according to CNN.\n\n\"They care more about their alliances than they do about trade deals,” Trump told Navarro.\n\nThe president also decried senior military officials' support for alliances with NATO and South Korea, which they argued saved the U.S. money in the long run.\n\nMore:Trump accused of describing war dead as 'losers' and 'suckers.' He denies allegations. Here's what we know\n\n\"I wouldn't say they were stupid, because I would never say that about our military people,\" Trump said, according to a passage cited by CNN. \"But if they said that, they – whoever said that was stupid. It's a horrible bargain ... they make so much money. Costs us $10 billion. We're suckers.\"\n\nTrump has strongly denied a report from The Atlantic that says he disparaged dead and wounded U.S. troops as \"losers\" and \"suckers. But on Monday, he shared his distrust of senior military officials, telling reporters, \"they want to do nothing but fight wars so that all of those wonderful companies that make the bombs, and make the planes, and make everything else, stay happy.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/01/30/live-politics-updates-tyre-nichols-police-trump-campaign-trail/11146011002/", "title": "Tyre Nichols' parents to attend Biden State of the Union: recap", "text": "Republicans relentlessly campaigned last year on a vow to not only be a check against President Joe Biden's policies but to probe his family's business dealings.

Jolly,” Johnson said in a new BBC documentary.\n\nJohnson continued that Putin’s “relaxed tone” led him to believe the Russian president was “just playing along with my attempts to get him to negotiate.”\n\nA Kremlin spokesperson told the BBC the allegation is a \"lie.\"\n\n– Ella Lee\n\nTyre Nichols' parents to attend Biden's State of the Union address\n\nThe grieving parents of Tyre Nichols will attend President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address on Feb. 7.\n\nThey were invited by Congressional Black Caucus Chairman Steven Horsford, who is requesting a meeting with the president this week in a renewed push for police reform after the officers were charged with second-degree murder, aggravated assault, kidnapping, official misconduct and oppression in the death of Nichols.\n\n“Mr. Nichols was a beloved father, friend, and coworker, who should still be alive today,” Horsford, a Nevada Democrat, said in a statement. “The Congressional Black Caucus is disturbed by the gut-wrenching allegations underlying Tyre Nichols’ brutal death at the hands of law enforcement and we must work to ensure that our legal system holds accountable police officers who, with impunity, kill too many in our communities.”\n\nHaving Nichols’ parents at the State of the Union will likely ensure Biden mentions his death and police reform during his primetime speech next week.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden spotted at Philadelphia Eagles game\n\nFirst Lady Jill Biden reminded everyone of her Philadelphia roots on Sunday when she was spotted at the NFC Championship game at Lincoln Financial Field with NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell.\n\nShe also posted a photo from the game on Twitter showing a selfie with her grandson and the Birds’ battle cry, “Fly Eagles Fly.” The president was home in Wilmington.\n\nIt’s one of many Philadelphia sporting events Biden has attended through the years. Most recently, she attended the Eagles-Cowboys game in October, when her favorite home team defeated Dallas 26-17.\n\nBoth Bidens went to the Phillies game on Nov. 2, when Philadelphia lost to Houston. And multiple members of the Biden family were at the 2018 Super Bowl to see the Eagles defeat the Patriots.\n\nIt wasn’t known early Monday whether any of the Bidens would follow their beloved Birds to Arizona for the Super Bowl on Feb. 12.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nPeter Navarro contempt of Congress trial delayed over executive privilege issues\n\nA federal judge on Friday delayed the contempt of Congress trial for Peter Navarro, a trade adviser to former President Donald Trump, to give more time for pre-trial debate over executive privilege issues.\n\nThe trial, which was set to begin Monday, comes after Navarro defied the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack. Navarro refused to testify before the committee, citing executive privilege to keep communications with Trump confidential.\n\nNavarro is the second Trump aide to face criminal charges for eluding the committee. Political strategist Steve Bannon was convicted of contempt of Congress last summer and sentenced to four months in prison in October, which he has not served, pending appeal.\n\n-- Ella Lee\n\nTrump intervenes, delays aide's trial:Donald Trump's last-minute intervention delays contempt trial of former aide Peter Navarro\n\nHouse moves to end COVID-19 pandemic era\n\nThe House is focusing its biggest work this week on a slate of bills designed to move the country past the pandemic and repeal COVID policies.\n\nThat work starts late this afternoon in the newly appointed House Rules Committee, which will take up bills to force federal workers back into their offices, declare an end to the public health emergency started by former President Donald Trump and continued by President Joe Biden, and repeal a federal mandate on vaccines for health care workers.\n\nThe House is moving after schools and businesses have reopened, mask mandates have been lifted and numerous private sector workers have remained remote mostly as a lifestyle choice rather than a public health-driven decision. House Republicans are mostly taking aim at Biden and federal policies.\n\n“If the American people are expected to show up to work, federal employees should be held to the same standard,” Majority Leader Steve Scalise said in a statement.\n\nHe also noted that Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser in her inaugural address Jan. 2 called for help from the White House to return federal workers to the city or give up some of the empty federal offices.\n\n“We need decisive action by the White House to either get most federal workers back to the office most of the time or to realign their vast property holdings for use by the local government, by nonprofits, by businesses and by any user willing to revitalize it,” she said, noting the federal government owns or leases a third of the city’s office space.\n\n-- Candy Woodall\n\nBiden to tout infrastructure law at Baltimore tunnel\n\nPresident Joe Biden is focusing on his administration's bipartisan accomplishments this week. He holds a 2:45 p.m. event in Baltimore to spotlight a major rail tunnel replacement funded by the bipartisan infrastructure law.\n\nThis focus comes as Biden gears up for his State of the Union address next month and a possible 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n-- Holly Rosenkrantz\n\nAmericans equally concerned about Biden and Trump's classified documents\n\nSixty-seven percent of Americans are concerned about classified documents found in President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump's possession, despite multiple differences in the number of documents found and how Biden and Trump responded to the discoveries, according to a poll released Sunday by NBC News.\n\nThe survey also found that 50% of respondents disapprove of Biden's job performance compared to 45% who approve. The numbers don't bode well for Republicans either, who have kick-started extensive investigations into the White House.\n\nWe asked:After Trump, Biden, Pence, are other former presidents holding classified documents?\n\nFifty-five percent of respondents said they believe House Republicans will spend too much time investigating Biden rather than focusing on other priorities. Fifty-four percent of respondents also said they believe Republicans will be too inflexible in their investigations.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n'We're here': Trump returns to the campaign trail in early voting states\n\nFormer President Donald Trump resumed public campaigning Saturday with renewed attacks on long-standing targets: President Joe Biden, the 2020 election, federal and state prosecutors, and a lengthening list of Republican opponents.\n\n“We will do it again,” Trump told supporters while introducing his “South Carolina Leadership Team” during an event at the statehouse in downtown Columbia, capping a day-long trip that also took him to New Hampshire. Both states hold early primaries in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nTrump in trouble:Republican support for his 2024 bid falls amid political, legal setbacks\n\nThe trip comes after more than two months of political turmoil for Trump following his mid-November announcement about his 2024 campaign. Agrowingnumber of Republicans say the former president cannot win next year and the party should look for another standard-bearer.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nHouse to vote on whether to removeOmar from Foreign Affairs Committee\n\nThe House is slated to vote sometime this week on whether to remove Democrat Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., from her seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\nOmar’s Republican opponents and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy are pushing for her removal because of her past remarks regarding American support for Israel. In a now deleted tweet from 2012, she accused Israel of having “hypnotized the world.” Omar has since apologized for the remarks.\n\nSome House Republicans have questioned the legitimacy of McCarthy’s claims and worry that Omar’s removal could be seen as political revenge. And with the GOP’s narrow majority in the House, it is unclear if there are enough votes to remove Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n\n– Ken Tran", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2020/10/22/presidential-debate-donald-trump-joe-biden-face-off-one-last-time/3725267001/", "title": "Trump, Biden spar over China, economy, covid in last election debate", "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. – President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden tussled over health care, the economy and the nation’s response to the coronavirus pandemic in a final debate Thursday that was fiery but far less vitriolic than their first appearance together last month.\n\nNearing the end of an intense campaign that has once again divided the nation, the two men slammed each other’s records during the 90-minute slugfest, with both repeatedly demanding time to respond to each other’s accusations as they worked through emotional battles on immigration, foreign policy and racial tensions in America.\n\nTrump walked into the debate on the Belmont University campus in Tennessee with more to prove and more at stake. Down double digits in polls national and single digits in virtually every battleground state in the country, it was the president – buffeted by the coronavirus and its economic consequences – who was most in need of reset heading into the Nov. 3 election.\n\n“We’re learning to live with it,” Trump said of the virus early in the debate, arguing that coming vaccines and therapeutics would take care of the latest surge in COVID-19 cases cropping up in many states across the country. “We can’t lock ourselves in a basement like Joe does.”\n\nBiden, who started off his debate by calling attention to the number of Americans who have died from the virus -- some 220,000 -- fired back by quoting the president’s own words back to him.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n“He says we’re learning to live with it,” the former vice president said during one of the more poignant exchanges of the evening. “People are learning to die with it.\"\n\nAs expected, Trump went hard on accusations against Biden’s son, Hunter, and a recent report about the alleged contents of a computer hard drive purporting to document his Ukrainian and Chinese business ties. Federal authorities are investigating whether the material – supplied by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer – is part of a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nBiden noted Trump’s foreign real estate holdings, including a Chinese bank account recently unearthed by The New York Times. Trump asserted, without providing evidence, that the account was closed before he became president.\n\nA last-minute decision to mute microphones during some portions of the debate appeared to lower the temperature, giving both candidates two minutes to answer questions without interruption. In at least two instances, Trump appeared to have his microphone cut off as he ran over his allotted two minutes.\n\nTrump and Biden fought bitterly over immigration and a recent report that the administration has been unable to locate the parents of some 545 children who were among the families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2017 and 2018. That turned into a much broader debate over immigration.\n\n“Who built the cages, Joe?” Trump repeatedly asked, pushing an argument that it was the Obama administration that had separated families attempting to cross the border.\n\nIt was the Trump administration that implemented the \"zero tolerance\" policy in 2018 that separated migrant children and parents at the southern border. The administration later admitted that it began separating families under a pilot program in 2017.\n\nBiden accused Trump of “ripping” parents from their children.\n\nVeteran pollster Frank Luntz said that Trump did “much better” than in the first debate, but questioned whether the debate did enough to “change the electorate fundamentally.”\n\nThe mute button created a more civil environment – for the most part – but did not lead to any kind of breakthrough moment for either candidate, analysts said. It was probably a draw, they said, and that benefits the front-running Biden.\n\n\"Assuming this debate is perceived as close or a draw, it's a win for Biden since he came into the evening with the most to lose and avoided making a disqualifying gaffe,\" said Aaron Kall, director of debate at the University of Michigan.\n\nKall added: \"This was the last opportunity in the campaign before tens of millions of people to change the election narrative and this didn't occur.\"\n\nLara Brown, director of the Graduate School of Political Management at the George Washington University, said Trump \"again spoke only to his base,\" while Biden \"appealed to those who may still have been on the fence.\"\n\n— John Fritze, David Jackson and Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump to Americans who didn't vote for him: We have to get back to a pre-pandemic country\n\nWelker asked both candidates what they would say on their Inauguration Day to Americans who did not vote for them. Trump began by saying that he wants to rebuild the country to what it looked like before the coronavirus wreaked havoc on the U.S. economy and killed more than 220,000 Americans.\n\n\"We have to make the country totally successful as it was prior to the plague coming in,\" he said before pivoting to attacking Biden.\n\n\"We are on the road to success, but I'm cutting taxes, and he wants to raise everybody's taxes and he wants to put new regulations on everything,\" Trump said of Biden. \"If he gets in you will have a depression, the likes of which you've never seen. Your 401K's will go to hell and it'd be a very very sad day for this country.\"\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden: science over fiction, hope over fear\n\nBiden said if elected, he would give an optimistic inaugural speech to Americans who didn’t vote for him based on plans to grow the economy, deal with racism and develop clean energy.\n\n“I will say I’m an American president. I represent all of you, whether you voted for me or against me,” Biden said. “We’re going to choose science over fiction. We’re going to choose hope over fear. We’re going to choose to move forward because there are enormous opportunities.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden reiterates opposition to fracking ban\n\nBiden reiterated his opposition to a ban on fracking – something that Trump continues to accuse Biden of wanting to do.\n\n“I do rule out banning fracking,” Biden said, adding that the fossil fuel industry needs to be able to “transition” as the country takes action to improve the environment.\n\nBiden has said he wants to stop new permits for fracking\n\n“Excuse me. He’s against fracking. He has said it,” Trump said. Biden clarified that he’s against fracking on federally owned land.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nPersonal comparisons\n\nThe candidates got personal as Trump hammered away at one of his main arguments, that Biden had his chance during his many years in Washington and didn’t deliver.\n\n“I ran because of you,” Trump said. “I ran because of Barack Obama because I thought you did a poor job.”\n\nBiden facetiously said he hopes Trump does put the focus on him as that will help the voters.\n\n“Because what’s happening here, you know who I am. You know who he is. You know his character. You know my character,” Biden said. “You know our reputations for honor and telling the truth. I am anxious to have this race.”\n\nTrump tried to turn the discussion back to his campaign’s unproven charge that Biden accepted influence payments from foreign entities.\n\n“Don’t give me this stuff about how you're this innocent baby,” Trump said. “Joe. They’re calling you a corrupt politician.”\n\nAs the debate turned to a discussion of the Black Lives Matter movement, Biden jabbed Trump for his boasts that no president since Abraham Lincoln has helped Black people more than he has.\n\n\"Abraham Lincoln here is one of the most racist presidents we've had in modern history,” Biden said of Trump. “He pours fuel on every single racist fire. Every single one”\n\n— Maureen Groppe and Ledyard King\n\nBiden and Trump spar over climate\n\nTrump defended his decision to pull out of the Paris Accord to set international carbon emission standards, saying it would “have destroyed our business” and cost the country “trillions of dollars.”\n\n“I will not sacrifice tens of millions of jobs,” Trump said, adding that the water and air have gotten cleaner during his administration\n\nBut Biden pushed back, saying the voluntary treaty would have addressed a looming crisis that scientists say is already damaging the country in terms of broader wildfires and fiercer hurricanes.\n\nThe former vice president called climate change an “existential threat to humanity. We have a moral obligation to deal with it.”\n\nHis plan also calls for reaching “net-zero” carbon emissions by 2050, a deadline laid out in the Green New Deal.\n\nBiden has said he doesn’t support the Green New Deal that was introduced by liberal Democrats in Congress earlier this year. But he does support a plan that transitions the economy to a green environment that he said would provide “millions of good-paying jobs.”\n\nBut on his campaign web site, the former vice president calls the proposal a “crucial framework for meeting the climate challenges we face.”\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nTrump: ‘Least racist person in this room’\n\nFacing questions about his past statements on white supremacy and other hate groups, Trump repeatedly claimed during the debate he was the “least racist person in this room.”\n\nTrump and Biden battled over race in one of the more emotional moments of the debate. Trump repeatedly pointed to the 1994 crime deal that Biden helped shepherd through Congress, legislation that Biden acknowledged was a “mistake.”\n\nTrump didn’t directly answer a question about his relationship with the Black Lives Matters movement but instead said his first impression of that movement was hearing anti-police chants following police-involved shootings of unarmed people of color.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nBiden says institutional racism exists in America\n\nBiden said he believes there is institutional racism in America and accused Trump of taking the country backwards in terms of equality.\n\n“A black parent, no matter how rich or poor they are, has to teach their child not to wear a hoody as they cross their street,” Biden said, reciting examples of how people of color confront racism in the U.S.\n\n“The fact of the matter is, there is institutional racism in America,” Biden said, adding that the U.S. has never fully “lived up to” the principle that “all men are created equal.”\n\n“We’ve constantly been moving the needle toward inclusion, not exclusion,” Biden said. “This is the first president who’s said, ‘We’ve got to put an end to that.’”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nTrump dodges question on family separations\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union said in a court filing that they are unable to locate the parents of 545 children who were among the families separated at the U.S.-Mexico border in 2017 and 2018.\n\nWhen asked how he plans to reunite those families, Trump said: \"We're trying very hard, but a lot of these kids come up without the parents. They come over through cartels and the coyotes,\" he said.\n\nAbout two-thirds of the more than 1,000 parents who were separated from their children were deported back to Central America, according to the filing.\n\nThe president then insisted that the Obama administration instituted the policy and his administration carried it out but the Trump administration implemented the \"zero tolerance\" policy in 2018 that separated migrant children and parents at the southern border. The administration later admitted that it actually began separating families under a pilot program in 2017.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nBiden: 'We owe' dreamers a pathway to citizenship\n\nBiden said one of the first steps he would take as president is proposed legislation to give some 11 million undocumented immigrants brought over by their parents or guardians at a young age a pathway to citizenship.\n\nThose children, known as “dreamers” had a temporary reprieve under the Obama administration but now live in fear of deportation under Trump.\n\n“They’re going to be immediately certified again to stay in this country and put on a path to citizenship” rather than “sent home to a country they’ve never seen before,” Biden said of his plan. “Many of them are model citizens. Over 20,000 of them are first responders out there taking care of people during this crisis. We owe them.”\n\nAsked why the Obama administration did not do more to protect them. Biden acknowledged that it “took to long to get it right.”\n\nBut Trump shot back that “he had eight years to say what he was going to do (and) he did nothing.”\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nTrump, Biden at odds on stimulus to boost economy\n\nTrump said he hasn’t been able to reach an agreement on another stimulus to counter the recession from the pandemic because House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., won’t reach an agreement before the election.\n\n“Nancy Pelosi doesn’t want to approve anything because she’d love to have some victories on a date called Nov. 3,” Trump said. “We are ready, willing and able to do something.”\n\nBiden said House Democrats approved a spending plan during the summer. But Trump blasted it for benefitting poorly run states and cities governed by Democrats.\n\n“The bill that has passed in the House was a bailout of badly run, high crime, Democrat – all run by Democrats cities and states,” Trump said.\n\nBiden said if elected he would serve as president of Democratic and Republican regions.\n\n“I’m going to be an American president,” Biden said. “I don’t see red states and blue states. What I see is American, United States.”\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden backs $15 federal minimum wage; Trump doesn’t\n\nTrump and Biden disagreed whether the federal government should institute a $15 minimum wage.\n\nTrump said it would put many companies out of business and that it should be a state-by-state decision.\n\nBiden said that it’s “simply not true” that it would hurt businesses.\n\n“No one should work one job, two jobs below poverty,” Biden said, adding that many frontline health care workers during the pandemic are making below $15 an hour. “They deserve a minimum wage of $15 and anything below that puts them in poverty.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden: Trump ‘lecturing me’ on Medicare and Social Security?\n\nBiden scoffed at accusations from Trump that he would seek to “destroy” Social Security and Medicare.\n\n“When he's talking about a public option,” Trump said of Biden’s health care plan, “he's talking about destroying your Medicare and destroying your Social Security.”\n\nBiden fired back: “This is the guy who's tried to cut Medicare. The idea that Donald Trump is lecturing me on Social Security and Medicare? Come on.\"\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden: ‘I beat all those other people’\n\nBiden tried to swat away Trump’s constant labeling of the former vice president as a “socialist” by pointing out that he conquered far-left candidates during the Democratic primary to nab the nomination.\n\n“I think he thinks he’s running against somebody else,” Biden said. “He’s running against Joe Biden. I beat all those other people because I disagreed with them.”\n\nThe moment echoed a recent visit to Wisconsin when Biden, upon being asked by a reporter about voters’ concerns he was too socialist, responded: “I beat the socialist,” a reference to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nTrump knocks another opponent: Obama; Biden says Trump is 'confused'\n\nTrump has occasionally used this debate to criticize another political opponent: Barack Obama, hitting his administration over issues like health care, North Korea, immigration policy, and even its response to swine flu.\n\n\"They left me a mess,\" Trump said during a discussion of North Korea's nuclear threat.\n\nBiden, who served the Obama administration as vice president, said Trump took over a prosperous and peaceful country but has cozied up to dictators like North Korea's Kim Jong Un and undercut the nation's health care.\n\n\"He's a very confused guy,\" Biden said of Trump.\n\n— David Jackson\n\nMute button shuts down initial statement\n\nIn one of the first manifestations of the debate commission’s new policy on muting microphones, Trump appeared to have the final words of his opening response were cut off as he was answering a question on health care.\n\nBoth candidates were limited to two minutes in their initial response to a question. It appeared Trump went over that time as he was discussing his desire to end Obamacare.\n\nEarlier in the debate, Biden’s microphone didn't flip on until after the former vice president began speaking for a second.\n\nThe new policy, imposed after a widely panned first debate defined by interruptions on Sept. 29, has had impact on the broader feel of the debate: Though the Trump campaign argued the rule was unfair, both candidates have had more time to speak without interruption during their initial answers.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nTrump says he would 'come up with a brand new, beautiful health care plan' if ACA is overturned\n\nOne of the most pressing questions hanging over the Supreme Court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett is a case backed by the Trump administration to strike down the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration's signature healthcare plan. The court will hear the case on Nov. 10, one week after Election Day.\n\nAsked what he would do to help the 20 million people who get their health insurance through Obamacare if the court overturns the ACA, Trump said he would \"come up with a brand new, beautiful health care\" plan. Trump, who campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare, has offered few details on what a Republican plan would look like.\n\nTrump instead boasted about the elimination of the individual mandate which required most Americans to have health insurance or pay a fine. He promised to protect people with pre-existing conditions, which is already enshrined under Obamacare but did not offer details on how he would do it under a new GOP plan.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nThe heat’s turned up\n\nThe debate got more contentious as the night wore on with one of the most heated exchanges occurring about halfway through during a discussion on North Korea.\n\nThe candidates were battling over Trump’s relationship with North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, whom he’s met with.\n\n“He’s legitimized North Korea,” Biden said. “He's talked about his good buddy who's a thug, a thug.”\n\nTrump responded that it’s important to have good relationships with other leaders.\n\n“We’re not at war,” he said.\n\nBiden shot back that the nation had a good relationship with Hitler before he invaded Europe.\n\nDuring the next segment, on issues affecting families, when Biden made one of his frequent reference to his birthplace, Trump interrupted.\n\n“He doesn't come from Scranton,” Trump said. “He lived there for a short period of time.”\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden: North Korea a threat\n\nBiden said Trump legitimized North Korean leader Kim Jong Un despite the totalitarian nuclear power that is developing more sophisticated missiles that would reach the United States.\n\n“He’s a thug,” Biden said. “We’re going to make sure we control them and make sure they cannot hurt us.”\n\nBiden said would only meet with Kim Jong Un if he agreed to reduce his nuclear stockpile.\n\n“The Korean peninsula should be a nuclear-free zone,” Biden said.\n\nBut Trump said he improved relations that were troubled. He said relations are good and the countries aren’t at war.\n\n“They left me a mess,” Trump said of the Obama administration that included Biden as vice president. “He didn’t like Obama.”\n\nBiden scoffed.\n\n“We had a good relationship with Hitler before he invaded the rest of Europe,” Biden said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nBiden introduces ‘Bidencare’\n\nBiden said he plans to pass Obamacare with a public option – and call it “Bidencare” – when asked what he would do if the Supreme Court were to overturn the Affordable Care Act.\n\nThe former vice president said his plan would reduce drug prices and premiums by allowing patients through the Medicare program to negotiate drug prices with insurance companies.\n\n“We’re going to make sure we’re in a situation where we’re actually going to protect preexisting conditions” he added, accusing the president of failing to come up with a plan on this front despite promising one. “He’s never come up with a plan.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden accuses Trump of cozying up to foreign ‘thugs,’ including China\n\nBiden said he would crackdown on China economically and move cut the trade deficit that has ballooned since Trump imposed tariffs on the foreign power.\n\n“They have to play by the rules,” Biden said, discussing ways that China has tried to set boundaries that are not internationally recognized or their efforts to steal intellectual property from the U.S.”\n\nThe former vice president went on to criticize Trump for cozying up to “thugs” running China, Russia and North Korea.\n\n“And he pokes his finger at all of our friends, all of our allies. We make up only 25% of the world’s economy. We need to be having the rest of our friends with us saying to China ‘these are the rules. You play by them or you're gonna pay the price for not playing by them, economically’,” Biden said. “That's the way I will run it. And That's what we did in upholding steel tariffs and a range of other things (under Obama).”\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nTrump acknowledges he has (or had) a bank account in China; Biden urges him to 'show us' his taxes\n\nTrump acknowledges he has (or had) a bank account in China; Biden urges him to 'show us' his taxes\n\nTrump acknowledged he has had a Chinese bank account and insisted he wants to release his tax returns – but also said he would continue to withhold them from the public.\n\nUnder pressure over the issue, the president said he has closed his Chinese account, but did not provide proof – which would be in the tax returns he is refusing to release because they remain under audit.\n\nAn audit does not obligate Trump to keep his tax returns private.\n\nBiden told Trump there's a simple solution: Just release the documents.\n\n\"Show us – just show us,\" Biden told Trump. \"Stop playing around.\"\n\n— David Jackson\n\nBiden says he’s ‘not taken a penny’ from foreign countries\n\nBiden said he’s “not taken a penny” from any foreign country after Trump raised allegations that the former vice president made money in a business scheme involving China with his son Hunter Biden.\n\n“I think you have to clear it up and talk to the American people,” Trump said, raising allegations elevated in a New York Post story last week that revealed purported emails from Hunter Biden and his former business associates.\n\n“I have not taken a penny from any foreign source at any point in my life,” Biden responded. He then raised recent reports that Trump has a secret bank account in China. “He’s talking about me taking money from China? I’ve not taken a penny from any country. Ever. ever. Ever.\"\n\nBiden pointed to Trump not releasing his tax returns after promising to do so for years, saying “What are you hiding?”\n\n“Nothing was unethical,” Biden said of Hunter Biden’s role on the board of the energy company Burisma. “My son has no made money from China. The only guy who has made money from China was this guy,” he said, directing his comments at Trump\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nAre smirks allowed?\n\nThe candidates were told not to interrupt each other but no one said they couldn’t physically react.\n\nAnd Biden had plenty of facial expressions when Trump was asked about his criticisms of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert.\n\n“This guy's a disaster,” Trump said of Fauci Monday. On Thursday, Trump said they didn’t have a problem.\n\n“I get along very well with Anthony,” Trump said, as Biden smiled.\n\nTrump then implied Fauci is a partisan.\n\n“I think he’s a Democrat but that’s OK,” Trump said of Fauci, as Biden shook his head.\n\nTrump got his turn when Biden was asked whether there was anything unethical with his son’s work for a Ukrainian energy company.\n\n“The guy who got in trouble in Ukraine was this guy,” Biden said of Trump as the president shook his head with a smirk.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden: Trump 'panicked' over coronavirus\n\nBiden once again went after Trump for telling author Bob Woodward in February that he purposely played down the threat of coronavirus.\n\nWoodward recently released an explosive new book on Trump titled \"Rage\", which included the president telling the journalist in a recorded interview weeks before the first death in the U.S. that despite knowing how \"deadly\" and serious the coronavirus pandemic would be, he wanted to \"play it down\" and would to continue to do so.\n\n“He was told this was a serious virus that spread in the air and it was much worse than the flu,” Biden said. “He went on record … that he knew how dangerous it was but he didn’t want to tell us because he didn’t want us to panic. Americans don’t panic. He panicked.”\n\n— Ledyard King\n\nBiden: Countries that interfere with election will pay\n\nBiden vowed to penalize any country that influences the U.S. election after intelligence officials said Russia, China and Iran are trying to interfere.\n\n“Any country that interferes with us will pay a price because it is our sovereignty,” Biden said.\n\nBiden said a former national security adviser accused Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, of being a Russian pawn by spreading misinformation. But Biden asked why Trump hasn’t challenged Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n“What happens? Nothing happens,” Biden said. “I don’t know why this president is unwilling to take on Putin.”\n\nTrump said he imposed sanctions on Russians.\n\n“There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump,” Trump said.\n\n— Bart Jansen\n\nTrump shows up in Nashville combative, but more restrained\n\nIt was a question that had dominated the pre-debate coverage for days: Would a more subdued Trump show up to the debate stage in Nashville, or would the president hold firm to the pugilistic style he has embraced for much of the campaign.\n\nIn a way, in the early moments of the debate at least, he managed to do both.\n\nTrump avoided the interruptions that marred the first the debate, giving Biden more room to speak – a strategy his aides had pushed him to embrace. But he still pressed hard against Biden as the Democrat slammed the administration’s coronavirus response.\n\n“We’re about to go into a dark winter. And he has no clear plan,” Biden argued on COVID at one point.\n\n“He was months behind me. He was way behind us,” Trump countered.\n\n“We’re learning to live with it,” Trump said of the virus. “We can’t lock ourselves in a basement like Joe does.”\n\nThe back and forth was tense but less fiery and uncivil than the first debate on Sept. 29.\n\nAt one point Trump asked NBC’s Kristen Welker if he could respond to a Biden criticism. When Welker said he could, Trump responded: \"Thank you, I appreciate that.\"\n\nThe exchange represented a departure from the more intense and combative exchanges he has had with the moderators of the first debate and a recent town hall.\n\n— John Fritze and Maureen Groppe\n\nTrump blames COVID-19 response on 'Democratic states'; Biden says the president is playing politics\n\nTrump sought to shed blame for the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent economic problems by blaming Democratic state governors.\n\nStates, like New York and Michigan, led by Democrats Andrew Cuomo and Gretchen Whitmer, have failed to step up and are resisting re-opening their economies, Trump said.\n\nBiden said New York and other states have \"bent the curve\" on COVID cases and are coming back, and added that Trump should not be dividing the country into \"red states\" and \"blue states.\"\n\n\"We're all the United States,\" Biden said.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nBiden says he would ‘shut down the virus, not the country’\n\nBiden did not rule out future shutdowns of businesses to combat the coronavirus if elected president, saying reopening must slow down if the rate of infections grows faster than it can be combatted.\n\nBut the former vice president said: “I’m going to shut down the virus, not the county.”\n\nBiden blamed the “ineptitude” of Trump for putting the country in a situation where many businesses and schools are closed to fight the spread of COVID-19. Biden said he supported health precautions against COVID-19 that would still allow businesses to operate.\n\n“He shouldn’t have been on his golf course,” Biden said of the president’s coronavirus response. “He should have been negotiating with Speaker Pelosi.”\n\nTrump fired back: “All he does is talk about shutdowns,” he said, adding that Biden is just like Democratic governors who have enforced shutdowns in their states. “He’ll shut down the country if one person in our massive bureaucracy says close it down”\n\nBiden responded: “Absolutely, not true. We should be able to walk and chew gum at the same time.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\n'He says we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it'\n\nTrump has repeatedly said we're \"rounding the turn on the pandemic,\" which has killed more than 220,000 people but the president had a new message about the coronavirus.\n\nBiden criticized Trump's optimistic message on the pandemic as several states are reaching new highs in average new daily cases and slammed the president for saying that the pandemic is going to be \"over soon.\"\n\n\"We're learning to live with it. We have no choice we can lock ourselves up in a basement like Joe does,\" Trump said.\n\n\"He says we're learning to live with it. People are learning to die with it,\" Biden responded.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nNo initial interruptions\n\nBoth Trump and Biden got through their first opening comments without interruptions.\n\nAfter all the overtalking of the first debate, the debate commission announced that only the microphone of the candidate speaking would be turned on while that candidate had two minutes to give an initial answer to each of the debate topics.\n\n“I’m going to ask you to please speak one at a time,” Kristen Welker, the debate moderator, requested at the start. “The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say.”\n\nWelker introduced the first topic, the coronavirus pandemic, and both Trump and Biden gave their initial responses uninterrupted.\n\n— Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden: Trump still has no plan\n\nDemocratic nominee Joe Biden slammed Trump for not doing more to prevent 220,000 Americans from dying of COVID-19 so far.\n\n“Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain president of the United States of America,” Biden said.\n\nThe former vice president said he would urge everyone to wear a mask for months, which could avoid half the projected 200,000 more deaths expected by the end of the year. He also proposed to create programs for rapid testing and national standards for reopening schools and businesses.\n\n“We’re in a circumstance where the president still has no plan,” Biden said. “I will take care of this.”\n\n--Bart Jansen\n\nTrump takes first question on COVID\n\nTrump took the first question in the debate – on COVID-19, and how his administration is going to deal with the latest surge in cases taking place in many states.\n\nThe president focused on the mortality rate in the country, which has decreased, and said asserted that states would climb out of their recent increases.\n\n“We’re fighting it and we’re fighting it hard,” Trump said. “There’s some spikes and surges in other places, and they will soon be gone.”\n\nTrump talked about his personal experience with COVID-19.\n\n“It’s going away,” he said.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nFinal presidential debate is underway\n\nThe final debate between Trump and Biden is underway in Nashville, an event that has been described as the president’s last, best chance to reset a campaign that is running behind in most of the nation’s battleground states.\n\nFamily members for both candidates have occupied the front rows in the Curb Event Center at Belmont University. An orange program and a pack of anti-bacterial wipes was placed on each seat in the hall, where about 200 people will watch the candidates square off in person.\n\nThe debate comes with less than two weeks to go before the Nov. 3 election, and as more than 40 million Americans have already cast a ballot. The candidates will discuss the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, racial tensions, national security and leadership, among other topics.\n\nBuckle up: No matter what happens, the next 90 minutes will be among the most interesting and important of this rollercoaster of an election.\n\n— John Fritze\n\nMembers of Trump family spotted in masks\n\nMembers of the Trump family including First Lady Melania Trump and the president's children Eric, Donald, Ivanka and Tiffany were spotted wearing masks as required by the debates commission. The family was criticized for refusing to wear masks at presidential debate at the Cleveland Clinic on Sept. 29, just two days before the president tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nLara Trump, a Trump campaign official and the wife of Trump's son Eric, sparred with Fox News' Chris Wallace, who moderated the debate, about whether the family was asked to wear masks indoors.\n\n\"We walked in with a mask on. We sat down - all the seats were socially distanced,\" she told Wallace earlier this month. \"I want to be very clear, never one time did anyone from Cleveland Clinic come up and ask any member of our family to put a mask on.\"\n\n— Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump invites Tony Bobulinski, Hunter Biden's former business partner, as debate guest\n\nPresident Donald Trump is again taking a page from his 2016 playbook by inviting a guest to attack his opponent.\n\nThe Trump campaign has enlisted Tony Bobulinski, a former business associate of Joe Biden's son, Hunter Biden, who has accused the former vice president of accepting influence payments from foreign entities. Bobulinski claims that Hunter Biden spoke to the former vice president often about his business dealings and \"frequently referenced asking him for his sign-off or advice on various potential deals.\"\n\nJoe Biden has insisted that his son Hunter's business interests have never influenced his policies.\n\nBobulinski's appearance comes after The New York Post reported on the alleged contents of a computer hard drive purporting to document the Ukrainian and Chinese business activities of Biden’s son, Hunter Biden. Federal authorities are investigating whether the material supplied to the Post by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, is part of a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nBiden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates responded to the allegations by pointing out the former vice president released his tax returns, which show \"there is no indication he ever got any money from anybody in these business deals.\"\n\n\"Joe Biden has never even considered being involved in business with his family, nor in any overseas business whatsoever. He has never held stock in any such business arrangements nor has any family member or any other person ever held stock for him,\" Bates said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday campaign officials told reporters they expect Trump to attack Biden and his family. Biden Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield warned that such accusations would be \"amplifying Russian misinformation.\"\n\nBobulinski has agreed to cooperate with a Senate investigation into the Bidens and agreed to be interviewed by members of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs and Finance committees on Friday.\n\nFor Trump, the move was a reprise of a similar stunt in 2016, when the president entered a debate with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with three women who had accused President Bill Clinton of inappropriate sexual behavior. At the time, Trump was still reeling from the release of the 2005 Access Hollywood recording in which he was heard bragging about groping women.\n\nIn what was billed as a campaign call \"ahead of tonight's presidential debate,\" officials outlined allegations against Hunter Biden and his business activities in Ukraine and China. Aides refused to answer any question that did not pertain to Hunter Biden hours before the final match-up between Trump and Biden.\n\n— Courtney Subramanian and John Fritze\n\nNo plexiglass to separate Trump, Biden\n\nThe plexiglass that separated the vice-presidential candidates during their debate this month will not be present on the presidential debate stage in Nashville.\n\nThe barrier was added to the stage following Trump’s diagnosis with COVID-19 and an outbreak at the White House. It was on prominent display when Vice President Mike Pence and Sen. Kamala Harris debated in Utah on Oct. 7.\n\nHealth officials in Nashville originally recommended the plexiglass but after consulting with Dr. Tony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and taking Trump's negative test result into account, the glass was removed around 4:30 p.m. CT, according to Frank Fahrenkopf, co-chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates.\n\nTrump recovered from his bout with the virus and has held an active campaign scheduled. Both candidates have tested negative for the virus ahead of the debate.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Plexiglass barriers were seen between the podiums. But by Thursday afternoon, after the two candidates conducted their walkthroughs of the debate hall, they were gone.\n\n— John Fritze, Joey Garrison and The Tennessean\n\nTrump at downtown fundraiser; Biden awaiting debate at local home\n\nThe president and several members of the first family, including Ivanka and Tiffany Trump, were still at a downtown fundraiser late Thursday afternoon.\n\nKid Rock and Lee Greenwood were on hand at the JW Marriott hotel where the fundraiser is taking place.\n\nBiden is staying at a local home while he awaits the debate.\n\n— Natalie Neysa Alund and Adam Tamburin, The Tennessean\n\nWhat time does the debate start?\n\nThe debate will air from 9 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. ET, and will be moderated by NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker. Viewers can stream the match-up at USATODAY.com. The debate also will air on major networks and cable channels, including Fox News, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, MSNBC, PBS and C-SPAN.\n\nJoe Biden invites North Carolina restaurant couple as guests for debate\n\nA North Carolina couple struggling to keep their restaurant afloat during the coronavirus pandemic will join Democratic nominee Joe Biden in Nashville for Thursday night’s presidential debate.\n\nZweli and Leonardo Williams, owners of Zweli’s Kitchen, a Zimbabwean restaurant in Durham, N.C., will be in the debate crowd as the former vice president’s invited guests, according to the Biden campaign.\n\n“They have really had to adapt in order to keep their business afloat,” Biden campaign senior advisor Symone Sanders said during a press call. “They are two of the many small business owners who have felt an economic impact of this administration’s failed response to the COVID-19 pandemic.”\n\n— Joey Garrison\n\nBiden camp rebuts Hunter attacks\n\nA Biden aide predicted Trump would attack the former vice president's son during Thursday night’s debate in Tennessee and said doing so would be \"amplifying Russian misinformation.\"\n\nTheir pre-debate warning from Biden comes after The New York Post reported on the alleged contents of a computer hard drive purporting to document the Ukrainian and Chinese business activities of Biden’s son, Hunter Biden. Federal authorities are investigating whether the material supplied to the Post by Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, has part of a Russian disinformation campaign.\n\nMore: A tabloid got a trove of data on Hunter Biden from Rudy Giuliani. Now, the FBI is probing a possible disinformation campaign.\n\n\"We expect that Trump will attack Biden and his family,” Biden Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield said Thursday. “And every time he does that, all he's doing is reinforcing what we've said all along: He is acknowledging that he has no case for a second term.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nTrump tests negative for COVID\n\nSoon after Trump’s COVID diagnosis this month a question emerged that the White House never fully answered: Was the president tested for the virus before he stood on stage with Biden for their first debate?\n\nThis time around, White House officials are being more clear.\n\n“We tested him on the way here and he tested negative,” White House chief of staff Mark Meadows told reporters traveling with the president to the debate in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nThe White House announced Trump’s positive test result on the morning of Oct. 2. He took part in the debate with Biden days earlier, on Sept. 29. Trump has not directly answered whether he was tested on the day of the debate, a requirement from the Commission on Presidential Debates, and White House aides have been unwilling to answer questions about the timeline of his previous negative tests.\n\n“I don't know, I don't even remember,” Trump said during a televised town hall on NBC last week. “I test all the time.\"\n\n– John Fritze\n\nTrump has much on the line in final debate with Biden\n\nTrump faces a make-or-break moment in his campaign for a second term as he squares off Thursday against Biden in the final presidential debate of the 2020 election – and perhaps the final opportunity to reset the narrative of the race.\n\nAfter a widely panned and frequently vitriolic debate Sept. 29, the two candidates will square off with less than two weeks to go before the Nov. 3 election. What to watch: Will Trump moderate his tone after facing blowback for coming in \"too hot\" during his first exchange with Biden? How will the decision by the Commission on Presidential Debates to mute microphones during portions of the debate affect the back-and-forth?\n\nThe final debate comes as Biden enjoyed double-digit leads in national polls and single-digit leads in most battlegrounds, findings the Trump campaign argues does not adequately capture the enthusiasm among the president's supporters for a second term.\n\nMore:How to watch the last presidential debate between Joe Biden and Donald Trump\n\nThe debate will air from 9 p.m. to 10:30 p.m. ET, and will be moderated by NBC News White House correspondent Kristen Welker.

We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\nCNN —\n\n“I know nothing.” That was the response members of the Order of the Star Spangled Banner were supposed to give when asked about their secret society, which was founded in 1849.\n\nThe fiercely anti-immigrant, anti-Catholic group evolved into the American Party, but it will be forever remembered by another name. The “Know Nothings” became a powerful political force, commanding the allegiance of more than 100 members of Congress in the 1850s, as Lorraine Boissoneault wrote in Smithsonian Magazine.\n\nLast week, a Republican member of Congress, Marjorie Taylor Greene, lashed out at Speaker Nancy Pelosi, falsely accusing her of having “gazpacho police spying on members of Congress,” apparently mistaking a cold vegetable soup from Spain for the Gestapo, the Nazi regime’s secret police. The botched reference was widely mocked on social media, and Greene later made fun of herself, tweeting: “No soup for those who illegally spy on Members of Congress, but they will be thrown in the goulash.”\n\nIt wasn’t the first time Greene had reached for wildly inappropriate Nazi comparisons. Even if she had gotten the term Gestapo right, there would have been no excuse for comparing the Capitol Police with the murderous agents of Hitler’s Germany.\n\nGreene’s blunder came at a head-spinning moment, when hyperpartisan politics and the long-running pandemic have combined to produce a cavalcade of misinformation, disinformation, ignorance, conspiracy theories and self-defeating protests – as if knowing nothing has become a feature, not a bug of 2022.\n\nClay Jones/CNN\n\n“One aspect of the pandemic experience that can’t simply be explained by the existence of an exceedingly transmissible, deadly virus spreading between us is the sheer absurdity that it brought with it,” wrote Abdul El-Sayed. “Whether boarding an airplane with underwear on your face to protest mask requirements, injecting yourself with horse dewormer instead of a safe and effective vaccine or swallowing household disinfectants because the President of the United States unironically suggested that it might help, the pandemic has amplified the frequency and tenor of ridiculous and sometimes alarming behavior.”\n\nTake the Canadian trucker protests. “Now, they’re impeding the Ambassador Bridge between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, one of the most active arteries for transnational commerce,” El-Sayed pointed out. “Here’s what’s so absurd about it: The protest over Covid restrictions is now disrupting peoples’ everyday lives – which is what the protest was supposedly aimed at stopping. They’ve lost the plot.”\n\nBill Bramhall/Tribune Content Agency\n\nReality of Rogan\n\nMisinformation has flourished on Joe Rogan’s controversial podcast, which has caused headaches for Spotify, the platform that reportedly invested more than $100 million in the show. “Rogan’s everyman persona is attractive to millions who view themselves as fed up with perceived liberal and conservative media biases,” Peniel E. Joseph noted.\n\n“Yet Rogan, in many instances, amplifies partisan divides by offering an unvarnished platform for some of the worst impulses in American culture. From Proud Boys to anti-vaxxers, Rogan has helped spread misinformation, furthered the coarsening of popular culture and trafficked in a kind of racial bigotry soft-pedaled in some corners of social media as merely the byproduct of speaking one’s mind…\n\n“Enter at your risk or pleasure (or both), but don’t pretend that you don’t know what you’re listening to.”\n\nTrump mystery solved?\n\nAnn Telnaes/Cartoonist Group\n\n“An enduring mystery might finally have been solved,” Eugene Robinson wrote in the Washington Post. “Remember when Donald Trump ranted about how ‘people are flushing toilets 10 times, 15 times, as opposed to once,’ and nobody knew what on earth he was talking about? Maybe he was referring to personal difficulties in trying to flush away official White House documents.”\n\nRobinson was referring to a report from Maggie Haberman’s forthcoming book that White House staff ran across toilets that were clogged with “wads of clumped up wet printed paper.” Trump denied disposing of records that way and brushed off reports that his administration failed to safeguard legally protected documents.\n\n“Most presidents have violated the Presidential Records Act,” wrote historian Julian Zelizer. “But former President Donald Trump’s actions go further than previous presidents, amounting to egregious violations of a law that came about in the aftermath of President Richard Nixon’s traumatic Watergate scandal… In recent days, the nation has learned that Trump made a habit of tearing up documents while he was in office. There have also been several news reports of Trump administration staffers putting documents in burn bags to be destroyed.”\n\n‘Legitimate political discourse’\n\nWalt Handelsman/Tribune Content Agency\n\nRichard N. Bond served as the chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1992 to 1993. So he has an informed vantage point on the world of trouble the RNC brought upon itself with three little words. The committee passed a censure resolution against Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger earlier this month that described the House select committee on which they serve as a politically-motivated effort to target citizens who engaged in “legitimate political discourse” on January 6, 2021.\n\nIn an open letter to current RNC chair Ronna McDaniel, Bond wrote, “At a time when our focus as a party should be on the Biden administration and Democrats at every level of power, you made former President Donald Trump’s unquenchable thirst for revenge against Republicans who disagree with him the political story of the week.”\n\nRecalling the events of January 6, Bond noted, “More than 725 rioters from nearly all 50 states have been arrested and charged with crimes related to the storming of the US Capitol. Five deaths are directly attributable to events of that day; approximately 140 law enforcement officers were treated for injuries. It could take millions of dollars to repair the damage caused by the rioters, according to congressional testimony by the architect of the US Capitol.”\n\nAs historian Nicole Hemmer wrote, “legitimate political discourse” is “an odd way to describe the actions of a mob that chanted ‘Hang Mike Pence’ as it clashed with police before breaking through the doors and windows of the Capitol in an effort to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election. And while, after widespread ridicule, the RNC insisted that it was referring only to the nonviolent protesters supporting Trump’s lie that the election was stolen from him, its attempt to whitewash right-wing violence is part of an ongoing pattern on the right… The end result of these efforts to minimize, excuse, and erase right-wing violence is an environment that invites even more of it.”\n\nInflation is no fun\n\nInflation is not President Joe Biden’s favorite topic. That’s a fair conclusion from his encounters with the media on the topic.\n\nLast month, he was caught on a hot mic calling a Fox News reporter a “stupid son of a bitch” after the President was asked about the potential impact of inflation on this year’s midterm elections. In an interview Thursday with NBC, Biden called Lester Holt a “wise guy” after the anchor pointed out that it had been more than six months since the President said the rise in prices was only temporary. Increasingly, Democrats fear that inflation is hurting Biden’s approval ratings and the party’s chances in the midterms.\n\nGet our free weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nThe consumer price index jumped 7.5% in the 12 months ending in January, a 40-year high. Inflation is diluting the earnings of US consumers, and the Federal Reserve Bank has signaled that it will embark on a series of interest-rate increases which could slow the economy’s growth. “The public tends to think of inflation as an indicator of a cycle of greed and inhumanity, as a conspiracy to rob them of their buying power,” economist Robert J. Shiller wrote in the New York Times. “In reality, the cause is more technical, like an increase in the money supply or disruptions in the supply chain.”\n\nBut he added, “When people start to think that inflation is a measure of collateral damage in the battle between big business and aggressive labor – when they blame, in effect, the wage-price spiral – they feed into the rhetoric of both the extreme left and the extreme right. America doesn’t need another angry political narrative that may further erode our trust in one another, trust that we need for economic growth.”\n\nNathan Chen’s moment\n\nWang Zhao/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn the 2018 Olympics, US figure skater Nathan Chen finished a disappointing fifth. In the run-up to 2022, he was favored to win the gold medal, having dominated a string of other major competitions. On Thursday, Chen finally fulfilled his dream – and the expectations of countless fans.\n\nPart of the appeal of the Games is watching people redeem themselves and realize their full promise, wrote Amy Bass. “For most of us mere mortals who cannot, as Chen did Thursday, land five quadruple jumps (or any kind of jump, for that matter), sport feels easy because that’s how it looks – think how often we use words like ‘effortless’ to describe something as crazy as a triple axel – when the stars do what they are supposed to do.”\n\n“But the stark contrast among the Team USA’s gold rush in the last few days – Chloe Kim’s confident yet emotional defense of her Olympic title on the halfpipe, (Lindsey) Jacobellis’ long-awaited reclamation of Olympic glory, and Chen finally making things right after they had gone so very wrong – show just how extraordinary a feat it is to win.”\n\nFor more:\n\nLincoln Mitchell: Controversy over gold-medalist Eileen Gu skiing for China misses the point\n\nKara Alaimo: What to do about the social media shaming of figure skater Zhu Yi\n\nThe artificial sun\n\nThe world may have moved a step closer to an energy breakthrough that could one day end the reliance on fossil fuels. As physicist Don Lincoln wrote, “On December 21, 2021, an artificial sun briefly flickered into existence underneath the English countryside.” Scientists, working at a center south of Oxford, created a nuclear fusion reaction for about five seconds, generating nearly 12 megawatts of power.\n\nIt was likely a final moment of glory for the device that created it. “The extreme heat and pressure generated by the reaction means this is likely to be the JET’s last hurrah.” But another experimental facility is being built in southern France.\n\nUsing nuclear fusion as a safe and clean energy source has been a goal since the mid-twentieth century. Back then, Lincoln noted, “it was thought to be possible in about 20 to 30 years. But the estimate today is that it is still 20 to 30 years away. Given the reality of climate change and the fact that the energy needs of the future will certainly be greater than that of the present, this is a problem we have to solve. Additional investment in fusion technology research would certainly speed up the process.”\n\nMask off\n\nLisa Benson/Washington Post Writers Group\n\nGovernors in a number of liberal states are dropping Covid mask mandates, getting ahead of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the White House, which have taken a more cautious approach.\n\nIt’s worth rethinking the mandates, argued Jill Filipovic. “Yes, if case rates are low, the vaccinated should have more opportunities to live mask-free. Because let’s be honest: Masks do come with costs. They can be uncomfortable, especially when worn for long periods at a time. They interrupt basic human communication – so much of how we understand each other and send subtle cues is through our facial expressions, which masks conceal. When we can’t see each others’ faces, we lose a primary means via which human animals connect, and, at least anecdotally, we can become even more atomized and less empathetic to each other. And while the impact of masking on children is still being studied and experts largely say that kids are flexible and can adapt or catch up, many parents and some experts worry that prolonged masking could impair children’s language skills and their social and emotional development…”\n\nFilipovic pointed out that a constant part of life is balancing “competing interests and potential harms. We do this all the time; we set speed limits and mandate seatbelts in cars, but we don’t expect to have zero traffic fatalities – and we don’t even set highway speed limits low enough to radically reduce traffic deaths because we’ve essentially decided that we need people to be able to get where they’re going, and that is worth the tradeoff.”\n\n“What we need is not just clear guidance for the here and now, but a clear formula for when mask mandates should lift, where they should lift, and when they may need to be reinstated. Covid-19 is not a static disease, and public health guidance should evolve as the disease does.”\n\nThe longest table\n\nSPUTNIK/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIt was another week of foreboding about a potential Russian invasion of Ukraine, punctuated by the spectacle of Presidents Vladimir Putin and Emmanuel Macron seated at opposite ends of a table that seemed many times longer than the one that separated newspaper publisher Charles Foster Kane and his wife Emily as their marriage was disintegrating in “Citizen Kane.”\n\n“Macron’s Moscow visit this week produced humiliation – at least so far,” wrote Frida Ghitis. “After the talks, France announced that Putin had agreed to refrain from new military maneuvers near Ukraine, for the moment. The Kremlin’s (Dmitry) Peskov later said he had no idea what the French were talking about; a slap in Macron’s face.” The Kremlin later explained that the long table was used because Macron had declined to take a Covid-19 test.\n\n“This moment demands understanding that the world is facing an authoritarian leader accustomed to bullying and intimidating,” added Ghitis. “In the end, it’s not so much Russia facing off against Ukraine or against the West, as it is its authoritarian President. The West is scrambling for the right language because this, as Russia’s neighbors and the rest of the world know, is Putin’s show.”\n\nFor more:\n\nLeroy Chiao: What a NASA astronaut learned about working with Russians.\n\nMichael Bociurkiw: Ukrainians are wondering if their TV showman-turned-president is up to the job\n\nThey’re deciding the election for you\n\nElection Day is more than 260 days away, but many of the important decisions have already been made – not by voters, but by Republicans and Democrats drawing congressional district lines to make it almost impossible for the other party to win seats.\n\nThis year’s gerrymanders are a “partisan bloodbath,” wrote David Daley. “Both parties have wiped competitive seats off the board. While Republicans overwhelmingly gerrymandered more Congressional districts and state legislatures 10 years ago, Democrats have been just as aggressive this cycle in states where they have complete control. The brazen gerrymander passed by New York Democrats last week not only locked in 22 blue seats in a 26-member delegation, but eliminated all four of the competitive districts where President Biden and Donald Trump finished within five points of each other in 2020… The People’s House belongs to the mapmakers.”\n\nDon’t miss\n\nDean Obeidallah: If a passenger misbehaves, put them on a no-fly list\n\nArick Wierson: Amir Locke’s death highlights federal lawmakers’ inaction on police reform\n\nWilliam J.

The photorealistic image of the former President, dressed in a black suit with a gray tie, is painted against a minimal white backdrop – a signature of McCurdy’s artworks. McCurdy said his paintings take at least a year to complete.\n\nPresident Barack Obama's portrait was painted by Robert McCurdy. First lady Michelle Obama was painted by Sharon Sprung. White House Historical Association\n\nThe former first lady’s portrait was painted by Sprung, who describes her work as “contemporary realism.” The image depicts Michelle Obama in a blue dress, seated on a sofa in the Red Room of the White House. The artwork was painted from photographs taken in different locations on the White House’s State Floor.\n\nThe long-awaited return of a White House tradition\n\nWednesday’s ceremony in the East Room marked a rare occasion for a celebration among two presidential administrations, where President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden convened a who’s who of administration officials past and present – from the unique vantage point of having served in both.\n\nThe pieces, which will hang inside the White House for decades to come, are the first official portraits added to the White House Collection since then-President Obama held a bipartisan unveiling ceremony for George W. Bush and Laura Bush in 2012.\n\nBiden used the unveiling ceremony to reflect on the Obamas’ accomplishments in the White House, saying that the former first couple “made history.”\n\n“You both generated hope for millions of people who were left behind for so long – and it matters. You both did it with such grace and such class. You dreamed big and secured lasting wins for the American people, helping lift their burden with a blessing of hope,” he continued. “It’s so underestimated … just having hope. This is the gift of the Obama presidency to the country and to history.”\n\nThe former President subsequently led a standing ovation for Biden, saying in the East Room, “Thanks to your decency and thanks to your strength – maybe most of all thanks to your faith in democracy and the American people – the country’s better off than when you took office. And we should all be deeply grateful for that.”\n\nStewart McLaurin, the president of the WHHA, told CNN that the Covid-19 pandemic played a factor in the timing of the unveiling. The WHHA, a nonprofit organization, facilitates and funds the creation of the portraits.\n\n“Covid impacted us two-and-a-half years ago, and I do think it’s important for these (portraits) to be revealed at a time when the public does have access to the White House and they can be seen,” McLaurin said.\n\nWhile there’s no hard-and-fast rule for when a White House portrait ought to be unveiled, ceremonies have often been hosted by a former president’s immediate successor. And when in office, President Donald Trump never held a ceremony for the Obama portraits.\n\n‘An evolution of art’\n\nDetails about the pieces being unveiled on Wednesday were a tightly held secret, with artists and art movers signing confidentiality agreements to keep things under wraps before the big day.\n\nBut the Obamas have often used art as a tool to express their tastes, so it should come as no surprise that their White House portraits are doing the same.\n\nMcCurdy’s depiction of the former President is minimalist, eschewing the conventional props typically associated with a presidential portrait, like a desk or a bookcase, for an entirely blank background.\n\nThe former President said during the unveiling that he liked that McCurdy “paints people the way they are, for better or worse.”\n\n“He captures every wrinkle on your face, every crease in your shirt. You’ll note that he refused to hide any of my gray hairs, refused my request to make my ears smaller. He also talked me out of wearing a tan suit, by the way,” Obama quipped. “His work is so precise that at first glance it looks like a photograph.”\n\nWhile past presidents attain a form of “mythical status” after leaving office, Obama said he hoped future generations would look at the portraits and “get a better, honest sense of who Michelle and I were.”\n\n“And I hope they leave with a better understanding that if we could make it here, maybe they can too. They can do remarkable things, too,” he continued.\n\nSprung’s interpretation shows the former first lady appearing to take a brief moment to get comfortable inside one of the the most formal rooms in the White House. Unlike her predecessors’ portraits, Michelle Obama is wearing a strapless gown in her portrait – perhaps a marker of the country’s evolving style.\n\nIn her portrait, the former first lady is wearing a custom Jason Wu Collection gown, a person familiar with the details told CNN. Wu is a full-circle choice of designer for Obama, and he designed both of her inaugural gowns. Obama’s choice of Wu back then essentially launched his career as a globally recognized fashion designer.\n\nMichelle Obama said during the ceremony that though she “never could have imagined” being first lady would be part of her story, she recognized that “traditions like this matter, not just for those of us who hold these positions, but for everyone participating in and watching our democracy.”\n\n“Too often in this country, people feel like they have to look a certain way or act a certain way to fit in, that they have to make a lot of money or come from a certain group or class or faith in order to matter. But what we’re looking at today – a portrait of a biracial kid with an unusual name and the daughter of a water pump operator and a stay-at-home mom – what we are seeing is a reminder that there is a place for everyone in this country,” the former first lady said.\n\n“That is what this country is about. It’s not about blood or pedigree or wealth. It’s a place where everyone should have a fair shot,” she continued.\n\nAhead of Wednesday’s reveal, McLaurin called the Obama portraits “an evolution of art.”\n\n“We’re now heading towards the first third of the 21st century. And I think in the mind’s eye of most Americans, we see presidential portraits as these very traditional, 19th-century-looking-and-feeling portraits. But art and taste in art evolves and changes,” he continued.\n\nWhile living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the Obamas opted to highlight several contemporary and modern artists.\n\nA Robert Rauschenberg painting replaced a portrait of a Roosevelt in the family dining room. Mark Rothko and Josef Albers works were installed. And Michelle Obama brought in work from Alma Thomas – the first Black female artist in the White House Collection.\n\nSince leaving the presidency, the Obamas have staked some of their post-White House careers in taste-making – producing podcasts and award-winning films, as well as curating playlists and book lists each year.\n\nFor their portraits unveiled in 2018 at the Smithsonian’s National Portrait Gallery (which are not to be confused with new official White House portraits being unveiled this week), the Obamas chose two Black artists with unique perspectives on African-American portraiture.\n\nAmy Sherald, who painted the first lady’s Smithsonian portrait, challenges conventions about race by depicting her figures’ skin in shades of gray. Kehinde Wiley, who painted the former President, re-imagines Old Master paintings with Black subjects.\n\nWednesday’s ceremony at the White House\n\nThe Obamas’ return to the White House marked a rare moment for the current and past administrations to converge and look back on a presidential legacy in the same room where President Obama awarded then-Vice President Biden a surprise Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2017.\n\nUnlike the 2012 Bush portraits unveiling, Wednesday’s event mostly hosted attendees from the same political party – with some attendees having connections to both administrations.\n\nThe Obamas were joined by family, friends, former Cabinet members and top staffers from the administration during the unveiling, acknowledging former staff in the room as well as staff from the White House residence.\n\nMarian Robinson, the mother of Michelle Obama who lived in the White House residence during their presidency, attended the ceremony.\n\nOther attendees included Obama’s former chief of staff (and the current US Ambassador to Japan) Rahm Emanuel, former senior adviser David Axelrod, former Treasury Secretaries Jack Lew and Timothy Geithner, former Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, former Attorney General Eric Holder, former Education Secretary Arne Duncan, former Director of the US Office of Management and Budget Shaun Donovan, and former White House press secretary Josh Earnest.\n\nShortly after Wednesday’s ceremony, the portraits were hung inside the White House.\n\nBarack Obama’s portrait is now hanging in the Grand Foyer at the base of the main White House staircase, replacing the portrait of former President Bill Clinton. Michelle Obama’s is hanging one floor below, along the ground floor hallway.\n\nThe Bidens also hosted the Obamas and Robinson for a private lunch at the White House ahead of the East Room event. The conversation was more focused on nostalgia, an official said, rather than a strategy session on midterm elections or pending policies.\n\nFormer President Obama has visited the White House since Biden took office, but Wednesday’s event marked Michelle Obama’s first time back in the building since the Trumps arrived in January 2017.\n\nWhile former President Obama and President Biden like to play up their relationship in public, there are limits to their friendship, officials have said.\n\nThey speak occasionally, but they are not in daily or weekly contact, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nAfter two terms working in Obama’s shadow, Biden has, at moments, differentiated himself from his predecessor. Officials have said there is also a degree of competition between the two men.\n\nTheir history, while one of partnership, has also been colored by various slights, real or perceived, that still linger.\n\nObama declined to endorse Biden over other Democrats in the 2020 primary, a step both men insisted was necessary to allow a true contest within the party. Four years earlier, Obama had viewed Hillary Clinton as his Democratic successor instead of Biden, who decided not to run as he grappled with his son’s death.\n\nTrump portraits are up next\n\nThe White House Historical Association is in the “beginning stages” of the portrait processes for former President Trump and former first lady Melania Trump, McLaurin said.\n\n“There’s focus on specific artists that will likely be doing their portraits,” McLaurin added.\n\nA source familiar with the situation told CNN that chatter about the portraits started in the last six months at Mar-a-Lago – Trump’s Florida residence – and that the former president recently sat for photographs. However, it’s not clear whether Trump has posed for the White House portrait artist or for photographs specifically for the portraits.\n\nOn Tuesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre declined to say whether Biden would extend an invitation to Trump should his portrait be completed during the Biden administration.\n\nWhile the official White House portraits are typically funded by the WHHA, the other set of portraits being created for the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery are being underwritten by Trump’s political donors.\n\nTrump’s political action committee donated $650,000 to the Smithsonian Institution in July to help underwrite the portraits of the Trumps, according to Linda St. Thomas, chief spokesperson for the Smithsonian.\n\nThe donation from Trump’s Save America leadership PAC marks the first time that funds have come from a political action committee since the institution began raising private funds for presidential portraits – a practice that started with the portraits associated with former President George H. W. Bush, St. Thomas said.\n\nSt. Thomas said another private donation of $100,000 also is helping to pay costs associated with the portraits. The funds, totaling $750,000, will go to artists’ fees, shipping, framing, installation and events.\n\nCLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify where President Donald Trump had the portraits of Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton moved during his time in the White House.\n\nThe Obamas’ official portraits have been hung in the White House.\n\nPresident Obama’s is hanging in the Grand Foyer at the base of the main White House staircase, replacing the portrait of former President Clinton.

They were forced to let her skate and Syers earned second place behind Ulrich Salchow.\n\nSoon after, officials banned female athletes, claiming their skirts were too long and the judges couldn’t see their footwork. Syers quickly found a solution: a skirt that ended mid-calf.\n\nShe went on to win the British Nationals in 1903 and 1904 and the women’s World Championships in 1906 and 1907. Figure skating made its debut in the 1908 London Olympics and Syers won gold in the women’s singles and bronze in the mixed pairs, where she skated alongside her husband, making her the first woman to take home two medals in just one Olympic Games.\n\n1988: Modesty and “The Katarina Rule”\n\nAt the 1988 Winter Olympics hosted in Calgary, German figure skater Katerina Witt wore a costume that a male Canadian coach, Peter Dunfield, claimed was “bizarre and indecent … The real provocative side is the back. But in the front, you’ve even got cleavage.”\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Dunfield also suggested that Witt might be trying to win over the judges with a revealing costume.\n\nWitt defended her choice, saying the costume was appropriate for her music, which was from the Broadway show “Jerry’s Girls.”\n\nThe controversy caused the ISU to adopt a new dress code: all women were required to wear skirts that covered their hips and bottom, as well as cover their midriff.\n\nThis strict rule was relaxed in 2003, but the ISU still requires all clothing to be “modest, dignified and appropriate for athletic competition.”\n\nKatarina Witt at the Calgary 1988 Winter Olympics.

Kerrigan’s rival Tonya Harding’s ex-husband Jeff Gillooly was involved in the plot.\n\nGillooly was sentenced to two years in prison for his role in the attack and Harding received three years of probation and was fined $100,000 for conspiring to hinder prosecution.\n\nKerrigan was still selected for the Olympic team despite her injury and went on to earn a silver medal at the 1994 Olympic in Lillehammer.\n\nHarding maintained her innocence throughout the games, but on March 16, just a few weeks after closing ceremonies, she pleaded guilty to hindering the prosecution.\n\nA few months later the US Figure Skating Association revoked her gold medal at the 1994 national championships and banned her from the ice for life.\n\nSubsequently the scandal was immortalized in the 2017 drama, “I, Tonya” starring Margot Robbie, Sebastian Stan and Allison Janney.\n\nAsked by The Boston Globe if she was bothered by Hollywood’s portrayal of Harding, Kerrigan said “It’s not really part of my life.”\n\n“As you say, I was the victim,” she said. “Like, that’s my role in this whole thing. That’s it.”\n\nUS figure skater Tonya Harding and Nancy Kerrigan take a break during training in 1994. Andreas Altwein/dpa/AP\n\n1998: Surya Bonaly backflips and judges flip out\n\nThe day before Surya Bonaly was set to perform her free skate at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, she pulled a muscle in her right leg, though knowing that these Winter Games were her last, the French star was committed to competing.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Radiolab, Bonaly recounted her performance, saying by the end of the program the pain in her leg was unbearable and she couldn’t perform the two triples she had left in her routine.\n\nBut Bonaly “had a special thing in her back pocket” to wow the crowd, performing an illegal backflip landing on just her left blade.\n\nIt didn’t go down well with judges, who handed Bonaly a score that dropped her from sixth to 11th place.\n\nIn recent years, fans have questioned if race might have played a part in her career, though both Bonaly and former judges deny any bias.\n\n“We are all humans, we all have different styles. And we can create a different personality of character on ice,” Bonaly told CNN’s Amy Woodyatt on Friday.\n\n“You have to find your own style, and you have to save it to give it … When you watch 20 skaters doing the same thing over and over, I mean, what’s about it?\n\n“Skating is called free skating, so supposed to be free, but it’s not really free, entirely free because there’s rules to follow and if you don’t, you’re in big trouble.\n\nBonaly told CNN that her routines were sometimes penalized by judges.\n\n“I remember back in the days I used to like jumps and combos, and if I will do one extra one jump after a combo because I felt like “oh, triple, triple and a double. You actually got in trouble because you did too much of that,” she said.\n\n“I think that judges should be more open minded, to be able to receive and see things coming from different places – a different way of what has been brought on the ice.”\n\nSurya Bonaly performs a backflip in her free skate routine. Eric Feferberg/AFP/Getty Images\n\n1998: Judging scandal exposed\n\nAt the 1998 Olympics, Jean Senft – a Canadian skating judge – surreptitiously recorded a conversation with a fellow Ukrainian judge, Yuri Balkov, where they openly discussed how they would place ice dancers before they had even competed.\n\nSenft had previously approached officials with her concerns about corruption among her colleagues but was told she needed proof.\n\nAfter playing the tape at an ISU hearing, Balkov was banned for one year. Soon after, Senft also suffered a six-month suspension for allegedly favoring a Canadian pair, though she claims the suspension was retaliation against her.\n\n“The athletes are not competing on a fair playing field. This isn’t sport. Somebody had to get proof,” Senft told CBC News in 2000.\n\nAfter the scandal, small reforms were made to judging requirements and deductions.\n\n2002: “Skategate”\n\nAfter Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier produced a flawless free skate at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City, the gold medal was awarded to the Russian duo: Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, who had enough technical errors in their performance to call the result into question.\n\nWhen the judges met to defend the results, French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne claimed that the French Skating Federation president, Didier Gailhauguet, had directed her to rank the Russian pair first.\n\nSoon evidence emerged of a quid pro quo between Russian and French votes in the pairs figure skating and ice dancing events.\n\nLe Gougne and Gailhauguet were suspended for three years and there was an overhaul of the judging system in figure skating, with strict protocols eliminating the room for subjective judgment.\n\n“Meddling,” a four-part series was released last month on Peacock chronicling the scandal.\n\nElena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze of Russia celebrate gold at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. Robert Laberge/Getty Images\n\n2010: Russian duo’s performance sparks cultural backlash\n\nReigning world champions in ice dancing, the Russian duo Oksana Domnina and Maxim Shabalin performed a dance inspired by Aboriginal culture at both the Russian and European Championships.\n\nThe pair skated to music that was largely chants and didgeridoos while wearing red loin cloths, body suits with white markings and make up that appeared to be brown face.\n\nTheir performance sparked outrage amongst Aboriginal activists in Australia who claimed the routine was culturally exploitative and inauthentic.\n\n“Accurate or not, you have to be sensitive to the people you are representing,” Jef Billings, a renowned designer of skating costumes, told The New York Times in 2010.\n\n“At the turn of the last century, minstrel shows were acceptable. Times have changed.”\n\nThe Russian duo’s coach, Natalia Linichuk ,was shocked at the outrage, denying any wrongdoing or ill-intent and claiming that the dance was not based on any one Aboriginal culture.\n\nBev Manton, chairwoman of the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council, expressed her anger in the Sydney Morning Herald: “From an Aboriginal perspective, this performance is offensive. It was clearly not meant to mock Aboriginal culture, but that does not make it acceptable to Aboriginal people.”\n\n2014: US Skating Federation team selection questioned\n\nMirai Nagasu took home the bronze medal at the 2014 US national championships but was passed over for the Sochi Olympic team in favor of fourth place finisher, Ashley Wagner.\n\nThe US Skating Federation had only ignored the national championship results four times until then, in all cases because of injuries that prevented the selected athletes from competing.\n\nThe federation defended its choice, citing Wagner’s higher global rankings and Nagasu’s inconsistent record over the past year.\n\nHowever, Jeff Yang of the Wall Street Journal found it hard to ignore the aesthetics of the choice, calling Wagner a “golden girl” with her blonde hair and blue eyes.\n\nHis claims had a ring of truth for some fans, especially when looking at previous treatment of Asian American skaters; including one media headline claiming, “American beats out Kwan.” Kwan being Michelle Kwan of the US team, who was born in Torrance, California.\n\nFour years later Nagasu won a bronze medal at the Winter Olympics in South Korea.\n\nNagasu also landed a triple axel – one of the most challenging jumps in figure skating. In doing so she accomplished a feat that made her the first female American figure skater to nail the triple axel at the Olympics.\n\nAt the end of her routine, Nagasu triumphantly threw her hands in the air and a bright, exuberant smile spread across her face.\n\nMirai Nagasu (L) and Ashley Wagner (R) on the podium together. Jared Wickerham/Getty Images\n\n2022: Kamila Valieva’s positive drugs test\n\nIn a sample taken in December, prior to the Olympics, 15-year-old Valieva tested positive for the banned heart medication trimetazidine, a drug commonly used to treat angina and which experts say can enhance endurance by increasing blood flow to the heart.\n\nHowever, the result was only analyzed and reported to Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) in February. Valieva was then suspended the day after she led the Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) to gold in the figure skating team event on February 7 when she became the first woman to land a quadruple jump in a Winter Olympic Games.\n\nRUSADA lifted her suspension the next day following a hearing. Subsequently the World Anti-Doping Agency, the International Olympic Committee and the ISU filed an appeal against the lifting of the ban.\n\nHowever, the Court of Arbitration for Sport cleared Valieva for competition, saying she would suffer “irreparable harm” if not allowed to compete, citing the “exceptional circumstances” of her being a minor.\n\nValieva finished in fourth place in the women’s individual figure skating event on Thursday, leaving the ice in tears after falling and faltering during jumps in her routine, despite having previously been the favorite to take gold.\n\nBefore being cleared to take part in the women’s individual figure skating competition, Valieva was suspended by the RUSADA on February 8, although the body lifted her suspension the next day following a hearing.", "authors": ["Kikue Higuchi"], "publish_date": "2022/02/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/11/politics/fact-check-republican-secretary-of-state-nominees-2020-election/index.html", "title": "At least 12 Republican nominees for state elections chief have ...", "text": "Washington CNN —\n\nIn at least 12 states, the Republican nominee for the job of overseeing future elections is someone who has questioned, rejected or tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nSecretaries of state will play a critical role in managing and certifying the presidential election in 2024. The distinct possibility that some of these secretaries will be people with a history of election denial is a major challenge for American democracy – especially because former President Donald Trump, who is widely expected to run again in 2024, continues to pressure state officials to discard the will of voters.\n\nThe Republican nominees for secretary of state in the November 2022 midterm elections include three swing-state candidates who have made efforts to overturn 2020 results in their states: Mark Finchem of Arizona, Kristina Karamo of Michigan and Jim Marchant of Nevada.\n\nThe Republican nominee in Republican-dominated Alabama, Wes Allen, expressed support for a 2020 lawsuit that sought to get the Supreme Court to toss out Joe Biden’s victory. The Republican nominee in Republican-dominated Indiana, Diego Morales, has called the 2020 election a “scam,” the vote “tainted” and the outcome “questionable.” The Republican nominee in GOP-dominated South Dakota, Monae Johnson, has refused to acknowledge that Biden won legitimately. The Republican nominee in Republican-dominated Wyoming, Chuck Gray, has said that Biden’s victory was “illegitimate” and that he “absolutely” thinks Trump was the real winner.\n\nThe Republican nominee in Democratic-leaning but regularly competitive Minnesota, Kim Crockett, has described the 2020 election in her state as “lawless.” The Republican nominee in the Democratic-dominated Connecticut, Dominic Rapini, is the former chair of a group that has made baseless complaints of 2020 fraud.\n\nThe Republican nominee in Democratic-leaning but sometimes competitive New Mexico, Audrey Trujillo, has called the 2020 election stolen. So have the Republican candidates in Massachusetts and Vermont, both obscure figures who face long odds of winning their liberal states in November.\n\nThere are some significant differences in the intensity with which these 12 nominees have committed to election rejection. For example, Morales acknowledged in June that Biden “legitimately occupies” the presidency, while Finchem, a serial promoter of wild conspiracy theories about the election, has persisted this year in his impossible quest to reverse Biden’s victory in Arizona.\n\nTwenty-seven states are holding secretary of state elections in 2022.

Mickey Welsh/AP\n\nState representative Wes Allen, who won Alabama’s Republican nomination in a June runoff election, endorsed the Texas-led legal effort to get the Supreme Court to overturn Biden’s victories in four states – tweeting in December 2020 that Alabama’s attorney general should “stand firm” in support.\n\nAllen has vowed to withdraw Alabama from a 31-state consortium that helps member states keep their voter rolls up to date, baselessly alleging that the consortium, which is funded and run by member states, is a “leftist” entity. Alabama’s departing Republican incumbent secretary of state, John Merrill, has called Allen’s claims “patently false” and defended the consortium as an important election security tool.\n\nThe Democratic nominee is Pamela Laffitte, a corrections sergeant for a county sheriff’s office.\n\nAllen’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nArizona: Mark Finchem\n\nArizona state representative Mark Finchem (R-AZ) speaks at a rally in Iowa State Fairgrounds, in Des Moines, Iowa, U.S., October 9, 2021. Rachel Mummey/Reuters\n\nMark Finchem is a far-right Arizona state representative who has for years promoted absurd conspiracy theories and other misinformation. Finchem has been aggressively dishonest about the 2020 election – and he continues to push to “decertify” Biden’s 2020 win in Arizona, though this cannot be done.\n\nFinchem has repeatedly and falsely claimed that “Trump won” the election. He has falsely proclaimed that “the election was a fraud” and that it was “rigged.” He demanded in mid-2021 that liberal officials and the media prove the falsity of election conspiracy theories that had already been proven false, even selling shirts reading “#ProveIt.”\n\nFinchem, who was endorsed by Trump last year and won the Republican primary earlier this month, played a key early role in the election-denying “Stop the Steal” movement in Arizona. After he attended the “Stop the Steal” rally in Washington on January 6, 2021, he was photographed outside the US Capitol during the insurrection that day. He also tweeted a sympathetic message about the rioters, blaming Congress for refusing to acknowledge the “rampant fraud” that, again, didn’t exist. (Finchem denies any involvement in the riot and has not been charged with anything.)\n\nOn the first anniversary of the insurrection, Finchem tweeted a false claim that “the real insurrection” was how Democratic officials in Arizona had rigged the election with “tens of thousands of fraudulent votes” in two big counties won by Biden. This is just fiction.\n\nIn July, Finchem baselessly called for the arrest of incumbent Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, who is now the Democratic nominee for governor, and Adrian Fontes, the Democratic nominee for secretary of state who oversaw the 2020 election in Maricopa County, where many Republicans have baselessly alleged mass fraud.\n\nFinchem’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nConnecticut: Dominic Rapini\n\nDominic Rapini is a candidate for secretary of state for Connecticut. From Dominic Rapini/Facebook\n\nDominic Rapini, who won Connecticut’s Republican primary on Tuesday, formerly served as board chair for a group called Fight Voter Fraud, Inc., which has had its baseless allegations about the 2020 election proven inaccurate by Connecticut’s elections enforcement commission. The Connecticut Post reported that the commission admonished Fight Voter Fraud in 2021; the commission said the group had wasted the commission’s limited resources and should “educate themselves” on the facts and the law before filing complaints.\n\nWhile chairing Fight Voter Fraud, Rapini at least indirectly promoted false claims that there was massive fraud in the 2020 election. He was listed as the author of a web post linking to a document that recommended various reports that falsely alleged the election had been stolen, falsely claimed that statistics cast doubt on Biden’s win, or falsely suggested something was amiss in 2020 with voting machines. (Rapini has said he left his role at Fight Voter Fraud, Inc. in August 2021.)\n\nRapini, who says he has spent more than two decades in sales at Apple, said in an appearance on Hartford station FOX61 in July that “Joe Biden is the duly elected president of the United States.” But in various other interviews over the past year, he refused to offer a direct answer when asked if he believed Biden’s victory was legitimate or whether Trump was the real winner. Dodging the question, he told The Connecticut Examiner in 2021: “I haven’t been researching what’s happened in Arizona and Wisconsin, I haven’t studied it. I will say that Joe Biden was certified in January and we have to move on.”\n\nHe told CT Insider this May: “Listen, Joe Biden, God bless him, was the duly elected president of the United States and beyond that, there’s so many details there I can’t really dive into them, I don’t know the particulars … I think there was definitely anomalies, and there’s things we need to understand, but I have no reason to believe there was widescale fraud in Connecticut, there’s nothing there that I can prove.”\n\nAsked for comment, Rapini said in an email: “I have stated on many occasions during my campaign that Joe Biden is the duly elected President of the United States.” CNN then sent him three examples of how he had sometimes avoided questions about the legitimacy of Biden’s victory and asked him to directly answer that question; we explained we were unclear if he was making some distinction between “duly” and “legitimately” elected. Rapini responded indirectly once more – saying he has been “very clear” in TV interviews that “Joe Biden is the duly elected president” and that reporters with “predisposed assumptions” sometimes leave out parts of his comments.\n\nThe Democratic nominee is state Rep. Stephanie Thomas.\n\nIndiana: Diego Morales\n\nDiego Morales, the GOP pick for Indiana's Secretary of State, does a press conference at the state GOP Convention, Indiana Farmer's Coliseum, Indianapolis, Saturday, June 18, 2022. Robert Scheer/IndyStar/USA Today Network\n\nIn March, when Diego Morales was running for the Republican nomination in Indiana, he published an article on the website Hoosier State Today in which he sharply disputed the legitimacy of the 2020 election – proclaiming that “we have valid reasons to doubt the official vote tallies in key states,” that the vote was “tainted,” that “the outcome is questionable,” and that the election was a “scam.”\n\nMorales, who served as an aide to Mike Pence when Pence was governor of Indiana, went on to argue that late changes to states’ election policies were illegitimate and – vaguely – that it was unconstitutional to subject mail-in voters and the Election Day voters to different levels of “scrutiny.”\n\nSome of Morales’ specific claims are subjective. Nonetheless, his broad initial claim that there are valid reasons to doubt key states’ vote totals is plain false.\n\nMorales has sometimes taken a softer line. After beating Republican incumbent Secretary of State Holli Sullivan for the party nomination at a party convention in June, he told Fox59 of Indianapolis that he had “already moved on” from 2020 to focus on future elections. Morales told journalist Brian Howey in June that Biden was elected in 2020 and “legitimately occupies that office today,” though he also maintained that “there were a number of irregularities in that election.”\n\nMorales campaign manager Kegan Prentice touted Morales’ biography in a statement to CNN and said, “His sole focus now is on visiting all 92 counties in Indiana to listen to and learn from voters so he can best serve them.”\n\nMorales was terminated from a job in the Indiana secretary of state’s office in 2009 for allegedly poor work performance, the Indianapolis Star reported in June. Morales faced more criticism of his work performance after returning to the office under a different secretary of state, the Star reported, and resigned in 2011 after refusing to sign on to an improvement plan.\n\nThe Star reported that Morales said: “Anybody can you write you up at any time, because their envy, selfish office rivalry, whatever you may want to call it. That’s exactly what happened.” Morales’ campaign manager also provided CNN with positive comments about him from Republican Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita, who was secretary of state in 2009. Rokita wrote, “As far as I’m concerned, Diego left my office on good terms, and I consider him a long time friend.”\n\nThe Democratic nominee is Destiny Wells, an officer in the Army Reserve and a lawyer who was formerly a deputy state attorney general.\n\nMassachusetts: Rayla Campbell\n\nRayla Campbell, candidate for secretary of state in Massachusetts. From Rayla Campbell for Massachusetts/Facebook\n\nRayla Campbell, a radio host who is running unopposed in the Republican primary in Massachusetts, falsely declared in November 2020 – after media outlets had called the election for Biden – that Trump was the actual winner.\n\n“Our great president is the President elected for the next four years. We know it. They’re trying to steal an election because they can’t win or do anything right,” Campbell said on a November 2020 radio show during which she also promoted so-called “stop the steal” events.\n\nOn another November 2020 radio show, Campbell endorsed false conspiracy theories about election software and wrongly declared that “there’s no way, with all of the Trump rallies and the support that we had out there, that our candidates didn’t get more votes.” She also called for Republicans to adopt “dirty” tactics to combat the cheating she inaccurately claimed Democrats had done.\n\n“They did it again with the cheating of the counting of the ballots,” she said. “And they will always do stuff like that because they can’t win legally, and that’s why we’ve got to fight a lot harder. A lot harder, and a little dirty. Because they fight extremely dirty. It’s time to beat ‘em at their own game, and we can do that.”\n\nIn December 2020, after the Electoral College affirmed Biden’s victory, Campbell continued to support Trump’s efforts to overturn the outcome. And she repeated her false claim about a “stolen” election in a combative speech at the state Republican convention in May 2022.\n\nIn an interview with CNN in late July, Campbell did not back down from any of her previous claims. She called for audits of the 2020 election in all 50 states, and she repeatedly criticized the news media for supposed bias. She added, though, that she has “moved on from 2020 elections because we’re going into 2022.”\n\nDemocratic incumbent William Galvin and Democrat Tanisha Sullivan, a lawyer who is president of the Boston branch of the NAACP, are also running.\n\nMichigan: Kristina Karamo\n\nKristina Karamo, who is running for the Michigan Republican party's nomination for secretary of state, speaks at a rally hosted by former President Donald Trump on April 02, 2022 near Washington, Michigan. Scott Olson/Getty Images\n\nKristina Karamo, who was endorsed by Trump last year and Michigan’s Republican Party at its convention this year, falsely claimed in a social media video in December 2020 “Donald Trump won Michigan” – where Joe Biden actually beat Trump by more than 154,000 votes.\n\nKaramo, who has taught orientation and public speaking courses at a community college, rose to prominence in the aftermath of the 2020 election, when she claimed to have witnessed fraud while working as a Republican poll challenger monitoring the processing of absentee ballots in Detroit. (The Detroit Free Press found that her claims were based on misinterpretations of standard election processes; a Republican-led state Senate investigation into Michigan’s election found “no evidence of widespread or systematic fraud.”) She subsequently filed an affidavit as part of a lawsuit that attempted to get the Supreme Court to discard Biden’s victories in Michigan and three other states.\n\nKaramo also promoted false claims about Dominion elections technology even after these claims had been thoroughly debunked, baselessly declaring in December 2020 that there were “over 200,000 votes” in Michigan that were “potentially compromised” by Dominion software. After winning the backing of the state party this April, Karamo said she was not going to say “whether or not I think the election was stolen,” Sinclair Broadcast Group reported, but she went on to complain of “so many illegal things that occurred.”\n\nKaramo has to be chosen once more at a Republican convention later in August to become the official party nominee, but that is widely expected to happen after her dominant performance at the April endorsement convention. The Democratic candidate is incumbent Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson.\n\nKaramo’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMinnesota: Kim Crockett\n\nKim Crockett speaks during the first day of the Minnesota State Republican Convention, May 13, 2022, at the Mayo Civic Center in Rochester, Minn. Glen Stubbe/AP\n\nKim Crockett has said of the 2020 election in Minnesota: “I don’t think the word ‘lawless’ is too strong.” When an interviewer told her that he believes Minnesota’s election was “illegitimate,” she said she agreed.\n\nCrockett, a lawyer who won Minnesota’s Republican primary on Tuesday, has been particularly focused on state Democrats’ changes to election rules amid the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020. But she has also promoted a right-wing film that makes dubious claims about supposed 2020 cheating. She baselessly called absentee voting “frankly insecure.” And she questioned whether mail workers – who carry millions of ballots every federal election with very few problems – can be trusted to carry ballots given that “the postal union is a partisan player” in politics.\n\n“Makes you kind of go: ‘Huh.’ After 2020, you start looking at everything,” Crockett said in a June interview.\n\nAt a state Republican convention in May, Crockett’s campaign played a video that depicted liberal billionaire George Soros, who is Jewish, as a puppetmaster pulling the strings of incumbent Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon and prominent Democratic elections lawyer Marc Elias, who are also Jewish. The chairman of the state party issued an apology – but also claimed Crockett had been unaware the video included antisemitic tropes.\n\nCrockett has previously worked or volunteered for conservative organizations, including a voter organization that has described the 2020 election as “rigged” and a think tank that suspended her in 2019 for comments about Somali immigrants for which she soon apologized. (However, she said this year that she was “taken out of context” by The New York Times and “would say everything today that I said in 2019.”)\n\nIn late July, CNN sent the Crockett campaign an email offering a chance to comment for this article. The email outlined many of the facts the article planned to mention and explained that Crockett would be included on a list of nominees who had denied the legitimacy of the 2020 election.\n\nIn response, Crockett called and left a message saying she found the request “less than open to actually finding out more about me or my campaign” and that we should look into “who I really am as opposed to who other people have said I am.” She also said, however, that she only had time to send along written comments she had previously provided to another journalist.\n\nIn those previous comments, Crockett outlined her criticism of Simon’s policy decisions, recommended a right-wing commentator’s book about how the 2020 election was “rigged” and wrote: “The corporate media narrative is that 2020 was the most secure election in the history of voting. This is propaganda designed to stop the conversation. And they viciously attack anyone who dares to question that conclusion, calling us names like ‘election deniers’ instead of engaging us on election policy.”\n\nNevada: Jim Marchant\n\nJim Marchant, center, the GOP nominee for secretary of state in Nevada, speaks with people at a political event July 16, 2022, in Pahrump, Nev. John Locher/AP\n\nJim Marchant, a businessman and former Nevada state assemblyman, has promoted baseless conspiracy theories about not only the 2020 election but numerous past elections. Marchant has repeatedly and falsely claimed that Nevadans haven’t actually elected “anybody” for years – either “for decades” or particularly since 2006, when Republican future senator Dean Heller was serving as secretary of state.\n\n“And in Nevada and maybe other places all over the country – we haven’t in Nevada elected anybody since 2006. They have been installed by the deep state cabal,” Marchant falsely said in podcast comments that were reported in January by liberal organization Media Matters for America.\n\nMarchant has said he would not have certified Biden’s 33,596-vote victory in Nevada if he had been secretary of state in 2020, falsely claiming to NBC News that it is “almost statistically impossible that Joe Biden won.” Marchant attended the December 2020 event where other Nevada Republicans signed on to be phony Trump electors. And Marchant told The Guardian early this year that it was “very possible” he would be prepared to submit alternate electors in 2024.\n\nMarchant unsuccessfully tried to get a court to order a re-vote of his unsuccessful 2020 congressional race, which he lost by more than 16,000 votes. He has been so consistent in questioning Nevada’s elections system, which his campaign has wrongly described as “fraudulent,” that he even raised doubts about his own victory in the Republican secretary of state primary this June – telling the Las Vegas Review-Journal that he was “not really confident in the result” and that there “could have been anomalies.”\n\nMarchant’s Democratic opponent is Cisco Aguilar, a lawyer who was formerly a staffer for late US Senator Harry Reid. They are vying to replace term-limited Republican incumbent Barbara Cegavske.\n\nMarchant’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nNew Mexico: Audrey Trujillo\n\nAudrey Trujillo, candidate for secretary of state in New Mexico. From Audrey Trujillo/Facebook\n\nAudrey Trujillo, a conservative activist whose campaign biography says she has operated a daycare, falsely claimed in a Facebook interview in March that the 2020 election was “a huge, huge, I would say coup, to really unseat a president.” On her own Facebook page, she falsely wrote in June that “Trump’s election was stolen.”\n\nTrujillo, who ran unopposed in New Mexico’s Republican primary, falsely claimed in the March interview that votes were fraudulently switched from Republicans to Democrats in 2020 races at “all levels,” including a New Mexico US Senate race that was, in reality, won handily and fairly by a Democrat. She also falsely claimed in the interview that the US is “no better than any other communist country like Venezuela or any of these other states where our elections are being manipulated.”\n\nWhen CNN asked Trujillo’s campaign in late July for comment on these claims, it responded by asking where we had gotten them from. When we provided links to the claims, the campaign did not respond again.\n\nTrujillo’s Democratic opponent is incumbent Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver.\n\nSouth Dakota: Monae Johnson\n\nMonae Johnson, the Republican candidate for South Dakota secretary of state. Monae Johnson for Secretary of State\n\nMonae Johnson, a former employee of the South Dakota secretary of state’s office, repeatedly refused in an October 2022 interview with KELOLAND News to say that she accepted that Biden won the 2020 election legitimately. “I don’t want to be an election denier, but I wasn’t behind the scenes, I wasn’t in the office at the time, so,” she said. The reporter said, “Okay. I wanted to give you an opportunity to acknowledge that, if you’d like – that he did win. Do you acknowledge that?” Johnson responded, “I’m not going to acknowledge that, so, thank you.”\n\nJohnson also said “I’ve never denied any election,” and she added, “I know President Trump won South Dakota as a Republican state. Joe Biden won the swing states; he’s our current president. But I want to move on to the next elections, and I want to inspire people that their vote is going to be tabulated exactly like they vote, ‘cause that’s going to just bring the trust to the citizens of South Dakota.”\n\nRunning on an “election integrity” platform, Johnson defeated incumbent South Dakota Secretary of State Steve Barnett at a state Republican convention in June. Her Democratic opponent is Tom Cool, the former executive director of the Council on College Admission in South Dakota.\n\nJohnson’s campaign did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nVermont: H. Brooke Paige\n\nH. Brooke Paige stands in front of the Vermont Statehouse on Thursday, Aug. 16, 2018, in Montpelier, Vt. Lisa Rathke/AP/File\n\nH. Brooke Paige, a conservative activist in Vermont, ran unopposed for the Republican nomination for secretary of state while also running unopposed for the party nominations for state attorney general, auditor and treasurer. He plans to turn down the latter three nominations and focus on his secretary of state campaign, the Vermont website VTDigger reported.\n\nThe day after a mob of Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in 2021, Paige falsely claimed on his Facebook page that the left “stole” the election through a “subversive plan” involving “stuffing the ballot box and corrupting the tabulation of the election results.” He made other false election claims in subsequent posts.\n\nIn an interview with CNN in August, Paige acknowledged that Biden was the real winner in Vermont in 2020, but said the question of whether Biden legitimately won the presidency is “such a complex question,” hinging on how someone defines “legitimately,” that he could not offer a direct answer.\n\nPaige criticized state-level changes to voting rules in 2020, said he was disheartened by “anecdotal evidence” of suspicious behavior during the vote count – there is no indication of wrongdoing by any state’s vote-counters – and said his “biggest concern” was pro-Democratic media bias, which he argued had been a major contributor to Biden’s victory.\n\nDemocratic incumbent Jim Condos is retiring. The Democratic nominee is state Rep. Sarah Copeland Hanzas.\n\nWyoming: Chuck Gray\n\nWyoming state representative Chuck Gray in Augugust 2021. (Hannah Gaber-USA TODAY) Hannah Gaber/USA Today\n\nIn 2021, Wyoming state Rep. Chuck Gray falsely called Biden’s election “illegitimate,” falsely described the 2020 election as “the fraudulent election,” and told CNN that he “absolutely” believed that Trump won.\n\nIn December 2020, Gray urged Wyoming leaders to join the Texas-led lawsuit seeking to overturn Biden’s victories in four states. When Republican Gov. Mark Gordon decided against doing so, Gray wrote on Facebook that Gordon was “totally wrong.”\n\nGray won the Republican nomination for secretary of state in August 2022. In June and July, he wrote on Facebook that he had sponsored screenings of the right-wing film, also promoted by Crockett, that makes dubious claims about cheating in the 2020 election; Gray told Wyoming website Cowboy State Daily in June, baselessly, that the film demonstrates how the left “has stolen elections with ballot drop boxes.”\n\nGray did not respond to a request for comment in August.\n\nThis story has been updated to add Wyoming nominee Chuck Gray and South Dakota nominee Monae Johnson to the list and to include comment from Vermont nominee H. Brooke Paige.", "authors": ["Daniel Dale"], "publish_date": "2022/08/11"}]}

Workers with the Marine Resources Division are tending to thousands of larval flounder at a state hatchery in Gulf Shores, according to a news release from the agency. They hope to get between 1,000 and 5,000 fish from the hatchery in the first year, with a goal of releasing about 60,000 fish annually in a few years. Those fish would help add to a population of southern flounder that’s been falling since 2008. Scientists aren’t sure what is causing the decline. The state decreased bag limits for the fish this year and closed the season for the whole month of November to protect the flounder that were migrating through coastal bays on their way to winter spawning grounds.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The oldest son of President Donald Trump has received a permit to hunt and kill a grizzly bear in the state, officials said Monday. Donald Trump Jr. was granted the permit to hunt north and east of Nome later this year, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game said. The governor has a limited number of “dignitary” licenses and game tags that he can hand out, Fish and Game spokesman Rick Green said. Trump Jr. did not receive one. He instead applied for one of 27 licenses designated for out-of-state hunters in the area. Only two other hunters applied. Officials said permits near Nome likely are not in demand for a variety of reasons, including the remoteness of the area and the expense to get there. As an out-of-state resident, Trump Jr. must be accompanied by a licensed Alaska guide for his hunt.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Republicans in the state Senate have given initial approval to a measure that would ask voters to limit the population differences among Arizona’s 30 legislative districts, over opposition from Democrats. The measure by Sen. J.D. Mesnard would require the state’s redistricting commission to create districts with a maximum difference of 5,000 people. Currently, a 10% difference is considered constitutional, meaning districts can vary by about 20,000 people. Democrats argued the change would greatly affect the ability of tribes and minority communities to elect representatives of their choice. They also said putting in hard rules like Mesnard proposes minimizes other factors the state’s Independent Redistricting Commission is required to consider, including keeping communities of interest together if possible.\n\nArkansas\n\nEureka Springs: A cemetery will continue allowing individuals or groups to place Confederate flags on grave markers unless a family member of the deceased objects, despite complaints the flag is a racist symbol. Eureka Springs’ cemetery commission approved an amendment earlier this month also requiring anyone wanting to place flags or plaques to get permission from the cemetery superintendent, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Glenna Booth, a member of the commission, said the amendment was her idea. “I just tried to come up with something that would be fair to everyone,” Booth said. Gloria Stevens, sexton at the cemetery, said there are about 47 Confederate veterans and 97 Union veterans among the 4,600 burials there. She said the cemetery was established in 1889, so none of those veterans died during the Civil War.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: In their latest bid to combat the state’s affordable housing crisis, lawmakers on Monday announced a package of bills to limit development fees that can add tens of thousands of dollars to the price of a new home. However, local governments depend heavily on the fees, which typically are used to pay for schools, roads and parks. Lawmakers said they were discussing those needs but have not yet decided how the fees might be replaced. The fees are “vital to local government’s ability to pay for the infrastructure that residents living in new developments need,” Chris Lee, legislative representative for the California State Association of Counties, said in a statement. Development-related fees, also known as impact fees, can provide up to a third of some cities’ budgets, according to a report last year by the University of California, Berkeley, Terner Center for Housing Innovation.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: Thousands of 17-year-olds are eligible to vote in the upcoming presidential primary for the first time under a new state law. The law allows 17-year-olds to cast ballots in spring primaries if they turn 18 before November’s general election. At least seven states and Washington, D.C., have similar laws. According to the Colorado Secretary of State’s Office, about 24,000 teens are eligible to vote in the March 3 primary under the change, a small number in a state with 3.4 million voters, the Sentinel Colorado reports. Three Overland High School students who were interviewed about the new law said they did not know about their ability to vote until a few weeks ago and figure most of their peers were not aware either.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A state legislative committee voted Monday to advance a bill that would eliminate the state’s religious exemption for certain childhood vaccines, despite vocal opposition from hundreds of parents and children who packed the Connecticut Capitol complex in hopes of persuading lawmakers to defeat it. The legislation narrowly cleared the General Assembly’s Public Health Committee by a vote of 14-11, prompting chants of “we will remember in November” after the tally was announced. Some opponents of the bill booed and shouted at the legislators who had voted for the measure as they left the hearing room and tried to get into elevators to their offices. Two Democrats joined Republicans in opposing the bill, which now awaits further action in the House of Representatives. It’s considered one of the most contentious issues of the three-month legislative session, fueling concerns about the safety of vaccines and the curtailment of parental and religious rights.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A judge has rejected a challenge by state environmental officials to rules issued by utility regulators regarding renewable energy requirements. The judge on Monday ruled that the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control has no standing to challenge regulations issued by the Public Service Commission. Superior Court Judge Ferris Wharton agreed with the commission and the state Division of the Public Advocate that DNREC had no standing to sue because it was neither a “person” nor “aggrieved” under Delaware’s Administrative Procedures Act. Environmental secretary Shawn Garvin did not respond to an email seeking comment, but a spokesman said the agency is reviewing the decision and will discuss its options. The ruling is the latest development in a long-running legal dispute over which state agency has authority to develop regulations regarding how minimum renewable energy purchase requirements can be frozen if they become too costly for ratepayers.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A man who was injured while assembling a construction crane was safely rescued from a high angle in D.C. The man, who wasn’t identified, suffered a serious injury to his leg Saturday while working on the crane about 230 feet off the ground, news outlets report. District of Columbia Fire and Emergency Medical Services used a second crane to reach the man and provide initial treatment. He was then placed in a basket and lowered to the ground, according to videos shared by the department. The worker was taken to the hospital for an injury not considered life-threatening.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Myers: Promising to be a worldwide first, a new Southwest Florida marina could set the standard for future boat storage. Set to open in April on Fort Myers Beach, Gulf Star Marina is being branded as the “world’s first SMART Marina” due to using its ASAR, or automated, storage and retrieval system. “The entire world is watching,” said Todd Carroll, one of the marina’s owners and president of Carroll Properties. “We believe it has the ability to change the way we store boats. It’s just a much better way.” The technology was developed by Austria-based LTW Intralogistics, which has been creating automated systems for warehouses used by companies like IKEA for decades, Carroll said. But it’s never been done in a marina before, according to Carroll. The railed system ditches the diesel-powered forklift often used in dry storage facilities and replaces it with an automated, electric-powered storage crane and shuttles.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State senators have approved a measure that would increase the fee for dumping coal ash in Georgia. The Senate passed Senate Bill 123 on Monday by a vote of 52-2, sending it to the House for more work. The measure would raise the fee for dumping coal ash from $1 a ton to $2.50 a ton, equaling what it costs to dispose of other kinds of garbage at Georgia landfills. Lawmakers raised the fee for other garbage in 2018 but left the fee for coal ash at $1. Coal ash has become a flashpoint in the current General Assembly session and in the state at large. A 2018 report by the Environmental Integrity Project and Earthjustice found contaminated groundwater near 11 of 12 coal-fired power plants. The refuse contains heavy metals and other contaminates that can leach into groundwater. Near Georgia Power Co.’s Plant Scherer in Juliette, environmentalists have been conducting tests that have found residents have contaminated well water.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A research report has predicted the state may be hit by the economic fallout of a new virus, negatively affecting the tourism industry. The University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization said the spread of COVID-19 could undermine previous predictions that 2020 would be a better year for tourism than 2019. The organization’s latest quarterly forecast on the state’s visitor industry released Monday said the virus that started in China has changed its previous calculation. “I think if it hadn’t been for this virus outbreak, it probably would have been better – mostly because the global economy was sort of repairing itself,” said Carl Bonham, the organization’s executive director. “Trade tensions had eased up a little bit. We were expecting some recovery in 2020, and now that hope has sort of been dashed.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Visitors to the state who are 18 and older and can legally possess firearms would be allowed to carry a concealed handgun within city limits under legislation that headed to the House on Monday. The House State Affairs Committee voted 11-3 to approve the bill brought forward by Republican Rep. Christy Zito. Republicans on the committee backed the measure, while all the Democrats voted against it. Idaho residents 18 and older are allowed to carry a concealed handgun within city limits in Idaho without a permit or training following a new law that went into place last summer. The legislation would extend that to any legal resident of the United States or a U.S. armed services member. Zito said the legislation is intended to clear up confusion. Opponents say allowing teenagers to carry a concealed weapon without any required training within city limits is a bad idea and could lead to shootings.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The sale of recreational marijuana in the state generated $7.3 million in cannabis tax revenue last month, the Department of Revenue announced Monday. The department also reported that an additional $3.1 million was generated in retail sales tax revenue. Dispensaries across the state sold nearly $40 million in recreational pot last month. Toi Hutchinson, an adviser to Gov. J.B. Pritzker on cannabis control, said the goal of Illinois’ legal cannabis industry is to build a socially equitable program to help communities most harmed by the nation’s war on drugs. “Revenue raised in this first month will soon begin flowing back into those communities to begin repairing the damage done by the failed policies of the past and creating new opportunities for those who have been left behind for far too long,” Hutchinson said.\n\nIndiana\n\nBunker Hill: The aircraft museum at Grissom Air Reserve Base is seeking a $100,000 boost from local government toward a building to protect and display one of the few surviving Cold War-era B-58 Hustler bombers. Grissom Air Museum leaders are asking for Miami County economic development fund money as they plan the estimated $700,000 exhibit space featuring the bomber, dozens of which were stationed at the Indiana base in the 1960s. The B-58 was the U.S. Air Force’s first operational supersonic bomber, and only seven remain out of the 116 built, the Kokomo Tribune reports. The museum has raised more than $100,000 toward the project and hopes to build a roof over the Hustler this year while continuing to raise money, museum Director Tom Jennings said. The project plans call for a display of artifacts about the bomber’s history and a loft area allowing visitors to look down on the plane. The Miami County Council could vote on the funding request next month.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The city is considering asking businesses seeking city tax incentives to also provide housing options if they employ low-income workers. It’s just one proposal for how the city could use its policies, zoning ordinances and financial incentives to ensure its mix of housing includes options that are affordable for its workforce. A workforce housing study released in May found central Iowa is short 57,179 new housing units for the region’s anticipated job growth in the next 20 years. Nearly half of those new workers would need housing priced below $175,000 for an owner-occupied home or below $1,250 a month for a rental. The Des Moines Area Association of Realtors reported in December that the median home price in its listings was $229,000, while CBRE/Hubbell Commercial, a brokerage that tracks the industry, said median rent across the metro is $935 a month. Downtown, it is $1,189 per month.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State legislators aren’t ready to declare that marijuana possession never should be a felony, rejecting proposals Monday to lower penalties for third-time offenders and to release others from prison. The House Corrections and Juvenile Justice Committee voted 7-4 against a bill that would make possessing marijuana a misdemeanor, no matter how many times someone was convicted. Kansas law currently says a third conviction is a felony that can be punished by up to 14 months in prison, though offenders often receive probation. The bill also initially said offenders now in prison for marijuana possession would be released, but the committee removed that provision from the measure. Supporters of lessening the penalties for repeated marijuana possession accepted the change to give the bill a better chance of passing. Yet the measure failed to clear the GOP-controlled committee anyway.\n\nKentucky\n\nCold Spring: A Northern Kentucky city has become the third municipality in 2020 to adopt a Fairness Ordinance. The leaders of Cold Spring, near Cincinnati, voted 4-1 on Monday night in favor of protecting LGBTQ people from discrimination in housing, employment and other accommodations. Cold Spring is the fifth city in Northern Kentucky over the past year to pass such an ordinance, according to the Fairness Campaign. It’s the 19th such community in the commonwealth. Councilman Adam Sandfoss, who introduced the ordinance, said in a statement that “I’m proud of our city’s vote for equal rights tonight. We want folks to know Cold Spring is a community everyone can call home, and I hope our action will inspire more Northern Kentucky communities – maybe even Campbell County – to adopt similar protections for all their residents.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A new group focused on Mardi Gras-season parade safety will begin work late this week or early next week, the police chief said Monday in discussing the city’s response to the recent deaths of two people in float-related accidents. Suggestions from family members of the victims and others – such as setting up barricades along the entire length of the parade routes, rather than only at major intersections, and mounting accordion barriers between sections of tandem floats – will be discussed, Superintendent Shaun Ferguson told a news conference. Ferguson noted that setting up barricades along parade routes that are 5 to 7 miles long would be time-consuming and require many workers. He also said additional workers would be need to be on hand to move such barricades out of the way for any emergency vehicles.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A Republican lawmaker is hoping to pass a bill he said would protect children in the state from unauthorized surveillance by drones. The proposal from Rep. John Andrews of Paris would create a new state law the legislator said in a statement would “prevent unauthorized drone spying on a person in their domicile where they have an expectation of privacy.” Andrews is asking the state’s Legislative Council to allow his proposal to go through despite the fact a legislation deadline has passed. He said the law would establish penalties for people convicted of surveilling underage children. The Legislative Council is expected to discuss whether to consider the proposal this session on Thursday.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Workers would be able to take 12 weeks off work to care for a new child or an ill family member through a new state-administered insurance pool that would provide partial wage replacement, under legislation that received a hearing in a House committee Monday. The measure would create a fund supported by weekly employer and employee contributions. Each would contribute half, based on a sliding scale. An employee with the state’s average wage would contribute $3.62 a week, said Del. Kris Valderrama, a Democrat sponsoring the bill. “It is limited in its scope, but it will allow people a brief respite and help to make ends meet, at least temporarily,” Valderrama said. But opponents said it would create the potential for up to 24 weeks off in some circumstances. Opponents said while they were not fully opposed to the concept, the Maryland measure was too burdensome.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: A local museum has received a gift of more than 1,600 photographic works it says will enhance what is already one of the leading collections of Asian photography in the U.S. and Europe. The gift to the Peabody Essex Museum in Salem comes from the Joy of Giving Something Foundation, known for its work that explores the intersection of photography and social issues. The collection features the works of 123 artists, primarily of Chinese and Japanese descent or who worked in eastern Asia, from 1930 to the present day. The museum already has a roughly 5,000-piece collection of 19th-century photography. “These photographs deepen our museum’s 220-year relationship with East Asian culture and offer a compelling complement to our historic collection of Asian photography,” Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, the museum’s deputy director, said in a statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Tuesday that the state will have a mobility officer to coordinate all initiatives related to self-driving and connected cars, an effort she said will ensure Michigan is the go-to place for testing and producing vehicles of the future. While speaking at the MICHAuto Summit in Detroit, Whitmer signed an executive directive to create the Michigan Office of Future Mobility and Electrification within the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity, effectively immediately. It will be led by a chief mobility officer whose name probably will be announced in April, Whitmer said. She also signed an executive order to establish the Michigan Council on Future Mobility and Electrification, an advisory group that will replace but function similarly to one created by a 2016 law. The council will be housed within the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity instead of the Department of Transportation.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Law enforcement officers should get better training in de-escalation skills and in dealing with people experiencing mental health crises, a working group on reducing police-involved deadly force encounters recommended Monday. Minnesota’s two highest-ranking black law enforcement officials – Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington – formed the working group last summer in the wake of several high-profile fatal shootings of black men by police officers, including those of Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. Minnesota has had more than 100 officer-involved shootings over the past five years, Harrington said, adding that many members were surprised to learn 60% happened outside the Twin Cities metropolitan area, affecting nearly every county in the state. Ellison said the group also learned that between 30% and 50% of the people killed in encounters with police were having mental health crises.\n\nMississippi\n\nBrandon: A routine road closure for a transportation worker turned into the quick delivery of a baby on the interstate. Wayne Evans, a superintendent with the Mississippi Department of Transportation, was getting ready to shut down a lane Monday morning on I-20 near Brandon when a car pulled up with its emergency lights flashing, and two women got out of the vehicle. “They were in desperate need for something,” Evans said in an interview shared online by MDOT. When Evans approached the car, he found a third woman in labor in the backseat. “It was going to happen pretty quick, and I knew they weren’t gonna make it to the hospital,” he said. So Evans got a first aid kit from his truck, put on a pair of gloves and helped deliver the baby boy. “He put his gloves on and got his umbilical cord from around his neck, and he helped me deliver,” new mom Desire’e Thomas told WAPT-TV. Evans said he believes his Marine Corps training kicked in.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A new effort in St. Louis County will make the overdose-reversing antidote naloxone more readily available to the public, in hopes of reducing the high number of opioid overdose deaths in the state’s largest county. Democratic County Executive Sam Page on Monday announced details of a program that will make naloxone available free of charge to community groups and the public during regular business hours at the county’s John C. Murphy Health Center in Berkeley. County officials said the site was chosen because of its location in north St. Louis County, the area hit hardest by the epidemic. U.S. health officials believe the increasing availability of naloxone, commonly known under the brand name Narcan, is partly responsible for the first drop in overdose deaths in nearly 30 years.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: An investigation has started after seven trumpeter swans were found dead at a pond near the city, wildlife officials said. The state Department of Fish, Wildlife and Parks received a report of dead swans between the towns of Belgrade and Manhattan on Friday, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. Biologists and wardens collected the animals’ bodies Saturday, department spokesman Morgan Jacobson said. “We still don’t have a cause of death,” Jacobson said, adding that the agency has not ruled out any causes including poaching or the swans eating moldy grain. Trumpeter swans are on the state’s species of concern list, according to Montana Field Guides’ website. The list helps resource managers make decisions about species conservation and data collection priorities. Trumpeter swans are the largest waterfowl in North America, experts said. They can be up to 5 feet (in length, have a wingspan up to about 7 feet and weigh over 20 pounds.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The University of Nebraska at Omaha has been chosen to lead a team of universities and other partners in studying counterterrorism and terrorism prevention, federal officials said. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Science and Technology Directorate announced Monday that the university has won a $3.65 million-a-year grant for 10 years. The university will spearhead a consortium of academic, industry, government and laboratory partners in trying to find ways to prevent or counteract threats to the nation’s people, infrastructure and economy, the directorate said. That consortium constitutes what the directorate describes as a center of excellence. It will be the directorate’s 10th center of excellence, said directorate spokesman John Verrico.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: State officials issued another marijuana health advisory regarding products that were on shelves at 30 dispensaries in Nevada last month. The Nevada Department of Taxation issued an advisory late Friday concerning 20 products that failed microbial testing conducted by an independent lab. The products were sold in the form of raw cannabis buds and raw cannabis that had been pre-rolled into a joint. The products came from six different cultivators in Nevada and failed a variety of mold, yeast and bacteria testing. All of the products were initially tested and passed by Cannex LLC, a Las Vegas marijuana testing lab that the taxation department suspended in December as part of an investigation. The products were on the shelves between Oct. 25 and Jan. 16 at dispensaries across the state. There are no known reports of illness, according to the taxation officials.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Lawmakers are working on a bill that would require more insurance coverage for people in the state who get tick-borne disease testing. Rep. Megan Murray, a first-term Democrat from Amherst, said her constituents have told her that doctors often prioritize testing for Lyme disease after a tick bite, New Hampshire Public Radio reports. Murray’s bill, which has bipartisan co-sponsors, would require insurers to cover additional advanced, broad tests that could catch Lyme and other more rare diseases. Murray said she hopes that testing for these diseases earlier will prevent delayed diagnoses, as well as lower costs for patients and insurers.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHoboken: The city, one of the areas in the state hit hardest by Superstorm Sandy, is making progress toward completing a large public park that will double as a reservoir for nearly 2 million gallons of storm water to prevent it from flooding city streets. On Monday, officials announced the awarding of a $14 million federal grant to continue construction of the 5-acre park, which sits in the northwest corner of the city on the former site of a chemical plant, about a mile from the Lincoln Tunnel into New York. The project has been under construction for about five months and is expected to be completed in late 2022. The park will feature green space, athletic fields, an ice skating rink and other amenities. A 30-foot-deep underground tank will hold up to a million gallons of water that normally would collect in city streets, Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla said Monday.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: It was the 1970s when the state last increased the amount of bond money that oil and gas companies are required to put up before drilling. As development continues at a record pace, State Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard says it’s time to take another look. Legislation that called for a study of the issue stalled during the recent session, but Garcia Richard announced just a day after lawmakers adjourned that she’s moving forward with the effort. She said her office has the funding to begin the work. The review could take months. Given all the infrastructure and development on state trust lands, officials said the amount of bonding needed to ensure taxpayers aren’t left paying for any cleanup and restoration after oil, gas or other minerals are extracted is currently unknown. Garcia Richard described it as an urgent issue that could leave “taxpayers and our state trust land beneficiaries on the hook for potentially millions of dollars.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: New York State Police say they plan to go forward with a body camera pilot program for state troopers, a move that would change the agency’s status as one of the few primary state law enforcement agencies in the nation without body or dashboard cameras. Kevin Bruen, first deputy superintendent of the New York State Police, disclosed the plan for a pilot program Monday at the state Capitol. He did not provide details of the plan, such as how many troopers will receive the devices and how much money the pilot program might cost. Patrol cameras are regularly praised by law enforcement experts as ways to increase transparency and hold officers and citizens accountable. Equipping state police with body cameras has received support from New York Attorney General Letitia James. Some state lawmakers have also expressed support for bringing the technology to the agency.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of a legislative session Republicans quickly called in 2016 to limit the power of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper before he could take office now want the state’s highest court to hear their case. Lawyers for Common Cause and ten citizens filed an appeal petition with the state Supreme Court on Tuesday, about a month after the Court of Appeals upheld the legality of the three-day session in December 2016. Republicans in charge of the House and Senate approved a pair of measures during the session that weakened Cooper’s power as governor. Those who sued said the fleetness of GOP leaders calling the session and pushing through legislation violated their right in the North Carolina Constitution to “instruct their representatives.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: A city building dubbed Sandbag Central will soon be open for business as Fargo leaders prepare for spring flooding along the Red River, the city administrator said Monday night. Bruce Grubb told city commissioners of plans to fill 250,000 sandbags in order to protect the city to 41 feet, which would be 23 feet over flood stage. The latest outlook from the National Weather Service shows a 10% probability that the river will reach 39 feet in the Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, area. KFGO radio reports Grubb called the chance of a severe flood “a flip of the coin” and said the city would rather “err on the side of caution.” Volunteers filled hundreds of thousands of sandbags last year for anticipated flooding that never materialized. Sandbag Central is located in a building that is normally a parking garage for garbage trucks. Plans are to begin sandbag operations March 10.\n\nOhio\n\nPowell: Two cheetah cubs have been born through in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer to a surrogate mother for the first time, zoo officials announced Monday. The male and female cubs were born to 3-year-old Izzy at the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium on Wednesday, the zoo said in a statement. A team observed the births through a remote camera and is continuing to monitor Izzy and the cubs. The biological mother of the cubs is 6-year-old Kibibi, who has never reproduced and is too old to easily become pregnant naturally. Kibibi’s eggs were extracted and then fertilized in a Columbus Zoo laboratory Nov. 19. The early-stage embryos were implanted into Izzy on Nov. 21, and an ultrasound revealed she was pregnant with two fetuses about a month later. Dr. Randy Junge, the zoo’s vice president of animal health, said this development could have broader implications for managing the species’ population in the future.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Children under the age of 17 would be required to wear seat belts in vehicle back seats under a bill narrowly passed Monday by the state Senate. The bill, which passed on a 25-22 vote, changes current law that requires only children younger than age 8 to wear seat belts in the back seat. “The bottom line is children are being hurt and dying simply because we don’t require them to wear a seat belt,” said Sen. Roland Pederson, a Burlington Republican. Pederson said Oklahoma is the nation’s only state that does not require seat belts for children older than age 8. The measure now heads to the House, where a similar bill is pending.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: House Republicans walked out from the state Capitol on Tuesday, joining their Senate colleagues in protest of a greenhouse gas emissions cap-and-trade bill. “Oregon House Republicans are taking a stand, with working families, in opposing cap and trade and this rigged process,” House Republican Leader Christine Drazan, R-Canby, said in a statement. House Speaker Tina Kotek, D-Portland, said she has and will continue to make an effort toward compromise, but that isn’t possible if Republicans are not in the Capitol. In a stream of statements released Tuesday morning, House Republicans cited the process of crafting Senate Bill 1530, as well as the policy itself, as their reasons for leaving. Republicans have said SB 1530 would increase the cost of living in rural Oregon and do little to combat climate change. Democrats say that cap-and-trade is the only way to reduce the state’s carbon emissions and that the bill has protections for rural Oregon.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: An inmate awaiting trial in a shooting case wants a federal judge to release him from solitary confinement in a central Pennsylvania county jail, where he has been confined for more than a year because he refuses to cut dreadlocks that hold religious significance for him. The hand-written lawsuit filed in October by Eric S. McGill Jr. against three senior administrators at the Lebanon County Correctional Facility shifted gears last week, when a set of lawyers produced an amended complaint that warned McGill’s mental health is deteriorating. It said McGill, 27, of Lebanon, an adherent of Rastafarianism, suffers anxiety attacks two or three times a week, and they are usually triggered by thoughts of his jail conditions and placement in solitary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Two state lawmakers are proposing to raise taxes on residents earning more than $500,000 annually to pay for education. Democratic state Sen. Ryan Pearson, of Cumberland, and Democratic Rep. Gregg Amore, of East Providence, are proposing a new tax bracket for income earned higher than $500,000. It would add 1 percentage point to the 5.99% top rate, with incremental revenue directed to an account for funding education from kindergarten through grade 12, they said. They emphasized that their proposal would not affect any resident earning less than $500,000 annually. Amore said the state needs a commitment of resources to pay for reforms to the education system. Pearson said that by asking the top 1% of earners in Rhode Island to contribute more, there will be funding to ensure that all Rhode Islanders can get a good education.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: An April performance by the Hong Kong Ballet at the Peace Center has been canceled due to concerns related to the coronavirus outbreak. The ballet was set to perform “ALICE (in wonderland)” on April 21 with the help of dozens of local ballet students. The company postponed its upcoming U.S. tour due to the virus. Hong Kong Ballet Artistic Director Septime Webre said the group is putting the health and safety of its dancers and the general public first but is committed to returning to South Carolina in the coming seasons. Auditions were held in late January to choose local ballet students to fill roles in the show, and rehearsals had already begun. Anyone who’s already purchased tickets will automatically receive a refund based on their method of payment, according to a release from the Peace Center.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State lawmakers on Tuesday rejected a proposal to stop schools from requiring students to get vaccinations. A House committee heard emotional testimony from parents on both sides of the issue but decided to effectively kill the bill, saying it would have resulted in decreased vaccination rates and could have caused outbreaks in vaccine-preventable diseases. Supporters of the bill said South Dakota is the first state Legislature this year to consider a proposal to end school vaccine requirements, but the issue is now being carried by lawmakers in a few other states. They hoped that despite the bill’s defeat, their doubts about vaccinations would gain credence in the state. Gov. Kristi Noem opposed the bill and told reporters last week that vaccinations have saved millions of lives. Doctors, as well as lobbyists from medical groups, hospitals, business groups, universities and schools, also lined up to testify against the bill.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state on Monday set two new execution dates, days after putting to death its seventh inmate in the past year and a half. The Tennessee Supreme Court ordered an Oct. 8 execution date for Byron Black and a Dec. 3 execution date for Pervis Payne. Black was convicted by a Nashville court of murdering his girlfriend Angela Clay and her daughters, Latoya, 9, and Lakesha, 6, at their home in 1988. Prosecutors said he shot the three during a jealous rage. Black was on work release at the time for shooting and wounding Clay’s estranged husband. Payne was sentenced to death in Memphis for the 1987 fatal stabbing of Charisse Christopher and her daughter, Lacie Jo, in what prosecutors described as a “drug-induced frenzy.” Christopher’s son, Nicholas, who was 3 at the time, was stabbed but survived. Attorneys for the inmates have argued that both men are intellectually disabled and mentally ill.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: This week the state Department of Transportation could approve a request from Gov. Greg Abbott to rent a state-owned temporary campsite for the homeless to an Austin nonprofit. But the residents have another idea: They want the governor to lease the property directly to them. In an open letter to Abbott, those who have taken shelter at the campsite they are calling Camp R.A.T.T., which stands for Responsible Adult Transition Town, said they would be willing to pay $1 a month per resident to rent the land. Abbott is offering a $1-a-month lease to ATX Helps, a nonprofit tied to the Austin Chamber of Commerce and the Downtown Austin Alliance. “We believe this is a good idea for several reasons: it gives the residents here a sense of responsibility, and provides the basis of stewardship,” the letter said. “Also, we aren’t lazy and aren’t expecting a hand-out. It’s our intention to get back into the world.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Most abortions would be banned in the state under a new proposal at the Legislature – one that abortion-rights advocates say would create fear and uncertainty even though it wouldn’t be enforced unless the legal landscape changes. The proposal would make it a felony punishable by up to 15 years in prison to perform an abortion except in cases of rape, incest or serious threat to the health of the mother. The bill contains a so-called trigger clause, so the measure wouldn’t go into effect unless the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 case that legalized abortion in the country. The trigger clause also means it likely could not be immediately challenged in court. Utah passed a ban after 18 weeks last year, and lawmakers are considering additional abortion-related proposal this year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state House on Tuesday voted to override Republican Gov. Phil Scott’s veto of a bill that would increase the minimum wage. The vote was 100 to 49. The Senate, which has a Democrat majority, voted 24-6 in favor of the veto override earlier this month. The original bill did not pass the Democrat-led House with the two-thirds margin that would be needed to override the governor’s veto, but some lawmakers changed their votes Tuesday. Scott has said that raising the minimum wage to $12.55 by 2022 could end up hurting the people it is intended to help.\n\nVirginia\n\nFredericksburg: A judge has hit the pause button on the city’s plans to remove a 175-year-old slave auction block from a downtown street corner. The Free Lance-Star reports Circuit Court Judge Sarah Deneke has agreed to a 15-day stay of her order to remove the block in Fredericksburg. Her order allows a business owner who is challenging the removal to ask the Virginia Supreme Court to take on the case. E.D. Cole Building LLC owns a commercial building across the street from the auction block. The firm and the owner of a nearby restaurant have argued that they’ll lose business from tourist traffic if the auction block is removed. The judge already ruled that city officials have the authority to approve the removal the block. The city had previously placed traffic cones around the block with plans to move it before the business owner urged the court to stop the city.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Weekly benefits under the state’s new paid family leave law are now taking up to 10 weeks to process because of the high number of people applying for the program. Under the law, eligible workers receive 12 weeks’ paid time off for the birth or adoption of a child or for a serious medical condition of the worker or the worker’s family member, or 16 weeks for a combination of both. An additional two weeks may be used if there is a serious health condition with a pregnancy. Weekly benefits under the new law are calculated based on a percentage of the employee’s wages and the state’s weekly average wage – which is now $1,255 – though the weekly amount paid out is capped at $1,000. In the first six weeks since the program went live last month, more than 30,000 people have applied, more than triple the amount that was projected in that same time frame, according to the Washington Employment Security Department.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Republican state lawmakers moved forward Monday on a sweeping tax overhaul that could slash county government budgets, though it appears likely Democrats may derail the plan. Senators voted 17-16 to pass a GOP proposal to cut taxes on manufacturers and personal vehicles while raising sales taxes and taxes on tobacco products. But still looming is an accompanying resolution, which requires a two-thirds majority vote, to set the plan in motion. “This is a bad plan; it’s going to hurt West Virginians,” said Sen. Mike Romano, a Democrat from Harrison County. Many county leaders oppose the tax overhaul and worry it could result in the loss of millions of dollars in tax revenues that play an integral part of their budgets. Jonathan Adler, executive director of the West Virginia Association of Counties, said the plan raised the potential for devastating cuts to local law enforcement and courts.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Authorities say three people died in snowmobile accidents last weekend, boosting the number of deaths to 17 for the season. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources said all three of the victims were from Illinois. Two of them died after striking trees, and one person was killed after being struck by another snowmobile rider. There have been nine fatalities this month. That includes a 15-year-old Wisconsin boy who failed to stop at an intersection of a public trail and highway and collided with a car, a 28-year-old Wisconsin man who struck a fence on private land and a 29-year-old woman who struck several trees. Alcohol, excess speed and driver inexperience are the leading causes of snowmobile accidents, according to the DNR.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: The National Park Service is about to begin facility and trail work totaling almost $4 million in Devils Tower National Monument in northeastern Wyoming. The work will include making an overlook trail more accessible to people who are in wheelchairs or have other physical limitations. Plans also call for improving access to restrooms, a visitor center and a trail to the base of Devils Tower. Parking lots, visitor center exhibits and trail signs also will see improvements. Funding will come from a variety of sources including a portion of entrance fees, the Gillette News-Record reports. “It’s been a long time planned and a long time coming to make sure that all these funding sources came together for us,” said Nick Myers, the national monument’s chief of interpretation. Work is expected to begin this week, weather permitting, and should be done by November, Myers said.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/08/giant-joystick-hyena-health-moose-loose-news-around-states/49327113/", "title": "Giant joystick, hyena health: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey on Friday signed employment protections for workers who claim a religious or health reason for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19. The Republican governor signed the legislation a day after it was approved by the Alabama Legislature as GOP-led states turn to lawsuits and legislation to fight federal vaccine requirements that they call an infringement on personal liberties. Ivey also signed into law a separate bill requiring parental consent for minors to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The new law says employers in Alabama can’t fire workers for being unvaccinated if the employee returns a new standardized state form to claim a religious or medical exemption. President Joe Biden in September announced contractors who do business with the federal government must have workforces vaccinated, with no option to test out. The Alabama law will also affect companies, such as medical providers, who wanted to independently place vaccination requirements on workers. The bill drew opposition from the Business Council of Alabama, which said it would put federal contractors in a no-win situation. Democrats said Republicans were putting both jobs and public health in jeopardy for the sake of scoring political points.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Department of the Interior said the first two federal land allotments to Alaska Native Vietnam War-era veterans have been finalized. Frank Nanooruk and Richard Boskoffsky received the first allotments under a 2019 law passed by Congress, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. The allotments are east of Goodnews Bay in southwest Alaska, agency spokesperson Richard Packer said by email Friday. The Interior Department said the allotments were finalized Thursday. Under the 1906 Alaska Native Allotment Act, Alaska Natives were allowed to apply for up to 160 acres of land. Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office has said that the program’s restrictions kept many from applying until the 1960s. There was a push to urge Alaska Natives to apply for lands if they had not already done so before a 1971 law took effect. But that period overlapped with the Vietnam War. A 1998 federal law allowed veterans to apply for land, but the provisions were seen as restrictive. The 2019 law lifted use and occupancy requirements that were part of prior laws and made lands available until late 2025, the Bureau of Land Management has said. “We have a sacred obligation to America’s veterans,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Education advocates did not collect enough valid signatures to give voters a chance to repeal a new state law exempting some business owners from a tax increase on the wealthy to boost school funding, a lawyer for Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said Friday. The measure is one of two tax-cut bills signed this year by Gov. Doug Ducey that school-funding advocates are trying to refer to the 2022 ballot. County election officials reviewing a sample of the 123,500 submitted signatures found too many were invalid. Petitioners needed 118,823 valid signatures. The failure to collect enough signatures is not likely to matter much, however, because the Arizona Supreme Court has signaled that the entire tax increase, approved by voters last year as Proposition 208, is likely to be struck down. In addition to the tax exemption for business owners, education groups want voters to have a say on a new flat income tax rate of 2.5%, which would cut taxes by about $2 billion a year, primarily benefiting the wealthy. They turned in significantly more signatures to refer that measure. Lawyers for the Free Enterprise Club, a conservative advocacy group, argued in court Friday that the constitution does not allow referrals for measures that provide for “support and maintenance” of state government and that tax cut bills fall into that category.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A former state senator convicted in 2018 of corruption-related charges is pushing forward with a request for a new trial. Attorney Lee D. Short of North Little Rock filed notice Wednesday that his client, former Sen. Jon Woods, will take his request for a new trial to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Woods was sentenced to more than 18 years in prison on 15 counts of conspiracy, fraud and money laundering for a bribery scheme in which prosecutors said he and another Republican legislator were taking kickbacks from state grants meant to be directed to nonprofit groups. The scheme involved at least $20 million taken from taxpayers or the nonprofit. The request for a retrial comes after claims that the FBI coerced former state Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson into giving incriminating information about Woods that lead to his investigation and subsequent conviction. According to the Democrat-Gazette, the information Hutchinson gave the FBI should have been protected by attorney-client privilege. Four additional state legislators pleaded guilty or were convicted on corruption-related charges in the investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDiamond Bar: Southern California air regulators on Friday approved new restrictions on area oil refineries and other factories that could remove tons of smog-forming pollutants from the air. The board of the South Coast Air Quality Management District adopted rule changes requiring emissions limits on oxides of nitrogen that will affect nine refineries and seven plants that produce asphalt, biofuel plants, hydrogen and sulfuric acid. Oxides of nitrogen, collectively known as NOx, form when fuel is burned at high temperatures. The gases can be produced by cars and industrial sources such as refineries and power plants. They are a key ingredient in producing ozone pollution. The new rules will reduce NOx emissions by about 8 tons per day over the next 14 years, with nearly half the reductions expected by 2023, and will go a long way to helping the region meet some federal air quality standards by 2031, the AQMD said. The rules apply to some 300 pieces of combustion equipment at the facilities, such as boilers and gas turbines. The rules, which will be implemented over a decade, provide two ways of meeting the new requirements and also ban refineries from purchasing credits to offset pollution they produce. The total cost of implementing the new rules is projected at about $2.3 billion, but the reduction in health costs from pollution is expected to be about $2.6 billion, according to a September AQMD study session.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two hyenas at the Denver Zoo have tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the first confirmed cases among the animals worldwide, a national veterinary lab announced Friday. Samples from a variety of animals at the zoo, including the spotted hyenas, were tested after several lions at the facility became ill, according to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories. The hyena samples tested presumptive positive at a lab at Colorado State University, and the cases were confirmed by the national lab. In addition to the two hyenas, 11 lions and two tigers at the zoo tested positive for the virus. “Hyenas are famously tough, resilient animals that are known to be highly tolerant to anthrax, rabies and distemper. They are otherwise healthy and expected to make a full recovery,” the zoo said in a statement. Zoo officials said the hyenas – 22-year-old Ngozi and 23-year-old Kibo – are experiencing mild symptoms, including slight lethargy, some nasal discharge and an occasional cough. The other animals that tested positive in recent weeks either have fully recovered or are on the path to a full recovery. “We now know that many other species may be susceptible to COVID-19 based on multiple reports, and we continue to use the highest level of care and precaution when working with all of our 3,000 animals and 450 different species,” the statement said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Bomb threats forced the evacuation of several buildings at Yale University as well as nearby businesses for hours Friday, school and city officials said. A single caller to the New Haven police nonemergency line indicated there were bombs in eight buildings on campus about 2 p.m., police and school officials said. People in the buildings were initially told to go to the New Haven Green. Later, they were directed to certain indoor locations. Yale gave the all clear at about 7 p.m. and said the campus had resumed normal operations. Several city streets were blocked off as law enforcement officials with bomb-sniffing dogs prepared to search the buildings that were threatened. FBI and state police were helping Yale and New Haven authorities in the investigation and response. “We’re treating this as if it is a legitimate threat; however, at this time we are still working on who the caller was,” acting New Haven Police Chief Renee Dominguez said at a late afternoon news conference. Yale Police Chief Ronnell Higgins said the person who made the bomb threats did not give a reason.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The family-owned Delaware Park, home to the state’s biggest thoroughbred horse race each year, is being sold to a private equity firm and a gambling investor. The sale of Delaware Park, which has been operated by the Rickman family since the early 1980s and now includes a casino, should be completed by the end of the year, according to a news release Friday. The new owners will be Canadian-based Clairvest Group Inc. and Rubico Gaming LLC, a newly formed subsidiary run by investor Thomas Benninger. Delaware Park President Bill Fasy, who declined to comment Friday when asked about a sale price, said he wasn’t aware of any immediate operational changes to the Wilmington-based attraction, which hosts the Delaware Handicap each July. First developed by William du Pont Jr. in the 1930s, Delaware Park was known as the only major East Coast track, save for Aqueduct in New York, that raced in June. In 1983, longtime Maryland-based real estate developer William Rickman Sr. purchased the track, which had closed after financial troubles. He revived the business by offering smaller purses, which attracted cheaper horses. Competition improved in 1996 when legislation allowed slot machines at the track.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University’s president addressed students Friday as campus protests entered a 24th day Friday, WUSA-TV reports. Dozens of students began occupying the Blackburn University Center and set up tents on the yard in October to bring attention to several issues, including a demand for better living conditions, as they claim some dormitory rooms have been found to have mold. They also want student representation to be restored on the university board of trustees. “We’re not just these radical Black students,” said Channing Hill, a junior at Howard. “We’re simply trying to garner the first-class living conditions that Georgetown students have.” The day’s protests coincided with President Wayne Frederick’s annual State of the University address. Frederick took questions from students and alumni in a virtual event and said he was “empathetic with the students who have concerns.” He said one student with mold in their room is one too many, and Howard needs to make sure its housing partners who are responsible for the upkeep and cleaning air ducts are doing it at a high level. But Frederick also said dorms are not any worse now than they have been in the past. “The physical infrastructure of our residence halls today is as good as it’s ever been,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Reversing its previous position, the University of Florida said Friday that it will allow three professors to testify as experts in a lawsuit challenging a new state election law that critics say restricts voting rights. Last month, the university prohibited Dan Smith, Michael McDonald and Sharon Austin from testifying in the lawsuit brought by civic groups, saying that such testimony would put the school in conflict with the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, which pushed the election law. More than half of the university’s trustees are appointed by the governor. In a letter to the campus, university President Kent Fuchs said he is asking the office responsible for approving professors’ outside work to greenlight their request to serve as expert witnesses in the litigation. Fuchs said the outside work would have to be on the professors’ own time and not use university resources. Attorneys representing the professors said they were still planning to move forward with a lawsuit against the university. The school’s announcement came after the union for faculty members urged donors to withhold contributions and scholars and artists to turn down invitations to campus until university administrators affirmed the free speech rights of school employees.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Republicans on Friday advanced a plan projected to maintain a 33-23 GOP majority in the state Senate, setting it up for a possible vote this week in the full Senate. The proposal passed the Senate Reapportionment and Redistricting Committee on a 9-4 party-line vote over complaints that Republicans pushed too fast for a proposal released late Tuesday. “This process has gone too fast,” said Sen. Harold Jones II, D-Augusta. “We should really know what we’re talking about.” As senators voted, a House committee started considering new districts for the 180-member state House. The General Assembly must redraw electoral districts at least once every decade to equalize populations following the U.S. census. Georgia added more than a million people from 2010 to 2020, with urban districts generally growing and rural districts usually shrinking. This will be the first time in decades that Georgia lawmakers won’t be required to get federal approval of their maps after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a portion of the Voting Rights Act. Committee Chairman John Kennedy, R-Macon, noted that this year’s redistricting process had been compressed because of delays in releasing census results. But he said that if people wanted different alternatives considered, they should have gotten their senators to introduce them.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: An independent review of the state of astronomy and astrophysics in the U.S. has recommended federal funding of a giant telescope in the state. The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey warned it could be “disastrous” for U.S. astronomy if the National Science Foundation does not invest in projects like the Thirty Meter Telescope, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The survey recommends the U.S. government fund several large astronomy projects. “There’s a little bit of a feeling of astronomy going the way of physics,” said Doug Simons, director of the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy. He said the cancellation of a particle accelerator in Texas in 1993 resulted in the research moving to European facilities like the Large Hadron Collider. “I think if … the Europeans were the only international organization that had this kind of research capacity, that really signals something kind of alarming in the U.S., which has historically had a leadership role in contemporary astronomy.” But the report also highlights astronomy’s problems with Indigenous people. Some Native Hawaiians consider the proposed site for the giant telescope, on the Big Island’s Mauna Kea, to be sacred. “I wish they would have recognized that we have already spoken,” Native Hawaiian activist Kealoha Pisciotta said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch sent a letter to the White House last week requesting a meeting about Idaho’s federal district judge vacancy, saying it “cannot be filled” without a “mutual agreement” between them and the administration. But the “blue slip” procedure that the Republicans referenced – a system that gave home-state senators a veto over federal judicial nominees – was thrown out during the Trump administration, when federal judges were appointed over objections from Democratic senators. “The blue slip procedure regarding filling United States District Court vacancies is alive and well,” the two senators wrote in a Nov. 2 letter to Dana Remus, counsel to the president, the Idaho Press reports. Idaho’s top Democratic elected officials submitted an all-female list of four nominees to the White House in March, but there’s been no further word on the nomination since then. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill took senior status in August, making Idaho eligible for another federal judge. The Democratics nominated Idaho Falls attorney DeAnne Casperson, Boise attorney Keely Duke, Boise attorney Deborah Ferguson and former U.S. Attorney for Idaho Wendy Olson. Idaho is one of just three states with only two U.S. district judges and has not gotten an additional judgeship in 60 years, though caseloads have soared.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Chicago Public Schools officials have canceled all classes next Friday in a bid to boost COVID-19 vaccinations among younger students who are newly eligible for the shots. A letter from the district sent Thursday to parents and families said schools will be closed Nov. 12 for “Vaccination Awareness Day” after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved a COVID-19 vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old last week. District CEO Pedro Martinez said next Friday’s canceled classes will provide “an opportunity for parents and guardians to take their children 5 years of age and older to get vaccinated.” He said sporting events would not be canceled. Martinez and Chicago Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady have stressed their desire to see children vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when family gatherings have proven to spread the coronavirus at high rates. Jesse Sharkey, the Chicago Teachers Union president, said in a statement to union members that he welcomes the district’s acknowledgment of the importance for parents and families to get their children vaccinated. Free vaccines can be obtained at sites around the city. In addition, CPS has set up four clinics where students can get shots. Appointments can be made at cps.edu/vaccinations.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: With state tax collections surging, a top Republican legislator is looking at possible significant changes to the state sales tax and cutting property taxes for some businesses. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Tim Brown hasn’t offered details yet for what he could propose for the new legislative session starting in January, but such changes face concerns about the possibility of an economic slowdown and the impact on funding for local governments and school districts. Topics in Brown’s sights include expanding Indiana’s 7% sales tax that covers merchandise purchases ranging from clothing to cars so that it also is charged for spending on services, which potentially could be anything from haircuts to hospital stays. Brown said his aim would be to lower the sales tax rate if it were applied to a broader range of spending. Brown pointed to a trend of more spending on services, which federal reports show now make up nearly 70% of consumer spending. “Our sales tax base is changing a lot, so I am interested in looking at sales tax, and sales tax affects everybody,” Brown said. “It doesn’t matter how much money you make; you pay sales tax.”\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Twenty years after a fire destroyed the dome of the University of Iowa’s Old Capitol, the UI now is preparing to redo “failing” gilding at an estimated cost of $200,000 to $500,000. The UI will pay OPN Architects $23,500 to study the “causes and extents of gilding failure on the Old Capitol dome and develop recommendations for repair and restoration,” according to a contract signed in September. The study may include drone photography, sampling of the gold leaf and consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office. Wendy Moorehead, UI assistant director of facilities management, said that “the campus is excited to celebrate the upcoming year representing the 175th anniversary of the UI, and the Old Capitol dome, at the heart of campus, will represent that important milestone.” Another major milestone was the Nov. 20, 2001, fire that destroyed the dome, damaged much of the historic building and kept the Old Capitol shuttered for five years. The Old Capitol Building, for which the cornerstone was laid July 4, 1840, was to be the hub of state government after Iowa City was chosen as the state capital in 1839. The Iowa Legislative Assembly met in the building for the first time in December 1842. The Legislature decided in 1857 to move the capital to Des Moines. Old Cap housed most of the UI classes after the university was founded in 1847. The building also served as the library, chapel, armory and office space for administrators.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly grew more forceful Friday in opposing President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine mandates, saying it’s “too late” in the pandemic to impose them after Kansas and other states tailored responses to their needs. Kelly’s latest statement came a day after she argued that federal mandates “tend not to work,” though they’ve boosted vaccination rates elsewhere. She faces a difficult race for reelection next year in her Republican-leaning state, and GOP officials have been attacking the Democratic president’s mandates for weeks and criticizing Kelly for not making any public comments until Thursday. “While I appreciate the intention to keep people safe, a goal I share, I don’t believe this directive is the correct, or the most effective, solution for Kansas,” Kelly said in her latest statement. Attorney General Derek Schmidt, a Republican who hopes to unseat Kelly next year, announced later Friday that Kansas is among seven states that filed a federal lawsuit with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati against a Biden mandate that applies to companies with more than 100 workers. Schmidt already had brought Kansas into a federal lawsuit against a mandate applying to employees of federal government contractors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear, a Bluegrass State bourbon industry leader and a Louisville-based spirits producer are applauding an agreement between the United States and the European Union to lift tariffs on bourbon and whiskey. The United States and European Union have been in a trade war since 2018, when the former imposed a 25% tariff, or tax on imports, on European steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum under then-President Donald Trump. The European Union retaliated with tariffs on American products, including a 25% on bourbon whiskey. That tariff on a major Kentucky product was set to double Dec. 1. But now, for bourbon producers, “it’s time to raise a glass,” Kentucky Distillers Association President Eric Gregory said. National security adviser Jake Sullivan, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced an agreement Oct. 30 in which the United States will allow some quantity of European steel and aluminum to come to the country without tariffs, and, in turn, the European Union will drop its retaliatory tariffs. Gregory said that “these unfortunate tariffs have slashed exports of Kentucky bourbon by 50% to the EU and the United Kingdom, costing distillers, industry partners and farm families hundreds of millions of dollars.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nFranklin: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is holding a contest to name a recently improved pond in a national wildlife refuge. The agency has graded the parking lot and installed a floating dock and an information kiosk at the pond on Stephen R. Road in the Bayou Teche National Wildlife Refuge near Franklin. Now it’s asking people to visit the refuge and take a selfie or a photo of their family enjoying its trails as part of their entry. The photo, proposed name and a short explanation of the name can be submitted by email – bayouteche@fws.gov – or at facebook.com/SoutheastLouisiana. Specific personal names or vulgar, profane, racially insensitive or other derogatory names will not be accepted. The top five entries will be announced Dec. 2 on the refuge’s Facebook page, and the public will have a week to choose their favorite. The winning name will be announced live on Facebook at 10 a.m. Saturday, Dec. 11.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s environmental commissioner said Friday that she’ll take the referendum vote into account when deciding whether to suspend a permit for a $1 billion electric transmission line in western Maine. Commissioner Melanie Loyzim will close comments at the end of a new public hearing Nov. 22 so she can expedite a decision. Loyzim’s letter to New England Clean Energy Connect points to an aggressive timetable after Maine residents voted Tuesday to halt the project. The law takes effect 30 days after election results are certified. The Natural Resources Council of Maine told the commissioner the permit should be revoked immediately to prevent further environmental damage during construction, which is continuing. It would be a “dereliction of duty” for regulators to allow “continued destruction” of woodlands while waiting for the law to go into effect, James Kilbreth, a lawyer for NRCM, wrote Thursday in a notice to environmental regulators. The 145-mile power transmission line would serve as a conduit for up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower. Most of it would be built along existing corridors, but a new 53-mile section is being cut through the woods to reach the Canadian border.\n\nMaryland\n\nElkton: The Christmas tree that will light up Rockefeller Center this holiday season is coming from Maryland for the first time in the nearly nine decades of the annual tradition. A 79-foot-tall Norway spruce will be cut down in Elkton next Thursday and arrive in New York City on Saturday, the center announced Thursday. Rockefeller Center’s website says the 85-year-old tree will be covered with about 5 miles of wire holding more than 50,000 multicolored lights and topped with a 900-pound star covered in 3 million Swarovski crystals. The lighting ceremony is scheduled for Dec. 1 and will be televised on NBC. After that, the tree will be lit daily from 6 a.m. to midnight. It will be lit for 24 hours on Christmas Day and from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. on New Year’s Eve.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Three residents of a tent encampment at the nexus of the city’s opioid and homelessness crises say in a lawsuit that Boston’s plan to move them from the area is unconstitutional because it doesn’t provide viable alternatives, officials said Friday. The lawsuit filed Thursday in Suffolk Superior Court by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and the WilmerHale law firm was in response to the city’s decision last month to declare addiction and homelessness a public health emergency and clean up the area around Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard, known as Mass and Cass. The city pledged to find treatment or alternative housing for people displaced from tents in the area but has not properly done so, according to the ACLU. Although only three plaintiffs are mentioned, the suit applies to all residents of the area, according to the ACLU. “We can’t sweep or arrest our way out of the intersecting crises at Mass and Cass,” Carol Rose, the state ACLU’s executive director, said in a statement. “This plan is harmful and unconstitutional because it forces people to disperse with no safe place to sleep, while disconnecting them from the medical care they are able to receive at Mass and Cass.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday vetoed Republican-backed bills that would have created scholarship accounts for K-12 students to pay for educational expenses, including private school and tutoring, and given tax credits to people and corporations that donate to the program. The veto, which was expected, came the same week proponents of the legislation preemptively launched a ballot drive that would enable the GOP-led Legislature to enact identical citizen-initiated bills without her signature. The Democratic governor said the bills would cut state revenue by as much as $500 million in 2022 alone. “Simply put, our schools cannot provide the high-quality education our kids deserve if we turn private schools into tax shelters for the wealthy,” she wrote to lawmakers, adding that she has worked to reverse disinvestment in public education. School-choice proponents such as the Great Lakes Education Project criticized Whitmer, saying the funds would have helped more than 1 million kids who fell behind during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the plan, students would have been eligible for scholarships if their family income was no more than double the cutoff to receive free or reduced-priced lunch – $98,050 for a family of four currently – or if they had a disability or were in foster care.\n\nMinnesota\n\nPine City: Gov. Tim Walz was among the thousands of hunters who took to the field Saturday for the state’s firearms deer hunting season opener. Walz hunted with Brady Crocker and Kevin Hinze on the Hinze family’s private property in Pine County. The family permanently protected the land by donating a conservation easement to the Minnesota Land Trust. Walz, Crocker and Hinze didn’t get a deer, but the opener was marked by beautiful, warmer-than-usual weather across most of Minnesota. Following the hunt, Walz visited a chronic wasting disease sampling site in Pine City, joined by Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Sarah Strommen and Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen. They highlighted the importance of sampling to detect the brain disease, which is always fatal in deer. During opening weekend, people hunting in CWD surveillance, control, or management zones must bring their harvested deer to sampling stations to be tested. Voluntary sampling is available after the opening weekend for deer harvested within a CWD zone. “I ask all Minnesota deer hunters to be aware of CWD regulations and use one of the state’s sampling sites if hunting in a mandatory or voluntary sampling area,” Walz said in a statement.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An environmental group is using fines from the 2010 BP oil spill to plan the state’s first oyster shell recycling program. “It’s very straightforward – take the actual oyster shell and reuse it to help restore the very resource it’s providing. But the devil is always in the details,” said Alex Littlejohn, state director for The Nature Conservancy. “We want to learn from the other successful programs like this in other states, work through the kinks and make this a viable program for Mississippi.” At least 14 other states have had programs that collect empty shells from restaurants, festivals and other venues and use them to build coastal reefs. A survey before the COVID-19 pandemic found such programs in all four other Gulf Coast states, nine on the East Coast, and California, said Tom Mohrman, The Nature Conservancy’s director of marine programs. The programs often cover specific areas, such as Galveston Bay or Mobile Bay, but Mississippi’s coastline is small enough that one program could cover it all, he said. Mississippi’s Gulf Coast generally has plenty of oyster larvae but needs more hard surfaces where they can attach themselves and grow into oysters, the organization said in a news release. Oyster reefs also create homes for other types of marine life, slow waves that erode coastlines, and purify water.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The U.S. Office of Special Counsel said in a letter to President Joe Biden and members of Congress that employees at a federal office complex in the city were exposed to “widespread, longstanding” contamination from asbestos, lead, mercury, arsenic and other toxic materials by the agency in charge of managing government workplaces. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the letter, issued Friday, also noted that children at an on-site day care facility were exposed. The letter said officials deliberately misled tenants about the health risks at the Goodfellow Federal Center in north St. Louis. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel handles investigations and prosecution aimed at protecting federal employees. The OSC said an investigation into whistleblower allegations “substantiated that officials had been aware of environmental contamination but failed to appropriately notify GSA employees or tenant agencies.” The investigation also concluded that officials made no effort to limit access to contaminated areas and failed to assess potential exposure risks in the site’s child care center. The GSA has said it is working to close the Goodfellow complex and expects to relocate most tenant agencies by the end of 2022.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Calls to the Missoula Mobile Support Team have significantly reduced the number of people who would otherwise be taken to jail or to an emergency room since the team’s inception late last year, according to a presentation the program’s organizers made to a City Council committee Wednesday. Data shows that calls to the team are also on the rise. “The number of calls increased over time and continue to increase,” Gretchen Neal, Missoula County’s mental health coordinator, told the Missoulian. The Mobile Support Team is funded by the county, the city and the state. Emergency medical technicians from the Missoula Fire Department and licensed behavioral health clinicians or clinicians in training work with case facilitators to staff the team. They are trained to provide consultation, screening and brief intervention to individuals in crisis stemming from behavioral health issues, which includes mental health issues or substance abuse issues. The goal is to provide them with the care they need while reducing the time that first responders spend addressing a situation in which behavioral health is the chief concern. Another goal is to reduce the number of arrests and emergency room visits, which reduces government-funded jail and hospital costs.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The city plans to join hundreds of others across the nation trying to come up with strategies to combat climate change. While the Nebraska Legislature has rejected calls for a statewide plan, Omaha will lead a metropolitan area climate action plan expected to be funded with a mix of public and private money, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Mayor Jean Stothert told the newspaper in an email that the time is right. “Omaha has been implementing sustainability measures for some time now without the need for a formal plan,” she wrote. “The current timeline gives us the opportunity to maximize the results of more coordination for climate-related practices.” Climate plans typically involve identifying where a community is most vulnerable to severe weather, its contribution to global warming, what needs to be done and measurable steps that can be taken. A consultant is expected to be chosen by mid-2022. It could take a year or longer for the consultant that’s chosen to develop the plan. Some wonder what took so long. The Kansas City metropolitan area, the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, and Lincoln are among nearby places that already have climate action plans. “Omaha and the surrounding area are late to the solutions game,” said David Corbin, chairman of the Missouri Valley Sierra Club’s energy committee.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: American Civil Liberties Union attorneys said if the state redraws its political maps without reallocating thousands of inmates to their pre-prison addresses, they will be in violation of a 2019 Nevada law. The threat of a lawsuit and the organization’s insistence that prison officials compile more addresses could complicate the redistricting process that lawmakers are expected to conduct this month. Though the U.S. census counts inmates at prisons where they’re serving sentences, Nevada is one of a growing number of states required to reallocate residents in prison to where they previously lived. Nevada lawmakers in 2019 passed legislation to ban so-called prison gerrymandering. It directs the Department of Corrections to “compile the last known residential address of each offender immediately before the offender was sentenced to imprisonment in a facility or institution of the Department” and subsequently “provide to the State Demographer all available information.” Last week, prison officials said they only had usable addresses for 6,275 people out of the 12,214 counted in the 2020 census, or about 51%. In a Friday letter sent to lawmakers and state officials, attorneys Holly Welborn and Chris Peterson allege the thousands of missing inmate addresses “place the Legislature at risk of violating Nevada’s Constitutional requirement to base reapportionment on accurate data.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: A 9-foot-tall video game joystick made of wood, rubber and steel has made it into the Guinness World Records 2022 as the largest. Dartmouth College professor Mary Flanagan created the giant controller – nearly 14 times the size of an original classic Atari controller – in 2006 to celebrate her childhood experience of “maniacally” playing Atari 2600 video games. She also wanted to see what it would be like when a single-player experience becomes collaborative: It takes at least two people to operate the joystick and push the button to play classic Atari games such as “Centipede” and “Breakout.” “To have this common pop culture artifact just erupt in the middle of a space and allow people to play something familiar, yet not familiar, was exciting,” said Flanagan, an artist who is chair of Dartmouth’s Film and Media Studies and the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor in Digital Humanities. The joystick, which toured Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, is now part of the permanent collection of ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A truck driver who ousted the powerful state Senate president in last week’s election previously posted online calling Islam “a false religion,” comparing vaccine mandates to the Holocaust and defending rioters at the U.S. Capitol. Republican Edward Durr apologized Friday after media outlets highlighted the posts. His victory over Steve Sweeney, widely regarded as the second most powerful Democrat in state government, in Tuesday’s election shocked the state’s political establishment. Durr spent a paltry sum on his campaign. On Thursday and Friday, media reports highlighted posts Durr had made on Twitter and Facebook, including some critical of immigrants, boasting of defying state COVID-19 mask mandates, and making misogynist attacks on Democratic elected officials like then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Durr issued a statement Thursday night to radio station WHYY and Friday to the website New Jersey Globe apologizing for the posts. “I’m a passionate guy and I sometimes say things in the heat of the moment,” Durr said in identical comments to both outlets. “If I said things in the past that hurt anybody’s feelings, I sincerely apologize.” Twitter showed Friday that Durr’s account had been deactivated by the user.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials have been inundated with critical letters on proposed K-12 social studies standards over the inclusion of racial identity and social justice themes in a majority-Latino state where Indigenous tribes have persevered through war, famine, internment camps and boarding schools aimed at stamping out their cultures. If approved, the standards would require students starting in kindergarten to “identify some of their group identities” and “take group or individual action to help address local, regional, and/or global problems.” By high school, students would examine “factors which resulted in unequal power relations among identity groups.” Critics, including some Hispanics, say the standards promote victimhood, while supporters have praised the standards as “more just and anti-racist.” The proposed New Mexico standards represent a new frontier in the clash over “critical race theory” – an academic concept increasingly used by conservative activists as a catchall term for the study of systemic racism, historical oppression or progressive social activism. New Mexico is a patchwork of 23 federally recognized Native American nations, tribes and pueblos. Half of the state is Latino, and about 10% of students are Native American, with many tracing their heritage to pre-Columbian and 16th-century Spanish conquistadors.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The former head of the city’s police sergeants union has been punished with a loss of 70 vacation days, which amounts to almost $32,000 in pay, after being found guilty by his own police department of improperly disclosing information and using inappropriate language on social media, police said Friday. Ed Mullins of the New York Police Department had already filed retirement papers last month and retired as president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association in the wake of federal agents raiding the union’s office and his home. The retirement was effective as of Friday, but the NYPD said in an email that “the cases were moved forward expeditiously to ensure the appropriate penalty could be imposed in the event of findings of guilt.” Mullins was found guilty in disciplinary proceedings for improperly tweeting NYPD paperwork last year regarding the arrest of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s daughter during protests over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. He denied violating guidelines. In a separate complaint from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, he was also found guilty after an administrative hearing for using inappropriate language in social media posts he made that referenced other New York City officials. Review board Chair Fred Davie said he was “disappointed” that Mullins was docked vacations days and not fired.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Barely 24 hours after their passage, the state’s newly drawn maps drew another legal complaint that will likely determine how much Republicans can expand their political clout over the coming decade in a state that is slowly becoming more blue. An organization formed by Marc Elias, a prominent Democratic lawyer, announced Friday that a group of voters who successfully challenged previous North Carolina maps will now make a similar appeal in state court contesting the latest congressional maps. They will argue that the boundaries approved by Republicans on Thursday were drawn for political gain in a way that violates several provisions of the North Carolina Constitution. The stakes are high, as Republicans currently hold an 8-5 edge over Democrats in the U.S. House and would likely expand their advantages substantially if the maps prevail. During a virtual event on Twitter, Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, called North Carolina’s maps “a grotesque partisan gerrymander” and “indefensible.” “The Republican Party has lost all shame,” Elias said. “I mean, in the 2010 (redistricting process and) after 2010, they were still pretending that they cared about democracy and about voting rights, and now they no longer pretend.” Last week, voters and advocacy groups sued in Wake County court to block the timetable for passing state legislative maps, accusing Republicans of breaking rules aimed at ensuring Black voters can elect their desired candidates.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A proposal to use $150 million in federal stimulus money to build another pipeline to carry natural gas from the Bakken region to eastern North Dakota will be on the table as lawmakers convene at the Capitol. Lawmakers plan to divvy up $1 billion from the federal American Rescue Plan Act during the special session, which opens Monday, and the money that leaders hope to set aside for pipeline grants could make the prospect of such a project more attractive to developers. “There’s been a long-standing desire to see more North Dakota gas be used in the state,” North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin Kringstad told the Bismarck Tribune. The Bakken region of western North Dakota produces substantial quantities of gas alongside oil, and some of it is wastefully burned off in flares at well sites rather than piped away for use as fuel due to a lack of infrastructure. Some eastern North Dakota communities have gas service because they happen to be near a limited number of pipelines that extend to that part of the state, but many do not. Much of the gas produced within North Dakota is transported to markets in other states. Cost appears to be the major barrier to building another pipeline. The economics tend to work out better to send gas down existing pipelines into other states, Kringstad said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The election board for the state’s most populous county is being put under administrative oversight by the secretary of state, after another problem with electronic poll books led to three improperly cast votes in last week’s election. Not all of Franklin County’s electronic poll books were properly updated on Election Day with data about who had already voted early or requested an absentee ballot, according to Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office. His office has determined three voters were able to vote twice but said those votes didn’t affect the outcome of any election. One of those voters told the office they cast a ballot during early voting, then did so again on Election Day while accompanying their spouse to vote because a poll worker indicated the poll book didn’t reflect the earlier vote. The voter said they were worried their first ballot hadn’t been counted. The Franklin County Board of Elections had another problem last year with some of its electronic poll books not updating, and it didn’t fully follow a remediation plan to avoid the newest problem, LaRose’s office said. To make sure the board is effectively administering elections, it will now have to report weekly to the secretary of state, according to LaRose’s office.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group of about 20 local pastors and ministers gathered outside the state Capitol on Friday to pray for Gov. Kevin Stitt as he weighs the fate of high-profile death row inmate Julius Jones. The preachers said they hoped Stitt would lean heavily on his Christian roots and follow the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board’s recommendation that Jones be granted clemency. “Lord, we implore you to allow Gov. Stitt to be the hero of Julius’ story,” the Rev. Keith Jossell, Jones’ spiritual adviser, said in his prayer. The prayer gathering came only days before Jones’ execution date, set for Nov. 18. Jones was convicted in 2002 in the fatal shooting of Edmond insurance executive Paul Howell during a 1999 carjacking. Jones has maintained his innocence in the murder, claiming another individual shot and killed Howell and pinned the slaying on him. The Rev. Major Jemison, senior pastor of St. John Missionary Baptist Church, said the circumstances surrounding Jones’ conviction included Jones’ lack of adequate representation, lack of fairness and lack of equality. Jemison also voiced unease that there could be negative consequences should the governor go against the parole board’s recommendation. “We are also very concerned about the potential for civil unrest if the state proceeds with the execution of Mr. Jones while disregarding the avalanche of questions and ambiguity surrounding the circumstances of the case,” he said.\n\nOregon\n\nNewberg: The teachers union in the city has filed a lawsuit over a policy passed narrowly by its school board that limits what kinds of images or signs school employees can display on campus. The “Ensuring Safe Environments to Learn” policy bars school employees from displaying images “relating to a political, quasi-political, or controversial topic.” The lawsuit was filed Wednesday. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the Newberg policy has been a lightning rod for controversy, with the ACLU, Democrats in the Oregon Legislature and the State Board of Education all issuing statements against it. The policy, backed by a four-member majority of the Newberg school board, started out as a directive to remove signs and posters showing support for Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ pride. In its 18-page complaint, the Newberg Education Association argues the policy violates two amendments of the U.S. Constitution: the First Amendment protecting free speech and the 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection. The suit also argues the Newberg policy violates Article I, Section 20 of the Oregon Constitution, which protects “against vague laws that confer unbridled discretion, because such discretion creates the potential for unequal application of the law,” among other state constitutional provisions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf said his mail-in ballot was dropped off by his wife before Tuesday’s election despite a state law requiring that voters deliver them in person. Wolf’s spokeswoman Beth Rementer called it an honest mistake. “I did vote; actually I voted by mail,” Wolf said Tuesday on KDKA radio. When an interviewer told him the ballot was due in the York County elections office by the end of Election Day, he said first lady Frances Wolf delivered it. “My wife actually dropped it off personally two weeks ago, so it’s there,” he said. The interview segment was highlighted Thursday in a tweet by state Rep. Seth Grove, R-York County, who has spent much of the past year working on an election code revamp. In June, Democrat Wolf vetoed an election reform bill Grove sponsored. “It’s law,” Grove said in a text exchange Thursday. “You can’t hand in more than 1 ballot.” He said Frances Wolf dropping off the governor’s mail-in ballot would have been legal had his bill been enacted. State law requires voters who do not mail their absentee or mail-in ballot to “deliver it in person to (their) county board of election,” although with preapproval others can do it under certain circumstances.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A World War I veteran is getting a new monument in the city after the original monument in his honor was vandalized. City Councilman David Salvatore said the new marker in honor of Pfc. Carlo Lafazia will be commissioned and dedicated next spring. “We’re going to relocate it to a new area that is going to allow for an education opportunity, first and foremost about the history of Private Lafazia and the contributions that he made, and secondly, some of the history around World War I and what that meant to the Eagle Park community and to Rhode Island as a whole,” Salvatore said. Lafazia, who served in the 16th Infantry Regiment, was killed in the Forest of Argonne in France in October 1918. The original monument was placed on Admiral Street in 2017. But earlier this year, it was knocked off its foundation. The vandal was never caught. The damaged monument stone is now stored at the Department of Public Works.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A strong storm off the Southeast’s Atlantic coast combined with periodic higher tides Sunday, causing coastal flooding that approached levels rarely seen outside of hurricanes along the South Carolina and Georgia coasts, officials said. Scientists have said data shows the unusually high tides and the flooding of roads that come with it are happening more frequently as sea levels rise with global warming. The Sunday high tide in Charleston Harbor reached 8.51 feet, the 10th-highest level in the century of recording at that site, the National Weather Service said. The high water closed dozens of roads in downtown and caused the city to cancel its Veterans Day parade scheduled for Saturday. Sunday’s high tides were the culmination of four days of rising ocean water pushed ashore by both winds from a strong autumn storm offshore and periodic King Tides when the moon’s location causes the water level to increase. Rising sea levels are leading to more frequent flooding, meteorologists said. Charleston Harbor has recorded 25 of the 39 tides of 8 feet or greater since 2015. The tide reached that level for major flooding three times already this month, meteorologists said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A moose on the loose got onto the South Dakota State University football field in Brookings before leaving town. Campus police said the moose left campus about 3:30 p.m. Friday and was headed west. They said the bull moose appeared to be 1 to 2 years old. Emmett Keyser, the regional supervisor for the Game Fish and Parks office, told KELO-TV his agency helped the campus police and other law enforcement with herding the moose out of town. “We did try to move him north,” Keyser said. But, in apparent impersonation of a running back, “he ran back through our line and into the stadium,” Keyser said. The moose hung around campus for a time until officials were able to herd him west out of town. “The thing is, moose are so unpredictable,” Keyser said. “You don’t want anyone getting hurt or the animal getting hurt.” The sighting followed one a few days earlier of a moose walking down U.S. Highway 75 in Luverne, Minnesota, about 50 miles away. It wasn’t clear if it was the same moose. While moose are rare in the area, they do appear from time to time.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee on Friday again extended an executive order that allows parents to opt students out of school mask requirements that federal judges have blocked from applying in three counties. The Republican’s decision maintains the status quo on the opt-out order for two weeks while he considers whether to sign a broad coronavirus-related bill that would limit mask policies in schools even further. He first issued the mask opt-out order in mid-August and extended it in late September. Lee on Friday also extended the ongoing state of emergency over the COVID-19 pandemic until Nov. 19, while members of his administration “continue analyzing impacts of recent legislation & how it affects certain provisions,” he wrote on Twitter. During their recent three-day special session, Republican lawmakers passed a proposal that would in part largely prohibit government entities – including public schools – from implementing mask mandates. Those entities would only be allowed to require masks if they lived in a county with a rolling average 14-day COVID-19 infection rate of at least 1,000 per 100,000 resident while the state is under a state of emergency. There are no counties that currently meet that threshold. Even then, mask mandates would continue to be limited in use.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The weeklong, record-breaking February freeze this past winter led to crises of power, water, food, shelter, medical care, transportation and emergency response. A lengthy report published by the city Thursday identified a myriad of issues the community experienced that week and offered 132 recommendations about how to be better prepared for the next disaster. The freeze “was an overlapping emergency with overwhelming and cascading community impacts,” says the report, written by the city’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management departments with the help of Hagerty Consulting. The report reviewed the city’s entire response to the weather event and subsequent crises, identifying lapses in training and coordination, as well as supply-chain failures and neglected communities. “City and county leadership sought to move expeditiously to provide life-sustaining services,” the report says. “These included activation of shelter and warming centers, coordinating medical operations and distribution of drinking water. They faced significant obstacles in loss of infrastructure, staffing shortfalls, and availability of volunteers.” The coronavirus pandemic meant resources were already stretched thin, the report says. Some elected officials and volunteers set up services in response to shortfalls in departmental services.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State lawmakers are set to vote on a name change for southern Utah’s Dixie State University this week. A bill to rename it Utah Technical University will be considered in a special session in which lawmakers will also vote on redistricting, state Rep. Kelly Miles, R-South Ogden, told Fox13. It’s expected to get a hearing before the Education Interim Committee on Tuesday. The step comes after numerous public hearings, focus groups and a vote in favor of a name change from the Utah System of Higher Education. Supporters of changing “Dixie” have pointed to difficulties in recruiting and retaining students, who link the name to the South, the Civil War and the Confederacy. Past yearbooks show students in blackface, Confederate flags and the former mascot dubbed “The Rebel.” Opponents of the name change insist the name comes from Mormon pioneers who settled in the St. George area to grow cotton. They’ve begun launching campaigns to pressure lawmakers to resist a name change, accusing the state of giving in to “cancel culture.” The Washington County Commission recently passed a resolution supporting \\\\ the “Dixie” name. But Miles said that after an extensive input-gathering process, he expects the Legislature to support a name change. Gov. Spencer Cox would also be expected to sign it.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is requiring unvaccinated employees to use personal sick time if they are exposed to someone with COVID-19 through their jobs and have to quarantine. State workers who exhaust all their sick time could be required to quarantine without being paid. Fully vaccinated employees forced to quarantine will be paid without needing to use sick time. “We want to do whatever we can to take advantage of safe, effective and free vaccines,” Jason Maulucci, a spokesperson for Republican Gov. Phil Scott, said Friday. “If there are people who choose not to, there are implications to making that decision.” Maulucci said it was unclear how many people have had to use sick leave or if anyone has already gone unpaid. Steve Howard, executive director of the Vermont State Employees Association, said there have been cases in which employees have had to use leave, but he didn’t have a specific number. He didn’t know if anyone had gone without pay. Howard said the union has filed a grievance, saying the new policy was implemented without working through the details with the union. The previous policy allowed state workers who had to quarantine to be paid while out of work.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A juvenile son of Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin tried twice to cast a ballot in Tuesday’s election, election officials said Friday. The 17-year-old presented an ID but was told he was ineligible to vote due to his age and turned away, according to a statement from Scott Konopasek, Fairfax County’s general registrar. The statement said the teen did not successfully vote, made no false statements, did not disrupt voting and appeared to have committed “no election offense.” The statement mentioned Youngkin’s son by name, saying the identification was based on contemporaneous notes by the chief election officer. The news was first reported by The Washington Post. The Associated Press is not naming the son because he is a juvenile. A spokesman for the Republican governor-elect, who campaigned heavily on election integrity, said the son misunderstood Virginia’s laws. State law allows any person who is 17 and will be 18 by Election Day to register in advance and vote in any intervening primary or special election. Jennifer Chanty, a precinct captain, told The Washington Post she encountered the son, who left after initially being told he was too young to vote. She said he returned a short time later, saying a friend who was also 17 had been allowed to cast a ballot. Youngkin, who has four children, made election integrity central to his campaign during the fight for the GOP nomination, and he refused for months to say whether President Joe Biden was legitimately elected.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Three Black women who work for the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department have filed a lawsuit against the county alleging a long-standing pattern of discrimination, harassment and retaliation against minority employees. The News Tribune reports Lt. Charla James-Hutchison and Sgts. Dione Alexander and Sabrina Braswell-Bouyer are the highest-ranking African American women in the department’s 168-year history. Their attorneys filed the suit on their behalf last Monday, claiming that the women – who all work in Pierce County Jail – have suffered emotional distress, economic losses and damage to their reputations due to the decades of discrimination. No specific damages are specified in the lawsuit. James-Hutchison, Alexander and Braswell-Bouyer are among 12 Black women who work for the Sheriff’s Department, according to county statistics. There are 47 Black sworn employees in the department out of about 614. The women have been subjected to racial slurs, told they were only hired or promoted to “fill a quota,” called thugs because of their hairstyles, and subjected to colleagues’ comments about how the COVID-19 vaccines should be tested on Black people before white people, the suit says.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Grandparents who are the primary caregivers for their grandchildren ages 5 to 11 can receive a $150 school voucher if they are vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Jim Justice said Friday. The program is through the Healthy Grandfamilies vaccination incentive program. To receive a voucher, the family must be enrolled in West Virginia State University’s Healthy Grandfamilies program at healthygrandfamilies.com. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended the vaccine for use by children ages 5 to 11. All vaccine-eligible members of the family must have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vouchers can be used for school supplies, the governor’s office said in a news release. About 19,000 West Virginia children live in households with a grandparent as primary caregiver, according to the Healthy Grandfamilies organization.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin-Madison has raised the Ho-Chunk Nation flag over its main administration building, marking the first time the university has flown another nation’s flag with the U.S. flag and the Wisconsin flag. Friday’s ceremony at Bascom Hall felt historic to senior Paige Skenandore, who grew up on a reservation in northern Wisconsin and is one of roughly 100 Native American students on campus. It also felt long overdue. “I think this is a great first step,” Skenandore told the Wisconsin State Journal. “It’s been a long time coming. It’s kind of shocking that it hasn’t happened before.” Ho-Chunk Nation Chief Clayton Winneshiek told attendees the flag-raising was “a start.” UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank said the flag-raising was more than a symbolic gesture but part of an ongoing commitment to educate and acknowledge the state’s tribes and their sovereignty. Almost 190 years ago, the U.S. government and Ho-Chunk Nation signed the Treaty of 1832, which forced the tribe to give up territory that includes the UW-Madison campus. “For many years, UW-Madison was not mindful of this history, and we paid little attention to our relationship with the descendants of those who were here long before us,” Blank told a crowd of at least a couple hundred. “But we are working to change that.”\n\nWyoming\n\nTorrington: An inmate who died Wednesday is the fourth death in as many weeks at the Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution. The Casper Star Tribune reports 66-year-old Frank Lee Apodaca died Wednesday at the Community Hospital in Torrington. The Wyoming Department of Corrections said it will conduct an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Apodaca was from Fort Collins, Colorado, and sentenced to nine to 12 years in prison in 2017, after being convicted of third-degree sexual assault and intrusion on a victim under age 16 in Laramie County.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/music/2021/01/18/protest-songs-sam-cooke-kendrick-lamar-lauryn-hill-public-enemy-mavis-staples-nina-simone/4152376001/", "title": "25 songs for Black History Month: James Brown, Billie Holiday and ...", "text": "Martin Luther King Jr. had a deep respect for music as an instrument of change.\n\nThe March on Washington in 1963, where King delivered his \"I Have a Dream\" speech, featured live performances by Peter, Paul and Mary, Harry Belafonte, Marian Anderson, Mahalia Jackson, Joan Baez and Bob Dylan, just to name a few.\n\nIn a piece he wrote for the 1964 Berlin Jazz Festival, King had this to say about the role of music in our lives:\n\n\"God has wrought many things out of oppression. He has endowed his creatures with the capacity to create, and from this capacity has flowed the sweet songs of sorrow and joy that have allowed man to cope with his environment and many different situations.\"\n\nMusic clearly played a starring role in the civil rights movement. People marched to freedom songs while artists from Sam Cooke to Dylan took the message to the masses in recordings as enduring as \"A Change is Gonna Come\" and \"Blowin' in the Wind.\"\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nKing considered the Impressions' song \"People Get Ready\" the unofficial anthem of the civil rights movement.\n\nMany of the songs that people marched to in the '60s have retained their relevance, with people singing \"We Shall Overcome\" at Black Lives Matter protests throughout 2020.\n\nIt 'should send a chill down everybody's spine': How hip hop is responding to George Floyd death\n\nAnd people are still adding new songs to that folk tradition, from Lauryn Hill's \"Black Rage,\" to Kendrick Lamar's \"Alright,\" a hip-hop song that emerged as a popular choice for people marching for their rights at Black Lives Matter protests.\n\nHere's a look at 20 of the most enduring civil rights songs, from the song known as the Black National Anthem, \"Lift Every Voice and Sing,\" and Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit\" to Lamar's \"Alright.\"\n\n20. Nina Simone, 'To Be Young, Gifted and Black' (1970)\n\nNina Simone has said that she and her musical director Weldon Irvine hoped to write a song that would inspire young Black children all over the world to feel good about themselves and celebrate their Blackness. That's exactly what this song accomplishes, a joyous gospel tune that tells those children, \"In the whole world you know there are a million boys and girls who are young, gifted and Black. And that's a fact!\" Simone's song shares a title with a play about the life of Lorraine Hansberry, a friend of hers who wrote \"A Raisin in the Sun,\" the first show on Broadway to be written by a Black woman. Within two years of the song's release, Aretha Franklin and Donnie Hathaway had both recorded their own versions.\n\n19. Kendrick Lamar, 'Alright' (2015)\n\nThis highlight of \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" had emerged by the end of 2015 as what the New York Times declared \"the unifying soundtrack to Black Lives Matter protests nationwide.\" In that same article, Lamar told the Times he could see what the kids who were chanting his song in the streets were hearing. \"Simple phrase,\" he said. \"We gon' be alright. It's a chant of hope and feeling.\" Although many of the struggles he addresses in the song are on a more personal scale than systemic oppression, \"Alright\" is one of three times on the album he references the 40 acres and a mule that formerly enslaved people were promised but didn't receive when the Civil War ended. And he touches on the root cause of those Black Lives Matter protest with \"And we hate po-po / Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho.'\"\n\nRelated: To help heal racial wounds, Black national anthem would become America's hymn under proposal\n\n18. Bob Marley, 'Redemption Song' (1981)\n\nThe final track on the final album Bob Marley recorded before his death in 1981, this intimate solo acoustic recording begins with a reference to Africans being sold as slaves to merchant ships. The chorus asks \"Won't you help to sing these songs of freedom?\" And the second verse finds Marley referencing a speech by Marcus Garvey, urging listeners to \"Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery / None but ourselves can free our minds.\" Like many of the freedom songs the chorus references, \"Redemption Song\" responds to the pain of oppression with a spiritual promise of better days to follow. \"But my hand was made strong by the hand of the Almighty,\" Marley sings. \"We forward in this generation triumphantly.\"\n\n17. The Roots, 'Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around' (2012)\n\nThis organ-driven reinvention of the spiritual \"Ain't Gonna Let Nobody Turn Me Around\" was the Roots' contribution to \"Soundtrack For a Revolution,\" a 2012 compilation of contemporary artists doing traditional Civil Rights-era freedom songs (with an assist from Brooklyn art-rock legends TV on the Radio). The music video offsets black-and-white footage of 20th-century protests with full-color clips of The Roots performing in the studio. Like many freedom song of the era, it's designed to be easily learned and sung at marches, a single refrain with slightly altered lyrics each time it's repeated, each chorus building to the same conclusion, which in this case is, \"I'm gonna keep on a-walkin', keep on a-talkin' / Marchin' on to freedom land.\"\n\n16. Lauryn Hill, 'Black Rage' (2014)\n\nSetting her words to the tune of \"My Favorite Things\" on an ominous bed of hip-hop beats and acoustic guitar, Lauryn Hill traces the roots of Black rage through American history to its tragic beginnings with \"Black human packages tied up in strings.\" She also examines the ongoing sins of systemic oppression that continue to define the Black experience for far too many people in the age of Black Lives Matter. \"Black Rage is founded on blatant denial,\" she sings. \"Squeezing economics, subsistence survival / Deafening silence and social control / Black Rage is founded on wounds in the soul.\" When she first shared a lo-fi recording of \"Black Rage\" in 2014, it was dedicated to the people fighting for racial equality in Ferguson, Missouri.\n\n15. Pete Seeger, 'We Shall Overcome' (1963)\n\nThis was one of the civil rights movement's most popular songs, an unofficial anthem so pervasive that President Lyndon B. Johnson slipped the title phrase into a speech to Congress in March of 1965 in the wake of violent attacks on civil rights demonstrators during the march from Selma to Montgomery. Two years prior to that speech, a young Joan Baez led a crowd of 300,000 in singing the gospel song at the Lincoln Memorial during A. Philip Randolph's March on Washington. Among the more notable artists to have covered the song are Mahalia Jackson and Pete Seeger, who played a key role in weaving the gospel song into the cultural fabric as a song leader at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee. His \"We Shall Overcome\" is in many ways the definitive version.\n\n14. Fannie Lou Hamer, 'Go Tell It on the Mountain' (1963)\n\nThe original lyrics of this 19th century spiritual celebrate the birth of Jesus. By the early '60s, both Fannie Lou Hamer and Peter, Paul & Mary were doing a version that subbed in \"Let my people go\" for \"Jesus Christ is born.\" Hamer was deeply involved in the civil rights movement, a community organizer known for her use of spirituals who organized the Freedom Summer Project, a volunteer campaign in 1964 to register as many Black voters as possible in Mississippi. Hamer's version of the song is a cappella gospel with Hamer's emotional testifying backed by handclaps and a joyous choir.\n\n13. Sam Cooke, 'This Little Light of Mine' (1964)\n\nThe earliest known recording of this gospel song of unknown origin is a field recording done in 1934 by John and Alan Lomax of Jim Boyd at the State Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas. It was widely used in Black churches by then and emerged as a civil rights anthem in the '50s and '60s thanks to the efforts of Zilphia Horton, Fannie Lou Hamer and Bettie Mae Fikes. It's a simple declaration of self-empowerment with an oft-repeated chorus of \"This little light of mine/I'm gonna let it shine.\" Sam Cooke's recording on 1964's \"Sam Cooke at the Copa\" is especially uplifting – joyous even –serving as a perfect segue into the soul singer’s equally joyous rendition of Bob Dylan's civil rights anthem \"Blowin' in the Wind.\"\n\n12. Gil Scott-Heron, 'The Revolution Will Not Be Televised' (1971)\n\nMore a spoken-word performance set to music than an actual song, \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\" was written in response to the spoken-word piece \"When the Revolution Comes\" by the Black Poets, whose track begins with \"When the revolution comes, some of us will probably catch it on TV.\" Gil Scott-Heron uses that line as a starting point to argue that \"You will not be able to stay home, brother\" when the revolution comes. \"You will not be able to plug in, turn on and cop out / You will not be able to lose yourself on skag and skip out for beer during commercials.\" As the track goes on, he unleashes a stream of satirical pop culture references to illustrate the many ways in which the revolution will not be provided for your passive entertainment value, ending with \"The revolution will be no re-run, brothers / The revolution will be live.\"\n\n11. Bob Dylan, 'Blowin’ in the Wind' (1963)\n\nIn Martin Scorsese's documentary \"No Direction Home,\" Mavis Staples recalls her first impression of this song and how she couldn't understand how a young white man could write something that captured the frustrations of the Black experience as powerfully as Dylan does here. Sam Cooke was impressed enough to add it to his repertoire and wrote \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" in part because he wished that Dylan's song had been composed by a person of color. Although the lyrics aren't exclusively concerned with civil rights – in the opening verse, Dylan sings, \"Yes, and how many times must the cannonballs fly before they are forever banned\" – it's easy to hear how it came to be embraced as a civil rights anthem. In the opening line, he asks, \"How many roads must a man walk down before you call him a man?\" And later, he wonders \"And how many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free?\"\n\n10. Kim Weston, 'Lift Every Voice and Sing' (1972)\n\nKim Weston's emotional reading of this life-affirming gospel song emerged as a defining moment of Wattstax, a concert held on the seventh anniversary of the 1965 Watts riots at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, where many in the crowd of more than 100,000 raised a fist in the air as she sang. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, who introduced her as \"Sister Kim Weston,\" called \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" the Black National Anthem that day. And he wasn't the first or last to call it that. Based on a poem by James Weldon Johnson and set to music by his brother John Rosamond Johnson, the song was first performed in 1900 by a choir at a segregated school in Jacksonville, Florida, as part of a birthday celebration for President Abraham Lincoln.\n\n9. Public Enemy, ‘Fight the Power’ (1989)\n\nThis hip-hop classic was written to order for \"Do the Right Thing,\" a Spike Lee joint from 1989 exploring racial tension in a Brooklyn neighborhood. In an interview with Time, Lee talked about how he was looking for a song to underscore the film's climactic riot scene. \"I wanted it to be defiant, I wanted it to be angry, I wanted it to be very rhythmic,\" he said. \"I thought right away of Public Enemy.\" Mission accomplished. Fueled by the Bomb Squad's incendiary production, Chuck D raps about fighting the powers that be with tossed-off references to James Brown, Malcolm X and their own first album. And before the song is through, he's trashed two paragons of white pop culture, Elvis Presley and John Wayne, accusing both of racism. He's since walked back his thoughts on Presley, saying it was more about the racists that anointed him the King of Rock 'n' Roll at the expense of the Black artists who inspired much of what he did.\n\n8. Mavis Staples, 'We Shall Not Be Moved' (2007)\n\n\"Like a tree that's planted by the water, we shall not be moved.\" Several folk acts recorded this uplifting spiritual in the '50s and '60s, from England's King of Skiffle Lonnie Donegan to Pete Seeger and the Seekers. Mavis Staples slowed it down to dramatic effect on a deeply soulful rendition she cut for 2007's \"We'll Never Turn Back,\" a concept album of songs related to the civil rights movement produced by Ry Cooder. Like many spirituals, its word are based in scripture, in this case, the Book of Jeremiah. In 2017, students at Howard University, a historically Black university, sang \"We Shall Not Be Moved\" to protest former FBI director James Comey taking the stage to deliver a convocation address.\n\n7. The Staple Singers, 'Freedom Highway' (1965)\n\nDriven by a gritty blues guitar lick and thundering handclap, \"Freedom Highway\" begins with a call to \"March up freedom's highway/ March each and every day.\" And for those who may have wondered what it was that had the Staple Singers marching up that highway each and every day, they laid in on the line in more explicit terms than most: \"There is just one thing I can't understand, my friend / Why some folk think freedom was not designed for all men.\" Mavis Staples revisited that highway on 2008's \"Live: Hope at the Hideout,\" which also featured such civil rights anthems as \"We Shall Not Be Moved\" and \"This Little Light of Mine.\"\n\n6. Nina Simone, 'Mississippi Goddam' (1964)\n\nNina Simone has said she wrote this song in a rush of fury, hatred and determination upon learning of four young Black girls murdered in the bombing of the 16 Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama on Sept. 15, 1963. It was also inspired in part by the racially motivated murder that same year in Jackson, Mississippi, of civil rights activist Medgar Evers. The song was first released as a live recording on \"Nina Simone in Concert,\" done in the style of an upbeat show tune, complete with the comic aside, \"This is a show tune but the show hasn't been written for it yet.\" Simone has called \"Mississippi Goddam\" her first civil rights song, to be followed by further classics as enduring as \"Four Women\" and \"To Be Young, Gifted and Black.\"\n\n5. Bob Dylan, 'The Times They Are A-Changin' (1964)\n\nThe title track to Bob Dylan's most topical album was a deliberate attempt to write an anthem for the changing times, which is exactly what this song became. Dylan never explicitly references race in a folk song warning congressmen and senators, \"The battle outside ragin' will soon shake your windows and rattle your walls.\" But it captured the mood of the moment, embraced by the civil rights movement, inspiring covers by Nina Simone and Odetta. In the liner notes to \"Biograph,\" the singer explained to Cameron Crowe what he was going for: \"I wanted to write a big song, with short concise verses that piled up on each other in a hypnotic way.\"\n\n4. Billie Holiday, 'Strange Fruit' (1939)\n\nAhmet Ertegun, the co-founder and president of Atlantic Records, once referred to Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit,\" a song she first performed in early 1939, as \"the beginning of the civil rights movement.\" Written in 1937 by Abel Meeropol, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants, it offers an unflinching portrait of the horrors of lynching as a form of racial terrorism, comparing the victims' bodies to a \"strange and bitter crop.\" It's as unsettling as it is profound, and therein lies its power, setting the scene, \"Southern trees bear a strange fruit / Blood on the leaves and blood at the root / Black body swinging in the Southern breeze / Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.\" It only gets darker from there, as shocking decades later as it had to be in 1939. And Holiday's suitably chilling delivery completes the mood.\n\n3. James Brown, 'Say It Loud – I'm Black and I'm Proud' (1968)\n\nThis Black pride anthem is somehow every bit as funky as it is empowering. This is James Brown in his prime as a trailblazing funk pioneer. Of course it's complete with a crowd-pleasing chorus set up as a spirited call and response between the legend and his backup singers for the day, a group of young children. \"Say it loud,\" he demands. \"I'm Black and I'm proud,\" they respond. Brown pulls no punches here, setting the tone for the first verse with \"Some people say we've got a lot of malice / Some say it's a lot of nerve / But I say we won't quit moving until we get what we deserve.\" But the record's most quotable moment comes later, when he rhymes, \"We're people; we like the birds and the bees\" with \"We'd rather die on our feet than be living on our knees.\"\n\n2. The Impressions, 'People Get Ready'\n\nNo lesser an authority than Martin Luther King Jr. named this Curtis Mayfield gospel song the unofficial anthem of the civil rights movement, even though the lyrics don't address the state of race relations as explicitly as other songs that may be vying for that title. There's a reason King so often turned to Mayfield's message of deliverance with its promise of a train a-comin' to motivate his fellow marchers. Whether you believe that train for which \"you don't need no ticket; you just thank the Lord\" is bound for Heaven (the most likely destination) or a better life on earth, there's no doubt many listeners found it easy to imagine their oppressors in the verse that starts, \"There ain't no room for the hopeless sinner who would hurt all mankind just to save his own.\"\n\n1. Sam Cooke, 'A Change is Gonna Come' (1964)\n\nFirst performed in February 1964 on \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson,\" this civil rights anthem draws much of its timeless appeal from the power of Sam Cooke's impassioned delivery, underscored by gorgeous orchestration. You can feel him feeling every word. Although it only briefly touches on discrimination (\"I go to the movie and I go downtown / Somebody keep telling me ‘don't hang around'\"), it couldn't be more obvious what kind of change he's after when he hits you with that gospel-flavored chorus of \"It's been a long, a long time comin' but I know a change gonna come / Oh yes it will.\" The song was partially inspired by an incident in which Cooke and his bandmates tried to register at a \"whites only\" motel in Shreveport, Louisiana, and partially inspired by Bob Dylan's \"Blowin' in the Wind.\"\n\nReach the reporter at ed.masley@arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.

The Alabama Association of Realtors is leading the petition that argues that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention exceeded its authority in issuing the order regarding evictions and that any health concerns have since dissipated since people are now gathering in public without masks. The eviction ban, initially put in place last year, provides protection for renters out of concern that having families lose their homes and move into shelters or share crowded conditions with relatives or friends during the pandemic would further spread the highly contagious virus. The order is now set to expire June 30. The emergency petition asks for a lower court decision blocking the order to go into effect immediately. “Landlords have been losing over $13 billion every month under the moratorium, and the total effect of the CDC’s overreach may reach up to $200 billion if it remains in effect for a year,” the emergency petition says. There have been multiple lawsuits over the eviction ban.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Supporters of efforts to limit cruise ship traffic in the city said they failed to gather enough signatures to qualify their proposals for a vote. A group of Juneau-area residents behind the effort needed to collect signatures from nearly 3,000 registered Juneau voters for each of the three proposed measures to qualify the questions for an Oct. 5 municipal election. Karla Hart, a leader of the group, said the group failed to do so. She declined to say how many signatures were collected, KTOO Public Media reports. Wednesday was the deadline to turn in signatures. One of the proposed measures sought to prohibit cruise ships that carry more than 250 passengers from docking or anchoring in Juneau between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m., and another sought to ban them from docking or anchoring on Saturdays. The third proposal sought to bar cruise ships larger than 100,000 gross tonnage from being at dock or anchor after Jan. 1, 2026. The proposed ballot questions were the subject of vigorous debate in Juneau, where tourism is a major industry, and state and local officials and businesses pushed for cruise ship travel to resume after the pandemic halted cruises last year.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s top health official expressed cautious optimism Friday that Arizona can reach a goal of getting 70% of adults partially vaccinated in the next month. “I just am fearful with our slowdown and decreased demand, it’s going to make it harder to reach that 70%, but I’m hopeful Arizona would,” Dr. Cara Christ, director of the state Department of Health Services, said during a virtual briefing. President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced a “month of action” to urge more Americans to get vaccinated before the July 4 holiday. In Arizona, less than half of the state’s population eligible to receive vaccines has actually been inoculated. Unlike some other states, Arizona has not created any vaccine incentive programs. However, officials are open to partnering on one-time events. The state teamed up with the Arizona Diamondbacks and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona for a family vaccine clinic Saturday at Chase Field offering free tickets for shots. There have been other incentives at the local level. In Pima County, the local health department gave out Arizona Lottery scratcher tickets at two vaccination sites over the Memorial Day weekend. A local chain of marijuana dispensaries in Mesa is offering “Snax for Vaxx,” a free pre-rolled joint and an edible gummy for getting vaccinated.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: One of the state’s largest courthouses is set to reopen to the public after access was limited due to the coronavirus pandemic. The Pulaski County Courthouse in Little Rock is scheduled to reopen Monday. Restrictions on entry into all county facilities by the public have been lifted. All visitors will be required to wear a face mask and have their temperature checked upon entry. Social distancing will also be mandatory in all areas of the courthouse. “We appreciate the support and patience of Pulaski County citizens with our temporary operational area during the last 15 months. It wasn’t ideal, but my office was determined to remain open for business and provide the essential services. We look forward to serving the public inside the various offices once again,” said Pulaski County Circuit and County Clerk Terri Hollingsworth. Coronavirus cases in the state rose by 253 on Friday, while those hospitalized with COVID-19 dropped by two to 178, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. “While we are seeing hopeful COVID-19 progress, let’s continue this trend by ensuring we all play a role in protecting others,” Gov. Asa Hutchinson tweeted Thursday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom played game show host Friday in a drawing for 15 winners of $50,000 prizes for getting vaccinated. “If you’re on the fence, if you’re just a little bit hesitant, or you just were unwilling in the past, but all the sudden you think, ‘Wait a sec, I could really use $50,000,’ we’re doing all of this to encourage that and to get you to think anew and hopefully act anew,” Newsom said at the California State Lottery headquarters, where he was flanked by a machine used to randomly choose winners and a Wheel of Fortune-style colored wheel for show. It was the first in a series of drawings for $16.5 million in prize money aimed at encouraging Californians to get their COVID-19 shots ahead of June 15, when the state plans to lift almost all virus-related restrictions. So far, 67% of eligible people 12 and older have received at least one dose of the vaccine. The state’s goal is to fully vaccinate at least 75% of people. Newsom announced the prize money last week, warning the state’s vaccination rates were about to go off a cliff without an intervention. State officials said rates had dropped at the time by 18% from the week before. This week, another 15 people will win $50,000, and on June 15 there will be 10 grand prize winners who will get $1.5 million each.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state has picked its first $1 million winner in a new lottery aimed at inspiring residents to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Gov. Jared Polis announced Friday that Sally Sliger of the Weld County town of Mead won the first of five $1 million prizes for residents who have received a COVID-19 vaccine. Sliger is a clinical data analyst at Tru Community Care, a Lafayette-based nonprofit health organization that offers hospice and other care. Sliger recounted how she and the community at large have suffered both personally and professionally the loss of neighbors and loved ones during the pandemic. “Like all the rest of us, we have postponed family events,” she said. “We’ve postponed memorial services. … So when the wait was over, there was no doubt I would get my vaccination.” She said she and her husband, Chris, initially planned to bolster their retirement savings and help their children with the winnings. “I am hoping that you all get the vaccine because this is the gift we have right now. This is the gift that keeps on giving,” Sliger said. Every resident who was vaccinated by the end of May was entered in the first of five weekly drawings. Residents needed to be 18 years old and have received at least one dose to be eligible. They didn’t need to register for the drawing, conducted by the Colorado Lottery.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The city’s Puerto Rican Day parade returned to the streets Saturday for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic started, with colorful floats winding their way through neighborhoods. People on the floats and in vehicles in the caravan waved the red, white and blue flags of Puerto Rico and played music as hundreds of onlookers cheered and displayed their own flags. This year’s procession was smaller than in previous years. Last year’s parade was canceled because of the pandemic. Saturday’s event also honored health care workers, first responders and other essential personnel for their work during the pandemic. Parade watcher Juliany Polar said the parade had the atmosphere of a neighborhood party. “People are happy,” Polar told the Hartford Courant. “People are ready to get out and about and enjoy the better weather, the better rates against COVID.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state has seen a 35% increase in the number of people experiencing homelessness in the past year, though local experts say the total is likely far higher due to the challenges of counting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Almost 60% of that increase is among children, according to a recent report from the Housing Alliance Delaware, a statewide nonprofit that performed the count and aims to alleviate issues facing the homeless population. The count didn’t include unsheltered people living in cars and encampments due to COVID-19 precautions and logistical challenges this year – communities that would drive up the total number of people experiencing homelessness across Delaware. “Even though they didn’t count the unsheltered, which should have brought the count down, the count went up by 35%,” said Stephen Metraux, director of the University of Delaware’s Center for Community Research and Service. Experts say the increase in the number of people experiencing homelessness is due to a variety of factors, including a lack of affordable housing and COVID-19 safety concerns that led people to stay in hotels and motels for extended periods of time. In response, increased funds and rapid rehousing programs in the state are helping members of the homeless population find and maintain stable housing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With the resumption of full parking enforcement, residents have been scrambling to find available appointments at the Department of Motor Vehicles, WUSA-TV reports. After a 14-month hiatus due to the pandemic, Mayor Muriel Bowser announced that ticketing wound resume again, including for expired parking meters, expired residential parking permits and expired vehicle tags. Vehicles must also display valid registration stickers. However, due to public health protocols, the DMV currently doesn’t allow walk-ins, and spots must be reserved online. Residents have until July 1 before enforcement for expired driver licenses will resume, according to the city. The mayor announced the plans weeks in advance, but some residents say it was still a struggle even to find a reservation.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state’s chief justice says Florida’s justice system will soon be allowed to resume in-person court proceedings without masks and social distancing rules put in place last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The administrative order issued Friday by Chief Justice Charles Canady would also require courts to take steps to resume rules guaranteeing speedy trials, which were suspended amid the logistical challenges the pandemic posed. The chief justice, however, directed courts to continue conducting most proceedings remotely, such as jury selection, unless an in-person hearing is required. Some proceedings, including hearings to determine whether an individual should be involuntarily committed, would have to be conducted in person unless the requirement is waived by the subject of the hearing. The order said criminal jury trials will be given priority for in-person hearings, while less serious cases will continue to be conducted remotely as part of the transition to pre-pandemic operations. Florida Supreme Court officials said the restrictions are being lifted because of increased vaccination rates and updated guidance from health officials. Chief judges across the state may drop the mask and distancing requirements in courtrooms as soon as June 21 and no later than Aug. 2.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The Biden administration is reevaluating a plan by Georgia officials to overhaul how residents buy health insurance under the Affordable Care Act as federal officials try to boost former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. In a letter to Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services raised concerns about the state’s proposal to have the private sector, not the government, engage in outreach to get residents to sign up for insurance under the ACA. “In its application, Georgia neither quantified the size of the expected investment by the private sector nor indicated any specific commitments by the private sector to engage in outreach and marketing,” the letter sent Thursday said. It asked the governor to reassess his plan to bypass healthcare.gov and have residents shop for federally subsidized health insurance through private agents. Former President Donald Trump’s administration approved that plan last year, and state officials have touted it as a way to boost insurance coverage. A spokeswoman for the governor’s office, Mallory Blount, said Friday that the letter was still being reviewed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige said Friday that the state will drop its quarantine and coronavirus testing requirements for travelers once 70% of the population has been vaccinated against COVID-19. Hawaii will also lift its requirement that people wear masks indoors once that level has been reached, he said. The state Department of Health website said 59% of Hawaii’s population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and 52% have finished their dosing regimen. The state is using its own figures, not those provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to calculate thresholds for lifting restrictions. Health Department Director Dr. Libby Char said that’s because Hawaii’s numbers are more accurate. She said it appears the CDC has been counting some of Hawaii’s doses twice. Right now, travelers arriving from out of state must spend 10 days in quarantine, or, to bypass that quarantine, they must show proof of a negative coronavirus test taken before departure for the islands. Once 60% of Hawaii’s population is vaccinated, Ige said, the state will allow travelers to bypass a quarantine requirement as long as they can prove they were vaccinated in the U.S. Restrictions on travel between the islands will open up before that.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Schools didn’t report the majority of coronavirus cases among the state’s K-12 students in the most recent academic year, the Idaho Capital Sun reports. While state officials count more than 16,000 cases among school-age kids from September through May 22, a website showing cases by school listed only 8,660 known cases in that time period, causing concerns about whether districts and schools are armed with the information they need to prepare for the fall semester. Dr. David Pate, an adviser to Gov. Brad Little and some schools on handling the pandemic, said underfunding, privacy issues, and a lack of coronavirus testing – compounded by Idaho legislators’ rejection of federal funding to expand surveillance – combined to make the already complicated task of tracking COVID-19 outbreaks even more difficult, according to the newspaper.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state announced Friday that it will officially enter Phase 5 of its reopening plan on schedule this week, marking the end of 15 months of capacity restrictions and mandates brought on to help defeat the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said in a press release that with hospitalizations and caseloads declining, not to mention having more than half of the population vaccinated, the time was right to commence the move to full reopening next Friday, June 11. “After a tremendously challenging year, Illinois has now reached a defining moment in our efforts to defeat COVID-19,” Pritzker said. “Thanks to the hard work of residents across the state, Illinois will soon resume life as we knew it before – returning to events, gatherings and a fully reopened economy, with some of the safety guidelines we’ve adopted still in place.” The new guidance means that businesses, sporting events, conventions, theme parks and other events can return to full capacity and attendance, with vaccinated people being allowed to go without their masks, a sign of a return to normalcy that so many across the state have anticipated. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, the director of the Illinois Department of Public Health, said that “the vaccine is giving us our freedoms back and allowing us to move to Phase 5.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A judge will hear arguments this month over whether the governor can go ahead with a lawsuit challenging the power legislators have given themselves to intervene during public emergencies. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb asked a judge in April to block the new law passed by the GOP-dominated Legislature following criticism from many conservatives over COVID-19 restrictions that Holcomb imposed. Attorney General Todd Rokita, also a Republican, has argued he has the authority to stop Holcomb from taking the dispute to court after the Legislature overrode the governor’s veto of the new law. His office’s court filings have called the private lawyers working for Holcomb “unauthorized counsel” in asking for them to be removed from the case. Marion County Judge Patrick Dietrick on Thursday set a hearing about that dispute for June 16. Holcomb and some legal experts maintain the state constitution only allows the governor to call the Legislature into special session after its annual session ends. They argue the constitution doesn’t allow the new process under which legislative leaders could call the General Assembly into what it calls an “emergency session.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A spontaneous scene of joy erupted downtown Friday as the Lauridsen Fountain in Cowles Commons was switched on for the first time since fall 2019. The signature fountain’s jets of water sprang to life in mid-morning Friday. Within the hour, a shirtless, barefoot boy was running amid them and rolling in the shallow pool. By midday, as many as eight other children and two dogs had joined the revelry as the temperature climbed above 90 degrees. The fountain had been shut off for the winter, as usual, when the COVID-19 pandemic struck in March 2020. With public gatherings forbidden and shows at the adjacent Des Moines Civic Center postponed or canceled, Des Moines Performing Arts left the fountain shut down throughout summer 2020. Now, with the coronavirus infection rate waning, the Willis Broadway Series at the Civic Center rescheduled, and free public events planned over the summer on the commons, DMPA has revived the landmark water feature. Completed in 2015 as part of a major redo of the former Nollen Plaza, the so-called zero depth fountain is comprised of 17 arcing jets of water rising from the pavement of Cowles Commons. Lighted at night, they provide a colorful contrast to the illuminated sculpture “Swirl,” by artist Jim Campbell, that dominates the opposite side of the plaza.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state ordered less than 1% of its vaccine allocation from the federal government for last week, the state health department reported Friday. The disclosure came as the department’s data showed that Kansas still had nearly 593,000 unused doses of COVID-19 vaccines as of Friday, about 21% of the 2.8 million shipped to the state. Demand for inoculations has dropped, prompting the state and county health departments to increase mobile clinics and bring vaccines to churches and work sites. The state, Wyandotte County and the University of Kansas Health System partnered with Kansas Speedway to promote vaccinations Thursday and Friday at the Kansas City, Kansas, NASCAR track. The speedway offered people who got vaccinated two laps around its track and entered them in a raffle for prizes that included tickets to the NASCAR Cup Series race there in October. The state health department said it ordered only 1,020 doses, or 0.7% of its federal allocation of 147,660, for last week. Its data showed that an average of 4,348 vaccine shots a day were administered during the seven days ending Friday, its lowest seven-day average since Jan. 21. The department said 42.5% of the state’s 2.9 million residents had received at least one vaccine shot as of Friday.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state joined the giveaway bonanza Friday to entice more people to get COVID-19 vaccines, with Gov. Andy Beshear offering $1 million prizes and college scholarships. Three Kentucky adults will win $1 million prizes, and 15 students ages 12-17 will be awarded full-ride scholarships to a Kentucky public university, college, technical or trade school, he announced. The Democratic governor is hoping the chance at landing a lucrative prize is enough to overcome vaccine hesitancy keeping many Kentuckians from rolling up their sleeves for the shots. “If you’re on the fence, how about a free ride to college?” Beshear said at a news conference. “Or how about the best odds that you will ever have at winning $1 million? All you’ve got to do is the right thing that every public health official in America says you ought to be doing anyway.” To enter the three drawings, Kentucky adults vying for the $1 million prizes must have received at least the first dose of a Moderna or Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine or the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Kentucky youngsters 12-17 must have received at least their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine to be eligible for the scholarships, which will cover tuition, room and board, and books. Drawings will be July 1, July 29 and Aug. 26, with winners announced the next day.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state is adding free entry to all 21 state parks as a perk for getting vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Thursday. Unlike the free drinks available this month at some bars and restaurants around the state, the free admission runs through July for anyone who can prove full vaccination, no matter when, he said. About 32% of all eligible residents have been fully vaccinated, he said. That compares with 41.2% nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Under “A Shot for a Shot,” announced earlier in the week, participating establishments are offering a free drink this month to anyone who shows proof of full vaccination within the previous seven days. The state parks freebie is for visitors as well as state residents. It is part of Louisiana’s “Bring Back the Summer” initiative, Edwards said. He also noted that there are numerous nationwide incentives listed at www.vaccines.gov/incentives.html. “Stay tuned for more incentives and rewards that will be offered in the near future,” he said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s mobile COVID-19 vaccine unit is being redirected to parts of southern Maine later this month and will wrap up service in two weeks. The state has used the mobile unit to provide vaccines to rural and underserved communities. It’s scheduled to continue that effort in Madawaska in far northern Maine through Monday. Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Nirav Shah said the mobile unit will then come to Portland and Old Orchard Beach. Its final day in service will be in Old Orchard Beach on June 18. That represents a shift in strategy for the unit, Shah said. Moving it to high-population centers in its final days will allow it to serve many people before it closes, he said. The unit will also be able to offer some of the numerous hospitality workers in southern Maine a shot, Shah said during a Maine Public appearance Thursday. “For much of the mobile vaccination unit’s drive through Maine, it has focused on rural Maine,” he said. The unit can administer about 500 shots a day, Shah said. It has provided more than 9,000 vaccinations, mostly to rural Maine residents, he said.\n\nMaryland\n\nWestover: Eastern Correctional Institution inmates harvested 13,000 pounds of produce in 2020 despite the constraints of a pandemic. A Somerset County Health Department initiative that started in 2014 aims to address food insecurity and childhood obesity in Somerset County, which has just two grocery stores and a Dollar General, making options for fresh fruits and vegetables slim. Sixteen inmates at ECI work daily throughout the year tilling, weeding and watering – their three gardens have no irrigation system – to grow plants including kale, cabbage, beets, tomatoes, yellow onions, eggplant, cantaloupe, watermelon, zucchini and bell peppers. Their first harvest of the 2021 season weighed in at 764 pounds, which is believed to be the gardens’ largest yield yet for the start of a season. Project director Sharon Lynch of the Somerset County Health Department explained that the boxes will be divvied up among roughly 20 community partners. From there, they will reach family tables in Somerset and Wicomico counties. The program started with a three-quarter-acre plot on the prison property but has since expanded to place a garden on each side of the main prison compound and at the annex.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Four communities that state officials say were shortchanged in federal pandemic relief aid will receive a total of $109 million from the American Rescue Plan Act, Gov. Charlie Baker announced Friday. The communities were among those hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic but, due to shortcomings in the federal funding formula, were set to receive disproportionately smaller amounts of funding compared to other hard-hit communities, the Republican said. “Our Administration committed additional funds to Chelsea, Everett, Methuen and Randolph to ensure all of the Commonwealth’s communities received the funding they deserved from the federal relief package,” Baker said in a statement. The American Rescue Plan Act, signed into law by President Joe Biden this spring, allocated direct aid to some municipalities based on the federal Community Development Block Grant program formula, while aid to other communities was allocated on a per capita basis. The Baker administration said the use of these two different formulas created disparities in distributions. Chelsea, Everett, Methuen and Randolph are the four designated hardest-hit communities to receive disproportionately smaller levels of federal funding compared to other hardest-hit communities.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday vetoed Republican-sponsored legislation that would have exempted high school graduation ceremonies from COVID-19 restrictions on crowd sizes. The veto, which was expected, came two days after her administration’s order was loosened to end outdoor capacity limits and limit indoor gatherings to 50% occupancy. “This bill is a solution in search of a problem,” the Democratic governor wrote to the GOP-led House. “Rather than sending me half-baked and punchless legislation like HB 4728, I encourage the Legislature to join me in eradicating this pandemic and making transformational investments in our economy.” When the measure won final passage more than two weeks ago, Michigan was restricting crowds at many outdoor stadiums to 1,000. At most indoor arenas, the limit was 375. Also Thursday, Whitmer vetoed a bill that would have prohibited a governor from issuing an emergency order extending response times for public-records requests or otherwise limiting a public body’s duties under the Freedom of Information Act. She did so for two months early in the pandemic. The since-expired order, Whitmer said, was designed to protect government officials’ lives during the first surge. She said she will not sign bills that constrain the governor’s ability to protect people.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: U.S. Sen. Tina Smith met with child care leaders and providers Friday to talk about the toll of the pandemic on child care in Central Minnesota. At Blooming Kids Care Center, she toured the facility and talked with owner Abdi Daisane, who said he’s seen a drastic drop in attendance during the pandemic. Affordability of child care, access to culturally sensitive staff and operating costs are significant problems for Minnesotans that have become even more exacerbated in the pandemic, Smith said at the meeting. During a roundtable discussion with Smith at the United Way of Central Minnesota, many of those present talked about the high cost of child care in the area, the need for more centers that are affordable for families, and benefits of public prekindergarten education. Others talked about the high costs associated with operating child care centers, which often leave owners like Daisane to take on second jobs and don’t motivate new people to enter the industry. A Minnesota family can spend tens of thousands of dollars a year on child care costs, equivalent to a semester’s tuition at the University of Minnesota, Smith said, and two-thirds of Minnesota counties are “child care deserts,” meaning there is one spot available at a child care center for every three children in the state.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s top health official said Friday that lack of access isn’t the reason Mississippi is last in the nation for COVID-19 vaccinations – it’s apathy. State Health Officer Dr. Thomas Dobbs said he guarantees the state is among the easiest in the country to get a vaccine, but many people refuse because they don’t think they need it. “I think that’s something that we really struggle with because it’s part of our health care culture here,” he said during a virtual conversation with the Mississippi Medical Association. “It’s really sad because people in foreign countries would saw off their small toe to get a COVID vaccine, and … we’re not going to take five minutes as we walk by the Kroger pharmacy.” Only about 27% of the population is fully vaccinated. Vaccines are available at state-run sites throughout Mississippi that don’t require appointments and can be accessed at dozens of pharmacies, clinics and hospitals, all listed on the Department of Health website. “It’s almost like you need to try to not get the vaccine,” Mississippi Medical Association Executive Director Dr. Claude Brunson said Friday. Dobbs said he has been doing at-home visits personally to vaccinate homebound residents, and he said the Department of Health is exploring incentives and other measures to encourage more vaccinations.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Health officials in Springfield and Joplin are seeing an increase in COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations amid relatively low vaccination rates and more people gathering for social events without masks or social distancing. CoxHealth’s flagship hospital in Springfield had between 35 and 40 COVID-19 patients, more than double the number two weeks ago, CEO Steve Edwards said Thursday. And nearly 20% of patients tested at CoxHealth facilities in southwestern Missouri are testing positive for the coronavirus, up from just 5% two weeks ago, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Three hospitals in Joplin reported a total of 39 COVID-19 patients Wednesday. That figure hovered around 15 in early May, The Joplin Globe reports. The city straddles Jasper and Newton counties, which have relatively low vaccination rates. About 38% of Joplin residents have completed vaccinations, but only 19% of Jasper County residents and 16% of Newton County residents have been vaccinated, according to state data. Edwards said more people have been gathering for events such as graduations, and fewer people are wearing masks or social distancing. He said nurses tell him patients say that they did not think COVID-19 was real and that they wish they had been vaccinated.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A record number of residents are enrolled in the state’s Medicaid expansion program, which provides health insurance for low-income adults, according to the state health department. Nearly 99,000 people were being served by the program in April – 18,300 more than the nearly 80,500 enrolled a year earlier, according to state data. The state stopped disenrolling people from Medicaid programs during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to the higher enrollment numbers, Chuck Council, a spokesperson for the Department of Public Health and Human Services, told Montana Public Radio. The department will resume taking people off the programs if they’re no longer eligible once Montana’s public health emergency ends, Council said. Republican Rep. Ed Buttrey of Great Falls, who co-sponsored the Medicaid expansion legislation, said the program is working as it should. “When we get into hard times, people get into hard times, this is a safety net measure to make sure that folks are not neglecting their health care and that providers are getting paid for the services they provide,” Buttrey said. The previous enrollment high was 96,656 people in August 2018. Medicaid expansion in Montana, which requires participants to pay premiums, is funded with 89% federal money and 11% state money.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The University of Nebraska Medical Center will require faculty, staff and students to document whether they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19 beginning June 21. Documentation is required because medical students work with patients in clinics and hospital wards, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Faculty, staff and students who choose not to get vaccinated will be required to wear masks at medical facilities, and students who are not inoculated might miss out on clinical placements outside University of Nebraska partners. The documentation is only required for the medical center and not other campuses in the University of Nebraska system, said Jane Meza, interim executive director for the office of health security at UNMC and the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Creighton University will require all students to be fully vaccinated at the Omaha and Phoenix campuses starting July 7, said the Rev. Daniel Hendrickson, the university president. Creighton faculty and staff are encouraged but not required to get vaccinated.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Washoe County School District will offer $2,000 hiring and retention bonuses, earmarked from federal pandemic relief funds, to school bus drivers in the wake of a critical shortage ahead of summer school and the 2021-22 school year. A returning driver could make as much as $3,000 in bonuses for returning to the job and referring someone who is hired. District bus drivers get paid between $14.18 and $25.04 per hour and are full-time benefitted employees who are eligible for Nevada’s Public Employees’ Retirement System. The district and the union representing bus drivers have already signed on to a memorandum of understanding for the $2 million proposal. The agreement is slated to go in front of the school board for final approval Tuesday. Meanwhile, Washoe County School District Superintendent Kristen McNeill said the district was working on contingency plans if bus drivers and other support staff don’t show up for work Monday, after rumors that bus drivers and others who were paid for snow days and are expected to work this week without additional pay might not show up. The school year originally was scheduled to end Friday, but three days were added after schools closed for snow and smoke last year.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state House on Friday rejected an attempt to introduce legislation aimed at protecting workers from being punished for getting the COVID-19 vaccine. Rep. Joshua Adjutant, D-Bristol, sought to suspend the rules and introduce a bill prohibiting employers from firing or docking the pay of workers who take up to three days off in connection with vaccination appointments. The goal, he said, was to eliminate a key concern for those who have yet to get inoculated. “I hope this will still do some good for some folks,” he said. Republicans argued the bill was unnecessary given the state’s high rate of vaccination. Rep. Al Baldasaro, R-Londonderry, was particularly scornful. “There comes a time and a place where we all come together and say enough is enough,” he said. During the pandemic, the 400-member House has met at the UNH ice arena, outside on an athletic field, in a parking lot from their cars and, for the past several months, at a Bedford athletic complex. Former House Speaker Dick Hinch, R-Merrimack, died in December, a week after being sworn in at the outdoor ceremony. “We’ve played enough games,” Baldasaro said. “We’re sitting here when we should be in our Statehouse. I hope everyone stands tall and says no.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday signed a bill to end the state’s public health emergency stemming from the coronavirus in the next 30 days. Murphy, a Democrat, signed the bill just a day after the Democrat-led Legislature passed it over objections from Republicans and a loud crowd outside the Senate chamber calling for the measure to be killed. The measure does away with some 100 executive orders, retaining just over a dozen, including one that created moratoriums on evictions and utility shutoffs. It leaves in place an executive order barring the garnishment of stimulus checks and extending certain rulemaking deadlines, among other directives from the governor. “Today’s lifting of the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency is a clear and decisive step on the path toward normalcy,” Murphy in a statement. “The past 15 months have been a challenge, and I thank every New Jerseyan who stayed home, masked up, took precautions to keep this virus in check, and got vaccinated for allowing us to get to this point.” The public health emergency goes back to March of last year, when the first cases were detected in New Jersey, and the state soon became a hot spot. The new law says the state’s mask and distancing requirements cannot be more restrictive than what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State finance authorities have said demand appears to be building for minimum-interest loans aimed at helping small businesses that lost income or experienced major disruptions during the coronavirus pandemic. New Mexico Finance Authority CEO Marquita Russel told a panel of state legislators Wednesday that about 865 businesses have applied for loans worth a combined $65 million since the program was overhauled in March. Reforms to the state’s small-business recovery loan program, signed by Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in early March, doubled the maximum individual loan amount to $150,000 and broadened eligibility after businesses expressed a limited appetite for the original program. “That program, as a result of the changes made to it, really had some traction, and we’ve seen a great deal of interest,” Russel said. The federal government has closed out its Paycheck Protection Program that provided forgivable loans to businesses beginning in April 2020. Restaurants are still in line for federal relief under the Biden administration’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package. New Mexico’s small-business recovery loans are repaid at half the prime rate of interest that commercial banks charge their most creditworthy customers, with zero interest accrued during the first year.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state failed to provide desperately needed protective gear, testing, and help with staffing for group homes serving residents with developmental and intellectual disabilities at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, leaders of those homes and family members told lawmakers at a legislative hearing Thursday. Staffing levels in New York’s system supporting individuals with disabilities have dwindled since the beginning of the pandemic, which advocates say threatens the quality of care for some of the state’s most vulnerable residents. Gov. Andrew Cuomo and lawmakers faced calls Thursday to boost pay for group home workers, require routine coronavirus testing and ensure people with disabilities are a priority in response plans. Among advocates’ concerns is that group homes, unlike nursing homes, aren’t required to regularly test staff for the virus or launch rounds of testing after a resident or staffer tests positive. At least 577 people have died due to confirmed COVID-19 infection at group residences overseen by the state’s Office for People With Developmental Disabilities, according to the agency’s latest data. That tally doesn’t include the number of residents who died at hospitals, or deaths of residents who likely died of COVID-19.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: For the first time since COVID-19 vaccines became available in December 2020, the state declined to accept any more supplies last week. Instead, last week’s requests from North Carolina providers were being fulfilled through transfers from other providers or through requests to local health departments, according to state health officials. “We are currently focusing on prioritizing the in-state inventory of vaccine by using a first-in, first-out strategy so that providers use vaccines by date of expiration in chronological order, as well as transferring vaccine between providers who can use them,” the state Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement Friday. The move comes as North Carolina nears an announcement on additional financial incentives to boost vaccine participation amid a sizable drop in vaccine demand over the past two months. North Carolina had returned more than 1.2 million doses to the federal government as of Friday. Nearly all states have contributed to the federal pool, according to the state Health Department. Data the department released Friday shows a surplus of nearly 2.4 million COVID-19 vaccines waiting for residents to take. The state has also turned down nearly 2.4 million additional shots from its federal allocation.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state is accepting applications for its Medical Marijuana Advisory Board after changes to the panel’s membership by the 2021 Legislature. The Bismarck Tribune reports the deadline to apply is June 30. Current board members’ terms will expire July 31. New membership of the nine-member board includes six people appointed by the governor: a health care provider, a state Health Department representative, a manufacturing representative, a dispensary representative, a registered qualifying patient and a licensed pharmacist. Voters approved medical marijuana in 2016. The 2017 Legislature implemented the program, which has 5,392 active patient cards and eight dispensaries operating in the state, including one in Bismarck.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s firefighters, officers, nurses, doctors and child care providers all worked outside the home throughout the coronavirus pandemic. But who among them deserves a $1,000 bonus check from federal pandemic relief funding allocated to the state has become a heated debate. Three Republican representatives and Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost introduced a plan to give first responders $1,000 checks if they worked full time throughout the pandemic and weren’t disciplined during that time period. Part-time first responders and volunteer firefighters would get $500 checks. But Rep. Erica Crawley, D-Columbus, said she thinks all front-line workers deserve these “hero pay” checks. “I don’t think we should be pitting one essential worker against another,” Crawley said. “We all needed them in their respective fields as we navigated COVID-19.” Shannon Jones, a former Republican state senator who now runs early childhood advocacy group Groundwork Ohio, went a step further, calling it a “punch to the gut” to see the Senate put lines in its budget proposal to prohibit Ohio from giving child care workers these kinds of bonuses. “The average wage for child care professionals is $10.60 per hour,” Jones said. “They could have earned more money on unemployment during the pandemic.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: More than 51,700 residents have qualified for Medicaid since enrollment began last week under an expansion of the program that voters approved last year, state officials said Friday. The Oklahoma Health Care Authority, which oversees the Medicaid program, reported that 51,708 Oklahomans have already qualified for benefits, including about 30,000 from urban areas and more than 21,000 from rural Oklahoma. Benefits will begin July 1. After a decade of Republican resistance, Oklahoma voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment last year to expand eligibility for benefits. Now, an individual who earns up to $17,796 annually, or $36,588 for a family of four, qualifies for Medicaid health care coverage. The Health Care Authority has projected that about 215,000 residents would qualify for expanded Medicaid for a total annual cost of about $1.3 billion. The estimated state share would be about $164 million. But those numbers could be considerably higher given the number of Oklahomans who lost their jobs and work-related health insurance because of the economic shutdown amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Gov. Kate Brown announced Friday that the state is close to lifting masking, physical distancing and capacity restrictions statewide. Last month, Brown set a vaccination goal of 70% of Oregon adults receiving at least their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine before reopening the economy. As of Friday, 66% of residents 18 and up had been vaccinated. “I want to be very clear that we are able to reopen like this because of the efficiency of the vaccines,” Brown said. “However, there are still Oregonians who need to take extra precautions to feel and stay safe.” For more than a year, Oregon has faced some of the nation’s strictest safety measures – county risk levels, mask requirements inside and outside, limited gatherings and restaurants closed for indoor dining. But as vaccination numbers increase, restrictions have been loosened as the state shifts from emergency response to recovery. Last month, Brown set statewide and county vaccination targets, with the hope of reopening the state’s economy by the end of June. Another 127,000 people must be vaccinated to reach the goal of 70%. “This has really become a tale of two pandemics. If you are vaccinated, then you’re safe; you can carry on safely without wearing a mask and social distancing,” Brown said. “If you are not vaccinated, this virus still poses a very real threat.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Bike riders won’t need their shirts, pants, skirts or even underwear – just a mask. Organizers of the annual Philly Naked Bike Ride say this year’s event will take place Aug. 28 and will require masks, based on the city’s earlier coronavirus restrictions. The city lifted most of its COVID-19 rules last week, citing an increase in vaccinations and a decrease in cases. But ride organizers said they hadn’t had a chance to chat since the city’s guidelines changed, so for the time being, they’re “going to stick with our initial mask guidance.” Lead organizer Wesley Noonan-Sessa said they’ll keep an eye on what the city says in the next month or so. Ride participants, sometimes in the thousands, usually gather in a park to strip off their clothes and paint each other’s bodies before carefully hopping on their bikes. The naked ride aims to promote positive body image, advocate for the safety of cyclists and protest dependence on fossil fuels. Riders pedal a 10-mile course while taking in sights including Independence Hall, the Liberty Bell and the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s steps, featured in the “Rocky” movies. The coronavirus pandemic slammed the brakes on the ride that had been planned for last year. Organizers said then that canceling the 2020 event was “the most responsible thing to do.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s restaurant industry, with the backing of some lawmakers, wants to extend a pandemic state-of-emergency rule that allows eateries to sell alcohol along with takeout orders. With indoor dining banned or limited for long stretches during the crisis of 2020, it was a way for restaurants make up for lost sales. Sam Glynn, owner of Chomp Kitchen & Drinks in Providence, said when restaurants were first reopening after last spring’s lockdown, takeout drink orders made up as much as a quarter of his sales. That has dropped to closer to about 10% as indoor dining has returned to near-normal. He would like to see the rule made permanent. “I remember when it first passed, people were concerned it would get taken advantage of, but it hasn’t been a problem, and now it just allows people to have some of the experience of going out for drinks when they are home,” Glynn said. The House passed a bill in March that would allow beer, wine and cocktails to be sold with takeout orders through the end of this year. An initial Senate version of the legislation would have made the last call for takeout drinks the end of 2022, but that was dialed back to March 2022 in a revised version that passed the Senate special legislation committee Wednesday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: People who get vaccinated against COVID-19 at breweries in the state this month will receive a free beer as part of an effort to get shots into the arms of young adults, the health department announced Thursday. The “Shot and a Chaser” events are scheduled throughout June at participating breweries across the state as part of a partnership between the Department of Health and Environmental Control and the South Carolina Brewers Guild. Trained medical professionals will offer the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine; people who get their shot on site can get a free beer or soda. Some sites will also offer the two-dose Moderna vaccine. “Young adults are often busy travelers and incredibly social, so we want to make sure they get their shot to protect themselves and others while visiting restaurants, vacationing and attending various events,” Dr. Edward Simmer, the agency’s director, said in a statement. The campaign targets young adults in the state, health officials said. Fewer than 16,000 people between the ages of 20 and 24 have been vaccinated in the state, according to DHEC data – equaling less than 1% of all vaccinated people in South Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: In a sign of meatpacking workers becoming emboldened by the pandemic’s health threats and economic repercussions, the union at a local pork processing plant that experienced a bad coronavirus outbreak last year has overwhelmingly rejected a contract offer from Smithfield Foods and will next move to bring the prospect of a strike to the negotiating table. The Sioux Falls chapter of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union said 99% of union members who voted on the new contract offered from Smithfield Foods rejected it. Throughout the pandemic, workers have organized around pushes for workplace safety and are now navigating an economy where some slaughterhouses, desperate for employees, have suddenly boosted wages. Smithfield Foods downplayed the contract rejection, saying it was a “routine” part of negotiations. But the UFCW plans to vote Monday on whether to authorize a walkout. Union leaders said they view striking as a last resort, as they push for a base wage of $19 an hour to match the rate at a JBS pork plant 70 miles away in Minnesota. Slaughterhouse jobs usually offer elevated wages and benefits in exchange for the bloody, back-breaking work on butchering lines. But the wage gap is closing between meatpacking jobs and those at fast-food chains or retail stores, union leaders warned.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Summer concerts returned in the city’s post-pandemic restriction era with the OUTLOUD Music Festival over the weekend. “It feels good to be back out,” said Jack Davis, founder of Good Neighbor Festivals. The two-day festival Friday and Saturday featured 18 solo acts, music groups and bands and was billed as “a celebration of LGBTQ+ artists and allies.” OUTLOUD is not to be confused with the annual Nashville Pride Festival, which is traditionally held in June. This year’s event was postponed until September due to the pandemic. Friday’s OUTLOUD lineup featured Japanese Breakfast and Tank and the Bangas as the headliners. The latter headlined again Saturday along with Todrick Hall. It was OUTLOUD’s fifth year holding a concert series, with similar events to this weekend’s held from 2017 to 2019. Organizers held a drive-in concert in 2020 due to COVID-19 restrictions. “It was a good learning experience that I never want to do again,” Davis joked. OUTLOUD serves as one of many unofficial ends to the COVID-19 era in Nashville. For weeks the city has lowered restrictions at restaurants, bars, sporting events and concert venues as the vaccinated population rose to nearly 1 of every 2 Nashvillians having received at least one dose.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: After a hiatus caused by the coronavirus pandemic, Eric Munscher of Houston returned to the Austin lakefront restaurant County Line over the weekend – not for its barbecue but for its turtles. On Saturday morning, Munscher of the Turtle Survival Alliance and a handful of other volunteers gathered at the restaurant, which sits on Bull Creek near Lake Austin, to resume a study of the abundant turtles in the area. “It’s just neat to finally be out again and getting people to come see the turtles,” said Munscher, director of the alliance’s North American Freshwater Turtle Research Group. With fishnets in tow, they dived into the water to catch, identify and tag turtles. They returned Sunday to continue their work and to celebrate the six different local species at the Turtlemania fundraiser, where people can drink beer and save turtles. Proceeds from the event, featuring discounted beer from the Celis Brewery, are earmarked to help fund the Turtle Survival Alliance’s research. Munscher, who occasionally watched the turtles through the restaurant’s online “turtle cam” during the pandemic, said the group plans to return again in the fall, when he said they hope to open the volunteer opportunity to more members of the public after further progress in vaccinations in economic reopening.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: If not for a special pot of federal COVID-19 relief funding meant to help foster kids and young adults who have left the system, Olivia Kilfoyle worries about what could have been. Thanks to the funding, she recently moved into an apartment and has a place to call home. Without the help – part of some $343.5 million in all meant to help foster kids and former foster youth around the country contend with the fallout from the pandemic – she worries she may have joined the ranks of the homeless, the Standard-Examiner reports. “It put me in a safe place,” said Kilfoyle, 21, a former foster child now living on her own. Now, state officials who help foster kids and those who have aged out of the system are putting out a call. Utah received $2 million, and funds are still available for those in need. “Please get in contact if you’re out there and need help,” said Aubrey Adams, who aids the population as a program administrator with the Utah Department of Human Services’ Division of Child and Family Services. Funds can help with back rent, apartment deposits, car repairs, some schooling-related expenses and more, she said. The program is meant for those 14 and older in foster care but is also geared to some adults as old as 27 who no longer receive care but did at some point after the age of 14.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state has launched an economic recovery program for businesses that have not received prior state and federal pandemic-related funding and for others that continue to suffer pandemic-related losses. The program is expected to deliver $30 million in federal financial relief to businesses that were ineligible for state and federal funding and to businesses that can show a continued loss of revenues, Gov. Phil Scott said. “As we move out of the pandemic emergency and into our long-term recovery, it’s so important that we support Vermont’s small businesses and employers, who are the backbone of our economy,” Scott said Thursday. “These grants will provide critical relief in the short term, allowing them to rebuild a stable foundation for their economic futures.” The state will start taking applications for the Economic Recovery Bridge Program on Monday. Grants will be issued on a first-come, first-served basis. In the first 30 days, priority will be given to businesses that have not received or do not have a pending application for any state or federal financial assistance in 2020 or 2021, officials said. More information is available online on the Agency of Commerce and Community Development Recovery Resource Center website.\n\nVirginia\n\nMount Solon: After a year’s hiatus due to the coronavirus, Red Wing Roots music festival is back and set to sell out quick, according to festival organizers. “We are thrilled to be coming together after such a long, difficult time,” said Michael Weaver, co-founder of the festival. “We anticipate a lot of emotion. For sure, it will be a year unlike any other.” The festival, the brainchild of local band The Steel Wheels, is focused on finger-picking, bluegrass and American roots music. It is also a way to bring the band back home to the area each summer. The music festival, which takes place at Natural Chimneys Park in Mount Solon, will be held July 9-11. In addition to The Steel Wheels, other 2021 headliners include Yarn, Asleep at the Wheel, The Mavericks, Dustbowl Revival and Tim O’Brien Band. Since it began in 2013, Red Wing has emphasized great music, great food and great fun for the entire family in the great outdoors, a release said. This year, the festival will have featured musical performances on five stages, along with regional food trucks with options for craft beer, cider and wine.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state is joining the trend of offering prizes to encourage people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, with Gov. Jay Inslee on Thursday announcing a series of giveaways that includes lottery drawings totaling $2 million, college tuition assistance, airline tickets and game systems. The incentive program, called “Shot of a Lifetime,” applies to those who start the vaccination process this month, as well as residents who are already inoculated. “This is a very, very commonsense investment to save lives,” Inslee said. Starting Tuesday, the state lottery will hold two drawings a week for four weeks, one for adults and another for those ages 12-17. The lottery cash prize will start out with a weekly prize of $250,000 through the end of June. On July 13, a final $1 million drawing will be held. In addition, the state’s public four-year universities and two-year community and technical colleges will receive nearly $1 million to run their own drawing for free tuition and expenses for vaccinated students. The state lottery will also hold drawings to offer 30 prizes of one-year of tuition college credits to 12- to 17-year-olds through the state’s Guaranteed Education Tuition program, with the credits going directly to the students’ families.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice has called a special session of the Legislature aimed at allocating federal pandemic relief funding and increasing funds for road improvements. Justice announced that the session will begin Monday at noon. Lawmakers were already scheduled to be in Charleston for June committee meetings, he said. The Legislature will consider allocating federal relief funds to the Department of Health and Human Resources and the Department of Education, Justice said in a statement. The funding was received after the end of the regular legislative session, he said. He also wants lawmakers to consider allocating $150 million from the state’s general fund to the Division of Highways for road projects. Justice said it would fund 702 miles of road paving and projects on 40 bridges across all 55 counties. West Virginia’s aging infrastructure often receives a failing grade. Voters approved a $1.6 billion bond measure called Roads to Prosperity in 2017 that the governor championed to improve public works.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers made it official Saturday, announcing his bid for a second term in the battleground state where he stands as a Democratic check on the Republican-controlled Legislature. Evers, 69, said he decided to run again because he has unfinished business and needs to remain able to stop Republicans through his veto powers, especially as they advocate for election law changes that would make it harder to vote by absentee ballot. “Even though I haven’t played much hockey, I have come to appreciate the role of being a goalie,” Evers said. He announced his plans during the Wisconsin Democratic Convention, which was held virtually Saturday for a second year in a row. The first 31/ 2 years of Evers’ term have been marked by clashes with the GOP-led Legislature and his handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Republicans brought successful lawsuits accusing Evers of overstepping his authority with closures, capacity limits and mask orders meant to slow the spread of the virus. Evers said his handling of the pandemic saved lives, and he listed it as “easily the most important thing that we’ve done.” Wisconsin Republican Party spokeswoman Anna Kelly accused Evers of a multitude of failures, including not getting kids back to school sooner and not getting benefits to the unemployed quickly enough.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Health concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic have changed how ticketing will be handled at this year’s Cheyenne Frontier Days, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. The “World’s Largest Outdoor Rodeo and Western Celebration” is switching to a mostly virtual system for the July 23-Aug. 1 event, which was canceled last year for the first time in its 125-year history. Digital tickets can be scanned via an app or browser on a smartphone, and those who opt for printed tickets will face steep surcharges, according to the newspaper. Few other pandemic-related precautions are planned, with crowds allowed at full capacity and no mask requirements.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/09/paula-cooper-executioner-within/93650408/", "title": "Indiana killer Paula Cooper: The Executioner Within", "text": "Robert King\n\nrobert.king@indystar.com\n\nThis 13-chapter story, told as a real-life novel, raises questions about race, justice, poverty and abuse. But it is also the story about the human capacity for forgiveness and a young woman’s struggle to find peace.\n\nStill shrouded in darkness, she sat alone in her car, parked between night and day, between this world and the next.\n\nBehind her, a family of teddy bears sat strapped in by a seat belt. In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers.

It was a thoughtful public discussion of obesity, mental health and wellness.\n\nI offer my deepest thanks to dietitian Jacque Schwartz of Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, Dr. Eric Barlow, psychiatrist from Compass Clinical in Urbandale, and trainer Nate Yoho of CrossFit Merle Hay.\n\nRegular readers have read many a praiseful paragraph about these people, as well as Dr. Shawna Basener, my family doctor, who could not attend, and my psychologist, who chooses to remain anonymous in these columns.\n\nThe event allowed a lot of people to learn just how spectacular these people are and how much the care about not only my personal health but that off all their patients and clients.\n\nOne of the points I emphasized in response to an audience question is one that I want to make here: It is essentially that you connect with your healthcare providers on an intellectual and emotional level.\n\nI’m not a fan of the word “providers” when describing the people have helped me to lose nearly 100 pounds in the last year. I prefer the term “partners.”\n\nThis isn’t just semantics. A partnership is a dynamic in which both people involved benefit from progress. I believe every member of my team is invested in my continued improvement. And if you can’t say that about your doctor, your coach or mental health professional, they it might be time to make a change.\n\nAn intimate relationship with your team is essential. You have to be able to trust doctors and therapists with your worries, be open about uncomfortable things in your life, with your body and goals.\n\nBarlow brought up an interesting point during the event. He said he wished he could have similar meetings with the health care teams that worked with his regular patients.\n\nThe realities of the daily practice of medicine prevents regular face-to-face meetings between physicians, mental health professionals, trainers and dieticians.\n\nBut all professionals present agreed the holistic approach would benefit patients. Hopefully, as the medical field continues to evolve from reactive care to preventative care, we will figure out better ways for medical professionals to communicate more effectively between offices and across disciplines.\n\nThe most surprising question of the evening came from my dear friend Tyler Teske, a fellow East High School alumnus, who showed up to support his old locker mate.\n\nTyler asked me if my experiences working to curb morbid obesity, contain my mood disorders and other issues helped me redefined the meaning of health for me.\n\nThe question gave me pause.\n\nThe truth is I don’t think I ever gave much thought to a definition of health until mine failed me. I never thought about the long-term consequences of what I put in my body, how sedentary my life had become or the psychological consequences of those actions or inactions, as the case may be.\n\nI think I thought healthy simply meant not being sick. But now I know it is much more than that. It is more than just diet, exercise, medicine and maintenance.\n\nHealth, to me, is not merely the absence of illness, but the presence of wellness. And wellness, like life itself, is not a destination but a journey.\n\nHere is to Year 2 of Making Weight. As always, I thank you for reading and wish you the love, dignity and respect all humans deserve.\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 12, 2016\n\nAnxious days\n\nI’ve really been struggling with my anxiety disorder the last week or so.\n\nThat’s bad news on multiple fronts.\n\nFirst, panic attacks stink. My heart races. I sweat. My hands shake. It feels as if I’m in the middle of a life-threatening situation just sitting in my apartment trying to watch the NBA Playoffs.\n\nThe worst attacks feel like my skin is itching on the inside.\n\nSecondly, anxiety spurs binge eating. Panic attacks are chemical imbalances in the brain. Biologically, my body will do whatever it thinks is necessary to restore proper chemical balance.\n\nMedication helps. But in the throes of the attack, I’m prone to hit the fridge or drive the restaurant. And I’m not likely to pick green beans or broccoli when I get there.\n\nI’m looking for a tiny boost of serotonin, the most common and one of the most powerful naturally occurring mood regulators in the brain.\n\nSometimes that comes from fried food or pizza or whatever.\n\nOne day last week, in a fit of anxiety, I plowed through a pound of boneless chicken wings and a pound of taco meat slathered on cheese sauce.\n\nIt felt great for all of 15 minutes. The good vibes from the short serotonin burst quickly faded. The anxiety again churned my gut. This time the cause was simple: I’d ingested a lot of calories at a time when I’m trying to lose weight.\n\nThe third thing I do when my anxiety is bad is buy things I don’t need with money I don’t have. The effect on mood is the same as overeating. It feels really great to get a new toy, book or movie for my collection.\n\nBut again the anxiety resurges, because I’ve spent money meant for rent, groceries, retirement or other necessities.\n\nAs I have written many times, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and eat yourself into an early grave.\n\nThe most obvious question here that if I recognize the destructive nature of these patterns, why, then, don’t I simply stop them?\n\nI’ve written before about schema. These are the behavior patterns we all develop to negotiate the world. A simple schema would be not putting our hands on hot burners to avoid being burned.\n\nThese schemata form when we’re young. And you really can’t change them. What you do is build new ones to create new behavior patterns that are more constructive.\n\nLet me assure you typing that sentence is a lot easier than acting on it. My schemata are deeply rooted and hard to override.\n\nI won’t get into the details of my childhood other than to say it was chaotic. I learned to take pleasure in food and presents. These things gave me the security and comfort in ways my family situation did not.\n\nThe trouble is the emergencies of my childhood have long since passed, but the patterns of behavior remain. And so, too, does the nagging anxiety.\n\nSometimes I can tell what causes a panic attack. I can trace it to an incident or problem I’m having. Other times, panic seems to strike me from what I like to call “free-floating anxiety.”\n\nOne afternoon last week, I dozed off during a basketball game. I woke up in a full-blown panic attack. Was I ruminating on some troublesome problem in a dream? It’s impossible to say.\n\nThe good news is I have a terrific support system in place. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my first set of parents died, are always there for comfort and support. My girlfriend takes many late night calls, as does my saintly therapist who helps me break the cycle of anxiety.\n\nStill, these cycles are exhausting. The drain my creative energy and I find myself cold, distant and detached from the people I love the most.\n\nI should also mention that the transcranial magnetic stimulation treatments, or TMS, that I underwent last year do not directly treat anxiety.\n\nI consider that treatment a resounding success. It sent my depression into remission or, at least, severely curtailed it. I have not suffered a major depressive episode since I completed the treatment in December.\n\nI controlled the anxiety with prescription medication. And my talk therapist and I work every two weeks to find ways for me to break the negative thoughts that spiral into dark thinking.\n\nThere was, at least, one spot of positive news on the Making Weight front. At my latest weigh in, I lost 11.8 pounds in a month.\n\nThat brings my total weight loss up to 99.8 pounds since the journey began more than a year ago.\n\nI know there is a long way to go before I’m anything approaching fit. I also know all too well there will be bad days ahead, both mentally and physically.\n\nBut even an anxiety junkie like me can say losing nearly 100 pounds is a good day.\n\nFRIDAY, MAY 6, 2016\n\nTalking ' Making Weight'\n\nDaniel Finney recently spoke to Iowa Public Radio about his one year anniversary of Making Weight. Take a listen to the conversation below:\n\nMAKING WEIGHT EVENT\n\nJoin Register columnist Daniel Finney for a talk about a year in his effort to lose weight and regain his health. Meet some of the people who've helped him along the way, including trainer Nate Yoho, physical therapist Stefanie Kirk, dietitian Jacque Schwartz, physician Dr. Shauna Basener and psychiatrist Dr. Eric Barlow. The talk, which is free and open to the public, is scheduled for Thursday, May 12 from 5 to 6 p.m. at the Wellmark YMCA of Greater Des Moines, 501 Grand Ave. To register, visit: https://tickets.desmoinesregister.com/e/making-weight-one-mans-journey-from-fat-to-fit/tickets.\n\n\n\nTHURSDAY, MAY 5, 2016\n\nFat jokes\n\nCriticism comes with being a columnist. It’s only fair. This newspaper gives me a lot of space to share my opinions. It’s reasonable some people will disagree, even vehemently so.\n\nBut there’s one trend I notice in negative responses I receive that I struggle to understand.\n\nFor example, a reader who disagreed with my column in which I said convicted murderer Joseph “Jo-Jo” White Jr. should never be released from prison wrote this email response:\n\n“I find it difficult to believe that one who has done such damage to his own body can pass judgment on another judged by the state to have committed a terrible crime against another human being.”\n\nThat's a whopper of a non-sequitur, but if I translate this correctly, it really says, “You’re fat. You shouldn’t have an opinion about a murderer getting released from prison.”\n\nAnother reader, who described himself as a 31-year journalist, did not care for my profile of Drake University President Earl “Marty” Martin. After he finished his criticism of that piece, he added:\n\n“Eagerly awaiting your next ‘Really folks, I’m trying to lose weight … oops, I gained 7 pounds’ series. I do wish you good health.”\n\nAside from having severe doubts about the sincerity of the writer’s wishes for my good health, I’m stumped by those sentences.\n\nA generous reading of the email might suggest he’s simply not a fan of anything I write for the paper. Or perhaps in the heat of writing an email — that “firing off a note” cliche comes from somewhere — his desire to get a really cutting line typed overcame his sense of decorum.\n\nI can understand that. It’s happened to me as a writer more times than I would like to admit.\n\nBut I think he threw in the dig about my recent gain of 7 pounds as simple spite.\n\nIt is as if he did not have enough confidence in his original criticism and decided, “You know what? I'll throw the fat thing in there, too.”\n\nThis is where I get confused. I understand disagreement with my work. But I don’t understand the base need to attack me or anyone else because of their weight, body size or appearance.\n\nPlease don’t read this as “woe is me.” It isn’t. As I said, I understand criticism comes with job.\n\nBut cruelty does not — and it shouldn’t come with anyone’s job. It genuinely troubles me that people think pointing at fat people and laughing is still acceptable.\n\nI’ve written before how I cringed when retired late night TV host David Letterman riffed on New Jersey Gov. Chris Cristie’s weight. There are many things about Christie ripe for lampooning, but his weight seems the least and laziest of topics.\n\nBut it isn’t just comedians and emailers. Making fun of fat people for sport is commonplace.\n\nThe cruel website peopleofwalmart.com posts unflattering pictures of shoppers at the retail chain, many of them holding obese people up for ridicule.\n\nI have a friend who once posted a picture of an obese woman riding her scooter through the drive-through of a fast food restaurant. He made comments I thought were mean and I posted a response. We argued a bit. Nothing came of it.\n\nSomeone will almost certainly accuse me of being politically correct for pleading with the public to be kind to obese people, myself included.\n\nI am OK with that. Political correctness, though it can be overdone, is simply people asking others to describe them with dignity and respect. All people deserve that.\n\nUnderlying all these “fat funnies,” I believe, is the myth that obesity is a simple problem of self-control. Put down the fork. Eat less. Move more.\n\nIf you’re fat, the thinking goes, it’s your fault.\n\nThere are reams of scientific research that show obesity has roots in genetics, changes in the makeup and portions of food we eat, socio-economic status, childhood trauma and a host of other issues.\n\nBut instead of scientific evidence, which the public seems all too eager to ignore, I will appeal on humane grounds.\n\nI am not an overly religious person, but I believe the Sermon on the Mount attributed to Christian savior Jesus Christ is probably the finest treatise on how humans should treat one another ever written.\n\nI won’t quote it here because this is not Sunday School. I encourage you to Google it sometime and keep an eye on the lines about mercy.\n\nThen consider whether we might not have a much better world if we focused on mercy instead of fat jokes.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 21, 2016\n\nControlling hunger\n\nSometimes it’s tough having a former U.S. Army Ranger as your psychologist.\n\nI sank into his recliner last week feeling glum.\n\nMy weight was up. I worked with my nutritionist. We decided to trim my daily calorie goal by 200 in an effort to restart the weight loss.\n\nBut I was really feeling the difference. I found myself thinking about eating a lot more than I had at any point since I began this effort to lose weight and regain my health.\n\nI complained of the problem to my therapist, who asks not to be identified in these columns because of the work he does with public safety agencies.\n\nMy therapist told me a story about Ranger survival training when he and his troop were on one ration a day.\n\n“The first few days, you were so hungry you would drink swamp water just to have something in your stomach,” he said.\n\nWell, then. I guess it isn’t all that bad after all.\n\nEating is a biological necessity. But hunger pangs can be controlled in much the same way I work to wrangle anxiety when it bubbles in my brain.My therapist wasn’t going with tough love, though. He was making a point.\n\nThe best tactic I’ve found for stemming panic attacks before they blossom – besides prescription medication, of course – is by breaking the cycle of thinking that causes panic to spiral.\n\nSometimes this is phoning a friend. Other times it’s distracting myself with a good book or even taking a nap.\n\nI’ve found the same tactics in nursing my way through attacks of hunger pangs, with a few exceptions.\n\nTV is rarely a good pick because if you’re feeling hungry there are a lot of commercials about food and none of them are particularly healthy options.\n\nBut favorite movies on DVD or a Netflix binge watch is much better than a food binge in the kitchen.\n\nConversation is always good, but don’t ruminate on food. I might call my girlfriend and complain about being hungry, but we switch topics fairly quickly to the latest antics of her cats.\n\nI call my friend Paul in Memphis to talk about how bad the summer movie slate looks. And so on.\n\nI want to make a couple of points here. I’m not talking about starving myself. That’s just as unhealthy as eating junk food.\n\nI’m talking about the hunger pangs that come not from the biological need to eat but thinking about food, being tempted by the smell of a favorite dish or the reflex desire to eat out of sheer boredom.\n\nI struggle with bored eating lot. I find myself looking into the refrigerator for entertainment rather than sustenance.\n\nAnother appetite control technique I’ve learned: Avoid fast foods. I don’t mean the drive-through restaurants. I mean premade foods that you can pop in the microwave or tear into like potato chips or other snack food.\n\nMost of my grocery bill goes to fresh veggies, meats, a few fruits, eggs and so on. The only quickie foods I have on hand are protein bars, which are low in calories and high in nutrients. So if I do break down and have an unnecessary snack, noshing on one of those isn’t a terrible choice.\n\nThe best thing, though, is a distraction. And the good thing about my apartment it is that it’s stacked ceiling to floor with books, movies and music. I can always find something to do besides eat.\n\nSo far it’s worked. As of this writing, I’ve stayed within my new calorie goal for 21 consecutive days. We’ll see how well it’s paid off at my next weigh in in a week or so.\n\nTHURSDAY, APRIL 14, 2016\n\nA setback amid celebrations\n\nLast week, we celebrated the one-year anniversary of Making Weight, my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI wrote a big front-page story in the April 10 edition. We hosted a Facebook Live chat on Facebook.com/DesMoinesRegister. (Click here to watch a replay.)\n\nI received dozens of emails, letters and phone calls. Almost all praised me and several readers shared their own experiences.\n\nIt felt great.\n\nThis doesn’t: I’ve gained 7.2 pounds since my last weigh in.\n\nIt is the biggest single weight gain I’ve had between benchmarks since I started the process.\n\nI can easily find where I got off track.\n\nI bought foods that I shouldn’t have, like peanuts, which are high in nutrients but also heavy in fats. In the recommended servings, they’re a fine snack.\n\nBut the recommended serving is very small. But I take a handful and then another and then another. And pretty soon a half pound of nuts has been consumed.\n\nThey are a poor choice to have in the house.\n\nI didn’t do much better eating out. A while back, I had some nachos for the first time in a while. It was like an alcoholic trying to take a single drink.\n\nPretty soon nachos were regular meals. Sometimes, I’m ashamed to admit, those nachos were “appetizers” followed by full meals.\n\nI got sick in late February and early March. I missed several sessions at the gym. And I didn’t eat well during that down time.\n\nI looked at MyFitnessPal, the smartphone app I use to track calories. Some days I hadn’t logged all my calories. Other days, I blew my calorie goal.\n\nI think I blew my calorie goal for seven out of 10 days at one point in March.\n\nNow, the weight gain is not all bad. The computer at Mercy Weight Loss and Nutrition Center in Clive gives me information about water weight and muscle mass.\n\nSince my workouts with Nate Yoho, owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, began in February, my muscle mass has increased by more than 6 pounds.\n\nThat’s terrific news. As Nate says: “You don’t get stronger by adding fat.”\n\nI am getting stronger. But I’ve also added some fat.\n\nI worked with dietitian Jacque Schwartz at the Nutrition Center. I decided to reduce my daily calorie goal from 2,700 to 2,500.\n\nAs of this writing, I’ve stayed at or below that goal for 13 days in a row.\n\nBut that’s come with its own side effect: I’m hungry.\n\nSince this journey began, I’ve been able to lose weight largely without major hunger pangs.\n\nYet I feel them with this 200-calorie cut. They’re manageable. If I get too hung up on them, I do what I always do when I get locked into a pattern of negative thinking: I phone a friend.\n\nSometimes it’s my therapist. Sometimes it’s a text message to Nate. Sometimes I call my girlfriend or my buddy, Paul, in Memphis, Tenn.\n\nWith my girlfriend and Paul, we don’t necessarily talk about eating and food. Sometimes we talk about movies, TV and sports — just anything to break the loop of thinking.\n\nPretty soon I forget about being hungry.\n\nWhat I don’t want to forget, however, is that are these lapses are natural.\n\nI’m not going to spend a lot of time beating myself up about this. Yeah, I gained some weight. But I have all the tools in place to lose that again and make more progress.\n\nAnd I’ve already taken action to stop the current slide. There’s been a lot of broccoli and green beans consumed in my house recently. My George Foreman Grill is getting a lot more work.\n\nWith hard work and continued vigilance, I’ll have a lot better news to report the next time I step on that scale.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 31, 2016\n\nThrowing weight around\n\nI stayed in bed Monday morning and pulled the covers over my head.\n\nI fiddled with a “Star Wars” video game on my smartphone when the alert from my calendar popped up. It was time to go to the gym.\n\nI did not want to go. I spent part of the weekend, as did many of my colleagues, covering the deaths of four people in a tragic head-on crash on Interstate 80 near Waukee.\n\nAmong the dead were two Des Moines police officers. I did not know the officers personally, but I worked as a police reporter for several years before eventually becoming a columnist.\n\nMy uncle Larry was a Des Moines cop. I’ve spent years learning about police procedure, tactics, their mindset, the challenges and struggles of the job.\n\nIn the process, I’ve gotten to know some law enforcement professionals very well. Some I call close friends. And I felt their grief even though it was not mine to carry directly.\n\nI was having a hard time with my emotions after writing about the incident. In fact, my brain chemistry was so jumbled up that I took some time off just to attempt to relax.\n\nI want to be very clear: I do not equate the emotional state I was in with that of those who lost loved ones, including the police.\n\nMy struggles were insignificant and infinitesimal compared to those who lost a son, a daughter, a mother, a father, colleague, friend and so on.\n\nStill, I did, in fact, have an emotional reaction to those officers’ deaths, and the last thing I wanted to do was go to the gym.\n\nBut I thought of the officers who reported for duty the next day and did a job far tougher than stacking paragraphs. The absolute minimum I could do was get out of bed and go to the gym.\n\nWhen I arrived at CrossFit Merle Hay, my coach, Nate Yoho, spotted something off about me right away as we began warm-up stretching.\n\n“You look like you have a lot on your mind,” he said.\n\nWe talked about the sad events of the weekend and where my head was at.\n\nNate knows tragedy. I first met him after his wife, Laura, died of brain cancer and their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months later.\n\nNate, of course, isn’t a therapist. But he’s a smart man and one whose experiences grant him good perspective.\n\nWe talked while I worked out. As the sweat ran, my heart rate picked up and my blood pumped, I was able to focus on something other than the confused set of emotions rattling around in my mind.\n\nNate put me through paces on a deadlifting exercise. For some time, I’ve joked to Nate that I was looking forward to the day when I could throw weights on the floor.\n\nThe fitter and more experienced athletes in Nate’s gym do a variety of lifts that after they’re done, they simply let the heavy weights fall to the ground rather than risk injury by trying to lower them to the ground.\n\nUntil that session, Nate worked gingerly adding weight to my deadlifts because of my tender, oft-injured back.\n\nPerhaps sensing I was ready for a challenge or simply that I needed to put my mind to work on something other than sadness, he challenged me with the heaviest weight I had deadlifted to that point.\n\n“When you’re done with your reps, I want you to drop that bar on the ground,” Nate said.\n\nHe showed me the proper technique. I lifted. I focused on breathing and form. And when my reps were done, I let loose of that bar.\n\nIt slammed into the rubberized floor with a satisfying clatter. I lifted my arms in the air with some sense of relief.\n\nThrowing that weight on the floor did not erase my sadness. But it sure helped.\n\nAnd my exchanges with Nate that day made me realize how much I had come to trust this man with both my physical health but also as a friend and confidant.\n\nThat epiphany did lift my mood. Because among the best medicine for sadness is the knowledge that you are not alone in this world.\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 24, 2016\n\nMental, physical health linked\n\nI recently wrote about a woman who is dying of lung cancer. Someone asked me if the subject of my story smoked. She didn't.\n\nThe question is, in a way, a natural outgrowth of decades of anti-smoking campaigns. The link between smoking and lung cancer is scientific fact.\n\nBut an unintended consequence of those campaigns is that when people suffer from lung cancer, there is almost an attitude of, “Well, they deserved to die wheezing because they were stupid enough to smoke.”\n\nI thought about the question in the context of my own ongoing recovery from morbid obesity. Writing about this publicly has brought scores of kind notes and letters from readers who share the same struggle, know of others who do or empathize with the journey.\n\nBut occasionally — and mercifully rarely — I will hear from the reader who believes this ongoing chronicle is self-indulgent and displacing real news. After all, the argument often goes, obesity is my own fault.\n\nIn essence, I’m fat because I ate too much and I deserved it.\n\nThere is some truth to that. I have overeaten for much of my life and rarely exercised. But no one reaches 563 pounds — the weight at which I began changing my life to avoid crippling myself at 40 — simply by overindulgence.\n\nThere is a growing body of research that links childhood trauma with obesity. Kaiser Permanente, a health care company in Oakland, Calif., did some groundbreaking investigations into the link in the early 1980s and was the subject of a Time magazine profile in 2010.\n\nThe data essentially says people with high adverse childhood experiences have higher risk for a host of negative health problems as adults, including alcohol and other drug abuse, chronic depression, heart disease, smoking and, yes, obesity.\n\nAdverse childhood experiences describe a wide array of problems ranging from verbal, physical and sexual abuse to problems related to poverty, abandonment, family history of mental illness and drug abuse and other issues.\n\nI took a 10-question survey at acestoohigh.com, a very good website about adverse childhood experiences, and scored a 4. That’s the highest category measured by the Kaiser Permanente ACE Study.\n\nWithout going into unnecessary detail about my childhood, it was, to say the least, a challenge.\n\nAnd, no, I’m not blaming me being obese directly on childhood trauma. But I absolutely believe in the link.\n\nWhen you suffer trauma as a child, you do what you can to feel safe and comfortable. The things I did most often to feel safe and comfortable was eat and buy things: toys, comic books, movies and so on.\n\nThese actions, my behavioral therapist tells me, create a chemical reaction in the brain that calms me, even if briefly.\n\nThe problem is, of course, you can spend yourself into bankruptcy and you can eat yourself into the grave.\n\nI work with my therapist twice a month to learn new ways to cope with stress. He takes a call from me two or three times a week when I face an anxiety situation that could spiral into negative thinking that could lead to anything from overeating to suicidal thoughts.\n\nJust the act of talking out those thoughts helps them dissipate and remove the chance of me acting on them.\n\nOne knee-jerk reaction might be to say, “Look, childhood was a long time ago. Get over it already.”\n\nCognitive function, alas, is more complicated than that.\n\nI am also 40 years old. That means I’ve been acting on a series of behaviors ultimately bad for my health for a very long time.\n\nPsychologists called these learned behaviors schemata — a learned cognitive response to certain stimuli.\n\nHere’s the tricky thing about schemata. They can’t be changed. Once they’re in place, you’re stuck with them.\n\nWhat you can do, though, is build new ones. This is a tough task. I’ve been in therapy off and on since I was 15 years old.\n\nMy behavioral therapist, who asks I not name him because of the work he does with public safety agencies, is the best medical professional I’ve ever worked with.\n\nThe work we’ve done in our two years of sessions is some of the most important and life-changing in my life.\n\nAnd still I find myself reaching out to him when I am on the precipice of or in the middle of a panic attack. That is, in fact, part of a new schemata that’s under construction. When the cycle of negativity starts, find a way to break it.\n\nSo, to bring this back to the obesity battle, yes, I ate too much of the wrong things for a long time. And sometimes I still indulge where and how I should not.\n\nBut like a smoker who is trying to quit or a cancer sufferer trying to survive, I am working as hard as I can to find a new path to a healthier life while fully realizing I will stumble and fall often along the way.\n\nAs for the idea that a smoker who gets lung cancer or an obese person with health problems “deserve them,” I think of Clint Eastwood’s line before he kills Gene Hackman’s sadistic sheriff in “The Unforgiven:”\n\n“Deserves got nothin’ to do with it.\"\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 17, 2016\n\nEnjoying exercise? It happens\n\nBoy, it felt good to get back to the gym last week.\n\nAnd that’s a sentence that I never expected to type. I mean I’m the kid who used to walk the mile in middle school. I rarely even tried in P.E.\n\nBut there I was last Monday at the gym eagerly putting on my shoes and getting ready for the day’s activity.\n\nI missed nearly two weeks of workouts because of a heavy chest cold that left my lungs wheezing. Two rounds of steroids and antibiotics and three doctor visits finally got me back on my feet.\n\nAs a side note, as someone who lives with an anxiety disorder, the heavy stimulants in steroids and oral inhalers made for a very edgy couple of weeks without much rest.\n\nBut once Nate Yoho, my coach and owner of CrossFit Merle Hay, started putting me through my paces, I started to feel spectacular.\n\nIn fact, I think I got an exercise high. This is a rush of endorphins in the brain spurred by exercise. Runners talk about it a lot when they push to a new level of exertion.\n\nI’d never experienced it before. But it felt great.\n\nThat I actually enjoy exercise and look forward to it as a part of my thrice weekly routine is a compliment to Nate.\n\nHe designs workouts that are varied. I rarely do the same thing twice in our three sessions.\n\nNate also excels at the human touch. On my second day back, the weather was pleasant. We took a short walk in the parking lot as a cooldown activity.\n\nNate told me my confidence of movement was improving. I didn’t know what that meant.\n\nHe said I approach activities less tentatively than I did when we started working together. I pick up weights without fear of injury, he said.\n\nI thought about what this meant. I came to Nate after finishing physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe pain of limited movement was fresh in my mind. I also had a mindset that an injury meant I had to stop, rehab and restart the process.\n\nBut as I’ve gotten more comfortable working with Nate, I’ve begun to realize that some nagging problems — such as knots in my calves — can be treated on the spot.\n\nNate “rolls out” the knots with a special tool he has. It’s unpleasant, but it’s an intense discomfort in the short term to avoid limping for a full day.\n\nI felt my calves, which had been dormant with the rest of my body during my illness, tighten up during a stepping exercise Nate gave me.\n\nI told Nate they were right on the edge of knotting up. He adjusted the workout to more upper body and core challenges and we avoided aggravating the calves further.\n\nAt the end of the day, I drank my protein shake. I had a couple extra bananas that evening as snacks. The calves felt acceptable the next day. They were sore, but not injured. We got on with the business of working out.\n\nThe key lesson here is the clear line of communication between Nate and I. I feel comfortable telling him, “Hey, this isn’t working.” And I trust him to challenge me to get better.\n\nThe blessing of this is that it allows me to focus on continuing to recover from morbid obesity without relying on the singular metric of how much I weigh.\n\nYes, I’m still morbidly obese. But in just a couple of months, my strength, flexibility and mobility have all improved that even I, the ultimate skeptic in recognizing my own personal improvement, can notice the difference every day.\n\nThis is an important and somewhat risky period in the recovery, I think. Once I cross the 100-pound mark for weight loss, there is a temptation to let up, to look back at how far I’ve come and rest on my laurels.\n\nThat’s why I’m so blessed to have Nate and his gym in my life. Nate is a master of thinking both day-to-day and big picture. He comes up with the workouts that get me sweating and stressing three times a week.\n\nBut then he talks about what I think is patently impossible: pull-ups, competing in CrossFit Games and so on.\n\nI tend to keep my focus in the present. I’m not even sure I want to compete as an athlete. But having someone looking that far ahead does make it easier for me to avoid feeling too satisfied and, instead, keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, MARCH 9, 2016\n\nBetter even when sicker\n\nOddly enough, I appreciate the improvements to my physical health most when my body fails me.\n\nHere’s what I mean: For almost two weeks, I’ve been plagued by a bronchial infection that I can’t shake. My lungs sound like a saw cutting through old wood.\n\nThe breathing problem curtailed my workouts with my coach, Nate Yoho at CrossFit Merle Hay, for more than a week.\n\nIt’s tough to exert yourself when you can barely get a chest full of air.\n\nStill, I think of how much worse I would have been if I were still carrying the 94.8 pounds I’ve lost over the last 11 months.\n\nI am by no means svelte, but I am definitely stronger. Even with diminished lung capacity, I’m able to walk to and from my car without stopping. I’m able to walk into the doctor’s office without assistance or breaking out in a fugue of sweat.\n\nI like how many of those sentences begin with “I’m able.”\n\nAn infection like this would have totally incapacitated me a year ago.\n\nI’ve been sickly to be sure, but I’ve mostly been able to work.\n\nMy voice hasn’t been strong, but my body has had enough strength for short bursts of energy needed to get things done: Pick up prescriptions or supplies at the grocery store and so on.\n\nI remain morbidly obese, of course, but the progress from March 2015 to March 2016 astounds me most when I hit a challenge such as illness.\n\nThen there’s this strange feeling: I actually miss the gym. Early in the lung ailment, I pushed through a workout and I got sicker. It wasn’t my brightest move, but I have come to enjoy my time with Nate.\n\nHis gym is as he promised: a place where anybody of any ability level can feel comfortable getting stronger.\n\nI’ve come to look forward to my thrice weekly appointments there the way I used to look forward to hanging out with my high school sports teammates or my weekly Dungeons & Dragons group.\n\nThere is a camaraderie. The gym is absent of judgement and heavy on encouragement.\n\nSo that I haven’t been able to go due to illness has been a disappointment both physically and socially.\n\nI really want to round off a full 100 pounds before the end of March, when the year anniversary of Making Weight rolls around.\n\nI still hope to pull that off, but this lung problem slowed that, to be sure, but Nate checks in on me nearly every day. That’s dedication.\n\nAnd I must admit, I’ve been blessed with a good cross-section of people who work very hard to help me get better.\n\nWhen the cold first started to migrate to my chest, I went to an urgent care clinic. The doctor prescribed a round of medications. But as that course wound down, it was clear the problem wasn’t working.\n\nI groused about this on Facebook and got a surprising response.\n\nMy family doctor, Shauna Marie Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic, messaged me and told me to get into see her at once.\n\nDoes that count as a house call in the social media age?\n\nI don’t know. I guess we’ll see when the bill arrives.\n\nBut I must appreciate a doctor who is paying close enough attention to my health that she reads my status updates.\n\nI did, in fact, go to see Shauna and she got me on a new round of medicine. A chest X-ray showed no signs of pneumonia. That’s good, though I’m still wheezing as of this writing.\n\nStill, I feel pretty good, at least from a mental standpoint. Just as I appreciate the physical transformation spurred by Nate and physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy, I am grateful for Shauna’s doting care.\n\nIn fact, I’m so enamored with Shauna’s work that I’m going to follow her when she changes offices in April and moves to an office in Ames.\n\nSure, it’s a few extra miles on my Dodge, but when you develop a relationship with a good doctor – or any healthcare provider – you do what you can to preserve it as long as possible.\n\nSo my message to my fellow travelers on the journey back from obesity is that there are good people out there – doctors, therapists, trainers and others – whose mission in life is to help you get better.\n\nWho are we to turn our back on such open acts of kindness?\n\nTHURSDAY, MARCH 3, 2016\n\nNow we're getting somewhere\n\n\"Have you tried on some of your old pants?\" said Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died.\n\n\"No,\" I said.\n\n\"Well, you should,\" she said. \"These are getting pretty baggy. The cuffs are dragging on the ground.\"\n\nThis conversation repeated itself a half dozen or so times in the last two or three months. She asked. I said, \"No.\"\n\nI still had several smaller sizes of khakis hanging in my closet at home. But I refused to pull them off the hanger.\n\nI was too scared.\n\nYes, I'd lost weight since my efforts to recover from morbid obesity began nearly a year ago. But I refused to recognize it.\n\nI looked in the mirror and did not see what I was, but remained haunted by what I was not.\n\nThis is the way of things for a lot of people in a vain culture. But it is an especially acute problem for the obese. I simply could not see any difference.\n\nSure, when my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, pointed out specific things I could do after working with her that I couldn't do months ago, I intellectually understood that to be true.\n\nBut I didn't feel it. I still felt like the same lumpy, hopeless fat guy who was a few french fries away from a heart attack.\n\nSometimes, I still do.\n\nEven now, when my fitness coach Nate Yoho works me out three days a week at his CrossFit Merle Hay gym, I see great leaps forward in physical abilities.\n\nA major part of Nate's program is retesting me on exercises we've done a few weeks earlier to see how much stronger and faster I've become.\n\nHe posts the numbers to a private Facebook page that only he, Stefanie and I can see. We talk about the improvements.\n\nI really do feel stronger. I notice it in small ways, like the ease in getting up from a chair or getting out of my car.\n\nAt the beginning of this journey, it must have looked like my Dodge Charger was giving birth to a 563.2-pound baby elephant every time I got out of it.\n\nI once needed my arms to pull myself to a standing position because my poor, overburdened and arthritic knees couldn't take the strain.\n\nNow, I just stand up without so much as a sigh or groan. That's a credit to the paces both Stefanie and Nate put me through.\n\nBut this pants thing was too much for me. I was afraid that despite all that progress, I would somehow slip on that smaller size and they would be as tight as they were when I pushed them to the back of the closet with the other \"maybe someday\" clothes.\n\nI finally acquiesced to Mom 2.0's request after a session at Nate's gym. He takes videos of me doing various exercises to show me what I'm doing right and wrong with form.\n\nHe showed me squats from my first week working with him and squats about a month later. I happened to be wearing the same shirt and shorts in both videos.\n\nI noticed my belly was visibly flatter in the profile shots. I made Nate show me both videos multiple times. He agreed. There was much less Finney in the second than the first.\n\nStill, it was hard for my brain to accept it. I showed the videos to my girlfriend. She reminded me she had been telling me for months that I'd slimmed out in the face and my belly was less bulky.\n\nSo I went home and pulled that pair of pants a size smaller and pulled them on. They fit marvelously, maybe even a hair looser than I would have expected.\n\nAfter that, I decided it was time to do something I'd been avoiding since December: Get weighed.\n\nI knew my diet had faltered during the holidays and my exercise evaporated before I started working with Nate.\n\nBut now it was late February and I was wearing slightly smaller pants. Progress seemed to be lurching in the proper direction. I might as well test the theory with an actual measurement.\n\nThe result: I was down 13 pounds between Dec. 14 and Feb. 23. I've lost a total of 94.8 pounds since this journey began nearly a year ago.\n\nI want to knock out that last 5.2 pounds before the year is up, just to get a nice triple-digit loss.\n\nBut, of course, I immediately got a vicious chest cold that sidelined me at the gym for several sessions.\n\nStill, the momentum is shifting in the right direction. It's going well enough that even I can see it.\n\nFRIDAY, FEB. 19, 2016\n\nChallenge, encouragement hallmarks of workouts\n\nIt still feels weird to call Nate Yoho “my personal trainer.”\n\nNate owns CrossFit Merle Hay, where I’ve taken up an exercise regime in my latest effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nThere is something very gauche about the phrase, like showy jewelry or riding around in a stretch SUV limo. I guess I’m just aggressively middle class that way.\n\nThe term I prefer is “coach,” because it feels both more accurate and less pretentious. And it describes my relationship with the man.\n\nThe best coaches are teachers. And Nate definitely teaches me with each session.\n\nEarly on, my legs burned and my back ached so bad I wanted to quit.\n\nNate taught me about protein drinks. I always thought protein drinks were for body builders.\n\nNot so, Nate said. Science says a high-protein drink within 45 minutes of an intense workout will help build muscle and encourage recovery.\n\nI was skeptical. But I went off to the grocery store and bought a few of the Hy-Vee brand plastic jars of whey protein that were low in sugar and carbohydrates and high in the nutrients Nate recommended.\n\nI put two scoops in some water, shake it up and drink it after workouts.\n\nAnd … wow.\n\nThe difference was awesome. My muscles were still sore after workouts, but the searing pain from lactic acid buildup was gone.\n\n“Recovery,” Nate said, “is just as important as the workout.”\n\nThese protein drinks gave me new life for workouts. I don’t tolerate pain well.\n\nAnd since I live with general anxiety disorder, my brain chemistry malfunctions tend to take a rational caution about pain and turn it into a paralyzing fear.\n\nNow that I knew the protein shakes work just like my coach said they would, I could embrace workouts with greater vigor.\n\nOne of the things I enjoy most about working with Nate is the way his mind seems to be always working on the parallel processes of challenging me and encouraging me at the same time.\n\nEarly in our workouts, we did a cycle of exercises that were timed. I performed four cycles of belly crunches, calorie burning on a rowing machine and ring rows, which require me to pull myself up to a standing position from an incline using gymnast’s rings.\n\nI was to do four cycles, taking breaks as I needed.\n\nThe first time we did this on Jan. 26, it took me 13 minutes, 38 seconds. I gasped for air the entire time and took many water breaks.\n\nI confess I needed the water less than I was simply stalling for time to get my breath back.\n\nWe retested the cycle about two and a half weeks later on Feb. 11. I made the cycle 2 minutes, 36 seconds faster than the last time.\n\nNate said he typically doesn’t retest this quickly on exercises. But that’s where the encouragement side of his challenge-encouragement dynamic comes in.\n\nNate wanted to show me that I was making progress even if my brain stubbornly refused to see it.\n\n“The numbers don’t lie,” he said.\n\nAnother little touch Nate offers: He checks in every day by text.\n\nHe texts after workouts to see how my body is feeling.\n\nHe texts before workouts to check my mental readiness.\n\nHe texts on off days just to ask how I’m holding up.\n\nThe other day I told him I had some soreness in my triceps after some bench press work we did.\n\nI told him it didn’t hurt. In fact, it felt kind of cool. It reminded me, “Oh, yeah. I worked out and that was cool.”\n\nNate replied: “You’re body is starting to figure out what’s going on.”\n\nAnd maybe my brain will follow along soon, too.\n\nTUESDAY, FEB. 9, 2016\n\nLife after my 'brain zap'\n\nMany readers have asked me how my “brain zap” treatment for chronic depression went.\n\nI hesitated to answer right away because I wanted to get more data before I gave a definitive answer.\n\nBut more than a month after I finished transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical Associates in Urbandale, I can safely say the treatment was a resounding success.\n\nA brief recap: TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerves in the brain to make them more receptive to the naturally occurring mood-regulating chemicals swirling around in our gray matter.\n\nI live with what is known as progressive depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder.\n\nThat simply means that I sometimes get very sad or very scared beyond what is reasonable for what’s going on in my life.\n\nA portion of this problem is caused by chemical imbalances in my brain. I’m essentially not getting enough of the juices that make me better at handling stress or grief.\n\nI took TMS five days a week for six weeks and once a week for another several weeks.\n\nOthers noticed the change in my mood before I did. My Grandma Newcomb said I seemed like my old self. Barlow said after a couple weeks that I was a lot more animated and brighter than I had been when the process began.\n\nI remained skeptical, in part because that’s how a good paragraph stacker should be, and in part because hope is a tough thing to embrace for people who live with depression.\n\nNow, though, having lived life after treatment, I would say my depression is in remission.\n\nI don’t know if that’s a term Barlow or the medical community would use, but that’s how I feel.\n\nRemission feels like the right noun because I recognize my depression is not cured. It’s a condition I live with like high blood pressure or Type II diabetes.\n\nI can do what it takes to keep those conditions in check, but they’re still a part of my health profile.\n\nI still have down days. But that’s it. It’s a day or two at the most. It isn’t a month or three months.\n\nI’m much better at recognizing when I’m down and acting to break the cycle. Sometimes this involves changing activities. Sometimes it means taking a nap.\n\nI still see a cognitive behavioral therapist twice a month. The other part of mental illness is understanding how you think, why you think that way and developing new ways to cope with the world.\n\nI liken the process to being asked to run 10 yards on a football field loaded with dozens of tackling dummies.\n\nAfter a while, you get winded because there are so many obstacles you can’t make progress.\n\nTMS removed half or more of those tackling dummies from my path. I work in therapy sessions to either dodge those other obstacles or find new ways to cope with them.\n\nI’m not the kind of person who endorses medical procedures. That’s a personal choice that individuals need to make in consultation with their medical team, family and their own values.\n\nI will say this: My behavior therapist is deeply skeptical of TMS and believes I am experiencing a strong placebo effect.\n\nHe might be right. I trust my behavioral therapist with my life. And he’s by far the best therapist I’ve ever had, and one of the finest men I’ve had the pleasure to know.\n\nHe might also be wrong. TMS, placebo or otherwise, helped me be more comfortable with who I am.\n\nIt didn’t make me a cheerful person. My coworkers and editors will attest to that.\n\nBut it allowed me to be more comfortable with who I am and accept myself, foibles and all.\n\nAnd that’s a wonderful thing, when I used to spend days ruminating on what a crummy person I am.\n\nOne side note: though anxiety and depression often occur together as mood disorders, they are separate conditions.\n\nMy anxiety is probably about the same as it always has been. It ebbs and flows, spiking and dropping based on what’s going on my life.\n\nI still find myself calling my talk therapist when I get into a mess of persistent ruminative thoughts — that is, getting stuck in a rut of negative thinking that tends to take a small problem and expand it to the worst possible ending.\n\nBut even my talk therapist agrees that I am getting better at recognizing those periods of gloomy rumination and breaking the cycle by calling him to talk it through.\n\nSo for now, I’m embracing life without the burden of feeling like I’m a bum, but I’ll always be braced for the possibility such thoughts will reoccur.\n\nTHURSDAY, FEB. 2, 2016\n\nWanting to quit\n\nSometimes I feel like Humpty Dumpty, the fairy-tale egg man who fell off a wall and required all the king’s horses and men to reassemble him.\n\nI propped my right knee on pillows and gingerly leaned back into my bed.\n\nTwo weeks of training at my friend Nate Yoho’s CrossFit Merle Hay studio left me with a swollen knee, knots in both calves and the return of the lower back pain that started me on my journey to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI was ready to quit. I wanted to quit. I was hurt, humbled and ashamed.\n\nI knew joining a gym and working with a personal trainer would be a challenge for my obese body.\n\nI just did not realize how much my body would rebel against the change – and how hard the emotional repercussions of that rebellion would hit me.\n\nFirst, I should note that Nate is an excellent trainer. He speaks in a clear, gentle voice and explains all the exercises, lifts and other activities to me in clear instruction.\n\nHe focuses on proper form and injury prevention just as much as my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk, of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nThe problem is my body. I carry a lot of weight in the front of my torso – my gut. Over years of hauling this girth around, I’ve developed the bad habit of leaning back slightly to balance out the extra weight that pitches me forward.\n\nThe problem is all that leaning back has compressed my spine in the lower back. And those compressed vertebrae pinch nerves. This leads to shooting pain that I sometimes feel all the way to my finger tips and toes.\n\nIt also makes sitting, standing or any kind of movement from a prone or supine position exceptionally painful.\n\nI aggravated my back doing a lifting exercise. When fatigue sets in, I start to rush. When I rush, I lose form. And when I lose form, I hurt myself.\n\nIn this case, I leaned back a few too many times while lifting weights.\n\nNate didn’t notice it at the time because I didn’t feel pain and didn’t grimace. Conversely, when knots developed in my calves, he stopped the exercise right away because he saw the pain in my face.\n\nBut over a few days, the back injury caught up with me. I became immobile.\n\nThat’s when the fear and shame crept in.\n\nNate has made every effort to make his gym as comfortable and inviting to me as possible. But there are mirrors and I see myself. I may have lost a lot of weight to this point, but I still don’t like my own reflection. That’s a self-esteem problem and I’m working on it.\n\nWhen the back injury returned, I knew exactly what happened. I overcompensated for that weight on my gut pulling me forward.\n\nIt felt as if my own body betrayed me. I got emotional. My thoughts spiraled to unrealistic finalities. Had I done so much damage to my body that getting from fat to fit was actually impossible?\n\nI was ready to quit the gym and just crawl under my blanket and hide from the world.\n\nEnter all the king’s horses and men.\n\nThe first call I made was to my therapist. I told him my dilemma. He suggested that maybe the exercise was too much for my current weight.\n\nI told him I was worried that I liked him saying that because it was what I wanted to hear. I wanted to quit.\n\nIf I quit, though, I wanted it to be because I was injured or was really overwhelmed, not because I was afraid.\n\nMy therapist replied: “Then you’re going to make the right decision whatever you decide because you’re asking the right question.”\n\nI texted Stefanie and told her of the injury. I confessed I was thinking about quitting.\n\nShe urged me to stick with it. Care for the injuries, she said. Tend to the pain. But I had to keep moving.\n\n“There were days in the first five sessions with me that we didn’t make any progress but you kept coming back,” Stefanie wrote.\n\nIt may be cliché, but it is often difficult for men to talk to other men about emotions. Still, I confided to Nate my emotional worries along with my physical ones.\n\nHe, too, urged me to come in for my final workout of the week. He said we didn’t have to go hard. We could even meet for lunch. He just wanted the conversation going.\n\n“It’s OK to be emotional about it,” he wrote. “How could it not be? I think if you continued your old ways making it to 50 would be pushing it. Look at what you’ve done in the past six to nine months. You’re on the right path.”\n\nHow could I turn my back on a man who was working so hard to convince me to get better?\n\nFinally, I called my primary care provider, Dr. Shauna Basener at Mercy Internal Medicine in Clive. She thought exercise – at a reduced level – was OK.\n\nShe renewed a muscle relaxant prescription and another anti-inflammatory that is slightly stronger than over-the-counter stuff.\n\nSo, I iced my knee. I took my medicine. And with a mixture of trepidation and resolve, I went to my last workout of the week.\n\nNate put together a cycle of exercises that didn’t require much bending. He constantly checked on the condition of my back. We both remained vigilant on spine position.\n\nThe workout was not as intense as previous sessions. But it did not matter.\n\nFor that day, winning was just getting through the door.\n\nFRIDAY, JAN. 29, 2016\n\nTHE NEW GYM\n\nI barely slept the night before I reported to CrossFit Merle Hay to work with my new trainer Nate Yoho.\n\nAnticipation is the worst part of starting anything especially for a chronic anxiety junkie like me.\n\nI passed off my trembling upon walking in the studio as an effect of the cold weather. The truth was I had no idea how this was going to go.\n\nI half expected to leave on a stretcher.\n\nThe activity started off poorly. The first thing Nate did was take my picture, front, profile and side.\n\nI enjoy having my picture taken about as much as I enjoy listening to a dental drill at top volume on a movie theater speaker system.\n\nNate said they were to mark my progress. He posted them to a Facebook page that only he and I are a member of.\n\nWe started with some stretches. I managed to get through that without breaking into flop sweat.\n\nNate explained every step calmly and articulately. I started to settle.\n\nNext were something called box squats. Per Nate’s instruction, I held my hands over one another and sat down on a box.\n\nThis is not as easy as it reads, especially for someone who carries his weight in his doughy middle.\n\nNate cautioned me to be mindful of form. He told me which muscles to use and how to rotate my legs.\n\nThe sweat the fell by this point was from exercise rather than nerves.\n\nWe moved to standing push-ups. He put a weight bar on a rack. I leaned forward into it and pushed back to a standing position. This too is not as easy at reads.\n\nAgain, Nate directed my form. I followed directions as best I could. My editors wouldn’t believe how easy I was to command.\n\nThe bench press came next. I just did the standard 45-pound bar. We rotated between the bench press and a stepping drill similar to one I had done many times in physical therapy with Stefanie Kirk over at Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nWe finished with some dumbbell exercises. I was beat. I pulled my towel out of my gym bag and changed my shoes.\n\nDay 1 was finished. I had survived.\n\nStefanie texted me: “I haven’t received an SOS call, so I’m guessing everything went OK.”\n\nIt did. The workout was good. I felt like I’d really done something.\n\nThe second day brought a new set of exercises. Nate introduced me to deadlifting technique. We worked just with the bar again focusing on form rather than strain.\n\nI got plenty of strain anyway.\n\nWe worked on a shoulder exercise before we advanced to the toughest part of the workout.\n\nNate sets a series of exercises out. This time it was something called “ring rows,” crunches and using a rowing machine.\n\nRing rows involve grabbing metal rings attached to straps that are lashed to a metal frame. I leaned back to about a 45 degree angle and pulled myself up to standing position. I did that eight times in a row.\n\nThen I hustled over to do 10 crunches — what old people like me used to call sit-ups with a slightly different technique that involves a special pillow to support the lower back.\n\nWhen I finished that, I switched to the rowing machine, where my goal was to burn eight calories.\n\nThe goal was to complete four sets of all three exercises. I wheezed and groaned my way through it. I stopped to get water. Nate made me stop once to catch my breath.\n\nThe whole thing took 13 minutes, 38 seconds. We finished with a 300 meter walk.\n\nNate said we’ll revisit that work out in a few weeks and mark the progress by how much more quickly I’m able to work through the cycle.\n\nThings went along fine, but I don’t think I truly trusted Nate until my third day at his shop.\n\nWe worked a step exercise and I felt my right calf muscle pull. It was a familiar feeling. It happened several times in physical therapy with Stefanie.\n\nBut Nate caught my grimace right away. He asked what hurt. I told him. We stopped. I laid prone on the floor.\n\nNate worked the calf muscle with a piece of PVC pipe, rolling the knot out similar to the way Stefanie used to torture me with these metal tools.\n\nHe cautioned me that when I feel something off, I needed to tell him. The goal was always to avoid injury.\n\nAnd this is a weird thing to say about your trainer, but in that moment I felt safe with him. I knew he cared about my health. He offered to train me after all.\n\nBut here he was working on the injury, telling me how to handle it and looking for ways to keep the workout moving forward without causing a bigger problem.\n\nThis is the kind of moment that builds a bond between coach and “athlete.” (Nate calls all his clients athletes. I don’t feel like one, but it’s not wise to contradict the guy who spots you when you lift weights.)\n\nWe finished the last day with some rope climbing. I sat on a bench. My goal was to pull myself into a standing position by mostly using my arms.\n\nIt was tough.\n\n“This is the first step to you one day being able to do a pull-up,” Nate said.\n\nI told him that my life has been pull-up free for 40 years. It’s never happened. I couldn’t even do it in high school when I weighed 190 pounds, played basketball and regularly jogged.\n\nNate smiled.\n\n“I’ll take that as a challenge,” he said.\n\nAnd I had this odd feeling that he might just get me to pull it off.\n\nTHURSDAY, JAN. 21, 2016\n\nUNCERTAINTY ABOUND\n\nMy nerves are really getting to me now.\n\nBy the time these paragraphs reach our print edition, I will have graduated from physical therapy for a second time.\n\nThe next step is work with personal trainer Nate Yoho of Crossfit Merle Hay in Urbandale.\n\nAnd I am terrified.\n\nI can’t get a good handle on why. I know some of it rests with a fear of failure.\n\nAnd if I’m honest, I’ve let nutrition and exercise slide in recent months.\n\nThat enthusiastic burst this summer faded in the fall and all but evaporated in winter.\n\nThis is true for lots of people who exercise and struggle with weight.\n\nThe holidays provide so many irresistible treats. The weather discourages activity.\n\nBut I’m in a funk and I won’t deny it anymore. Weight loss plateaued in October.\n\nI’ve probably gained a few pounds because more fried foods, fatty foods and carbohydrates have found their way onto my plate and into my stomach.\n\nNo, that’s not the right way to say it. Food isn't animated. It didn't jump down my throat. It was me. I chose and chose poorly.\n\nEven Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my first set of parents died, has had to scold me not to go for a third bowl of her delicious chili.\n\nI haven’t made an appointment with my nutritionist, Jacque Schwartz at Mercy Weight Loss & Nutrition Center in Clive, since late November.\n\nI put it off using the holidays as an excuse. The truth is I didn’t want to look at that number, because I knew it went in the wrong direction or, if I was very lucky, just stayed the same.\n\nJacque has again and again admonished me not to take my weight as the end all, be all of my health.\n\nBut I do. Everybody does. Thinner and leaner is better. Rounder and plumper is not.\n\nSo I’ve avoided going to see her because I’m afraid to face the number.\n\nI know, I know. I should just suck it up and go and get back on track.\n\nI should. And yet I don’t.\n\nBecause not knowing gives me a slim hope that I haven’t undone as much work as I think I have.\n\n(And given my penchant for anxiety-driven self-flagellation, I’ve practically convinced myself I weigh more than I did when I started this process last March.)\n\nI’ve enjoyed my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy. She’s the best. She really is.\n\nAside from my talk therapist, I cannot think of a better relationship I’ve had with a medical professional in my life.\n\nStefanie has worked with me as much as possible on this transition from her clinic to Nate’s gym.\n\nShe went as far as to talk to Nate on the phone about what we’ve done, what I can do and where I need to improve.\n\nShe tries hard to convince me I’m in better shape than I feel. But my anxiety is stubborn even when controlled by medication.\n\nI am afraid I am going to fail. I am afraid I’m not going to get any better and the slide to immobility will begin again.\n\nThis is the reality of the recovery. I’ve written about this many times: “Rocky” movies have montages. Life does not.\n\nRight now, I feel like I’m playing the same note over and over again. It’s tedious. It’s tiring. I want to give up. I just want to roll over, pull the covers up and go back to sleep.\n\nBut Stefanie stares me down with her big brown eyes and reminds me I once couldn’t walk more than 156 feet without stopping because of pain.\n\nNow I’m doing balancing exercises that weren’t even possible back in May when I discharged from physical therapy the first time.\n\nI try hard to keep these positives in mind. But I have a mirror. And I don’t like what I see. And every little comment, even the ones by people I don’t know and shouldn’t care about, seems to hit like a punch.\n\nI spoke to a fraternal group the other day. The first question from an audience member — the first damn question — was “how much do you weight?”\n\nI answered, but I felt like an exhibit at a freak show. I feel that way more often than I’d like to admit.\n\nI wish I could type inspiring paragraphs for readers every week with a smile on my face and joy exploding from my fingertips.\n\nBut that isn’t how this works. There are highs, lows and everything in the middle.\n\nI’m in a low right now and have been for longer than I’d like to admit.\n\nSo I’m going to have to take some of my own advice. When you get low, you’ve got to ask for help.\n\nStefanie has taken me as far as she can. Now I turn to Nate and his skills.\n\nAnd I’ll have to find the fortitude somewhere to keep moving forward.\n\nWEDNESDAY, JAN. 13, 2016\n\nTOUGH TALK\n\nA reader wrote in to ask my advice on a delicate question.\n\nI’ll pause for regular readers to stop laughing.\n\nThe reader carries a few extra pounds herself and has followed this blog as I write about my efforts to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nShe noted that a friend of hers is obese. The woman loses her breath walking from her desk to the restroom.\n\nThe reader wanted to know my advice for talking to her friend about the subject.\n\nWell, that is dicey, isn’t it? The reader knew that.\n\n“I know that when people would tell me that I needed to lose weight, it only saddened me — making me more likely to eat more,” the reader wrote.\n\nI am afraid I don’t have very good advice here.\n\nObesity is absolutely a life-threatening health condition.\n\nBut unlike most diseases, it comes with a great deal of shame and scorn.\n\nI don’t want to get into the victim culture debate when it comes to obesity. But no one blames someone who gets cancer for getting cancer.\n\nWell, unless they smoke. I always find it odd and crude after someone dies of lung cancer to have someone ask, “Did he smoke?” If so, I guess he must have deserved to die.\n\nAnyway, there is, of course, some measure of personal responsibility in maintaining a healthy weight.\n\nBut to argue that a person is obese simply because they overeat oversimplifies a complex disease.\n\nAnd yes, I call obesity a “disease.” Because that’s what it is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees with me.\n\nObesity has roots in genetics, food portions, the chemistry of food and even trauma.\n\nSure, the No. 1 reason I am morbidly obese is because of overuse of my excellent hand-to-mouth coordination.\n\nBut the underlying causes: including a chaotic childhood and depression and anxiety conditions that I’ve written about here are just as important.\n\nI overeat when I’m stressed. I binge eat to feel better. I make poor food choices when I’m anxious or depressed. These are all part of a holistic approach to treating the problem.\n\nSo the first bit of advice I’d give: Don’t assume obesity is just because the person lacks self-control.\n\nThe second thing, and this is very important, remember that the person knows they are obese, or at least fat.\n\nNobody ever had to tell me I was fat. I knew. I thought about it every time I saw a reflection in the mirror or a window.\n\nI knew it every time my arthritic knees cracked and popped when I stood up or my embattled back cried out when I tried to shop for groceries.\n\nAnd, as the reader noted of her own experience, when people brought it up to me, I just slipped into a deeper depression, ate more and was more self-destructive.\n\nI had a good friend tell me point-blank that I was too fat and he was worried he was going to have to attend my funeral soon.\n\nI knew it came from the heart and he meant it from the deepest part of personal concern.\n\nI ignored him. I ignored the doctor who diagnosed me with Type II diabetes, too.\n\nI only sought help with my body broke down to the point that I could not do my job and could barely function.\n\nI don’t believe it has to come to that for everybody.\n\nI do believe that everyone has to come to terms with their disease in their own way.\n\nI would never discourage a friend from expressing concern over the health of another friend.\n\nBut be forewarned: Even if you do it in the kindest possible way, with the gentlest language or with blunt force honesty, there’s every chance there will not lead to immediate change.\n\nSo, yes, dear reader, talk to your friend about your concerns about her health. But take extraordinary pains to make sure she knows your words come from a place of love and not judgement and scorn.\n\nBecause believe me, she’s doing enough of that to herself already.\n\nTUESDAY, JAN. 5, 2016\n\nMOST IMPROVED\n\nNate Yoho was busy with a client when I arrived at his gym shortly before 10 a.m. Tuesday.\n\nNate owns Crossfit Merle Hay, located on the backside of the former Carlos O’Kelly’s restaurant in a strip mall south of the Interstate 35-80 bypass.\n\nI took a seat on one of the barstools – still emblazoned with the defunct O’Kelly’s logo. I watched the action.\n\nA woman easily taller than 6 feet jumped on a wooden box that looked to be about 3 feet tall.\n\nThe woman looked like an athlete. Her body size and shape reminded me of the late Missy Lange, a former Drake women’s basketball player who was 6-foot-4 whose former coach, Lisa Bluder, once described as “having the perfect body for basketball.”\n\nThe woman jumped on the box about 30 times. She didn’t grunt once. Her balance was impeccable.\n\nShe moved from the box jumps to deadlifting what appeared to be 225 pounds. She sweat, but she was in total control – strong, powerful and determined.\n\nBehind her, another fit man was squatting on one leg in a balance exercise that looked nigh impossible to me.\n\nMy first thought, my only thought, was to get the hell out of there. This place was not for me. This was for fit people, not fat slobs who injure their back lifting 10-pound barbells.\n\nNate was a minor league baseball player. He was a real athlete. I was never a real athlete. I played basketball and baseball as a boy, but I was terrible. I just wanted to be on the team with the other guys. It was something to do other than go home.\n\nI won “Most Improved Player” my sophomore year at Winterset High School. This is because I went from making zero of 10 free throws at the beginning of the season to four of 10 free throws by the end of the season.\n\nNate finished with his client and took me next door to a quieter room. His 2-year-old daughter, Caralyn, was with him. She ran around with adorable boots with animal faces on the toes.\n\nNate had kind eyes and a gentle manner. He shares the same gift of making a person feel welcome and at ease possessed by Mom 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines hairdresser who raised me after my parents died.\n\nStill, I could not conceal my nervousness. I felt overwhelmed at the sight of the powerlifters next door.\n\nNate assured me.\n\n“You won’t start there,” he said. “If anything, the first few days are going to be kind of easy. I would rather have that than you going too hard and getting hurt.”\n\nNate opened with a thorough interview. He wanted to know what kind of exercise I’ve been doing in physical therapy, how I hurt myself most recently and my comfort level with various stresses on knees, my back and so on.\n\nNate is good at his job. I can tell because when he talked, I actually believed I could do whatever he put in front of me. I feel the same way when I work with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nYet as I walked out to my car, I felt overwhelmed again. I was never, ever going to be powerlifting like those people I saw today. I remembered trying out for the East High School basketball team my junior year.\n\nI was so slow in sprints that Coach Chuck Sutherland, after two days of tryouts, offered to let me be team manager. I was much better at taping ankles and handing out towels and Gatorade than playing sports.\n\nI had a talk therapy appointment after meeting with Nate. My therapist asked me what I was so afraid of.\n\nI said I was afraid of getting hurt and I was afraid I couldn’t do it.\n\nMy therapist said what I was really afraid of was embarrassment. He said I was focused on the wrong thing.\n\n“Embarrassment is an emotion, not a measure of performance,” he said. “You’re right. You may never be able to do what those other people in the gym can do. But that isn’t the goal. The goal is to improve your health.”\n\nI thought about this. He’s right. I’m not shooting for varsity here. I’m just trying to fit into movie theater seats and build up the strength and endurance for everyday life.\n\nCome to think of it, “strength for everyday life” was a phrase Nate used.\n\nSo, in a few weeks, I’ll be at Nate’s gym. I’ll be the one in the back, covered in flop sweat and going about an eighth of the speed of everybody else.\n\nBut if everything goes well, I might just win Most Improved Player again.\n\nTHURSDAY, DEC. 31, 2015\n\nRECLUSE NO MORE\n\nI start work with personal trainer Nate Yoho, who owns Crossfit Merle Hay in Des Moines, as soon as I discharge from my latest round of physical therapy, which looks to be about Jan. 22.\n\nI meet with Nate soon to look at his gym and talk about training techniques. The occasion will mark the first time we’ve met in person despite the fact that I’ve written four stories about him as both reporter and columnist.\n\nRegular readers will remember the beautiful, tragic love story of Nate and his wife Laura. They met while working at a gym. They fell in love.\n\nNate’s proposal was so romantic a jewelry store later recreated it for a commercial. But Laura got aggressive brain cancer. She died in July 2013. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born in November that year by surrogate.\n\nThe story is easily the most heart-wrenching and beautiful I’ve written in my career. But I never met Nate.\n\nThe first time I wrote about him, I was on a tight deadline trying to beat the TV competition. The other times, though, well, that’s a little hard to talk about.\n\nREAD THE SERIES:\n\nWhen I was writing about Nate, I was at the peak of my obesity: more than 560 pounds. I was having a real hard time getting around physically.\n\nThe walk from the parking garage to the office, about a block, was almost too much for me at the beginning and ending of my workdays.\n\nNagging and cyclic injuries often laid me up for days at a time.\n\nSo whenever possible, I did my interviews over the phone, even on stories as sensitive as this one.\n\nThere were many reasons for this. One was that I was afraid wherever I met people, there would not be a chair strong enough to hold my weight.\n\nThis was a real concern. Once I was at an assignment where I was sitting on a metal folding chair. It collapsed beneath my weight. I landed flat on my back in a room full of laughing school children.\n\nThere is a sort of slapstick humor to that, of course. Even I can see it.\n\nBut there is an underlying truth that is far more terrible: I was so ashamed of my body and appearance that I didn’t want to be seen.\n\nThat’s a horrible feeling to have.\n\nNate, for his part, was always kind to me. He actually wanted to meet me after one of the stories I wrote about him.\n\nAnd I admitted to him something that I never told anyone: I was afraid to meet him because I didn’t feel worthy.\n\nNate is a guy who is doing life right. He was a pro baseball player in the Milwaukee Brewers system. He takes care of his body.\n\nHe married a beautiful, loving woman who shared his passion for fitness. He tended to her until her last moments.\n\nAnd he dotes on their daughter.\n\nI look at Nate and see all the things I am not, especially physically.\n\nI don’t know why I opened up to Nate in this way. Like I said, we’d never met before in person.\n\nBut he trusted me with his intensely personal story about his wife and daughter. There was a connection there beyond the paragraphs.\n\nNate asked me some time ago if I was a recluse when I felt ashamed, even around the people I trust.\n\nI did and I do. I never want the people I love to see me at my worst.\n\nBut that was a long time ago. I’ve lost 82 pounds since then. I can do things physically that I thought were impossible when I first spoke with Nate.\n\nSo finally I took Nate up on his offer to help me get fit. That’s what he does for a living at Crossfit.\n\nAnd hopefully he will help me show myself and the people I love me at my best.\n\nTUESDAY, DEC. 22, 2015\n\nBAD MATH\n\nI sat down at Jethro’s BBQ near Drake University for dinner with a pal last week.\n\nI opened up MyFitnessPal, the smartphone application that I use to track my calories. A new feature popped up.\n\nIt allowed me to search restaurants in my area based on the GPS location of my phone.\n\nThis is a major development.\n\nSince I began using the app, back in March when the weight-loss journey began, I’ve been forced to estimate the calories in foods at my favorite restaurants.\n\nI eat out a lot, more than I should. This would, at least, provide me with a consistent baseline.\n\nThat was the good news.\n\nThe bad news was I was vastly underestimating the calories of several of my favorite foods.\n\nNot all the restaurants in my area are on the app, but Jethro’s is. And a few of my favorites are heavier in calories that I figured.\n\nThis goes a long way to explaining the lengthy plateau in weight loss. I was guessing wrong and it was going against me. I was treading water instead of making meaningful strokes to the other side.\n\nThe truth is I’ve probably been blowing my calorie goal more often than I thought for months.\n\nThis was a frustrating revelation, but it is better to know than to constantly be wondering what is going wrong.\n\nOnce you know what’s going wrong, then you can make adjustments.\n\nSpeaking of adjustments, my work with physical therapist Stefanie Kirk at Mercy South Physical Therapy continues to go well.\n\nI’d been sick with a fever and some gastrointestinal issues and missed our last session.\n\nI don’t like missing appointments with Stefanie. No matter what my mood is going in, I’m usually feeling centered and sharper going out.\n\nThe rest was doing well. My posture has improved as well as my form in walking.\n\nIt is still a strange thing for me to think about so many different things as I walk.\n\nTighten the abs. Adjust the pelvis to a neutral position. Flex the gluteus muscles as part of my stride. Keep my hips steady and not swaying. Force my toes to point forward.\n\nWhat a list to consider just to take a step.\n\nBut bad form leads to injuries and that leads to more setbacks. This plateau has gone on long enough. It feels too much like wallowing. It’s time to break through to the next level.\n\nHoliday eating is always a challenge. I was frustrated enough with my plateau in November to skip one Thanksgiving meal with my Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon and have a scaled-down, healthier offering with Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after my parents died.\n\nI have two Christmas celebrations planned this season. I’ll have lunch – pork loin is the main course – with my parents.\n\nMy folks are watching their weight, too. Mom 2.0 is a type II diabetic like me, so she’s mindful of carbs and sugars in her offerings.\n\nMom 2.0 also will be cooking the meal for the other Christmas gathering, set on Dec. 28, which brings Dad 2.0’s side of the family to my folks’ stately east-side manor.\n\nThere will be more foods to avoid at that gathering than our Christmas Day festivities, but I think I’ll manage.\n\nI find my appetite can be slaked by good helpings of foods that I like and are low in calories and high in nutrients. I just have to be mindful of portions.\n\nBut if the story MyFitnessPal tells me is true, then I’ve got a lot of work to do to get my diet changes back in order.\n\nI eat out to socialize, either with friends or with the acquaintances I meet among bartenders and servers.\n\nMy girlfriend is changing jobs soon and that means she’ll be working fewer nights. We are committed to eating healthier.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to make our own meals. I think it’s time I started putting my crock pot to use as well as my George Foreman Grill.\n\nI’m sure there will be plenty of trips to Jethro’s, Tasty Tacos and other favorite haunts.\n\nBut now is the time to hunker down and get serious about this recovery. I’ve made great progress to be sure, but this isn’t the time to start feeling satisfied.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 18, 2015\n\nCHANGING DIRECTIONS\n\nAnxiety precedes every visit to my primary care doctor.\n\nThis is not a reflection on Dr. Shawna Basener of Mercy Westown Internal Medicine Clinic. She is an excellent doctor with a terrific, upbeat attitude whose approach to medicine matches mine: The best medicine is no medicine.\n\nUnder her care, I’ve already shed an expensive cholesterol medication and a diabetic pill. In my latest visit, she encouraged me to drop an iron supplement because my blood hemoglobin numbers are strong.\n\nStill, I get very worked up before every visit. I feel like going to the doctor is like going to the mechanic. She's going to find something wrong and it’s going to be very expensive.\n\nThe night before doctor visits, I’m rife with anxiety. I sleep fitfully if at all. I drive myself to the brink of a crack-up just to get a checkup.\n\nThe news came in mostly good. My A1C, the critical measure for diabetes, was down to 5.3, lower than my September visit. My blood pressure, the doctor said, was perfect.\n\nBut the weight, well, it was the same. Actually, it was up two-tenths of a pound. That’s such an insignificant number that it could be thrown off by how big a cup of water I had when I took my morning medications.\n\nStill, I was discouraged. For nearly three months, I’ve been unable to move that number on the scale.\n\nI know. I know. Plateaus are a part of weight loss. My nutritionist tells me that. My physical therapist tells me that. Social media commentators tell me that.\n\nStill, I feel like I’m in a car that just won’t start.\n\nMy eating habits aren’t horrible. My blood work shows that. I’ve excised most sugars and carbohydrates from my diet. I keep to my daily calorie goal of 2,700. I’m usually much lower.\n\nInjuries have hampered my physical activity. I reinjured my back going too hard on the elliptical machine at my gym. I went back to my physical therapist to get it worked on. She’s focused on form and balance.\n\nThis involves a lot of awkward retraining of my posture. Tuck the pelvis in. Tighten the butt muscles. Squeeze the hips. It feels silly and weird. But if there’s a person in this world I trust to get me on the right physical path, it’s Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy.\n\nStefanie and I are going to be working through the end of the year and maybe slightly into the new year.\n\nAfter that, well, I need to change my fitness routine in a significant and meaningful way.\n\nMy attitude toward exercise is soured. I don’t know if it is the colder weather or the rain and gray skies or simply apathy. But home seems so warm and comfortable and the gym seems so dull and uncomfortable.\n\nStill, if this weight loss effort — and this column, for that matter — is going to be anything more than complaining about not having the mojo to exercise, I need to do do something different.\n\nAs soon as I’m discharged from physical therapy, probably in mid-January, I’m going to start working out with my friend Nate Yoho.\n\nRegular readers might remember Nate from a story I wrote about him and his late wife, Laura, who died of cancer. Their daughter, Caralyn, was born by surrogate a few months after Laura died. It’s probably the most popular and touching story I’ve ever written.\n\nNate and I have kept in touch. He is a former minor league baseball player and fitness guru who owns his own gym. Several times, he’s offered to develop a program for me. I always turned him down.\n\nI gave lots of lame reasons. But the truth was basic: I was afraid.\n\nNate is the real damn deal when it comes to fitness. The guy has arms like steel cable.\n\nAnd, well, I’m a wimp. I was afraid I would get hurt or be embarrassed.\n\nBut these days, it’s pretty embarrassing to write once a week about how I haven’t really been exercising and I haven’t lost any weight.\n\nSo I finally took Nate up on his offer.\n\nTo his credit, he’s got the same upbeat attitude Dr. Basener has when I visit her. So maybe I’m worried about nothing.\n\nIn a way, this is only fair.\n\nNate trusted me with the most intimate story of his life. The very least I can do is trust him to help in my ongoing effort to save my own life.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 11, 2015\n\nDEPRESSION SPECTER\n\nI’ve lived with chronic clinical depression for a long time.\n\nThe transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, treatments I took under the direction of Dr. Eric Barlow at Compass Clinical in Urbandale seem to have done their job.\n\nTo recap, TMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the nerve endings in the brain to make them more receptive to mood-regulating chemicals such as serotonin.\n\nI took acute treatment five days a week for six weeks. I’m finishing the year taking maintenance treatments once a week.\n\nI think it worked. I would like to declare it an unqualified success, but, like I said, I’ve lived with depression for a long time. I’ve had breaks in the blackness only to fall right back down that bottomless elevator shaft.\n\nIn real, measurable terms, I feel less depressed. And that, in itself, is a strange thing to feel.\n\nSometimes I think depression is stalking me, just outside the periphery of my vision, waiting to strike if I let my guard down.\n\nSo far, that hasn’t happened.\n\nBarlow is so pleased with my progress, he suggested we begin to taper my antidepressant medication and sleeping pills.\n\nI am wary of this, but also excited.\n\nThe excitement comes from the fact that many antidepressants, including the ones I take, come with a side effect of increased appetite and weight gain. Since I’m fighting morbid obesity as it is, it would be nice to remove one of the obstacles, no matter how small it is.\n\nBut the wariness is great as well. I feel pretty good right now. Do I dare tamper with it?\n\nIn the short term, anyway, the answer is yes.\n\nNot long after I finished the acute treatments, I noticed I was sleeping a lot.\n\nSleeping a lot is a behavior I associate with depression, especially the deeper varieties that include anhedonia — loss of interest in things that previously gave me pleasure.\n\nI would put on a ballgame and sink into the recliner. I would be asleep in moments. Sometimes I would sleep for a few minutes. Other times, it was for hours.\n\nThe thing was, I didn’t feel low. I wasn’t in a “woe is me” mode. I was just sleepy and, on the positive side, so relaxed that I drifted off to sleep.\n\nThere are far worse fates than this, of course. But I wanted the lift of depression symptoms to correspond with a bit more pep. I love to read and when I was in the thick of the major depression episode, I couldn’t concentrate enough to stay with a story for more than a page or two — even a comic book.\n\nAnd my exercise mojo seemed to have evaporated completely. If it weren’t for my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, working on my posture and strengthening my bum right hip and groin, I wouldn’t be moving much at all.\n\nSo, Barlow and I consulted and we decided to halve my sleeping pill and drop my antidepressant down by a quarter.\n\nThis has corresponded with a slight uptick in anxiety.\n\nUnfortunately, TMS treatments don’t address anxiety directly. Anxiety and depression are two heads of the same mood disorder dragon. But the chemicals that cause panic attacks are different than those that cause depression.\n\nSo, I know anxiety is probably always going to be a part of my life. It’s something I’ll have to manage, like high blood pressure or cholesterol.\n\nI am worried that the drop in my antidepressant is contributing to my anxiety. Then again, we’re in a chicken-or-egg argument, aren’t we? Is a lower dose of antidepressant causing more worry or is me worrying about a lower dose of antidepressant causing the worry?\n\nI don’t know. The only thing I can do is stay the course. I show up for my maintenance treatments and meet regularly with Barlow to talk things over and keep the brain juices in a proper cocktail.\n\nHopefully, one day, I’ll stop looking over my shoulder for the bad juju of depression.\n\nBut for now, I try to enjoy the relief, but keep one eye on the rear-view mirror.\n\nFRIDAY, DEC. 4, 2015\n\nBALANCING ACT\n\nI lean left, but not in the way Register columnists are usually accused of.\n\nInstead of a political sensibility, it is an issue of physical balance.\n\nI favor my left leg. Much of the time I find myself standing with most of my weight on my left leg and my right leg dangling almost like a kickstand.\n\nThe lean may seem harmless enough, but it’s the latest focus of my ongoing effort to recover from morbid obesity.\n\nI reinjured my back by taking on aggressive workouts at my gym. The setback frustrated my efforts to lose more weight, leaving me stalled for more than a month.\n\nFurther, it brought back the same pain – though not at the same level – that led me to seek treatment for the health issue in March.\n\nI was happy to be working with my physical therapist, Stefanie Kirk of Mercy South Physical Therapy, again. But I was annoyed that I wasn’t able to keep healthy.\n\nStefanie, as she usually does, saw the problem right away: my butt.\n\nSpecifically, the gluteus muscles weren’t firing when I was climbing stairs or walking.\n\nThis was likely caused by bad posture I assumed when I weighed more than 530 pounds.\n\nThese are the small, harmful changes in your body that you don’t realize occur when you’re obese. You can see the fat. You mop up the flop sweat. You know your endurance is low.\n\nOne of the many things I really didn’t understand about my condition was how much damage the extreme weight was and continues to do to my physical structure.\n\nMorbidly obese people make all sorts of adjustments to their posture and movement. They’re slight and almost imperceptible, but over time there are terrible consequences.\n\nMy bulging belly forced me to carry myself in a poor posture, which in turn changed my gait.\n\nThis wasn’t a problem when I was content to wheeze a few hundred feet to the car or mailbox and be done with movement for the day.\n\nBut when I started doing more walking outside and on the elliptical machine at the gym, the out-of-whack walking style caused my back to break down on me again.\n\nThe weight loss also has one negative side effect: My center of gravity changes with each handful of pounds that come off. That means my body is relearning balance on a regular basis.\n\nStefanie has me working on a variety of posture-improving techniques, strengthening my gluteus muscles and my hip flexors.\n\nSince I’ve been so large for so long, one of the bad habits I’ve picked up is sitting with my hips splayed wide open. This is particularly acute when I’m driving my car.\n\nStefanie tells me the body has something called a neutral position, similar to a car transmission. However, my neutral positions are out of alignment with the center of my body.\n\nMy right hip – which I used to work the pedals in my car – is especially open.\n\nThis might all sound rather technical, but what it boils down to is that when you don’t stand and move the way the body was designed, you injure yourself.\n\nThis round of physical therapy with Stefanie is a lot different than my first. I was much more passive then. I just did what my physical therapist told me. I was happy to get any movement.\n\nNow I’m trying to move the right way. It’s the difference between throwing a baseball casually with a buddy in the park and throwing nine innings for a major-league club.\n\nI ask a lot of questions. And the physical therapy sessions are less sweaty endurance tests and more about the right form, concentrating on making sure the right muscles are firing at the right time.\n\nI have a lot of problems with my hips. They dip and sway in the wrong way. Some days it feels like Stefanie is one of the censors on the old “Ed Sullivan Show” and I’m Elvis Presley trying to break all the rules.\n\nStill, the constant correction is helpful. It feels awkward to concentrate on every step.\n\nI have a list of things I’m supposed to do just when I walk. Tighten my abdominal muscles. Make sure my shoulders are back. Tighten the glutes, especially when I’m climbing stairs. Unlock the knees. Point my toes forward and force my hips to move in the proper direction.\n\nI bet I look pretty silly watching my feet when I make a stride just to see if my toes are in the right place.\n\nI don’t remember how old I was when I learned to walk, but I’ll likely always remember that at 40, I had to learn to walk all over again.\n\nTUESDAY, NOV. 24, 2015\n\nBRAIN BUILDING\n\nI wrote a column earlier this month about how transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, helped ease my chronic depression symptoms.\n\nBut I want to make an important clarification: I am not cured of depression.\n\nI’m not even in remission, which by definition is the absence of symptoms over a sustained period.\n\nI feel fine, better than I have in a long time, but I’m not free of depression or anxiety. In fact, I still have quite a bit of anxiety in crowds and in social situations.\n\nTMS is not meant to be a cure. It is, like prescription medications, a tool in helping rein in a sometimes debilitating health problem.\n\nDepression and anxiety are controlled on two fronts. The first is medicine and treatments such as TMS.\n\nThose treatments address brain chemistry. Severe depression occurs when the brain is deprived of serotonin — the brain’s mood-regulating hormone.\n\nA plethora of medicines exists to try to regulate this. Many of them are very effective. But my depression was treatment-resistant and my psychiatrist, Dr. Eric Barlow, suggested TMS.\n\nTMS uses magnetic pulses to stimulate neurons in my brain, making them more receptive to natural levels of serotonin and other mood hormones.\n\nAnd, so far, that feels pretty good.\n\nWhat it did not do, however, was change my thinking patterns. As we grow up, our brain develops ways of dealing with the world. These are called schema.\n\nA simple example of a schema is learning about a hot stove. At some point in your childhood, you probably touched the burner of a stove despite the warnings of your parents. The pain that resulted led your young brain to build a schema that said, simply, “Don’t touch hot stoves.”\n\nBut I had a chaotic childhood. Along with the more common “hot stove schema,” I developed some schemata to deal with the struggles associated with a mother who was addicted to prescription pain killers, suffered violent mood swings and memory loss, and had other boundary issues that I choose to keep private.\n\nI developed schema to survive these situations.\n\nFor example, if I recognized my mom was lashing out angrily, saying cruel things, I learned to keep quiet and make myself scarce, but a part of me believed my mother’s erratic behavior was triggered by me being a bad little boy.\n\nThis is a reasonable response to what seemed like a threatening situation as a boy. But as an adult, I have a job that often leads me into conflict with people.\n\nHonorable people disagree, but sometimes, especially behind the veil of social media, unkind things are said and feelings are hurt. My reaction is often to either withdraw or lash out.\n\nAnd always there is a rush of self-loathing, assuming that I am still a bad person because of the flawed schema I developed under a now outdated set of circumstances.\n\nSuch self deprecation is not particularly helpful in fostering productive, civil dialogue.\n\nSo while I hope TMS has given me a long-term break from major depression, I still have plenty of mental health work to do with my talk therapist.\n\nFor example, when I was a boy, I often felt uneasy or nervous. My parents quelled this disquiet by giving me toys or taking me out to dinner at a fast food restaurant.\n\nSo the schema my brain built included thinking that the way to feel safe and loved is to buy things and eat. And, to a degree, that still works in that I get a serotonin rush from a buying spree or a food binge.\n\nBut it is not a particularly effective way to live as an adult because it drains my bank account and expands my waistline.\n\nThe work I’m doing with my talk therapist now is focused on building new schema. My therapist said you can’t remove an old schema. You can only create new ones.\n\nThis all seems rather technical, but the brain is a complicated organ. And I like that my medical team explains the science to me.\n\nKnowledge is power. I like the idea that I can take more control of how I think by understanding why I think that way.\n\nThere are still bad days. An incident arose just the other evening that had me on the phone with my therapist for a half hour.\n\nI was in a loop thinking I was a bad person. The truth was, I had run into an old thinking pattern triggered by a current conflict.\n\nI was somewhat downtrodden that I was still struggling with these same kinds of thinking errors, but my therapist reminded me that I’m getting better at catching these moments when thoughts start with a relatively minor incident and then increase in awfulness until I’m nearly panicked.\n\nAnd he reminded me that now that my brain chemistry is under better control, I can more freely work on better thinking.\n\nThat is very good news … I think.\n\nFRIDAY, NOV. 20, 2015\n\nGIVING THANKS\n\nThanksgiving is associated with overeating more than any other holiday.\n\nAnd why not? Such a bounty of delights: turkey, stuffing, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sweet potatoes, cranberry sauce, green bean casseroles, pumpkin pies, pecan pies and, for the sadistic, mincemeat pies, and, of course, delicious gravy.\n\nMy mouth waters at the thought of a heaping plate with heavy dollops of everything and then some.\n\nBut I’m fighting morbid obesity. I’ve lost nearly 82 pounds since March. Nothing I could eat on Thanksgiving could undo all that work.\n\nStill, my journey is long. I have 220 pounds to go before I’m outside the obese range. Thanksgiving poses a challenge for which I have no good answer.\n\nI could attend a family event Wednesday night at my aunt and uncle’s Bondurant home. I could, as I did at my family’s annual July 4 celebration, map out what I was going to eat in advance and limit myself to that.\n\nI could stick to the green veggies and salad and skip the pie altogether. My family would understand. They’re a good family like that.\n\nI needn’t worry about them being uncomfortable at the chow line while I poke at a few slices of turkey, green beans and salad.\n\nNo, the problem is with me. I want to eat big and bad. And I don’t trust myself at the event. My family might remind me of my goals if I forget in a frenzy of pie, but I don’t want them to have to do that, either.\n\nWhat I want to do is feel confident enough to eat sensibly at Thanksgiving or any other day. And the truth is I just don’t right now.\n\nMy weight-loss efforts have been stagnant since fall began. Plateaus are commonplace in weight loss. This one seems too long to me.\n\nI have to admit my culpability in that. I eat out too often. Wings, which is fried food, are my kryptonite. I’ve indulged too often.\n\nMeanwhile, injuries and a general malaise have stymied my exercise efforts. I’ve lost my workout mojo. Some of it is just plain laziness. Some of it is a cramped schedule the past six weeks while I went through an intense new treatment for my chronic depression and anxiety issues.\n\nRegardless, I’m moving less and while I’m not necessarily eating more, I’m definitely not eating as well as I should be.\n\nSo this Thanksgiving, I’m taking a knee. I’m sitting it out. Parents 2.0, the kindly east Des Moines couple who raised me after Parents 1.0 died, and I will have a quiet dinner together Thanksgiving Day. My apologies to Uncle Larry and Aunt Sharon, but this year I’m won’t be at the table.\n\nThey’ll understand and I’m thankful for that.\n\nIn fact, despite recent foibles and the occasional unkind gripe from disgruntled rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/05/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/05/24/josh-fight-revived-roses-vr-rehab-news-around-states/50275581/", "title": "Josh Fight 2.0, revived roses: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHomewood: Republican U.S. Senate hopefuls made last-minute pitches to primary voters Monday in the tight race for the GOP nomination for a seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Richard Shelby. The three leading candidates in Tuesday’s primary – U.S. Rep. Mo Brooks, former Shelby aide Katie Britt and veteran Mike Durant, a businessman best known as the helicopter pilot held captive in the “Black Hawk Down” battle in Somalia – concentrated their efforts in Republican strongholds in north Alabama, attempting to sway undecided voters and combat a flurry of negative attack ads in the race. The fractured field increases the chances the primary will go to a June 21 runoff, which will be required unless a single candidate captures more than 50% of the vote. Brooks appeared at a rally in Huntsville with U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, as he seeks to overcome ex-President Donald Trump’s harsh criticisms and decision to rescind his endorsement. Trump had initially endorsed Brooks – who had been a key champion of the false claims that the 2020 election was stolen – but Trump reversed in March, citing Brooks’ languishing performance and accused the congressman of going “woke” for saying it was time to move on from the 2020 presidential outcome and focus on upcoming elections.\n\nAlaska\n\nKetchikan: The 750-mile Race to Alaska has returned after the pandemic led to its cancellation in 2020 and 2021. The engineless boat race takes competitors from Port Townsend, Washington, to Ketchikan, Alaska Public Media reports. The first-place prize of $10,000 cash is nailed to a board at the race’s end, and the runner-up wins a steak-knife set. A new documentary, “The Race to Alaska,” elevated recognition of the competition, according to Alaska Public Media.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: The state’s second most populous city has signaled it may forgo part of its allotment of Colorado River water delivered by the Central Arizona Project aqueduct in order to help forestall a shortage declaration for Lake Mead that would trigger mandatory reductions. The Tucson City Council included its potential willingness to take 20% less CAP water in voting Thursday to direct city officials to discuss with other jurisdictions the possible of coordinated conservation agreements to keep more water in the reservoir, which has seen its level plummet due to drought. “We have a responsibility to protect our precious water resources and preserve our water supply,” the council said. “With today’s direction we are taking action to safeguard Lake Mead and Lake Powell from the threat of climate change and over-use.” Lake Mead’s surface has dropped more than 170 feet since 1983, and the lake is down to about 30% of capacity. Tucson receives about 144,000 acre feet of CAP water annually but uses only about 100,000 and has been storing the surplus underground. Several American Indian tribes and local jurisdictions, including Phoenix, have not taken their full allocations of CAP water, and Tucson previously said it would also participate if needed, KOLD-TV reports.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Emergency officials reported an explosion early Monday caused by a fire in a grain silo. There were no injuries, police said, but traffic was being diverted and motorists advised to avoid the area.\n\nCalifornia\n\nRedding: Several people were injured when a bull jumped a fence and escaped an arena during a popular Northern California rodeo, authorities said. The escape occurred Friday during the final section of the Redding Rodeo’s bull riding event, the Redding Rodeo Association said on Facebook. The bull leapt over a fence, then ran through a crowd of spectators and across a parking lot before it was captured near a bridge about a half-mile from the arena. At least six people were treated for minor injuries, including 15-year-old Jordan Greco, a sophomore at Redding’s Enterprise High School. Greco said the bull’s horn’s clipped his leg as the animal charged through the arena’s VIP section. “Getting hit by a bull was an experience,” Greco said. “To be honest, I didn’t feel it at the time because my adrenaline was pumping, and I had to make split-second decisions.” At least one person was hurt near the Sundial Bridge, where the animal was finally caught, placed in a trailer and returned to its ranch, Redding police Cpl. Aaron Holleman said. “We wish the best to all those affected. The safety of our fans is our highest priority and we appreciate their support,” the Redding Rodeo Association’s statement said. The incident occurred on the third day of the four-day annual rodeo.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Roses once planted at a site where people of Japanese descent were detained during World War II may soon bloom again. Bonnie Clark, an archaeologist with the University of Denver, and her team found the bramble crawling across the remnants of a barracks doorway at Camp Amache in 2012. It had survived a dark time in American history and the unforgiving extremes of Colorado’s southeastern plains. During World War II, the U.S. government sent some 10,000 Americans of Japanese descent to the camp near the Kansas border, formally known as the Granada Relocation Center. The land recently became a national historic site. Clark, who leads the DU Amache Research Project and Field School, said she believes people who were imprisoned at the camp planted the roses. There is no chance they were growing there before the camp was built, she said, because the land is bone-dry and was mostly uninhabited at the time. “They are living,” Clark said. “But I have never seen them bloom.” But soon that may change. Clark, eager to see the roses flourish and to share the experience with survivors and their descendants, eventually reached out to Denver Botanic Gardens. Horticulturist Mike Bone and his team traveled to Camp Amache last fall to examine the rosebush and take cuttings. They kept the clippings moist and transported them in a cooler to a special propagation greenhouse at the botanic gardens in Denver. The plants are thriving and may blossom by mid-summer, Bone said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Mayor Justin Elicker nominated a high-ranking city police official for chief Monday following a nationwide search. The mayor announced Assistant Chief Karl Jacobson was his pick to lead the department. The nomination will now go before the city’s Board of Alders. “By far the individual that was the most qualified was right here at home,” Elicker said at a news conference. Jacobson came to the New Haven Police Department 15 years ago after a nine-year career with police in East Providence, Rhode Island. He has been assistant chief in New Haven for the past three years. The nomination comes after Elicker’s first pick for chief, Renee Dominguez, was rejected by the Board of Alders after some residents criticized her for not doing enough while serving as acting chief to reduce violent crime and to diversify the department. Dominguez, who would have been the first woman to permanently lead the department, retired earlier this month after a judge ruled she must step down from the acting chief’s job because she served longer than the six months allowed under the city charter. Former Chief Otoniel Reyes retired last June.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: Tuition will increase by 3% for students at the University of Delaware for the upcoming school year. The university announced the tuition increase Friday. In real dollars, it amounts to an increase of $390 for in-state students and $1,050 for out-of-state residents. The university is not increasing its mandatory fees. As a result, full-price tuition, room and board for in-state students will be $29,644 and $52,164 for out-of-state students in the 2022-23 school year. The university said it has budgeted $168 million in undergraduate financial aid for the academic year, an increase of 86% since 2016. Nearly 19,000 undergraduates and nearly 4,300 graduate students are enrolled at the university.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city’s air quality improved early in the pandemic, and local officials hope they can keep that trend going as the coronavirus’ spread slows, WUSA-TV reports. The District Department of Energy and Environment found that ozone levels in 2020 were exceptionally low due to a reduction in traffic congestion. The department said while 2021 was close to a return to pre-pandemic conditions for ozone levels, they remained a bit lower. Kelly Crawford, associate director for the air quality division of DOEE, said if 2022 stay relatively normal in terms of the pandemic, she would expect D.C. to continue to exceed the health-based national ambient air quality standards for ozone levels. “There’s always a concern that as we return to more normal levels of traffic in the district that we’ll see increases in local air pollution,” Crawford said. “However, we are still working on those measures that reduce air pollution in the district.” Crawford said D.C. is working to get more electronic vehicles on the road while encouraging more people to use public transit or bicycles to get to work. She also pointed to the role heat plays in increasing ground ozone levels. The city is expected to have two straight days of 90+ degree heat this week, which is abnormal for mid-May.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The already slow slog of picking jurors in the penalty trial of Parkland school shooter Nikolas Cruz hit a new stumbling block Monday when a potential juror’s T-shirt honoring those killed and traumatized in the 2018 massacre resulted in the dismissal of her entire group of 10. The 58-year-old high school teacher was wearing a T-shirt in the burgundy and silver colors of Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School that read: “Teacher Strong.” Below that were two hashtags that were commonly found on T-shirts and bumper stickers throughout South Florida long after the Feb. 14, 2018, shooting: #msdstrong and #NeverAgain. Cruz, 23, pleaded guilty in October to murdering 17 people and wounding 17 others. The trial will decide whether he is sentenced to death or to life in prison without parole. The woman had been brought into the courtroom separately from the other nine potential jurors because she had written on her questionnaire that she has a medical condition that would prevent her from sitting for long stretches of time. After that was discussed, Melisa McNeill, Cruz’s lead public defender, asked her about her T-shirt and how much contact she had with the other jurors. The woman said she hadn’t talked to the others, but they had all seen her shirt. McNeill told Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer the entire group should be dismissed because the shirt possibly could have been prejudiced others against Cruz. Prosecutors agreed.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Tybee Island’s beaches will officially become a smoke-free zone June1. The City Council narrowly passed the smoke-free ordinance Thursday, with Mayor Shirley Sessions breaking a tie. The ban – which encompasses smoking, vaping and other tobacco-related products – applies to beaches, crossovers and the pier. Smokers are getting warnings during a grace period through the end of May. But once the ordinance goes into effect, those who are caught smoking or vaping on the beach will be fined $300. Surveillance cameras will aid code enforcement. Tybee officials say there will be designated smoking zones off the beach. Fight Dirty Tybee, a nonprofit group that regularly does beach cleanups, has pushed for a smoke-free beach since 2015 after bearing witness to the pounds of cigarette butts they’ve individually plucked off Tybee’s shores. Tim Arnold, the group’s president, said he’s relieved about the council’s decision. During tourist season, he and other volunteers can fill an entire 18-gallon bucket with cigarettes over a one-month span. Most of that is concentrated around the pier. “It’s not a little problem; it’s a massive problem,” Arnold said. “It’s a literal ashtray out there.” Fight Dirty Tybee picks up all types of litter from the beach, but a majority – nearly 70% – is smoking-related, he said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Volunteers gathered Sunday to clean up a section of the Kalihi neighborhood that’s become an illegal dumping ground. “We have keiki that reside in this area,” Joanna Polevia, a State of Hawaii Organization of Police Officers administrative assistant who organized the event, told HawaiiNewsNow. “And they walked to school through all of this.” Auiki Street had been plagued by bulky rubbish, overgrown vegetation and graffiti, according to the news outlet, but more than 100 residents, business owners, community leaders and others came out to transform the site.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. officials have released an environmental study for a proposed nuclear test reactor to be built in eastern Idaho that backers say is needed to revamp the nation’s fading nuclear power industry by developing safer fuel and power plants. The U.S. Department of Energy earlier this month released the environmental impact statement for the Versatile Test Reactor that would be the first new test reactor built in the U.S. in decades. It would give the nation a dedicated “fast-neutron-spectrum” testing capability. Such reactors are called fast reactors. Plans call for building the reactor at the Energy Department’s 890-square-mile site that includes the Idaho National Laboratory by the end of 2026. The environmental impact statement notes that the reactor would produce spent nuclear fuel beyond 2035, going past a deadline the Energy Department has with Idaho concerning spent nuclear fuel at the site. The document states that the Energy Department would explore possible approaches with Idaho regarding that issue. Construction of the proposed reactor depends on funding from Congress.\n\nIllinois\n\nSt. Charles: A weekend fire that damaged portions of a shuttered suburban Chicago resort took firefighters a full day to extinguish, and officials are still working to determine how it started. The fire began Saturday afternoon at the former Pheasant Run Resort in St. Charles, sending huge plumes of smoke into the sky. More than 20 local fire departments, including the St. Charles Fire Department, battled the blaze before it was extinguished late Sunday afternoon. No firefighters or civilians were injured in the fire in St. Charles, a city in DuPage and Kane counties that’s about 35 miles west of downtown Chicago. The blaze was contained to the center structures of the shuttered 18-acre complex, Deputy Chief Erik Mahan with the St. Charles Police Department told the (Arlington Heights) Daily Herald. He said investigators are still trying to determine how the fire began, saying that “many questions are unanswered.” While the idled resort had been the target of vandals during the past year, Mahan said there is no evidence anyone had been living on the closed property before the fire began Saturday. The Pheasant Run Resort closed in March 2020 after attempts to auction the property were unsuccessful.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: In the past five years, the city has denied the vast majority of tort claims for pothole damage. Just 84, or 3%, of the 2,600 claims the city received from 2017 through 2021 were awarded settlements, according to data provided by the Office of Corporation Counsel. The state’s tort claim law says claims that sit for more than 90 days are automatically considered denied. Year to year, the percentage of cases that get settled varies from less than 1% in 2018 to about 10% in 2017. Those settlements over five years amounted to just over $34,200, or about $400 a claim. For the city to consider itself responsible for pothole damage, the city has to have received notice of the pothole and had a “reasonable opportunity” to fix it prior to the person’s striking it, Deputy Chief Counsel Misty Mercer said. How often the 90-day rule gets invoked has varied widely in the five-year period, as has the sheer number of claims. In 2017, more than half were decided within a month, and only a sliver were left sitting more than 90 days. Things changed in 2018, when a particularly brutal freeze-thaw cycle led city Department of Public Works Director Dan Parker to call it “pothole-mageddon.” The number of tort claims jumped fivefold. All but 1% were denied. And one-fifth sat for more than 90 days. The only way to push back against the city’s denial is to sue in small claims court, and for a $200 to $400 claim, most people don’t bother, said attorney Gary Selig, whose law firm offers tort claim services.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds’ proposal to divert about $55 million from public schools to private school scholarships will not pass in the state House because of a lack of Republican support, House Speaker Pat Grassley said Monday. Reynolds’ plan to provide taxpayer-funded scholarships for up to 10,000 students to attend the private school of their choice was one of her top priorities for the legislative session. The measure passed the state Senate in March with only Republican support but won’t clear the House, despite the GOP holding a 60-40 edge in the chamber. The opposition largely came from lawmakers in rural areas and smaller communities who were concerned about the loss of money to public schools. Reynolds targeted at least one Republican, Jon Thorup of Knoxville, by supporting his opponent in the upcoming June primary election over his opposition to her bill. “It doesn’t look like were going to be able to put the votes together in the House this year to pass that; however, we want to continue to work with the governor to get something achieved that’s been a big priority of hers moving toward next session, and we’ll work on that in the offseason,” Grassley said. He said the session likely will end this week. Adjournment has been delayed over the issue of private school scholarships.\n\nKansas\n\nMcPherson: A couple well-known for their philanthropy have donated $25 million to McPherson College, the largest gift in the college’s 135-year history. Melanie Lundquist announced the gift from her and husband Richard while she gave the commencement address Sunday at the private liberal arts college about 60 miles north of Wichita. The college said the gift would be used to complete a fundraising campaign started in October 2019. With the Lundquists’ gift, the campaign has raised $53 million, which will be used to build a campus commons, strengthen academic programs and support a project that enables students to graduate debt-free. Richard Lundquist owns Continental Development Corp., a property development firm based in El Segundo, California. He and his wife are noted philanthropists, with an emphasis on education and health care. The couple did not attend or graduate from McPherson. Their relationship with the college began in 2012. Previous donations to the school have included $1 million and an Enzo Ferrari 1972 365GTB/4 Daytona to its automotive restoration program. Richard Lundquist, who will become a member of McPherson’s Board of Trustees, said he and his wife hope the gift “spurs more support of well-run small liberal arts colleges in the U.S.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A police officer who was fired for threatening to kill his colleagues and supervisors in the homicide unit is asking the city Merit Board to give him his job back, saying he suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder. Former homicide unit detective Christopher Palombi was fired March 2 for violating two department policies – obedience to rules and regulations and conduct unbecoming – after a contentious series of communications Jan. 13-14 with two officers in which he threatened a “shootout” suicide, killing all his colleagues in the homicide unit and killing four commanding officers whom he named. Palombi’s attorney, Thomas Clay, said at Thursday’s Merit Board hearing that the department wrongfully terminated Palombi because of his disability, PTSD, and blatantly ignored state and federal law that prohibits such action. Clay said during the hearing he plans to prove that Palombi suffered punishment because of his disability and he was otherwise qualified to perform the job. The board is expected to make a decision this week at the conclusion of what’s expected to be a four-day hearing. The threats stemmed from Palombi’s frustration after he was turned down for a transfer to the Office of Sexual and Physical Abuse Investigations, Lt. Donnie Burbrink, commander of the homicide unit, said Thursday.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A three-day comment period opens Tuesday for a proposed group housing site for Hurricane Ida survivors in one southeast Louisiana parish, the Federal Emergency Management Agency said Monday. Up to 75 families could be housed at the site in the St. Charles Parish community of Killona, the agency said in a news release. FEMA says the parish needs 79 units for residents whose houses were destroyed or are still unlivable because of damage from the hurricane that made landfall Aug. 29, 2021. Comments would be about a draft environmental assessment. Instructions for getting that document and posting comments are available on the agency’s website. FEMA says it’s a short comment period because of a housing emergency among survivors of the hurricane. Developing the proposed 13-acre site would need clearing, grading, road construction, the placement of concrete pads, utilities and installation of transportable temporary housing units. The agency notes that such group sites are generally occupied by families who lived in the area before the hurricane. That means they typically don’t increase demands for local services such as schools and police and fire protection. Once the direct housing program ends, FEMA will remove all housing units and infrastructure, returning the property as close as possible to its original state.\n\nMaine\n\nPassadumkeag: The small town has effectively shut down because it no longer has a town clerk, code enforcement officer, assessor or animal control officer. The Bangor Daily News reports that Christen Bouchard resigned last month from her position as town clerk in Passadumkeag, a town of about 350 residents north of Bangor. She also had been serving as deputy treasurer and was in charge of licensing pets, registering vehicles and maintaining vital records. The town office has been closed since April 21, and it’s unclear when some of the key positions might be filled.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The former chief of staff to Gov. Larry Hogan abused his position as leader of the Maryland Environmental Service, in part by arranging for an unprecedented $233,647 severance payment, according to a legislative investigation. The investigation also said Roy McGrath collected exorbitant personal expenses and improperly hired close personal associates, The Baltimore Sun reports. Lawmakers announced the results of the investigation Friday in an 82-page report detailing McGrath’s conduct and recommending that MES seek financial restitution for money McGrath and his associate Matthew Sherring spent on activities irrelevant to their jobs. State Senate President Bill Ferguson called the report “deeply troubling on all levels.” “Mr. McGrath’s conduct and flouting of long-established rules and policies to enrich himself and loyal friends is beyond the pale of what we expect of our public servants,” Ferguson, D-Baltimore, said in a statement. House Speaker Adrienne Jones, D-Baltimore County, said the behavior outlined in the report “dissolves the public’s trust in our entire system of government and can never be tolerated.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Two police officers who killed suspects in two unrelated shootings in 2019 acted within the law and will not face criminal prosecution, the city’s top prosecutor said Monday. The officers’ actions in both cases “were lawful and reasonable exercises of self-defense and/or defense of others,” the office of Suffolk District Attorney Kevin Hayden said in a statement. “I am deeply aware of the impact these cases have on everyone involved,” Hayden said. “Our office moved forward with all these investigations with the utmost respect for all those affected by these traumatic events. We met with the families of those killed, the officers involved and their respective departments regarding these findings in advance of releasing them to the public. These were thorough, meticulous investigations conducted with one primary goal – to gather and review all the relevant facts.” In one case, Boston Officer William Hull shot Kasim Kahrim in the city’s Roxbury neighborhood early Feb. 22, 2019, after Kahrim shot and injured Hull’s partner, Officer Mark Whelan, the prosecutor’s office said. In the other shooting, which occurred Aug. 4, 2019, in Revere, Everett Officer Alex Vieira shot and killed Oscar Ventura-Gonzales after a “dangerous high-speed” vehicle pursuit, according to the investigation.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A foundation connected to billionaire Dan Gilbert is investing $13 million in a fund to help low-income city residents facing eviction. The Gilbert Family Foundation said Monday that $12 million will be invested over three years in three Detroit-based organizations that will provide legal representation for renters with children. It is expected to benefit nearly 6,000 families each year. The funding will be made directly to the United Community Housing Coalition, Michigan Legal Services and Lakeshore Legal Aid, which will manage the program. They also will hire lawyers, legal supervisors and legal aids. The Gilbert Family Foundation also has allocated up to $1 million for a long-term study into the program’s effectiveness and the city’s eviction defense ecosystem. City officials recently passed an ordinance that provides renters facing eviction with legal representation in all eviction proceedings and housing-related administrative proceedings that threaten the occupancy of their homes. Dan Gilbert is founder and chair of Rocket Companies, which includes mortgage loan provider Rocket Mortgage.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State utility regulators have decided pipelines that carry carbon dioxide are hazardous and therefore subject to state approval. The decision by the Public Utilities Commission on Thursday affects two multibillion-dollar carbon dioxide pipelines proposed to cross Minnesota and carry waste from several ethanol plants in the Midwest. Commissioners interpreted a 1998 state law on pipelines that carry hazardous materials includes those transporting carbon dioxide. The decision initiates a rulemaking process that could take a year to complete. Actual approval of any CO2 pipeline could take months after that. The companies seeking to build the pipelines disagree with the commission’s decision. The Midwest Carbon Express, proposed by Summit Carbon Solutions, would run for 150 miles in Minnesota, connecting to seven ethanol plants. The Heartland Greenway, proposed by Navigator CO2 Ventures, would run for 12 miles, linking to one ethanol plant west of Fairmont. Commissioners left open a possible exemption for Navigator’s pipeline since it only goes through one county, the Star Tribune reports. CO2 is heavier than air, so if a pipeline ruptures, it can displace oxygen and potentially cause breathing difficulties, rapid heartbeat, vomiting, headaches and impaired thinking.\n\nMississippi\n\nNatchez: A school district has approved a $5,000 incentive to help recruit teachers. Natchez-Adams School District will pay some teachers in areas of “critical need” a $5,000 sign-on bonus to come work for them following a unanimous vote of the Board of Trustees. The bonus is specific to English, mathematics and science teachers and will be issued “based on funding availability,” Deputy Superintendent Zandra McDonald Green said, The Natchez Democrat reports. It would be in addition to a historic teacher pay raise that legislators passed at the state level. The district’s biggest area of need is math teachers in sixth through 12th grade, Superintendent Fred Butcher said. With 16 vacancies for certified teachers, “we’re in better shape than we were this time last year,” he said. However, the Mississippi Department of Education has said the district would lose its accreditation if no changes to its staffing were made, said Cassandra Tennessee, the district’s assistant supervisor of human resources. One reason the district had been cited is that school accreditation guidelines were relaxed during the pandemic, and teachers were moved around to accommodate classroom changes to keep students safe. Consequentially, some teachers are now teaching multiple classes outside their areas of certification, Butcher said.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Workers at Daniel Boone Regional Library in central Missouri have voted to form a union, library officials said in a statement Monday. The new union will be the only active public library union in the state. The results showed 101 employees in favor of unionizing with 55 opposed, for 65% approval, according to the Missouri State Board of Mediation. Daniel Boone Regional Library has branches in Columbia, Fulton, Ashland and Holts Summit. Employees covered by the new DBRLWorkersUnited union will be represented by the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees. Union supporters cited concerns about pay and benefits, safety and health policies, and communication with administrators as reasons they began the union effort. The next step is contract negotiations between the library and the union. No date has been set to begin that process. Margaret Conroy, executive director of the Daniel Boone Regional Library, said in the release that the library’s employees job satisfaction has always been important to administrators. “We are looking forward to learning more about their specific concerns through the bargaining process,” the release said.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A hospital is using virtual reality to aid in neurological rehabilitation. Every patient at the Rehabilitation Hospital of Montana is expected to complete three hours of demanding therapy a day. To spice up the grueling repetitions, RHOM partnered with tech companies Penumbra and BIONIK Labs to integrate virtual reality and artificial intelligence to patient care, The Billings Gazette reports. RHOM is now the first and only facility in Montana to utilize this technology. “(Rehab) is probably the last frontier for medical robotics,” said Loren Wass, chief commercial officer with BIONIK Labs. The company produces the InMotion ARM, which uses robotics, AI and machine learning to help patients work on upper extremity rehabilitation when they have a neurological disorder such as a stroke, Wass said. The patient is seated in front of a monitor, and their forearm is strapped into the device. Guided by games on the screen, the patient grips a handle and moves their arm forward and back, challenging them to get in more reps. The AI and ML allows the device to collect data and adapt to the patient’s needs. The machine produces progress reports, makes treatment recommendations and can follow protocol driven treatments. In a conventional therapy session, the patient completes about 30 to 60 movements in an hour, while BIONIK’s InMotion ARM devices achieve 600 to 1,000 movements in the same amount of time.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A couple hundred people grabbed their pool noodles and headed to a local park again over the weekend to battle over the right to the name “Josh.” The event started as an online joke when Josh Swain, from Tucson, Arizona, sent out a tweet challenging anyone who shared his name to fight over it. After it took on a life of its own, Swain turned it into a real event last year at the random coordinates he included in his original note, which happened to be in Lincoln, Nebraska. “The enthusiasm from everybody here was just incredible,” Swain told the Lincoln Journal Star. Several of the competitors this year donned costumes, including masks, animal suits and football helmets, before heading out to Bowling Lake Park. But that wasn’t enough to dethrone 5-year-old Josh Vinson Jr., who defended his 2021 title as the No. 1 Josh. Saturday’s event raised nearly $21,000 for Children’s Hospital & Medical Center in Omaha, and the owners of the Josh Cellars wine label pledged to match that amount with a donation of their own. The hospital said it plans to share some of the donations with the Joshua Collinsworth Memorial Foundation that promotes water safety with its Josh the Otter mascot, who attended Saturday’s battle. Swain said he’d like to make the Josh Fight an annual event, though he’s not sure if he’ll be able to keep it up.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: One of the more than 70 high schools in the Clark County School District has several examples of the kind of physical security that officials want to see districtwide as they assess safety in the wake of a string of high-profile acts of campus violence. Chris Batterman, a coordinator in the district’s office of emergency management, pointed them out on a recent walk-through with the Las Vegas Sun at Mohave High School, a campus in North Las Vegas campus home to more than 2,500 students. All visitors, such as parents picking up their kids early, are funneled through the theater entrance, which has a separate exterior door outside of the school’s main gate. There’s also a panoramic-view window, made into one-way glass by a graphic wrap, from the administrative office overlooking the quad. The courtyard is spacious, with well-trimmed landscaping – bushes aren’t full enough to hide people – and the outdoor stairwells are airy, all to reduce blind spots and allow easy flow of foot traffic. Notably, it’s the theater entrance, a few paces east of Mojave’s main gate leading to the front office – a socially distanced holdover from pandemic protocols – that makes it harder for just anybody to come onto campus, especially if they have dubious intentions. The main gate cannot be opened from the outside. Single points of entry are among many target-hardening methods school officials are reviewing and will potentially boost into the summer and beyond.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has vetoed a bill that would have barred schools from implementing face mask mandates. The bill vetoed Friday would have prohibited school boards or other public education agencies from adopting policies requiring students or members of the public to wear face coverings. “Just because we may not like a local decision does not mean we should remove their authority,” Sununu said in his veto message. “One of the state’s foremost responsibilities is to know the limits of its power.” Though Sununu also noted that the state prides itself on promoting local control in education, schools have not had free rein when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. When state public health officials stopped recommending mask-wearing in most indoor public spaces in February, Sununu said any schools that try to maintain mask mandates would run afoul of state laws requiring that each student be provided equitable access to education. Also in February, the state enacted new rules prohibiting schools from shifting to fully remote or hybrid instruction due to COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMoorestown: More than half a billion dollars in federal and state funds will go to nearly 30 water systems in the state, serving about 6 million residents, or about two-thirds of New Jersey’s population, officials said Friday. The combined federal and state funding of $588 million in low-interest loans will cover an array of projects. In Newark, the state’s biggest city, some $25 million will go toward lead service line replacement. In suburban Philadelphia’s Moorestown at the North Church Street Water Treatment Plant, where officials unveiled the funding Friday, about $20 million will cover new filters to remove radium and other toxins from water. And in rural Clinton, a water system is getting almost $3 million as part of a water main extension project. The announcement is the latest orchestrated this year by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy’s and President Joe Biden’s administrations to retool and repair crumbling infrastructure. Vice President Kamala Harris made a stop in Newark in February to highlight the city’s efforts at removing lead pipes. The funding includes $221 million from the Environmental Protection Agency under a 2014 law known as the Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act. The remainder comes from a mix of state funding and from the sale of bonds from the New Jersey Infrastructure Bank, a state authority that finances road, water and other projects.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The governor has presented a long-awaited plan that would set goals for academic proficiency as the state struggles to resolve a lawsuit by frustrated parents who won a court ruling saying New Mexico is failing to provide an adequate education for the vast majority of its students. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s proposal released this month is meant to satisfy that 2018 court ruling and ongoing litigation to ensure adequate resources to equip students as they pursue a career or college education. New Mexico is on a long list of states where parents have turned to the court system to address frustrations with the state budget process and the quality of classroom education. The public and advocacy groups have until June 17 to comment. The plan is expected to drive immediate reforms by the state Public Education Department, as well as discussion and budget priorities in the Legislature next year. However, critics say it lacks specifics, including detailed funding plans and timelines. Native American education advocates and tribal leaders put forward their own plan in 2019. Called the “Tribal Remedy Framework,” it cites sections of the lawsuit, makes specific recommendations and suggests a specific amount of funding to carry them out.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The city has agreed to pay $7 million to a man who spent 23 years behind bars for a murder he didn’t commit, Comptroller Brad Lander said Monday. Grant Williams was exonerated last July in the 1996 shooting of Shdell Lewis outside a Staten Island public housing complex. Williams, who is in his 50s, had been paroled in 2019. After being cleared last year, he filed a notice of claim, a first step toward suing the city. The comptroller’s office has the authority to settle such claims without court action and occasionally does so, including in the 2014 police chokehold death of Eric Garner. “While no amount of money can bring those years back for Mr. Williams or his family, I am pleased that we were able to move quickly to a fair and early resolution of this claim,” Lander, a Democrat, said in a statement. The case against Williams had rested largely on the testimony of a couple of eyewitnesses. One was a police officer who chased the gunman and initially gave a description that didn’t match Williams. Prosecutors at his trial also sought to suggest a connection between Williams and a baseball cap the shooter dropped at the scene, though it was never tested for DNA that could have pointed to its wearer. It was emblazoned with the logo of Wu-Tang Clan; Williams had worked at the multiplatinum-selling rap group’s Staten Island studio. No physical, forensic or digital evidence tied Williams to the crime, and some witnesses testified he wasn’t the gunman.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republicans in the state Senate are strongly considering legislation that would expand Medicaid coverage to hundreds of thousands of additional low-income adults. Such legislation would mark a key step in an extraordinary turnabout by GOP members in the chamber set against expansion for a decade. A draft bill yet to be formally filed also would include several other medical, health care coverage and insurance reforms, according to a summary of the bill obtained by the Associated Press. Many of these proposals, including expansion, have been discussed in a House-Senate health care study committee that’s met several times since February. “Senate Republicans continue to have discussions about how to address the rising costs of health care and how to increase access in the state,” Lauren Horsch, a spokesperson for Senate leader Phil Berger, said Monday. Horsch confirmed the summary’s authenticity but could not say if and when legislation would be filed during the General Assembly’s annual work session, which began last week and likely will end around July 1. The measure’s showpiece would be Medicaid expansion, which Republicans were cool to or outright against for several years after the 2010 federal Affordable Care Act authorized the coverage for people earning too much money for traditional Medicaid coverage. North Carolina is one of a dozen states that have not expanded Medicaid.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A panel that regulates the state’s energy industry voted Monday to extend the deadline for proposals to build a natural gas pipeline from western North Dakota’s oil patch to the eastern part of the state. The three-member, all-Republican North Dakota Industrial Commission headed by Gov. Doug Burgum moved the deadline for proposals to Aug. 15 after no applications were received by the deadline this month. The Legislature in November set aside $150 million in federal coronavirus aid to help construct such a trans-state pipeline for natural gas, which is a byproduct of oil production. The idea, pushed by Burgum, was to help cut down on the wasteful flaring at well sites and pipe it to communities in the gas-poor eastern part of the state, hoping to spur industrial development. Despite the promised subsidies, no applications were submitted for the pipeline. WBI Energy, a subsidiary of Bismarck-based MDU Resources Group, said the project is not viable due to regulatory uncertainty, limited in-state demand and rising construction, labor and land-acquisition costs. MDU resources is North Dakota’s only Fortune 500 company. WBI Energy owns and operates more than 3,700 miles of transmission and storage pipelines in the Dakotas, Minnesota, Montana and Wyoming.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The city could soon add anti-discrimination protections for “gender expression” and for women who breastfeed in public. The city’s anti-discrimination law already has protections for transgender people. But under the proposed changes, the law specifically forbids discrimination based on “gender expression,” which is defined in the bill as how a person expresses themselves through “one’s behavior or appearance, that may or may not be those traditionally associated with the individual’s assigned sex at birth.” Businesses, employers and landlords would be among those subject to the new rules. Councilmembers Reggie Harris and Victoria Parks, both Democrats, are proposing the tweaks to the law. The City Council could vote on the measures as soon as Wednesday. “Fundamentally we are a rule-abiding society,” Harris said. “It really does make a difference when there are laws on the books that shape people and business’ behavior. So it is important the anti-discrimination code be up to date.” Harris said changes would bring city law in line with proposed federal and state equality acts, which would protect LGBTQ people against discrimination in employment, housing, credit, education, public spaces and services, government-funded programs and jury service.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Less than one-third of the state’s voters want a ban on all abortions, and only Republicans are deeply divided on the question, according to a poll taken before the Legislature approved bills this year aimed at shutting down most abortions. The poll, taken by Amber Integrated of 500 registered Oklahoma voters in December, shows 31% would support a total ban on abortion if the U.S. Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade; 55% of the Oklahoma voters surveyed did not want a total ban, and another 14% were unsure. Only 14% of Democratic voters and 12% of independents said they would favor a total ban on abortion if the 1973 ruling is tossed. On the Republican side, 48% of those voters surveyed said they would support a total ban, while 40% would not. Only 29% of women and 33% of men surveyed favored a total ban on abortion. “This shows that most voters cannot simply be placed into a ‘pro-life’ or ‘pro-choice’ dichotomy,” said pollster Jackson Lisle, a partner in Amber Integrated, of Oklahoma City. “Voters have a wide range of beliefs that lie between a 100% ban on abortion and allowing abortion up until the point of birth.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A permit system that will limit how people visit the most popular waterfall hikes in the state goes into effect this week, part of an effort to combat skyrocketing crowds and parking congestion around Oregon’s most beautiful places. The latest system requires visitors to obtain a “timed use permit” to drive into the Columbia Gorge’s waterfall corridor on the historic highway between Bridal Veil (via exit 28 from Interstate 5) and Ainsworth State Park (exit 35). The permits, which can be purchased at Recreation.gov two weeks in advance of a visit, are required between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. May 24 to Sept. 5. They’ll be required to reach popular spots such as Multnomah Falls, Horsetail Falls and Oneonta Trail. The permits, now on sale, provide a one-hour window for people to enter through blockades set up on both sides of the Columbia River Gorge Historic Highway. “Everybody knows how big a problem traffic congestion is in this part of the Gorge, and this is a pilot program to see how well it works,” Oregon Department of Transportation spokesman Don Hamilton said. “At the end of the summer, we’ll look at whether this is an effective tool for the long term. We know something has to be done, and this is what we’re starting with.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nNorristown: The state’s former top law enforcement officer, who served jail time for leaking secret investigative files and lying about it, admitted Monday that she violated her probation when she was arrested for drunken driving in March. Kathleen Kane, the first woman and first Democrat to be elected attorney general in Pennsylvania, was sentenced to two months to a year of jail on the probation violation but was given credit for time already served and scheduled to be paroled directly to a residential treatment center for alcohol use. Kane appeared before the same judge who sentenced her in the original leak case. “I was not anticipating seeing you again, and I was hopeful we would not see you again in Montgomery County, but that’s been your choice, not mine,” Judge Wendy Demchick-Alloy told Kane in court. Kane took the stand briefly and answered a series of routine questions. She did not comment outside court. Once a rising star in Pennsylvania politics, Kane resigned as attorney general after being convicted in 2016 of perjury, obstruction and other counts for leaking grand jury material to embarrass a rival prosecutor. She served eight months of a 10- to 23-month sentence before being released in 2019.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The $5.3 billion sale of Narragansett Electric to PPL Corporation is moving ahead again after a Rhode Island Superior Court judge lifted a stay that had put the transaction on hold. Judge Brian Stern lifted the stay after Attorney General Peter Neronha and PPL notified the court Monday morning that they had reached a settlement to resolve an appeal lodged by Neronha’s office. The terms of the settlement had not yet been filed with the court, and Stern still has to approve the agreement. But a favorable decision is expected, allowing the case to be dismissed. Under the settlement, which was announced by PPL, the company will provide $50 million in bill credits to gas and electric customers in Rhode Island, seek approval from state regulators to forgive $43 million in bill arrearages for low-income customers, forgo recovery of the costs of transitioning Narragansett Electric to new ownership, and write off another $20 million in assets. Among other measures, the company agreed not to seek any base rate increases for at least three years after the transaction closes. PPL said it expects to close the acquisition this week.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nParris Island: Rising seas are encroaching on one of America’s most storied military installations, where thousands of recruits are molded into Marines each year amid the salt marshes of South Carolina’s Lowcountry region. Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island is particularly vulnerable to flooding, coastal erosion and other impacts of climate change, a Defense Department-funded “resiliency review” noted last month. Some scientists project that by 2099, three-quarters of the island could be underwater during high tides each day. Military authorities say they’re confident they can keep the second-oldest Marine Corps base intact, for now, through small-scale changes to existing infrastructure projects. Maj. Marc Blair, Parris Island’s environmental director, described this strategy as “the art of the small,” a phrase he attributed to the base’s commanding general, Brig. Gen. Julie Nethercot. In practice, it means such things as raising a culvert that needs to be repaired anyway, limiting development in low-lying areas and adding floodproofing measures to firing range upgrades. Others advocate much larger and more expensive solutions, such as building huge seawalls around the base, or moving Marine Corps training away from the coast altogether. Salt marsh makes up more than half of the base’s 8,000 acres, and the depot’s highest point, by the fire station, is just 13 feet above sea level. It is linked to the mainland by a single road that’s already susceptible to flooding.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Four ad agencies, all from outside the state, have been selected to collaborate on promoting its tourism industry. Karsh Hagan, Love Communications, Lou Hammond Group and Two by Four were picked after only one South Dakota agency bid for the partnership. The four out-of-state companies were selected because of what the Department of Tourism sees as new and fresh ideas to give South Dakota tourism a broader appeal, said state tourism spokeswoman Katlyn Svendsen. “When it came down to it, these folks inspired us, and they really encouraged us to think differently about our state and how consumers are looking at it, and that’s what’s important to us because we’re advertising to millions of people across the country and internationally,” Svendsen said. Robert Sharp, with Rapid City-based marketing group Sharp & Associates, told KOTA-TV it’s baffling that the state can’t find marketing talent in its own borders to promote what South Dakota has to offer. Svendsen said the new campaigns in recent years have been able to better spread the word. “Where we have gone in the last few years, we’ve taken our brand nationally, we’ve been able to place our first national TV spot in the last few years, and we’ve really continued to elevate our brand and be on the rise,” she said.\n\nTennessee\n\nCleveland: A private Christian university is considering strictly limiting the free speech rights of its students when it comes to sexuality and gender, from how they behave to what they wear and what they can say on campus or even online, according to published reports. If approved, the policy presented to faculty and staff at Lee University this month would not allow students to identify as anything other than their biological sex. They also would be forbidden from questioning these restrictions or any other university policy, according to a leaked draft. The proposal has sparked criticism from some former students, including the Affirming Alum Collective, a group of alumni from the Cleveland university, who posted on Facebook that they were “deeply saddened and frustrated by the new anti-LGBTQIA+ policies” under consideration. A university spokesperson, Kendra Mann, released a statement to WTVC-TV and the Chattanooga Times Free Press saying the policy has been in the works for years and is in line with long-standing theological beliefs. “No member of the Lee University community may publicly identify or behave as a gender that does not correspond to his or her biological sex,” the draft policy says.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Seven years after being charged with felony crimes, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has managed to avoid standing trial. The twists and turns of how the Republican – who is on the cusp of winning the GOP nomination for a third term Tuesday – has yet to have his day in court after being indicted on securities fraud charges in 2015 has little comparison in American politics. And along the way, it has upended what it means to be a compromised officeholder in Texas. Four different judges have overseen his case at some point. Where a trial would happen – if it ever does – has pingponged from Dallas to Houston to Dallas again. All the while, other clouds have gathered over Paxton: The FBI is investigating him over separate accusations of corruption, and the State Bar of Texas is weighing possible reprimands over his attempts to baselessly overturn the 2020 election. Once, nearly a year passed with no movement in the case at all. “I mean, this one is crazy,” said Andrew Wheat, a leader of the watchdog Texans for Public Justice. His group in 2014 filed a complaint with prosecutors over Paxton’s failure to register as a securities adviser, one of the criminal charges the Republican is battling. Paxton, who faces five to 99 years in prison if convicted, has pleaded not guilty. His attorneys point out that Paxton invoked his right to a speedy trial and blame the holdup on special prosecutors, who have spent years in a protracted battle over how much they’re getting paid and where the case should be tried.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Pride of Southern Utah has new leadership and new plans for southwestern Utah’s LGBTQ+ community, starting in June. The previous leaders of POSU, Katie Perkins and Lisa Wucherpfenning, stepped down and handed the role of executive director over to Micah Barrick. Barrick’s wife, Morgan, will take on the events coordinator position. However, leadership isn’t all that’s changed for the organization. Traditionally, POSU holds most of its events in September, when it has cooled down from the hottest days of summer, but doesn’t have many activities the rest of the year. Under Barrick, POSU is planning on holding monthly events throughout the year and growing the LGBTQ+ community. “We’re back in full swing,” Barrick said. “And we, you know, want to make people feel safe. St. George is growing; there’s a lot more queer people moving to town. So we want to create just more events, more visibility for them create safe spaces for them to come out and enjoy the beauty of St. George.” To welcome the leadership, POSU hosted a meet-and-greet event Sunday near Encircle, which is partnered with POSU. “I’m committed to creating more safe, inclusive events, fun events, family-friendly events for the community, just because there’s such a need for it,” Morgan Barrick said.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: A refugee resettlement organization has proposed bringing more than 300 refugees to the city in the next three years. Amila Merdzanovic, the Vermont director of the U.S. Committee on Refugees and Immigrants, wrote in an email to the city’s Board of Aldermen last week that the organization has proposed to federal officials to resettle 75 people in Rutland in fiscal year 2023, 100 in fiscal year 2024 and 150 in fiscal year 2025, the Rutland Herald reports. The city is now home to 13 people who fled from Afghanistan following the withdrawal of all U.S. troops from there last year. Two Syrian families arrived in 2017. “They are settling in well, all are working at local manufacturing companies, learning English, and connecting with community members,” Merdzanovic wrote. “Many Rutlanders have given them a warm welcome and are helping them get settled in the community.” Gov. Phil Scott has been a strong proponent of refugee resettlement. He’s also issued a call inviting the federal government to settle Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion in the state.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: Dozens of graves at a city-owned cemetery are threatened by eroding shorelines on the Elizabeth River. A city review of the 44-acre site at Riverside Memorial Park found the shoreline surrounding the cemetery has been damaged by decades of dredging, nearby marine industrial activity and wind-driven waves that have undercut the riverbanks. At least 10 headstones are only feet away from steep slopes leading down to the river, The Virginian-Pilot reports. The city is seeking $1.9 million from the Virginia Community Flood Preparedness Fund to repair 1,500 feet of shoreline. But the money in that fund comes from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, from which Gov. Glenn Youngkin wants to withdraw. A city official said it’s unclear if that funding source would be available if Virginia withdraws from the regional initiative.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Eastern Washington University and No-Li Brewhouse will create the school’s first professional certificate program for the craft beer industry. The 15-credit program begins in the fall. No-Li Brewhouse owners John and Cindy Bryant donated $10,000 to help launch the certificate program. “It’s going to provide living wage jobs and great career opportunities,” John Bryant told The Spokesman-Review. Chris Cindric, a senior lecturer for EWU’s Department of Wellness & Movement Sciences, said the idea for a craft beer certificate program was sparked after he invited Bryant to speak at one of his classes. More than 64 breweries are located within 100 miles of Spokane, and demand is increasing for jobs in the craft beer industry, Cindric said. As breweries expand, they are looking to hire employees in production, service, distribution, human resources, event management, marketing and more, Cindric said. The state of Washington has more than 437 craft breweries, and the industry generated more than $2 billion in economic impact in 2019, according to the Brewers Association, a Boulder, Colorado-based craft beer industry trade group.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A celebration of the state’s mountain culture and ethnic heritage will return to its original, full-weekend format for the first time in three years. The 45nd annual Vandalia Gathering is set for Friday through Sunday on the state Capitol grounds in Charleston. The free event that includes traditional arts, music, dance and food was canceled in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic and was limited last year. The festival kicks off Friday evening with an awards ceremony for quilt and wall hangings, followed by the presentation of the Vandalia Award, the state’s highest folk-life honor, along with a concert. Another concert is set for Saturday evening. Exhibitors will demonstrate their crafts and sell handmade items, including art, jewelry, pottery and candles. Several competitions are on tap Saturday and Sunday, including banjo, fiddle, dulcimer, mandolin and guitar. The festival wraps up Sunday with a Liars Contest in the Culture Center theater.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Assembly Speaker Robin Vos was booed and jeered at Republicans’ state convention Saturday, and more than a third of those gathered voted to oust him. Vos remains at the center of the fight within the Wisconsin Republican Party over the false claims of voter fraud successfully deployed by ex-President Donald Trump to build doubt over his legitimate election loss in 2020. But on Saturday, Vos withstood a second attempt in as many years to call for his removal – a punishment GOP activists want to level for his refusal to rescind the state’s 10 Electoral College votes cast for President Joe Biden. About 36% of convention delegates voted to approve a resolution calling for Vos to resign or be removed from his position as speaker. Forty percent supported a resolution to decertify the 2020 election, which has been deemed by legal scholars and constitutional attorneys to be impossible even as Trump continues to say otherwise. The convention resolutions are symbolic votes with no practical impact. The vote to oust Vos came hours after he had enraged much of the convention audience by declaring again that the 2020 election was over.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: A state board has turned back a proposal to name a butte after Jackson Pollock, the famed artist born in the city, Wyofile.com reports. A Michigan-based painter who’d rendered the promontory’s likeness in a series of works discovered it had no formal name and suggested “Mount Jackson Pollock,” but the Wyoming Board of Geographic Names took back its endorsement of the proposal upon learning the butte was on private property, according to the news outlet. And the public response to the idea had been mixed in Park County, given that Pollock’s family moved away from Cody when he was just a baby.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/03/31/chef-initiative-ice-fishing-trash-tribeca-plans-news-around-states/115656660/", "title": "Chef initiative, ice fishing trash: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A spokeswoman for Gov. Kay Ivey said Monday that the state’s mask mandate will end April 9 despite the president’s request for states to reinstate or maintain restrictions. “We have made progress, and we are moving towards personal responsibility and common sense, not endless government mandates,” Ivey spokeswoman Gina Maiola said in a statement. President Joe Biden and a top health official on Monday appealed for mask requirements and other restrictions to be maintained or restored to stave off a “fourth surge” of COVID-19. Alabama has kept a mask mandate in place longer than surrounding states, but Ivey has made clear it will not be extended past the end of next week. The Republican governor has urged Alabamians to keep wearing face coverings as a matter of personal responsibility. “After April 9, masks will no longer be a mandate, but they remain one of the most successful tools we have to keep folks safe from COVID-19,” Ivey said last week. Her office released sign templates that businesses could use to request that their patrons wear masks.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Eight youths from the state have developed a serious inflammatory syndrome from previous coronavirus infections, health officials said in a report. The report released Friday said some of the eight children ended up in the pediatric intensive care unit with severe complications. The condition they developed is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. MIS-C can lead to inflamed organs, including the heart, lungs, kidneys and brain, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since May 2020, the CDC has reported 2,617 cases of the syndrome and 33 deaths from MIS-C across the nation. Most cases were in children and adolescents between ages 1 and 14, with the median age being 9. Cases have occurred in children and adolescents less than 1 year old and up to 20. About 66% of the reported cases have occurred in children who are Hispanic, Latino or Black – a total of 1,586 cases, according to the CDC. Roughly 99% of those who developed the syndrome had previously tested positive for the coronavirus. The remaining 1% were around someone who had the virus, the CDC said. “This happens to kids after COVID,” said Dr. Benjamin Westley, an infectious disease specialist who treated six of the eight Alaska minors and contributed to the report.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Corrections officials cited staffing and resource demands of the pandemic in trying to fend off a contempt-of-court fine against the state that could reach as high as $17 million for failing to follow through on promises in a legal settlement to improve health care for inmates. Lawyers for corrections officials said in a court filing Friday that the pandemic forced people working in prisons to take on more duties, caused infection employees to miss work and required resources to be spent on trying to guard against the coronavirus. They said the focus on protecting prisoners and staff members from the virus came at the expense of compliance with the 6-year-old settlement. While acknowledging their clients’ noncompliance on many provisions of the settlement, the lawyers said corrections officials still made their best efforts to comply in a challenging situation. Compliance declined during periods when the state experienced spikes, when mass testing was done inside prisons and when providing care to inmates with the virus, the attorneys said. The state has already been the subject of two contempt fines totaling $2.5 million for noncompliance with the settlement. U.S. District Judge Roslyn Silver, who had threatened the third round of fines, has warned the state against offering any of its past excuses for noncompliance. In an order earlier this month, Silver wrote that coronavirus restrictions may provide a valid basis for noncompliance but emphasized that the virus can’t be used as a complete shield.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state will open up COVID-19 vaccinations to anyone 16 and older and is dropping its mask mandate immediately, Gov. Asa Hutchinson announced Tuesday. The Republican governor announced the moves as Arkansas saw its coronavirus cases and hospitalizations continue to decline. The state had previously made the vaccine available to people 65 and older as well as several other categories, including teachers, health care workers and food service employees. Hutchinson last month lifted most of the state’s virus restrictions, including restaurant and bar capacity limits, and had said the mask mandate would expire at the end of March if the state met goals for test positivity and hospitalizations. Hutchinson is lifting the mask mandate despite President Joe Biden urging states to reinstate or maintain such restrictions to stave off another surge of the virus. “Last year, the urgent COVID message was ‘wear a mask,’ ” Hutchinson said Saturday in a tweet. “Masks remain important, but today’s urgent message is ‘get vaccinated’ … but if we are going to win, we must increase the count. Roll up your sleeve for Arkansas!”\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Massive Los Angeles County can reopen even more businesses – including outdoor bars that don’t serve food – while expanding how many people are allowed to dine indoors and catch a movie, but it won’t do so until next week, officials said Tuesday. The county of 10 million people was one of several, including neighboring Orange, that moved into the state’s second-least-restrictive orange tier amid low coronavirus case rates and increased vaccinations. Half of the state’s population is now in that tier, where the virus rates are “moderate.” The new rules allow for expanded activities the following day, but counties can opt to maintain more restrictions. LA County’s public health director, Dr. Barbara Ferrer, said Tuesday that reopenings and expansions will go into effect Monday, as she wanted to take a more cautious approach given the mix of new variants of the virus. The county, home to a quarter of California’s residents, was reporting well over 10,000 new cases and a couple hundred deaths a day during the winter surge. On Tuesday, Ferrer reported 26 additional deaths and 386 new cases as she implored people to continue wearing masks. “If we wish to maintain these low numbers, it will be essential that each of us not get sloppy,” she said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Students will only take one state standardized test this year in either math or English following a year of challenges caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The federal government has approved a request from Colorado that allows students in fourth, sixth and eighth grades to take the math assessment and students in third, fifth and seventh grades to take the English or language arts assessment, Colorado Public Radio reports. Parents can choose to have their child take both tests, which are intended to measure students’ academic progress at the end of each year in multiple subjects. “This is the answer we’ve been waiting for,” said Democratic state Sen. Rachel Zenzinger, who sponsored the waiver bill. “I appreciate the quick response from the federal government that will allow our schools to plan and prepare.” State officials made the request to give students, parents and educators some relief after a year both in and out of the classroom during the pandemic. The tests this year won’t be used to evaluate teacher performance or rate schools, but officials hope the results will help evaluate the effects of the pandemic. Parents and teachers have argued that students’ learning and mental health must take priority over standardized tests during the pandemic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: With everyone age 16 and older eligible Thursday to begin signing up for COVID-19 vaccination appointments, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Monday that people with certain medical conditions that put that put them at high risk, including people with intellectual disabilities, will have “priority access” for shots. Some hospitals are planning to hold dedicated vaccine clinics, and others are reaching out to patients with reserved appointments, while some patients will likely get vaccinated during their normal medical appointments at the hospital, said Josh Geballe, Lamont’s chief operating officer, who expects the group will include about 10,000 people. The list of conditions includes sickle cell disease, end-stage renal disease on dialysis, active cancer treatment and solid organ transplant. “These are the conditions that the chief medical officers at the hospitals felt were most worthy of prioritization,” Geballe said. He urged families to hold off on signing up their older teens in the early days of this final phase of the rollout. “I think if you’re the parent of an older teenager, about 16, or if you’re in your 20s, you’re perfectly healthy, please give it a week. You’re going to get in your turn very soon. But let’s let people in their 40s or people in these other conditions get appointments first,” he said. “That’s good advice.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The state is easing restrictions on outdoor gatherings starting Thursday and will make all residents 16 and older eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine next Tuesday. The loosened gathering limits will allow up to 150 people at certain venues for events including weddings, funerals, sporting events and concerts. It’s the second set of changes Delaware has made this year to loosen restrictions, but many are still in place, including a public mask mandate and a 10-person limit for private indoor gatherings. In a statement, Gov. John Carney said the state is comfortable easing some outdoor restrictions because the coronavirus is less likely to spread outdoors, especially in warm weather. Under the revisions, the state can also issue an additional 1,000 surf fishing tags for the 2021 season. But restaurants, retail locations, gyms, houses of worship, arts venues and other businesses remain limited to the lesser of 50% of their stated fire capacity or 25 people. Almost 1 in 3 Delawareans have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 15.7% of the population fully vaccinated, according to federal data. Coronavirus cases have started increasing again in the state and throughout the region. In the past two weeks, the seven-day average for new cases in Delaware has increased by 44% to 284.6.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A coalition of chefs in D.C. is stepping up to spread awareness and raise money to end anti-Asian racism, WUSA-TV reports. Chefs Stopping AAPI Hate is launching a series of dining experiences throughout April to get people talking about violence against the Asian American community that’s widely seen as being amplified by the coronavirus pandemic. “A lot of people are trying to fight for what’s right,” said chef Kevin Tien, a co-organizer with Chefs Stopping AAPI Hate. He said he’s sick of seeing attacks on Asian people in America but turning that sadness and anger into action with the monthlong takeout dinner series to fight racism. “I always cook whenever I’m having times of self-doubt or trouble,” said Tien, who is partnering with 45 chefs in the area to prepare five-course to-go meals every Sunday in April. Tien is Vietnamese-American and said, culturally, many elders within his community chose to ignore and stay silent on racism against them for years. The xenophobia is now amplified, many believe, because of rhetoric related to where the virus first took hold. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s administration announced it is donating $10,000 to support the effort. Others in the area can back what the group is doing by ordering meals online from Chefs Stopping AAPI Hate.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis said Monday that he would issue an executive order forbidding local governments and businesses from requiring so-called vaccine passports to show proof that customers have been inoculated against COVID-19. He made the announcement during a ceremony he convened at the state Capitol to sign into law a bill approved by the Legislature on Friday that would bar coronavirus-related lawsuits against businesses that have made good-faith efforts to comply with guidelines meant to stop the spread of the virus. A plaintiff would also need a signed affidavit from a doctor stating with reasonable certainty that injury or death caused by COVID-19 was a result of the defendant’s actions. “We don’t want to be in a situation where people are scared of being sued just for doing normal things,” the Republican governor said. DeSantis had a live band playing a cover version of the Beatles’ “With a Little Help from My Friends” in the Cabinet meeting room before he signed the bill. Of the order to bar businesses from refusing to serve people who can’t prove they have been vaccinated, he called it “completely unacceptable for either the government or the private sector to impose upon you the requirement that you show proof of vaccine to just simply participate in normal society.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Diners could permanently get mixed alcoholic drinks to go when ordering food under a measure that passed the General Assembly on Monday. The House voted 120-48 for the bill, sending it to Gov. Brian Kemp. Georgia lawmakers already agreed to allow restaurants to sell takeout beer or wine. Rep. Kasey Carpenter, R-Dalton, who owns a restaurant, said the measure is needed to reflect a change in dining habits spurred by the coronavirus pandemic. “Moving forward, Georgians will eat out differently,” said Carpenter, who said his business does not sell mixed drinks. “This bill seeks to give our industry the flexibility to address those needs.” The drinks would have to be packaged in tamper-proof containers with no straw holes and would have to be transported in a vehicle’s trunk, in a glove compartment or behind the last seats. Only two drinks per entree could be ordered. Local governments could still prohibit such sales, but they would be legal if a city or county does not act. The measure would take effect as soon as the governor signs it. The Distilled Spirits Council, which lobbies for alcohol makers, says to-go cocktails are currently allowed in more than 30 states.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A recent surge of tourists has driven up the price of rental cars after fleets were thinned out during the pandemic. Some companies in Honolulu have recently had only large vans for $500 a day and convertibles for $1,000 a day or more, Hawaii News Now reports. Timo Lee, a part-time Honolulu resident, said some vendors she checked with were “completely out of stock.” The pandemic resulted in limited inventory, which meant rental companies “had to get rid of them,” said Jerry Agrusa, a professor in the School of Travel Industry Management at the University of Hawaii. “They had to sell them.” Uncertainty about when tourism would return is another factor for the high prices, he said. Like Oahu, Maui has also seen a recent surge in COVID-19 cases, and the island’s mayor is warning visitors to follow local mandates. “You see these people on the beach back here – they’re visitors, and they’re not wearing masks,” Mayor Mike Victorino said. “If you can’t obey our rules, don’t come if you can’t wear a mask or do what is right.” The mayor said he is considering more options to help curb the spread of COVID-19, including a post-travel coronavirus test for all travelers and tighter local restrictions.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little has issued his first veto of the 2021 legislative session, refusing to sign a bill involving the responsibilities of the chairman of the Idaho State Tax Commission. Following Friday’s veto, the Republican governor said the legislation would add red tape that goes against his core belief of good government. “The legislation adds a burdensome level of bureaucracy and uncertainty, which I fear will only complicate and slow the Tax Commission’s ability to accomplish its important mission,” Little wrote in his veto letter. “In the last year, we witnessed firsthand during the pandemic the incredible ability of the Tax Commission staff to step up and adapt quickly in changing environments to successfully implement initiatives and programs that support Idaho citizens and businesses.” The Legislature is recessed until April 6 due to a COVID-19 outbreak among lawmakers in the House. Last year, as the coronavirus pandemic took hold, Little signed a proclamation extending the tax filing deadline from April 15 to June 15. The commission also played a role in many other financial areas, including handling applications for small businesses so they could receive federal coronavirus emergency funding.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A hospital CEO has been suspended for two weeks following a series of COVID-19 vaccination events involving alleged favoritism, including one in which ineligible Trump Tower workers were vaccinated. The unpaid suspension of Loretto Hospital’s president and CEO, George Miller, is on hold until the hospital finds a new chief operating officer and chief financial officer, a hospital spokeswoman said late Monday. Dr. Anosh Ahmed, who had been Loretto’s COO and CFO, resigned last week, days after he and Miller were reprimanded by the board of directors following news reports that hospital executives provided vaccines to some people who weren’t yet eligible. Loretto Hospital is located on Chicago’s West Side and largely serves Black and Latino people. It was chosen last year to administer the city’s ceremonial first COVID-19 vaccination as part of efforts to encourage residents in West Side neighborhoods to get vaccinated. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Monday that Loretto is a “safety net hospital” that is pivotal to Chicago and that she is “committed to helping Loretto get it right because they’re so important to the West Side community.” She said it was clear that officials “deviated from what I think is their core mission and what should have been the focus during this critical time period.”\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend: University of Notre Dame officials say they will be able to vaccinate all students on campus by the end of the spring semester. The school will receive enough Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for every student to be fully inoculated with both doses before the end of May, the university’s president, the Rev. John Jenkins, said in a letter to students, faculty and staff Thursday night. A vaccination clinic is anticipated to open by mid-April, but students are only being encouraged – not required – to receive the shots. “Needless to say, we are delighted to receive this positive news,” Jenkins said, noting that Notre Dame will continue enforcing its current campus health and safety protocols. The Notre Dame vaccination clinic will also have shots available for faculty and staff, he said, although university officials have asked non-students to first seek out vaccine at local community sites. The announcement follows Gov. Eric Holcomb’s confirmation in a statewide address last week that all Hoosiers ages 16 and up will qualify for the vaccine starting Thursday. The Republican governor said he would also lift the statewide mask mandate and remaining COVID-19 business restrictions next Tuesday.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A week before Gov. Kim Reynolds officially makes all adults eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations, public health officials acknowledged Monday that some counties have already started providing the shots to anyone over age 16. In northwest Iowa’s Humboldt County, for example, public health officials announced they would hold mass vaccination clinics Wednesday and Thursday for anyone 16 and up. Public health officials said they have 650 doses of the Pfizer vaccine available. Appointments were required and confirmed on a first-come-first-served basis for the clinics to be held at the county fairgrounds. Reynolds has said she anticipates opening up availability to all adults Monday as national supplies and the allocation of doses to states increase. As of Monday, Iowa was eighth in the nation for the percentage of the entire population fully vaccinated at 19%. Nationally, 15.8% of the U.S. population is vaccinated. Iowa, like many states, is seeing a recent increase in coronavirus activity. The state on Monday reported 110 new confirmed cases and seven additional deaths. The seven-day rate of positive coronavirus tests increased to 4.7%. State public health officials reported 196 people in hospitals and 44 COVID-19 patients in intensive care units.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Legislators are working on a plan for setting aside potentially several hundred million dollars in federal COVID-19 relief funds to pay businesses harmed by state and local restrictions imposed last year to check the coronavirus’ spread. The state Senate Judiciary Committee is considering a proposal to set up a fund to pay claims from businesses that either were shut down or had their operations curtailed by state restrictions. The measure also would require counties and cities that imposed restrictions to set up similar funds. The state, cities and counties would be required to set aside 25% of their federal COVID-19 relief funds that aren’t dedicated to a specific purpose. The committee had hoped to vote on the proposal Monday, but Chair Kellie Warren, R-Leawood, said lawmakers and interested parties were still trying to hash out some details. The measure is designed to end the threat that the state, counties and cities could face a larger total payout from lawsuits from business owners. A Wichita fitness studio’s owner and his business sued the state in December, and his attorneys and Attorney General Derek Schmidt agreed to put the lawsuit on hold to allow lawmakers to consider a plan for compensating businesses.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The mass vaccination site at Cardinal Stadium, set to open April 12, will start accepting appointments for everyone 16 and older Wednesday. The site, which will include 24 lanes in the parking lots outside the stadium, has set a goal of inoculating at least 4,000 people a day through May 28 – 200,000 total. Dr. Jason Smith, chief medical officer for University of Louisville Health, said Tuesday that he hopes the site can administer 24,000 vaccines in its first week. U of L Health is providing fourth-year medical students, nurses and physicians to run the site, as well as “a huge pool of volunteers that are willing to help out,” Smith said. There will also be an AmeriCorps presence and a National Guard presence to help with traffic. Smith said the site will have the Pfizer vaccine and, later, the Johnson & Johnson one-dose version. People can sign up at UofLHealth.org or call 502-681-1435 starting Wednesday. Meanwhile, the University of Kentucky has also announced an expansion of its vaccine and coronavirus testing services to new locations around the state.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state will end many of its coronavirus restrictions for businesses but will keep its mask mandate in place, Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Tuesday. Customer limits on bars, restaurants, salons, gyms, malls, casinos and other nonessential businesses will be removed, though they’ll be required to use social distancing. They had previously been capped at 50% or 75% of their occupancy limits. Direct table service still will be required at bars, but an 11 p.m. alcohol curfew will end. The changes mean businesses face the fewest restrictions since the pandemic began. The new rules start Wednesday, though local officials could choose to enact tougher limits than those put in place by the Democratic governor. “Today marks a big step forward, but we’re all going to have a role to play,” Edwards said. He urged people to continue to “mask, vaccinate and distance.” But the lightened limits diverge from some of the recommendations of President Joe Biden’s administration, which has urged restrictions to be maintained or tightened to avoid another surge of COVID-19. Edwards said he won’t loosen the rules for face coverings, which have been in place since July, arguing that mask-wearing is among the most effective ways to lessen the spread of COVID-19.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Augusta Civic Center is slated to pull double duty this week as the host of the Legislature and a COVID-19 vaccination clinic. The Legislature, which has been using the civic center to facilitate easier social distancing, was slated to convene at the venue Tuesday and expected to take up the biennial budget proposal. MaineGeneral Medical Center was also scheduled to hold a continuing vaccination clinic at the facility. Maine Senate President Troy Jackson of Allagash and Chuck Hays, president and chief executive officer of MaineGeneral Health, said they were confident the civic center could accommodate the two events simultaneously. “We’ve been working with legislative leadership and the state of Maine to ensure that both the legislative session and the community vaccination clinics can occur at the same time in the same building,” Hays said. MaineGeneral said it has provided more than 16,300 COVID-19 vaccinations, and 14,700 of those have been provided at the civic center.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The Federal Emergency Management Agency has agreed to open a community vaccination center in Prince George’s County, officials announced Tuesday. The center will open at the Greenbelt Metro Station on April 7, with its daily schedule to be announced. Gov. Larry Hogan’s administration said as more vaccine doses become available, the center’s capacity is expected to be up to 3,000 shots per day. This will be the first federally operated site in Maryland, using direct vaccine allocations from the federal government. Prince George’s County has had the highest number of COVID-19 cases in the state. Local officials have criticized a lack of equitable distribution of vaccine doses to the county, which is the state’s second-largest jurisdiction. Meanwhile, Maryland entered the next phase of its COVID-19 vaccination eligibility Tuesday. Phase 2B expands eligibility to Marylanders age 16 and older with underlying medical conditions that increase the risk for severe COVID-19 illness, as well as to residents with disabilities.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBrimfield: A small town known for its outdoor summer antiques shows has given the go-ahead for them to resume this year, but not everyone is on board. The Brimfield Select Board voted Monday to allow this year’s Brimfield Outdoor Antiques Shows and Flea Markets to go on after the town’s Health Board met last week with state officials to discuss the logistics of the shows, which bring tens of thousands of people to town to shop a milelong stretch of markets. This year’s three shows are scheduled for May 11-16, July 13-18 and Sept. 7-12. Last year’s shows were canceled because of the pandemic. Some of the promoters who provide the space for vendors said they will opt out of the May show, citing COVID-19 safety concerns. “It would be impossible to conduct a successful show for either our vendors or our shoppers under the current regulations,” said Klia Ververidis, spokesperson for the Brimfield Show Promoters Association, according to Masslive.com. Those who do open will be asked to provide a safety plan to the town’s health agent, who will review plans with the state Department of Labor Standards.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A barber who defied Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and reopened his shop last spring amid the pandemic was fined $9,000 for violating licensing rules, including joining a protest where hairstylists cut hair on the state Capitol lawn. Karl Manke will appeal the penalties in court, his lawyer said. The Board of Barber Examiners on Monday accepted an administrative law judge’s findings and issued the fines for violations – including barbering on the Capitol steps, where he was not licensed to operate. He also allowed used neck strips and piles of hair to accumulate on the floor in his Owosso barbershop and stored a comb in his shirt pocket instead of a covered container, according to the board, whose membership consists primarily of barbers. The fines were levied against both Manke and his business, and $6,000 stemmed from his participation in the Capitol demonstration last May. “It shows their pettiness; it shows their vindictiveness. The lack of proportionality here is almost breathtaking, really,” said David Kallman, Manke’s attorney. In a March 1 report, Administrative Law Judge Stephen Goldstein said Manke’s argument that he had a right to free speech “may have merit,” but the tribunal had no jurisdiction to address constitutional issues. “Respondent had the option of protesting without cutting hair,” Goldstein wrote. “He chose a different path and in so doing has violated the Code.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The coronavirus pandemic drove many residents outdoors to go ice fishing, and authorities say it led to an increase of an unwanted byproduct as some anglers left behind litter and trash. “In some places, it was a little more than usual,” said Joe Albert, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources spokesman. “And that’s likely kind of reflective of the fact that there (were) more people out this year ice fishing.” Discarded items ran the gamut from cigarette butts to bait to plastic bottles to slabs of wood used to prop up fish houses, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. On a visit to Medicine Lake in early March, conservation officer Brent Grewe filled the back end of an all-terrain vehicle with trash he collected, including beer cans, pieces of Styrofoam, plastic bags and even a tip-up flag that alerts anglers when they’ve caught a fish. “It’s just kind of disgusting,” Grewe said. There was a silver lining: Grewe noticed more anglers cleaning up other people’s messes, which he called “a breath of fresh air.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves on Monday signed a bill authorizing a $1,000 pay raise for most teachers, and lawmakers worked to adopt final parts of state spending and borrowing plans for the year that begins July 1. Approving a teacher pay raise is a two-part process. First, it must be authorized. Then, money must be budgeted to pay for it. Reeves, a Republican, signed the legislation that sets a $1,000 raise for most teachers and a $1,100 raise for those in the early years of the career. “It’s hard to imagine how difficult 2020/21 have been on our state’s educators,” Reeves wrote on Twitter as he announced the bill signing. “But so many have stepped up and done what Mississippians do – whatever it took to help MS kids!” Mississippi has long had some of the lowest teacher salaries in the nation. According to the Southern Regional Education Board, the average teacher salary in the U.S. for 2018-19 was $62,304. For Mississippi, the average was $45,105. The state-funded portion of the state government budget will be nearly $6.6 billion. It includes an increase in funding for early learning collaboratives. Those preschool programs are partnerships between public school districts and Head Start centers, child care centers or private or parochial schools. “This is a real good year for education, as far as money going into it,” said House Education Committee Chairman Richard Bennett, R-Long Beach.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Federal prosecutors unveiled new charges in the case against state Rep. Tricia Derges last week, this time accusing her of misleading Greene County officials to secure a pandemic grant worth nearly $300,000. According to the latest from a grand jury, Derges, who operates multiple medical clinics in the area, effectively got the county to reimburse her for providing coronavirus tests for which patients had already paid her. The new filing says Derges applied for the grant saying she needed the money to cover the cost of free tests for the poor provided by her nonprofit, Lift Up Someone Today. She included invoices totaling $296,574 from Dynamic DNA for more than 3,000 tests. But the indictment says those tests were actually provided by her for-profit company, Ozark Valley Medical Clinic, where patients had already paid roughly $517,000 for the service. When the check came to her nonprofit’s account, the filing says, she transferred the funds to the company’s account. The new charges add to a February indictment that also accuses her of duping patients with a fake stem cell treatment, illegally distributing prescription drugs and lying to federal agents as they investigated her. Republican leaders have barred her from serving on House committees that review legislation and called for her resignation. When she refused to leave, they kicked her out of Republican caucus meetings and moved her office to a closet.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s House Appropriations Committee has moved forward with a bill to allocate about $2 billion in federal stimulus money, including financial penalties for local governments, tribes and schools that have stricter COVID-19 guidelines than the state. Gov. Greg Gianforte lifted the statewide mask mandate Feb. 12. State law allows cities and counties to have stricter guidelines, and several still have mask mandates, while some continue to limit the sizes of gatherings and business operating hours. The appropriation bill, sponsored by Rep. Frank Garner, R-Kalispell, calls for a 20% reduction in grants awarded to cities, counties, tribes and schools that are still enforcing mask mandates or other health guidelines. Rep. Sharon Stewart Peregoy, D-Crow Agency, argued Monday that “cities and counties are being extorted” to lift their regulations when they want to protect their people and wait until more people are vaccinated. Republican Rep. Matt Regier said he finds it ironic that local governments can impose strict COVID-19 protocols that hurt the economy but then ask for tax money to bail them out. The measure passed the appropriations committee 16-8 on Monday. Most of those voting “no” opposed the deficit spending.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Now that vaccines are becoming more widely available, many residents are scouring the internet in search of an appointment to get a COVID-19 shot. Michael Nollett of Lincoln said he hopes to land an appointment soon, after pharmacies participating in a federal program in the state opened up vaccine eligibility to all adults Monday. Local health officials remain focused on vaccinating people 50 and older, although some public health districts in rural areas are also offering the shots to all adults. Officials have said they expect to make the vaccines available to the general public statewide by late April or early May. “There’s a lot of imperfect things about the way it’s being done,” Nollett told the Omaha World-Herald. “I’m hopeful with this new thing opening up (Monday) that I’ll be able to make some headway somewhere.” More than 325,000 Nebraskans have registered with the state online to get a vaccine. That system notifies people when they are eligible to get the shots at their local health department, which Nollett doesn’t quite qualify for yet in Lancaster County at age 47. Pharmacies participating in the federal program are offering appointments to anyone online, but they fill up quickly.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Health officials say they’re hopeful about the direction of the state’s coronavirus outbreak as reported cases, deaths and hospitalization trends remain favorable and as the state gradually reopens following a winter surge. State biostatistician Kyra Morgan said during a telephone news conference Monday that Nevada did not see any significant increase in reported virus cases after allowing businesses to increase capacity to 35% up from 25% in mid-February, nor from allowing another increase up to 50% capacity March 15. State COVID-19 Response Director Caleb Cage said officials are watching closely but hoping that the statewide mask mandate, along with other measures aimed to stop spread of the virus, will help keep cases low and businesses open. Nationally, cases of the virus are up about 10% over the past week from the previous week, to about 60,000 cases per day, with both hospitalizations and deaths ticking up. Nevada, however, has seen consistent declines in cases, hospitalizations and deaths since mid-January. The state’s 14-day rate of coronavirus tests coming back positive fell slightly to 4.2% Monday, down from 4.3% a day earlier.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen has helped introduce a bill that would increase funding to fight the opioid epidemic, which has worsened during the coronavirus pandemic. The bill increases funding authorization levels and sets out new policy reforms in the Comprehensive Addiction & Recovery Act, which was enacted in 2016. Policy changes include new research into non-opioid pain management alternatives and long-term treatment outcomes to sustain recovery from addiction. The bill establishes a commission to improve the quality and safety of care for drug overdoses and substance use disorders. The bill also authorizes $300 million to expand evidence-based medication-assisted treatment and $200 million to build a national infrastructure for recovery support services to help individuals move successfully from treatment into long-term recovery. “Over the last year, we’ve witnessed the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbate the substance use disorder epidemic in New Hampshire. Essentially, we’ve experienced one public health crisis exacerbate another. It has taken a devastating toll on our communities and it demands Congress’ attention and action,” Shaheen said in a news release.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: State officials on Monday warned about another public health consequence begat by the COVID-19 pandemic, this one disproportionately harming young children: a significant decrease in testing for the toxic metal lead. The number of children tested for lead last year dropped about 35,000 – or 20% – from 2019, according to the New Jersey Department of Health. Meanwhile, the percentage of children who had lead levels that warrant intervention increased somewhat from about 2.2% in 2019 to 2.8% of children tested last year. In 2019, three children were hospitalized for lead above 45 micrograms per deciliter in their blood, but 11 were hospitalized last year, according to the Health Department. The government requires action when a child’s tests show just 5 micrograms per deciliter in their blood, though no level of lead is safe. “This data seems to confirm that the pandemic is exacerbating New Jersey’s childhood lead poisoning epidemic, which continues to disproportionately impact lower-income children and children of color,” said Staci Berger, president and CEO of the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey. Before the pandemic eclipsed the attention of public health professionals, a lead water crisis that started in Newark brought the issue to the forefront.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state’s public schools have a long way to go to meet goals for returning students to the classroom set by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and the administration of President Joe Biden. An analysis by the Associated Press shows 5% of New Mexico students from kindergarten through eighth grade can walk through school doors full time. The national average for a similar age group was about 45% in February. The governor has urged schools to open their doors to in-person learning for all students next Monday. On Thursday, Biden reiterated his goal to have over half of K-8 schools open by April 30, his 100th day in office. The state and federal government are dedicating enormous resources to rebooting in-person education and making up for learning loss. State officials haven’t estimated the toll on learning for the entire pandemic, but a legislative analysis found learning loss of between four and 12 months as a result of last spring’s closures alone. An increased percentage of New Mexico students were failing at least one class last fall, and some rural districts still hadn’t connected students to the internet. On the bright side, roughly 85% of all the state’s educators, including those who work in pre-K and universities, have received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine, and a third are fully inoculated.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The Tribeca Film Festival said Monday that it plans to hold its 20th edition in person this June and with outdoor screenings spread throughout the city’s five boroughs. The springtime festival – canceled last year due to the pandemic – will instead turn to the summer for its next edition, spanning 12 days beginning June 9. Tribeca will screen films at outdoor venues around New York, including the Battery, Hudson Yards, Pier 57 Rooftop, Brookfield Place, the MetroTech Commons in Brooklyn and Empire Outlets in Staten Island. The festival will also use a traveling 40-foot HD screen in other areas. “The Tribeca Film Festival was born out of our mission to bring people together in the aftermath of 9/11. We’re still doing it,” said Tribeca co-founder Robert De Niro. “And as New York emerges from the shadow of COVID-19, it seems just right to bring people together again in-person for our 20th anniversary festival.” Tribeca has gradually broadened the footprint of its annual festival, stretching beyond its downtown namesake. It has regularly hosted outdoor “drive-in” screenings on city streets, something it expanded nationwide last year in a series of drive-ins held around the country showing classic films.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: More than veterans can now get vaccinated against COVID-19 through the Western North Carolina VA Health Care system thanks to a new law that expands the VA’s eligibility to veterans’ spouses and caregivers. In an announcement Monday, the WNC VA Health Care system said it has already begun providing vaccinations to all veterans, their spouses and caregivers participating in the VA’s Program and General Caregiver Support Services and more. The announcement came after eligibility was opened to all veterans regardless of age, profession or medical status March 19 and after a mass vaccination event Saturday at the Charles George VA Medical Center in Asheville. WNC VA Public Affairs Officer Vance Janes said 608 doses were given, 77 of which were to those eligible under the SAVE LIVES Act. “Overall, we viewed it as a success,” Janes said, as those 608 doses were in addition to the VA’s normal vaccination efforts, when it uses all 1,170 of its normal weekly allotment of doses. The new law opens eligibility for any spouses and caregivers of the roughly 46,000 veterans enrolled for health care with the WNC VA system, he said, as well as any area veterans not enrolled.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Federal Emergency Management Agency has approved $19.4million in additional funding for pandemic response efforts in the state. To date, FEMA has paid more than $77.1 million in public assistance funding for COVID-19 response in North Dakota. About $18.3 million was provided to the North Dakota Department of Health to add temporary nursing staff and couriers to administer and distribute coronavirus tests and materials to testing sites throughout the state. And $1.1 million was provided to the McKenzie Healthcare System Inc. to convert an abandoned medical clinic into a fully functioning Alternate Care Site, temporarily expanding hospital capacity and providing the needed care to patients living in the city of Watford and surrounding areas.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: City Councilman David Mann is calling on the city administration to evaluate compliance with basic COVID-19 precautions following the opening of the outdoor drinking area at The Banks last weekend. Hundreds of people gathered at The Banks on Saturday to bask in the good weather and enjoy the 85-acre open-container drinking district. Long lines packed with mostly unmasked people formed outside bars and restaurants for hours. Mann is asking what additional enforcement or education may be appropriate to minimize the risk that the Dora district will become a major source of new coronavirus cases. Tracy Schwegmann, spokesperson for The Banks, could not give officials numbers about how many people visited the Dora on Saturday. “If you went to any public park or space anywhere downtown, you saw it was packed. People clearly had spring fever,” Schwegmann said. There are signs posted throughout the Dora reminding guests to social distance and wear masks. “I think at this point people understand what the risks are and what measures they can and should be taking.” The Dora district is not planning any specific celebrations for Thursday’s Opening Day for Major League Baseball, but crowds may once again gather throughout the district.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Gov. Kevin Stitt received a COVID-19 vaccine Monday as state health officials opened eligibility to everyone over age 16. Stitt, a Republican who in July became the first U.S. governor to announce testing positive for the coronavirus, received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine and said he hopes that receiving his shot publicly will encourage Oklahomans who may be hesitant to get vaccinated. “I wanted to wait until our most vulnerable had the choice, but now that we’re in Phase 4, I’m going to lead by example, and I’m going to do it,” said Stitt, who flashed a thumbs-up to reporters after getting his shot. Deputy Health Commissioner Keith Reed said surveys have shown about 66% of Oklahomans have indicated a willingness to receive the vaccine, a number he said he hopes continues to increase as more doses are distributed. “The vaccine is free to all Oklahomans,” Reed said. “There are appointments available across the state, including in our metro areas, so if you haven’t enrolled in the state portal yet, I highly encourage you to do so.” The state currently ranks 16th nationally with 30.4% of its population having received at least one dose, compared to a national average of 28.6%, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown and education officials marked the return to in-person learning for the state’s schoolkids in a virtual address Monday morning, saying parents should be confident they will be able to keep students safe. “Today, Oregon officially returns to in-person instruction,” Brown said. “It’s truly a moment worth celebrating. I know students, parents, educators, all of us, have been looking forward to this for months.” The most enriching learning environment for school kids is the classroom, Brown said, for both educational and socialization needs. However, the Democratic governor cautioned that a return to classrooms doesn’t signify a return to pre-pandemic normal. Distance learning days will still be needed, she said, as the state continues to work toward complete in-person learning. Colt Gill, director of the Oregon Department of Education, said parents should be confident their children will be safe when returning to in-person learning in Oregon’s schools. He praised the state’s reopening guidance as among the best in the country. These same protocols will also protect educators and staff from contracting COVID-19, he said. “It is time to go back to our school buildings,” Gill said. Oregon schoolchildren have largely been studying at home since March 12, 2020.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s schools will get nearly $5 billion from the federal pandemic aid package, the Wolf administration announced Monday. School districts must use at least 20% of the money to address learning loss from the pandemic and to support the “social, emotional and academic needs of underrepresented students,” including students from low-income families, those with disabilities and English language learners, according to the governor’s office. Schools may use the rest of the money for professional training, technology, cleaning supplies, summer and after-school programs, and mental health services and other expenses. About $4.5 billion will go directly to public school districts and charter schools. The Education Department itself will get about $500 million for various initiatives and to assist career and technical schools, intermediate units and other education entities that do not get a direct allocation. “This extra funding is critical to help schools meet the unique needs of educating students at this time while keeping school buildings safe when students return to the classroom,” Gov. Tom Wolf said in a statement.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state is on track to meet Gov. Dan McKee’s target of making all residents 16 and older eligible to sign up for a COVID-19 vaccine by April 19, health officials said Tuesday. Federal allocations of vaccines will make that possible. “We have a pretty good sense of what our allocations are going to look like, by beginning of June, mid-June, getting 100,000 doses per week in the state,” Tom McCarthy, executive director of the COVID-19 Response Team, said at a virtual meeting of the state COVID-19 Vaccine Subcommittee. About 70% of the population should be fully vaccinated at that point, he said. “So, in order to reach herd immunity, getting as many people vaccinated that are 16-plus is critically important,” McCarthy said. The state is also stepping up efforts to vaccinate more people of color, who have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. The age-adjusted hospitalization rate among Hispanic or Latino Rhode Islanders is 4.6 times higher than the rate among white, non-Hispanic Rhode Islanders, while the age-adjusted rate among Black or African American Rhode Islanders is 2.6 times higher, according to the state Health Department.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster said Tuesday that he will spend $6 million in discretionary COVID-19 relief funds on free community computer labs near broadband deserts statewide. Schoolchildren, teachers and others in need of computer access will soon be able to use Apple computers at eight sites across the state, McMaster announced in a news conference at Benedict College, a historically Black liberal arts school in the capital city. “The pandemic has made it abundantly clear that internet access is not a luxury but a necessity for millions of South Carolinians,” McMaster said in a statement. The announcement comes as officials push to expand broadband access across the state. Hundreds of thousands of people in its rural areas have struggled to get online, a problem underscored after the coronavirus pandemic pushed many functions of life onto the internet. The eight computer labs will be strategically located so local school districts, historically Black colleges and universities, and technical colleges can use them, officials said. Two hubs will be centered in Columbia’s Bull Street District and at Benedict College, with some others located at University of South Carolina campuses.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The opening of the city’s new triage and addiction center has been long-awaited by many as a central location that can provide help for substance abuse and mental health patients. City Councilor Marshall Selberg said that’s why he’s pushing to appropriate $500,000 of Sioux Falls’ COVID-19 relief funds toward the center, known as The Link. “There’s a bigger issue out there than we realize about people who need some help,” Selberg said. Operation Hope Fund would be part of the Sioux Falls for All funding package that will head to a council vote in April. The fund would be available for a broad number of uses, he said, such as paying for treatments, assisting with housing or transportation that would improve access to care, or helping to buy medication or medical supplies. “We’re trying to use it to be as open as possible,” Selberg said. He said with the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbating many issues around mental health, he doesn’t want anyone who could benefit from The Link’s help to refrain from reaching out for financial reasons. Selberg said there’s not a hard limit on how much could be spent per person, but officials have spoken generally about $500, which would enable them to help 1,000 people.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Businesses would be able to decide whether to follow health guidelines issued by state or local authorities during a pandemic under legislation approved by state House lawmakers Monday. Businesses would still be required to follow public health guidelines. But under the bill, titled “Business Fairness Act,” they could decide whether to adhere to less stringent state guidelines over ones put in place by local authorities. The legislation cleared the House on a 90-0 vote and the Senate 28-0 last week and is expected to arrive on Gov. Bill Lee’s desk. Sen. Bill Powers, R-Clarksville, said the bill protects small businesses that suffered economic loss due to mandated closures during the pandemic. Under the bill, businesses could choose to comply with any executive orders, rules or guidelines issued by the governor, state agencies or local authorities to curb the spread of a health crisis. As case numbers climbed in spring 2020, Lee temporarily closed nonessential businesses, and similar restrictions were put in place in cities such as Nashville, Memphis and Knoxville. Even as Lee lifted the statewide orders, local governments in metropolitan areas kept more restrictive measures in place. Davidson and Shelby counties have both faced lawsuits from businesses protesting the mandated closures last summer.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A federal appeals court has struck down a lawsuit brought by elderly inmates who alleged the state did not implement adequate measures to shield them from COVID-19. Two male inmates of the Wallace Pack Unit near Houston filed a class-action lawsuit alleging that the conditions there violated their constitutional rights by endangering their health and safety. A federal judge in Houston had agreed and ordered the state to equip inmates with protective equipment. Last June, the appeals court panel overturned the order, saying the state was in substantial compliance. The three-judge appeals court panel on Friday ruled in favor of the state. Brandon Duke, one of the inmates’ attorneys, said the decision was disappointing, “but we do agree with the court that the suit, as stated in the opinion, ‘played a role in motivating the prison officials into action and saved countless lives.’ That was the ultimate goal of the case.” It’s unclear whether further appeals are planned.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: With vaccines rolling out and a long buildup of cabin fever, visitors are already flocking to Utah’s national parks by the thousands. Zion National Park, the nation’s third most popular national park, saw more than 300,000 visitors in January and February alone this year, breaking records for the winter months. Capitol Reef also broke records, and Canyonlands National Park saw double its January-February 2020 visitation this year, according to official data. A fall surge to Utah national parks last year followed months of drops related to pandemic restrictions. But now, it’s all on the up-and-up. “The forecast looks like it’s going to be a really busy year; there’s a lot of pent-up energy around the country and the world. Because we have open space and we’re accessible, the demand is high,” Greater Zion Office of Tourism Director Kevin Lewis said. For Utah’s tourism economy, this means nothing but profit to make up for last year’s pandemic losses. However, for locals, this means the effects of overtourism could be coming back again with crowding, graffiti and litter beyond control. To help with that, the Utah Office of Tourism is shifting how it does business, with a “Forever Mighty” initiative it hopes will encourage visitors to leave no trace and mindfully spend time on Utah land.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: State officials are urging eligible residents to get vaccinated against COVID-19, but they are also asking people to keep up with the measures designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The Tuesday call came as Vermont continues to set or approach records for new cases of the virus. But deaths and hospitalizations are down because many older Vermonters, those most vulnerable to death and serious consequences of COVID-19, have been vaccinated, with the state leading the nation in inoculation rates among those 65 and older. Many of the new cases are among young people who are less likely to suffer serious consequences or death from COVID-19. “The key to ending the pandemic is for all of us to get vaccinated,” said Mike Pieciak, the Vermont commissioner of financial regulation who has been monitoring COVID-19 statistics during the pandemic. “This individual action will have a significant collective impact.” But it will be some time before all Vermonters can be vaccinated. “People are sick of life in a pandemic, plain and simple,” Vermont Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said Tuesday. “That’s been true for awhile, of course, but our strides in vaccination, the beginning of spring and hope for the future may be enticing us to take increasing risks.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Evictions are continuing in the state despite a nationwide moratorium by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Washington Post reports loopholes and misinformation are the likely culprits. Palmer Heenan, an attorney with the Central Virginia Legal Aid Society, said more than 11,000 eviction judgments were made in the state between September and December of last year. The CDC eviction moratorium applies only to failure-to-pay-rent cases. And it requires tenants to fill out a declaration form. That puts the onus on a tenant who might be uninformed about the options. “Part of the problem with the protection as it currently exists is that they require an invocation by the tenant,” Heenan said. “The tenant has to know about the protections. They have to print out and sign a declaration. And they have to bring it to the landlord.” Another problem is that the moratorium applies only to failure-to-pay-rent cases and not other causes of eviction. Housing experts say more landlords are finding other reasons to evict someone, such as a noise complaint or a lease expiring.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: As of Wednesday, about 5 million of the state’s more than 7.6 million residents will be eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine. The latest tier expansion was announced by Gov. Jay Inslee earlier this month. Starting Wednesday, eligibility will be extended to those those 16 and older with two or more comorbidities, anyone between the ages of 60 and 64, and workers 16 and older employed by restaurants, manufacturing and construction. Those living in congregate settings like correctional facilities or group homes for disabilities, plus those experiencing homelessness, will also be eligible for a vaccine. That leaves about 1.2 million more Washingtonians who are not yet eligible, excluding kids under age 16. Inslee has said that the remainder will be eligible by May 1, a federal deadline set by President Joe Biden. Many states have moved to lift eligibility requirements sooner, but Inslee has said he wants to ensure the most vulnerable receive the shot before eligibility opens to everyone. More than 3.2 million doses of vaccine have been administered to date, and more than 16% of the state’s population has been fully vaccinated, including those vaccinated by the one-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Schools in the capital city and surrounding Kanawha County reported the most coronavirus outbreaks since the start of the pandemic Monday. A total of 41 students and three staff members have been affected by outbreaks across seven schools, according to the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department. And in northern West Virginia, officials at East Fairmont High School announced that classes will be conducted remotely until next Tuesday due to a virus outbreak there, prompting all sports competitions to be called off. Less than a week after Republican Gov. Jim Justice announced the state’s color-coded map of outbreak severity would no longer determine in-person school attendance, some counties are struggling to keep classroom doors open. Justice has left it up to local health and school officials to determine when outbreaks are severe enough to cancel activities. The outbreaks come amid a bump in hospitalizations and cases statewide. Justice lifted capacity limits on businesses earlier this month and loosened restrictions on schools, keeping in place a mask mandate. Positive coronavirus cases grew for the third consecutive week in West Virginia. Confirmed cases hit 1,924 last week, up 16% from the previous week, according to state health records.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State health officials have decided to make COVID-19 vaccinations available for the general public starting next week, accelerating the timetable by a month, Gov. Tony Evers said Tuesday. The move comes as Evers’ administration braces for another surge in infections and a court order that could wipe out the governor’s statewide mask mandate. Currently, health care workers, people over 65, nursing home residents and staff, educators and people with existing health conditions are eligible for vaccines. That will expand to everyone 16 and older starting Monday, Evers announced. “We still have a heck of a long way to go to get everyone vaccinated,” Evers said during a news conference. “But every day we are closer than yesterday in getting back to our Wisconsin way of life. I know I’m not alone in feeling the hope, excitement and relief. … We are this close to the finish line.” State health officials had planned to open up vaccinations to the general public May 1. But case rates in Wisconsin have been rising over the past two weeks, mirroring a national rise in infections. Meanwhile, the state’s conservative-leaning Supreme Court is scheduled to rule Wednesday on whether Evers’ mask mandate is legal.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Lawmakers plan to wrestle with state spending as they meet a couple of days longer than expected due to a snowstorm that shut down operations in the capital. This year’s legislative session – one already divided into virtual and in-person segments and scheduled to go a few weeks later than usual due to the coronavirus pandemic – was due to end this Friday. A storm that dumped 31 inches of snow shut down state government and prevented lawmakers from meeting March 15-16. The session is now scheduled to conclude April 7, two days after lawmakers take Monday off in observance of the Easter holiday, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Tasks remaining for legislators include agreeing on a supplemental budget and finding a solution to Wyoming’s education funding model. The budget is especially important after the coronavirus and a downturn in fossil fuel markets caused Gov. Mark Gordon to slash state spending last year. Legislators, meanwhile, are trying to find a way to sustainably fund public education, which is running at a deficit.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/03/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/27/humpback-whale-alert-monk-seal-attacks-northwest-sizzles-news-around-states/50531153/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nClanton:Two Chilton County deputies and two Clanton Police Department officers wore body cameras that offered a 360-degree view of the environment surrounding the officer during a weekslong field test. Called the Nexx360, the officer’s collar holds four wide-angle cameras. Instead of capturing footage of a narrow field of view in front of the officer, this system gives an all-around view. “This has the potential for being a game-changer,” said Sheriff John Shearon. “There are times when we don’t get good footage of an encounter. The officer may be moving to protect themselves or others; the other person may be moving. An officer doesn’t need to think about where they need to be to get the best body camera footage. This solves that problem.” The cameras serve as a “dispassionate observer,” said Terry Luck, a longtime defense attorney whose practice is in Montgomery. The technology also allows dispatchers – and supervisors – to get real-time images of what’s happening. That’s a huge advantage in rural counties, where help in the form of backup can be 20 minutes or more away, Shearon said.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Republican U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she recently tested positive for the coronavirus. In a statement on social media, Murkowski said she recently tested positive after experiencing flulike symptoms. The statement did not specify the timing of the test. Her campaign posted photos of events that Murkowski participated in Friday and Saturday in Fairbanks. “I will be following guidance and advice from doctors and will be quarantining at home in Alaska while continuing my work remotely,” Murkowski’s statement said. Karina Borger, a spokesperson in Murkowski’s Senate office, said by email that Murkowski is “vaccinated and boosted.” Borger said she had nothing more to share beyond the social media post.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Beginning this month, students whose jobs or income were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic can receive free tuition, monthly stipends and employment help in a range of workforce programs from manufacturing to health care at Maricopa County’s 10 community colleges. Phoenix is using $7 million of its federal pandemic relief funds to finance the “Route to Relief” program, which will run through December 2024. Eligible students can get up to $5,000 for tuition, fees and books. Training-related expenses, job search expenses and career services in programs such as semiconductor, health care, business, manufacturing and information technology also are covered. Students also will get monthly stipends during their studies of up to $1,500 for other expenses such as child care and transportation.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:Power has been restored across the Arkansas River Valley after storms last week caused outages in Roland, Oklahoma and Paris. But a heat wave will continue through the first part of this week with triple-digit temperatures in Fort Smith. There is a 50% chance for rain Thursday with a high of 98 degrees, the National Weather Service reported. An excessive heat warning was issued for 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. Monday and Tuesday in Fort Smith and Sebastian County. High fire danger continues during an ongoing drought.\n\nCalifornia\n\nForest Falls: A man died and a woman was injured when the pair tumbled down a waterfall in the San Bernardino Mountains, authorities said. Rescue crews responding Sunday afternoon found the woman performing CPR on the man at Big Falls near the community of Forest Falls, the San Bernardino County Sheriff’s Department said. The man, a 43-year-old resident of Hemet, died at the scene, the department said. The 43-year-old woman from Riverside was airlifted to a hospital, officials said. Their names were not immediately available. Officials said the pair fell from the middle falls to the lower falls at the popular destination along a hiking trail about 80 miles east of Los Angeles.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A federal judge has temporarily blocked the city of Superior from enforcing parts of a new gun control ordinance, including a ban on the sale and possession of assault weapons, after it was challenged by gun rights groups. U.S. District Court Judge Raymond Moore issued a temporary restraining order on Friday, noting the Rocky Mountain Gun Owners, the National Association for Gun Rights and a Superior resident, Charles Bradley Walker, had established a likelihood to prove their case in challenging two sections of the ordinance. Moore scheduled an Aug. 4 hearing to determine whether to continue to keep Superior from enforcing those sections. The other section requires people who had assault weapons before the law took effect on July 1 to get a permit to continue to possess them but largely only on their own property. The law defines assault weapons as a number of different semi-automatic weapons. Moore’s ruling included several references to last month’s U.S. Supreme Court ruling that struck down a New York law that required people to show why they needed a concealed weapons permit. He noted that the court found that Americans have the right to bear commonly used arms in public, subject to reasonable and well-defined restrictions, and that governments must identify “an American tradition” to justify any limits on their use.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNorwich: The City Council gave the green light to the Norwich Community Development Corporation to apply for a $500,000 Brownfield Remediation Grant from the state’s Community Investment Fund to help remediate and redevelop the Reid and Hughes department store, a vacant building on Main Street. Mayor Peter Nystrom said the funding is needed to take care of asbestos, lead pipes, and other areas that aren’t up to modern code compliance. The plan for the building is to create 17 apartments and a first-floor retail space. Heritage Housing, Inc. is the developer interested in the Reid and Hughes building. It already owns the Wauregan Building across the street.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Senate Democrats voted in a special session to seek to remove Delaware’s state auditor from office, an action criticized as meaningless “political theater” by the Democratic House speaker. Senators voted 13-7 for a resolution to hold a joint session of the Legislature regarding the removal of Auditor Kathy McGuiness, a Democrat. Senate Democrats contend that McGuiness should be removed from office for betraying the public trust. McGuiness, who is responsible as auditor for rooting out government fraud, waste and abuse, was convicted this month on misdemeanor charges of conflict of interest, official misconduct and structuring a contract with a consulting firm to avoid compliance with state procurement rules. She was acquitted on felony charges of theft and witness intimidation. The case marked the first time in Delaware history that a sitting statewide elected official had been convicted on criminal charges. The Senate resolution must also be approved by the House, but Speaker Pete Schwartzkopf said he has no intention of calling his chamber into special session. “This isn’t taking decisive action: it’s political theater,” Schwartzkopf, a longtime political ally of McGuiness, said in a statement issued by Democratic House leadership.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Police are investigating after a 7-year-old boy was hit by a car driven by an 11-year-old boy in Southeast D.C. on Monday night, WUSA-TV reported. According to the Metropolitan Police Department, the unidentified boy was hit in a playground parking lot, located on the 3500 block of Stanton Road, just after 6:30 p.m. Police believe the juvenile driver lost control of the car and wasn't able to hit the brake before running into the child. The car also hit a curb. When first responders arrived, they found the boy conscious and breathing. The 11-year-old driver of a 2020 Kia Optima ran away from the scene after the crash, but was located by police Tuesday. The family of the injured boy said he is expected to be OK, but he is recovering from a leg injury in the hospital.\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: Four people, including a 5-year-old boy, were injured when a car crashed through an unoccupied toll booth and ended up in the Atlantic Ocean, officials said. The crash happened just before 5 p.m. Sunday along Daytona Beach, where vehicles are allowed on the sand. The driver of the car, Christian Rivera Rosado, 28, of Springfield, Massachusetts, apparently had a seizure and lost control of his Nissan Altima, according to a report from Volusia County Beach Safety Ocean Rescue. The car smashed through the empty toll booth at the International Speedway Boulevard beach approach in Daytona Beach and ended up in the water, Volusia County Beach Safety officials told news outlets. The child, identified as David Alamos of Nashville, Tennessee, was taken to a hospital in Daytona Beach and then airlifted to Arnold Palmer Hospital in Orlando, the Daytona Beach News-Journal reported. The child he was released from Halifax Health Medical Center later Sunday. Rosado was also taken to the hospital as a trauma alert, the report said. Rosado, who said he didn’t remember the incident, was cited for careless driving, the report stated. The crash remains under investigation.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A judge rejected an appeal by a group of voters and affirmed the Georgia secretary of state’s decision that Republican U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene is eligible to run for reelection. The five voters from Greene’s district sought to have her removed from the ballot, saying she played a significant role in the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol that disrupted Congress’ certification of Joe Biden’s presidential victory. That was a violation of a rarely invoked provision in the 14th Amendment against insurrection or rebellion, they argued.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A swimmer at a beach in Waikiki was injured last weekend after encountering an endangered Hawaiian monk seal with a young pup. Hawaii Marine Animal Response, a nonprofit conservation organization that helps monitor protected species, said their workers witnessed a swimmer come into contact with the mother monk seal known as Rocky on Sunday morning. The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources said in a statement the victim is a 60-year-old elementary school teacher from California. The woman received lacerations to her face, arm and back, the agency said. State officials said they would not recommend charges or fines for the woman and are not naming her because she requested anonymity. The Hawaii Marine Animal Response said in a statement the seal gave birth to a pup about two weeks ago on Kaimana Beach in Waikiki, the same area where the swimmer was injured. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and Hawaii Marine Animal Response have been watching the pair and warning people to stay away. It is against the law to touch, harass, injure or kill monk seals, of which there are less than 1,600 remaining in the wild. People are told to stay at least 150 feet away from a mother seal and pup, though that recommendation is not a law.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Tom Arkoosh, an attorney from Boise, said he’s running for Idaho attorney general as the Democratic nominee. Arkoosh announced his candidacy amid family and friends at the Statehouse. He’s replacing Steve Scanlin, who withdrew from the race last week and was a placeholder for the Democrats. Arkoosh will face former U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador in the November general election. Labrador defeated five-term incumbent Attorney General Lawrence Wasden in the May Republican primary.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man who died after being stabbed on a commuter train early Monday apparently threatened or tried to rob the person who wounded him, authorities said. The stabbing occurred at about 3 a.m. on a Chicago Transit Authority Red Line train on the city’s South Side, police said. Chief of Detectives Brendan Deenihan said video footage reviewed by investigators suggested the man was with a group who threatened or tried to rob someone else on the train. Video showed the man holding a gun before the individual targeted by the group used a knife to stab him, Deenihan said during a news conference. The man suffered wounds to his chest and later was pronounced dead at a hospital. Deenihan said investigators haven’t identified anyone else involved yet. No arrests have been made.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Thousands of people arguing the abortion issue surrounded the Statehouse and filled its corridors Monday as lawmakers began to consider a Republican proposal to ban nearly all abortions in the state. Vice President Kamala Harris denounced the effort during a meeting with Democratic state legislators. Harris said the abortion ban proposal reflected a health care crisis in the country. Despite the bill’s abortion ban language, anti-abortion activists lined up before a legislative committee to argue the bill wasn’t strict enough and lacked enforcement teeth. Indiana is one of the first Republican-run state Legislatures to debate tighter abortion laws following the U.S. Supreme Court decision last month overturning Roe v. Wade. Indiana’s Republican Senate leaders proposed a bill last week that would prohibit abortions from the time an egg is implanted in a woman’s uterus with limited exceptions – in cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother. Republican Senate leaders said the bill would not add new criminal penalties against doctors involved with abortions, but they would face possibly having their medical licenses revoked for breaking the law.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:As three more families sue Tyson Foods over COVID-19 deaths among workers at its Iowa plants, the meatpacking giant is petitioning the U.S. Supreme Court for protection. Tyson’s attorneys filed the petition Friday, asking the country’s highest court to hear their case and rule that a March 2020 executive order by President Donald Trump shielded the company from legal liability, Bloomberg Law reported. Trump’s order instructed the secretary of agriculture to take “all appropriate action” to keep the country’s meat and chicken processing plants open as COVID-19 spread, though it did not prohibit them from temporarily closing their plants. In their petition, according to Bloomberg, Tyson’s attorneys wrote the company followed “the federal government’s instructions to help avert an impending national food shortage.” They added that Tyson executives “will not be so eager to willingly aid the federal government in a crisis” if the company is subject to lawsuits.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State Attorney General Derek Schmidt is trying to get ahead of arguments that an anti-abortion measure up for a statewide vote next week would hinder medical care for patients with life-threatening pregnancies. Schmidt, a Republican running for governor who supports the measure, argued in a legal opinion issued Friday that treating miscarriages, removing dead fetuses and ending ectopic pregnancies do not fall under Kansas’ legal definition of abortion. The proposal on the ballot Aug. 2 would amend the Kansas Constitution to allow the Legislature to further restrict or ban abortion. It’s the first referendum on abortion policy by a state since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last month.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Funding is available to help boost the Kentucky tourism industry, which saw a decline in visitors because of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. The state will allocate $75 million over the next several weeks to help eligible tourism organizations that apply and show the impact of the virus, Gov. Andy Beshear’s office said. The funding comes from the American Rescue Plan Act and was allocated by the General Assembly earlier this year. It will be distributed in four ways. Officials said $25 million will go to local tourism commissions to market their communities, $25 million will be used to attract conventions and meetings, $15 million will go toward statewide marketing and $10 million will be available for multicounty collaborations.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: Mayor-President Josh Guillory said he has checked himself into a rehabilitation facility for treatment of alcohol addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. Guillory said in a news release he will be at an in-patient facility for 21 days. A statement from the city said Guillory will remain in authority over Lafayette Parish and city government. Through arrangements with the facility, Guillory will have access to a computer and internet service and will be able to review and sign contracts, ordinances and other documents. Guillory’s biography on the city’s website said he enlisted in the Louisiana Army National Guard in 2001 and led a platoon in Iraq in 2005.\n\nMaine\n\nNewry: A decision by state regulators could make it difficult for the owners of a potentially rich lithium deposit in western Maine to extract the metal. The owners of the Newry property asked the Maine Department of Environmental Protection to review the possibility of quarrying at the site. However, regulators decided earlier this month the site would be viewed as a metallic mineral mine and not a quarry operation, said Maine mining coordinator Michael Clark on Monday. Maine’s mineral mining laws are among the strictest in the country. The Freeman family, which owns the land, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. New sources of lithium are in demand in the U.S. because the metal is crucial to the development of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries used in electric and hybrid cars.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Democratic U.S. Rep. C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger has tested positive for the coronoavirus, his office said Monday. Ruppersberger, who represents Maryland’s 2nd District, tested positive on Sunday night. The congressman’s symptoms are mild and he is working from home while isolating, his office said. He is fully vaccinated and has had a booster shot. Ruppersberger, 76, is serving his 10th term in Congress. This is the second time this year that he has tested positive for the coronavirus. He also had a positive test in January and reported mild symptoms at the time.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: After a whale crashed into a fishing boat and others were seen off the South Shore coast in the past week, the state is warning boaters to use caution as a group of young humpbacks feeds in Plymouth Harbor. The state’s environmental agencies have warned all boaters, kayakers, paddleboarders and others on the water to watch out for three juvenile humpback whales that have been feeding near Plymouth for at least a week. The young whales’ behavior is “very unpredictable,” the state said, and they are feeding on schools of fish in shallow waters. A whale on Sunday struck a fishing boat off the coast of Plymouth after breaching with several boats nearby. The whale hit one of the boats and caused the bow to dip down into the water. Two people on the boat braced themselves as the boat tipped forward and back, a video showed. A paddleboarder had a close encounter with a whale off Manomet last week, and amateur wildlife photographer Suzanne O’Shea managed to photograph a breaching whale off the coast of Plymouth on July 19. The whales feeding and breaching in the area have brought residents and tourists in the hopes of catching a glimpse. Most of the whales have been humpback, which can measure up to 55 feet and weigh up to 40 tons, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation, a nonprofit group dedicated to the conservation of whales. It is illegal to harass marine mammals under the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act and the Massachusetts Endangered Species Act. Harassment includes any act of pursuit, torment or annoyance that can injure or disrupt the feeding behavior of the animal. The National Marine Fisheries Service recommends that boaters stay at least 100 feet away from whales and take caution given the unpredictable behavior of whales and the potential safety hazards involved.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: Dozens of University of Michigan medical students walked out of a weekend ceremony to protest a speaker who publicly opposes abortion rights. Dr. Kristin Collier, an assistant professor of medicine, was the keynote speaker Sunday at an annual event where new medical students are formally welcomed and given a white lab coat. A video of some students walking out was posted to social media and has received more than 11 million views. Collier didn’t refer to abortion in her remarks, but she has shared her opinions on social media and in interviews. A petition signed by 340 medical students, including some of the new ones, had urged the university to drop Collier as a speaker. Spokeswoman Mary Masson said the university “does not revoke an invitation to a speaker based on their personal beliefs.” Dr. Joseph Kolars, a senior associate dean, said Collier was nominated to speak by members of a medical school student honor society. He told the audience that she is an “enormously popular teacher and physician.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Mekhi Speed, 18, a cousin of Amir Locke, was sentenced to more than 16 years for his role in a January murder that prompted police to execute a no-knock warrant on the apartment where Locke was killed by a SWAT team officer. Speed pleaded guilty in May to aiding and abetting second-degree unintentional murder while committing a felony – namely aggravated robbery – in connection with the Jan. 10 killing of 38-year-old Otis Elder. Speed, who was 17 when Elder was shot, told the court during his plea hearing that he had a handgun when he and others tried to rob Elder of drugs in St. Paul, and there was a struggle and a shot was fired. Speed said he had no memory of pulling the trigger and didn’t know if his accomplice was armed. As St. Paul police were investigating Elder’s murder, they identified Speed as a suspect and obtained search warrants for Minneapolis apartments associated with him. Locke, Speed’s cousin, was not a target of the investigation and was not named in the warrants, but he was in one of the apartments as a Minneapolis SWAT team entered the unit without knocking on Feb. 2. Video showed Locke, 22, who was Black, was shot seconds after police entered the apartment before 7 a.m. He was on a sofa wrapped in a comforter, and video showed he was holding a gun in the moments before he was shot. Minnesota prosecutors declined to file charges the against Officer Mark Hanneman, saying his use of deadly force was justified.\n\nMississippi\n\nSatartia: With a population of 64, the village of Satartia in Yazoo County is Mississippi’s smallest town, but it will soon hold a celebration of something unusually large – a fictional catfish named Eli that lives in the nearby Yazoo River. The Eli – Pride of the Yazoo River Festival on July 30 will be an evening of music, food, fireworks and might be one of the only festivals around where you can rent a catfish. “It’s going to be epic,” said Michele Harris, president and event coordinator of the non-profit Moving Satartia Forward. “It’s going to be so much fun.” Eli isn’t a real catfish. He’s the focus of an award-winning children’s book; Eli – Pride of the Yazoo River. He lives in the river under a bridge, which is a stone’s throw from the village. In the book, a boy and girl set out to do what no one has done – catch the legendary fish. Instead, they develop a friendship with Eli and become his protectors. Eli is now a part of the town’s identity. There’s even a 3,500-pound wooden sculpture of the fish in downtown Satartia created by artist Alexander Brown.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: St. Louis has joined a growing list of Democrat-led cities seeking to help women gain abortion access, even in red states that have largely banned the procedure. Not long after Democratic Mayor Tishaura Jones signed a measure providing $1 million for travel to abortion clinics in other states, Republican Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt sued to stop what he called a “blatantly illegal move to spend Missourians’ hard-earned tax dollars on out-of-state abortions.” The give-and-take is emblematic of city versus state fight playing out since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. The St. Louis law called for using federal COVID-19 relief money for a “Reproductive Equity Fund.” The funding is part of a larger health care package that also offers postpartum support, lactation help, doula assistance and money for COVID-19 testing and vaccine incentives. Jones said during a news conference before signing the bill that she expected a lawsuit from Schmitt, who is seeking the GOP nomination for U.S. Senate in the Aug. 2 primary, and who has filed dozens of lawsuits ranging from efforts to halt mask mandates in schools to a suit against China over the coronavirus.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: A helicopter search crew looking for two missing Montana climbers in Glacier National Park spotted their bodies Monday, park officials said in a statement. The men, both 67, were reported overdue Sunday from their planned climb of Dusty Star Mountain in the park’s center. They set out for the climb on Thursday and planned to hike out on Friday. Park rangers found their vehicle at a trailhead Sunday and search crews first took to the air later that day, park officials said. Authorities were making a plan to recover the men’s bodies and their belongings, the park statement said. Their identities were not immediately disclosed.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Gov. Pete Ricketts remains noncommittal about calling a special legislative session to address abortion, despite many Republican lawmakers pushing to outlaw the procedure. Abortion opponents don’t appear to have the 33-vote super majority needed to overcome a filibuster waged by abortion-rights supporters. Abortion remains legal up to 20 weeks of pregnancy in Nebraska. Those seeking an abortion must receive counseling and wait 24 hours before getting an abortion. People under 19 must have parental consent to undergo an abortion.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Thirteen Nevada Republicans announced a new coalition to endorse Democratic Attorney General Aaron Ford in his re-election bid against their party’s nominee, Sigal Chattah, a conservative who bested a more moderate Republican primary contender. The announcement of “Republicans for Ford,” first reported by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, signaled a major shift in party support as the group is headlined by a former rival of Ford’s – former state Senate Majority Leader Michael Roberson, along with former GOP Chairwoman Amy Tarkanian. Chattah won the June Republican primary by 11 percentage points over Tisha Black, a more moderate candidate who had the backing of Nevada’s Republican establishment. A Las Vegas-based lawyer, she is one of a few conservative GOP candidates in Nevada who won their primary races against more moderate opponents. Chattah sued Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak over pandemic restrictions on behalf of a church and has often painted Black as a Democratic sympathizer throughout the primary.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state sued several pharmacy chains Tuesday, becoming the latest government entity seeking to hold them accountable for fueling the nation’s opioid epidemic. The lawsuit filed by Attorney General John Formella called CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens and their subsidiaries “the last link in the opioid supply chain and the critical gatekeeper between dangerous opioid narcotics in the public.” It accused the companies of flouting their duty to protect public health and safety by failing to stop suspicious prescriptions and diverted drugs. Opioids – including prescription drugs and illegal ones such as heroin and illicitly produced fentanyl – have been linked to more than 500,000 deaths in the U.S. since 2000, and the number of cases reached a record high in 2020.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBernards: Capt. Robert Terry and his wife Estelle were posthumously awarded the Tuskegee Airmen Congressional Gold Medal at a ceremony Thursday at the couple’s former home across from the original Somerset Hills Airfield off Lord Stirling Road. The gold medals were commissioned by President George W. Bush in 2001. “This is outstanding,” said Qaaim Saalik, son of Robert and Estelle Terry, accompanied by his daughters Malika Ra and Ramdasha Bikceem, cousin David Booker and close family friend Kumar Best. “I am very proud of them. I know my parents would look down on this occasion with great, great joy.” Brooks Betz, researcher for the Mr. Local History Project, campaigned for the couple’s honors. Over two years, he prepared a detailed story about the couple’s experiences with the Airmen. Robert Terry served as a Tuskegee Airmen flight instructor and pilot from 1943 to 1945. He helped train 992 pilots, 350 of whom were deployed in the war and served with distinction. A licensed pilot, Estelle Terry might have been the first Black woman pilot in New Jersey, Betz said. She also served among the 14,000-member ground support personnel as a mail clerk and packing parachutes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Mayor Tim Keller said the city’s most visible unsanctioned homeless encampment will close next month. Keller said the exact date for Coronado Park’s closing hasn’t been decided. City officials said an estimated 120 people camp nightly at the park and occupants will be told about other housing options. They said increasingly dangerous conditions such as narcotics trafficking and usage combined with prolonged damage to the park’s irrigation and vegetation created safety concerns and were the leading factors in the decision to close the park.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: A preacher known for his close friendship with Mayor Eric Adams was robbed of more than $1 million worth of jewelry Sunday by armed bandits who crashed his Brooklyn church service, just as he was sermonizing about keeping faith in the face of grave adversity, police said. Bishop Lamor Miller-Whitehead, who embraces his flashy lifestyle and can often be seen driving around the Big Apple in a Rolls Royce, was delivering a sermon at his Leaders of Tomorrow International Ministries when police said three robbers walked in. They showed guns and demanded property from Miller-Whitehead and his wife, Asia K. DosReis-Whitehead, police said. The service was also being livestreamed online. In the video, which appears to have been removed from the church’s social media channels, Miller-Whitehead is heard asking his flock, “How many of you have lost your faith because you saw somebody else die?” moments before the robbers entered the church. He’s then seen dropping to his hands and knees and repeatedly saying, “all right, all right,” before a man holding a gun and wearing a black sweatshirt enters the frame. The man, who was also wearing a black mask, is then seen approaching Miller-Whitehead, who was hiding behind a gold-colored lectern, and stuffing the bishop’s jewelry into his pockets. Another man, dressed in similar garb, is then seen heading toward Miller-Whitehead, lingering near him for a few minutes and then running off. Miller-Whitehead said in a video posted to Instagram that the robbers ripped his collar off to grab his chain and held a gun to his infant daughter’s face while stealing his wife’s jewelry. Police said the robbers fled in a white Mercedes that was last seen on Avenue D near the church, in Brooklyn’s Canarsie neighborhood. Neither Miller-Whitehead, 44, nor DosReis-Whitehead, 38, were physically injured, police said. They daughter was also unharmed.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A construction worker at Charlotte Douglas International Airport was electrocuted, according to a California-based company for whom he worked. The Charlotte Observer reported Rosendin Electric, a company based in San Jose, California, filed a report Monday morning confirming Sunday’s death at the airport. John Mallow, a spokesman for the state Department of Labor, said the death was caused by electrocution. The worker’s identity has not been released and the labor department is investigating the incident, Mallow said. It’s not immediately known what project the worker was involved with when he died, or what time it happened. The airport began several construction projects in 2015. The west side of a $608 million terminal lobby expansion recently opened to passengers, but some parts of the lobby, such as ticketing booths and additional lighting, are still being installed. There also are other ongoing projects across the airport complex.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck:Republican U.S. Sen. Kevin Cramer said the U.S. Environment Protection Agency awarded $280,000 to the state Department of Environmental Quality to implement a program to provide drinking water assistance to underserved, small and disadvantaged communities in the Tri-County Water District.\n\nOhio\n\nMilford Township: A medical helicopter responding to the scene of a fatal accident crashed early Tuesday when it hit power lines, but no one on board the aircraft was seriously injured, authorities said. Three crew members were in the CareFlight helicopter on the way to an accident involving two pickup trucks that occurred about 4:15 a.m. in Milford Township, according to the Butler County Sheriff’s Office. The aircraft was approaching the scene when it crashed into the power lines and went down. According to a statement issued by CareFlight, no patients were in the aircraft, which was being operated by Air Methods, and the crew members were able to safely exit the helicopter. The cause of the crash will be investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Aviation Administration. Butler County Chief Deputy Anthony Dwyer told WXIX-TV that one crew member suffered “an unknown injury” and was taken to a hospital. The other two crew members were treated at the scene for minor injuries. Authorities said one person was killed in the vehicle accident and three other people were injured. The cause of the accident remains under investigation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: A couple has been charged in the death of a woman whose body was found last year wrapped in plastic in the basement of a home. Margarita Sandoval, 19, had been missing for three years when police found her body in May 2021 in a box hidden underneath some stairs in a home in Norman. After a 14-month investigation, Normal police charged Sandoval’s brother, 35-year-old Octavio Sanchez, and her sister-in-law, 27-year-old Desiree Sanchez, each with murder and unlawful removal of a dead body. Earlier this month, the Oklahoma Medical Examiner’s Office ruled Sandoval’s death a homicide. Investigators said Sandoval had moved in with the couple in their Norman home in January 2018. Several months later, other family members began looking for Sandoval after not hearing from her. Police said Sandoval, who had limited cognitive abilities, had called authorities to report that the couple had been abusive to her. Police alleged the Sanchez couple had continued to collect Sandoval’s disability payments up until her body was discovered.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Temperatures soared to 102 degrees Fahrenheit in Oregon’s largest city on Tuesday, which was expected to be the hottest day of a scorching spell that will be unusually long for this part of the U.S. It was also a new daily record for the city for July 26, besting the previous high set in 2020. Oregon health officials said there has been an uptick in the number of people reporting heat-related illness in emergency departments, and the number of those calling emergency services numbers for similar symptoms. “Heat-related illness daily visits are above expected levels statewide,” said Jonathan Modie, lead communications officer at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division. He said there were 32 such visits to emergency departments on Monday compared to three to five per day before the heat wave began. Gov. Kate Brown declared a state of emergency across much of the state, warning the extreme temperatures might cause utility outages and transportation disruptions. Portland officials opened cooling centers in public buildings and installed misting stations in parks. TriMet, which operates public transportation in the Portland metropolitan area, will allow passengers who cannot afford fares to ride for free when heading to cooling centers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nBaden: Punk’s Ice Cream Shoppe has been forced to temporarily close after a car crashed into the building Sunday night. Owner Mariellen Ketterer said the incident occurred about 7 p.m. when a car struck the building’s left side along State Avenue in Baden. The shop was open for business at the time but was forced to close immediately, and Ketterer announced on Facebook it would remain closed until further notice. It is unknown why the car crashed into the building or if the driver or anyone else was injured during the accident. Officers from the Baden Police Department were unavailable to comment on Monday afternoon.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: The ACLU of Rhode Island said it is concerned a system recording audio and video in the City Clerk’s office might be illegally capturing conversations between visitors in the room. ACLU Executive Director Steven Brown wrote to Mayor Roberto L. DaSilva earlier this month, after receiving a complaint from someone visiting City Hall who saw a sign indicating that video and audio surveillance was taking place. In his letter, Brown asked DaSilva for more information about the system and asked that he “take immediate steps to address the legitimate privacy concerns that this surveillance technology raises.” DaSilva, in a three-page response to Brown, wrote a video system has been in place since 2014, but that audio in the clerk’s office was added several weeks ago after “a few customer complaints related to their interactions with city employees.” “Please be assured that the City believes that its use and placement of cameras and audio recordings is fully compliant and consistent with ‘reasonable expectations of privacy’ and various statutory requirements,” DaSilva said in his letter to Brown.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: South Carolina can continue enforcing its six-week abortion ban after a judge denied a request to temporarily block it amid a legal fight that is now headed to the state Supreme Court. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic and other plaintiffs had asked the judge for an injunction while their lawsuit challenging the ban moves through the courts. The lawsuit argued the law violates the state constitution’s rights to privacy and equal protection. South Carolina Deputy Solicitor General Thomas Hydrick on Tuesday argued voters did not intend to cover abortion rights when they approved the state’s right to privacy in 1971.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:An animal rights organization filed a complaint with the U.S. Department of Agriculture asking for an investigation into a Sanford Research scientist. The complaint from Stop Animal Exploitation Now was filed by the group after it obtained a document showing that privileges to perform experiments on animals by Shanta Messerli had been permanently revoked. A letter from Sanford Research to the USDA’s Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare indicated Messerli’s privileges were revoked in January 2021. After an appeal to the Sanford Research Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, her privileges were restored to perform two specific experiments under direct supervision. But the letter, signed by David Pearce, the president of innovation and research for Sanford’s World Clinic, said Messerli received a subsequent report of noncompliance while conducting an experiment with funding from the Department of Defense. The USDA has the authority to regulate animal research laboratories. The self-reported letter from Sanford Research to USDA was dated May 2. A Sanford spokesperson did not immediately respond for comment. The USDA did not immediately respond.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Memphis district of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has a new commander for the second time in about a month. Col. Brian D. Sawser assumed command of the expansive district at a ceremony Friday in Memphis, the Corps said in a news release. Lt. Col. Robert W. Green had been named commander in mid-June, and the Corps had said Green would be handing over command to Sawser this month. Sawser now leads a district that covers 25,000 square miles in parts of Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois and Kentucky. He is responsible for flood damage reduction, navigation, environmental stewardship, emergency operations and other civil works along 610 miles of the Mississippi River and the White River. The district manages levees, tributaries, harbors and navigation channels connected to the river.\n\nTexas\n\nBalch Springs: A grass fire apparently sparked on the shoulder of a freeway swept about 300 yards across tinder-dry open field to a suburban Dallas subdivision Monday, burning through wooden fences and torching a row of at least eight homes on the subdivision’s edge. The blaze was the latest in drought-stricken north Texas, which has been vulnerable to wildfires for at least two weeks. It was initially unknown what sparked the fire just off Interstate 20 in Balch Springs about 4 p.m. Monday. There were no immediate reports of injuries. Aerial video showed the fire spread up and down the street as firefighters and homeowners working in 103 degree heat tried to prevent the fire from spreading to more of the bricked frame homes. One end of the fire spread to a home where a panicked dog ran back and forth before running through a pet door at a neighboring home. The dog’s fate was not immediately known. Fire crews from Dallas and other nearby suburbs have gone to the scene to assist Balch Springs crews.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:Utah reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the week ending Sunday, adding 6,870 new cases. That’s down 11.8% from the previous week’s total of 7,789. Utah ranked 34th among the states where coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data showed. Cases fell in seven counties, with the largest declines in Salt Lake County, with 2,765 cases from 3,162 a week earlier; in Utah County, with 1,156 cases from 1,284; and in Tooele County, with 167 cases from 226.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: Federal prosecutors said a man charged with killing his mother at sea in 2016 in a plot to inherit millions should remain behind bars pending trial because he poses a flight risk and danger to others. The prosecutors filed a motion in U.S. District Court in Burlington on Friday, opposing a request by Nathan Carman to be released. Carman, 28, who lives in Vernon, was charged in May with killing his mother, Linda, of Middletown during a fishing trip in 2016 off the coast of New England in which his boat sank. He was found floating in a raft and rescued eight days after departing from a Rhode Island marina. He pleaded not guilty in May in his mother’s death. Prosecutors also have accused Carman of killing his grandfather, John Chakalos, who they said was shot in his home in Windsor in 2013 as part of a scheme to obtain money and property from his grandfather’s estate. Carman has not been charged in that case. Earlier this month, Carman’s attorneys filed a motion seeking his release, saying the evidence against him is “tenuous at best” and he does not pose a flight risk or danger. The attorneys said Carman is willing to surrender his passport, submit to electronic monitoring and turn over all the money he has – $10,000 – to a third party or post some of that money as bail.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state police has temporarily reduced the operating hours for its Med-Flight helicopter service in central and southwest Virginia because of a shortage of pilots. The state police said until more pilots can be hired and trained, the service has been reduced from 24-hour coverage to 16 hours a day, from 8 a.m. through midnight, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported. The changes went into effect on Sunday. In the meantime, private, for-hire air ambulance services such as those offered by VCU Health Systems and HCA Hospitals will fill the gap in the Richmond area. Med-Flight is free, but the private services bill patients for the transport. In most cases, the fee is covered by a patient’s health care insurance.\n\nWashington\n\nRoyal City: A Moses Lake woman drowned Sunday trying to rescue a dog in a canal, according to the Grant County Sheriff’s Office. Deputies and medics responded at about 12:45 p.m. to a report of a woman who fell into a canal off Dodson Road Southwest, near Road 12 Southwest, about 3 miles east of Royal City, the Longview Daily News reported. Witnesses told deputies the 46-year-old woman, later identified as Brigetta Delgado, was trying to rescue a dog when she fell into the canal. She went under and did not resurface, becoming trapped by the turbulence in a plunge pool. Her body was recovered once the water released its grip. Delgado’s body was transported to the coroner’s office for an autopsy and her family was notified.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state Division of Motor Vehicles is now able to process some services that have been affected by a system mainframe outage. The agency is using a workaround to process commercial driver’s licenses, driver’s licenses, instruction permits and driver’s license reinstatement transactions, according to a news release Tuesday from the Department of Transportation. The division is continuing to work with the Office of Technology to restore all services, the release said. Customers should visit the DMV website for up-to-date alerts before they visit a regional office or try the online portal, the Department of Transportation said. The outage was first reported last Wednesday.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Former President Donald Trump plans to visit Wisconsin to campaign for his endorsed candidate for governor, Tim Michels – an announcement made just two days after Michels said he wouldn’t prioritize a key piece of Trumps’ agenda: to decertify the 2020 presidential election results. Trump plans to hold a rally at the Waukesha County Fairgrounds at 7 p.m. Aug. 5, the Friday before the Aug. 9 primary election. Gates are expected to open at 2 p.m., with first speakers to deliver remarks at 4, followed by Trump at 7. Michels faces former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and state Rep. Tim Ramthun in the Republican primary for governor and has surged in recent polling to the top of the field as he spends millions of his own money to blanket television airwaves since entering the race in April. The primary winner will go on to run against Democratic incumbent Gov. Tony Evers in the general election.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A lawsuit filed Monday by a Casper women’s health clinic and others seeks to block Wyoming’s new abortion ban just before it’s scheduled to take effect. The lawsuit claimed the new law violates the state constitution with restrictions that will discourage potentially life-saving pregnancy health care in Wyoming, forcing pregnant women to go to other states for necessary procedures. As with all Wyoming laws challenged in court, Wyoming Attorney General Bridget Hill will defend the new law set to go into effect Wednesday, Michael Pearlman, spokesman for Gov. Mark Gordon, said by email. Gordon, a Republican, signed the ban on nearly all abortion in Wyoming in March. The ban was to take effect if the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which happened June 24. After a more than three-week review, Hill last week gave the go-ahead for Gordon to certify the law to take effect Wednesday. The law will outlaw abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to protect the mother’s life or health, not including psychological conditions. Wyoming until now has allowed abortions up to the point of viability outside the mother, or about 23 weeks into pregnancy.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/20/pigeon-hats-cushion-cash-chaka-khan-news-around-states/41032359/", "title": "More pigeon hats, cushion cash: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The nation’s first memorial to lynching victims is expanding. The Equal Justice Initiative on Saturday opened a new welcome center and exhibition space that will add to the existing lynching memorial and museum that documents the history of racial inequality in America. The downtown pavilion will serve as a hub for visitors to the two previously opened sites: EJI’s National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which documents the era of racial terror lynchings between 1877 and 1950, and the Legacy Museum. The Legacy Pavilion will include a monument to women, men and children who were victims of racial terror lynchings in the Civil War’s aftermath. It will also honor civil rights figures including Martin Luther King Jr., Claudette Colvin, John Lewis, Rosa Parks, Jonathan Daniels, Jo Ann Robinson, and E.D. Nixon and describe Montgomery’s role in fueling a civil rights movement. It’ll also include a gift shop, soul food restaurant, and a shuttle service to the memorial and museum.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The University of Alaska Southeast and other schools in the state university system have proposed increasing tuition starting in the fall to combat a decrease in state funding. The 5% increase was brought about after significant cuts to the state’s funding of the University of Alaska system, the Juneau Empire reports. The increase would generate up to $500,000 for the system and apply to resident undergraduate students, university chancellor Rick Caulfield said. Students taking 15 credit hours of courses a semester would pay about $400 more each year, university officials said. Only three students participated in a meeting scheduled for them to address university officials about the proposal, Caulfield said. Teacher education, marine biology and science programs, and mining and maritime-oriented vocational training are some of the university’s most successful programs, university officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nHeber-Overgaard: U.S. Forest Service officials confirm that seven more wild horses have been found dead in eastern Arizona after eight others were found earlier this month and say that at least some were shot. “Several horses died due to bullet wounds,” but other carcasses were too badly decomposed to determine the cause of death, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests officials said in a statement Friday. The statement said the 15 carcasses were found in a ranger district headquartered in Heber-Overgaard, a rural community 109 miles northeast of Phoenix. According to the statement, evidence was limited because some of the carcasses “had been exposed to extreme weather conditions over extended periods of time.” Forest officials said law enforcement officials had taken steps to more quickly deploy equine experts and veterinarians to incident scenes to help collect evidence.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A state commission has approved nearly $9 million in funding to repair levees damaged by record flooding last year. The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved the $8.8 million in grant funding Thursday for 14 groups overseeing levees along the Arkansas River that were damaged last year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The largest grants were for $1.6 million for the Riverdale area in Little Rock and $1.5 million for a levee district in Dardanelle. Last year, Gov. Asa Hutchinson created a task force to study how to improve the state’s aging levee system. The group presented its final report earlier this month and recommended increased oversight, consolidation of some levee districts, and state grants to fund improvements. Last year’s springtime flooding along the Arkansas River occurred because of heavy rainfall in Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state increased its efforts Friday to keep the federal government from allowing oil and gas drilling on more than 1 million acres of public land, suing to block the Trump administration from issuing new permits in the central part of the state. The federal lawsuit against the U.S. Bureau of Land Management follows a new state law also intended to counter Trump administration plans to increase oil and gas production on protected public land. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued on behalf of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration, saying the permits would allow the controversial extraction method called hydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking. Newsom in October signed a law barring any California leasing authority from allowing pipelines or other oil and gas infrastructure to be built on state property. Federally protected areas are adjacent to state-owned land.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: After former Gov. John Hickenlooper came under fire for how he spent money from a little-known account in his office, similar accounts have been noted throughout state government that hold millions of taxpayer dollars, KCNC-TV reports. The money in the accounts comes from sources like federal dollars and legal settlements, and departments don’t have to disclose it to the Legislature. Democratic Sen. Dominick Moreno plans to change that with a bill he says the powerful Joint Budget Committee is drafting this year. As vice chair of the committee, Moreno has in-depth knowledge of state finances. But he says even he didn’t know about all the money state departments take in that isn’t reported and over which the Legislature has no control. The Colorado Sun reports the Hickenlooper account is paying ongoing legal bills related to an ethics complaint against the current U.S. Senate candidate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Democratic speaker of the state House says lawmakers should consider whether to ban Native American athletic nicknames and symbols at public high schools after one school restored its Redmen mascot just months after dropping it. “I’d like to see a bill introduced to have a public hearing and have the discussion,” Joe Aresimowicz told the Hartford Courant. The school board in Killingly voted in June to drop the high school’s Redmen nickname and then replaced it with Red Hawks in October. The board, with an infusion of new Republican members, restored Redmen last month. Aresimowicz called the mascot “highly offensive.” Across the state, 19 public high schools use Native American-themed nicknames or imagery. Opponents of such names say they are racist and perpetuate stereotypes. The defenders of Native mascots and symbols say they are signs of respect.\n\nDelaware\n\nHockessin: A local temple is now home to a statue of a Hindu god said to be the tallest in the country. Hundreds of people celebrated the arrival of the 25-foot granite statue of the Hindu god Hanuman on Saturday morning at a temple in Hockessin. A welcome ceremony was held after a truck delivered the 60,000-pound statue. “Across India, Lord Hanuman is often enshrined and worshipped in the form of a towering statue, and we are proud to bring that tradition to Delaware,” says Patibanda Sarma, president of the Hindu Temple Association. Organizers of the effort to bring the statue to Delaware had said it would be the tallest statue of a Hindu god carved out of a single piece of stone in the United States. Sculptors in India spent about a year carving it.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Thousands gathered on Freedom Plaza on Saturday as part of the nationwide Women’s March rallies focused on issues such as climate change, pay equity, reproductive rights and immigration, though crowds were noticeably smaller than in previous years. The 2017 march drew close to 1 million people. Last year about 100,000 held a rally east of the White House. This year’s protesters planned to march around the White House, but President Donald Trump wasn’t there, as he was spending the weekend at his resort in Florida. Organizers faced criticism from some local African American activists for failing to focus on local issues and damaging the ability of local activists to organize. “Local D.C. is a domestic colony and the actions of national organizers have to recognize that,” Black Lives Matter D.C. wrote in a letter last week to Women’s March organizers. “Here in D.C., these unstrategic mass mobilizations distract from local organizing, often overlook the black people who actually live here and even result in tougher laws against demonstration being passed locally.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The Legislature set a lot of lofty goals for its annual 60-day session: passing a budget expected to top $90 billion; lowering the cost of health care; preventing blue-green algae; and boosting teacher pay. But also on the agenda entering the second week of session are measures banning iguana breeding, protecting nude sunbathers, making shelter animals the official state pet, banning sunscreen bans, and giving hunters a sales tax break on guns and ammo. The full Senate will take up a bill that would ban local governments from banning sunscreens, while a House committee takes up its version of the bill, in reaction to Key West banning the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate, which some researchers say can harm coral reefs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is on track to have its new election system ready for the presidential primaries in March, lawyers for the state assured a judge Friday, but critics pushed for a more concrete backup plan in case things don’t go as planned. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg tried throughout a conference call to strike a balance between the interests of the two sides while making it clear that she does not consider herself a “guarantor” for the state’s election system rollout. Totenberg is presiding over a lawsuit filed in 2017 by election integrity advocates and individual voters who alleged that the state’s outdated touch-screen voting machines and election management system, in use since 2002, were not secure and were vulnerable to hacking. Critics argue that the new system has many of the same security vulnerabilities as the old system and that voters can’t be sure the barcode read by the scanner accurately reflects their selections.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. Navy is honoring a World War II hero in naming a new aircraft carrier for Mess Attendant 2nd Class Doris Miller. The announcement is expected to be made at Pearl Harbor on Monday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Miller was the first African American to receive the Navy Cross for valor. He was recognized for manning a machine gun on the USS West Virginia and returning fire against Japanese planes during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. USS Miller, a destroyer escort, was previously named in his honor. An African American was not allowed to man a gun in the Navy in 1941, said Doreen Ravenscroft, a team leader for the Doris Miller Memorial. “Without him really knowing, he actually was a part of the civil rights movement because he changed the thinking in the Navy,” Ravenscroft said. Two of Miller’s nieces are expected to be at Pearl Harbor for the announcement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state has the nation’s sixth-highest growth rate for spending on corrections in the past 25 years, and with the governor proposing a 12.1% budget increase for the Department of Correction, the department’s director says the state is at a “critical juncture,” the Idaho Press reports. Idaho increased spending on corrections by 207% between 1992 and 2018, according to a report by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy in Boise. Idaho’s expenditures outpace its spending during the same time period on education, which increased by 94% for public schools and 39% for higher education. At least some of that spending is the result of policy decisions the Legislature made in the past 40 years, according to the report. Idaho is one of only three states in the country where inmates are required by law to serve 100% of their fixed terms, the result of truth-in-sentencing legislation passed in the 1980s, according to the report.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city will test updated bus routes on the West Side under a pilot program recently approved by the Chicago Transit Board. City officials tout the change as part of Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s promise to invest in neighborhoods outside the downtown core. The pilot program is designed to provide streamlined service along the city’s grid system and improve connections to city trains, according to city officials. For example, riders will have more access to jobs, services and schools near the University of Illinois at Chicago, where there are also several hospitals. The changes take effect in April and will last one year. Chicago Transit Authority staff will determine whether to make the changes permanent. The changes will cost about $550,000 and be funded with CTA operating funds, according to officials.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Portions of two parks are getting a special designation because of a rare tree species. Areas in Brown County State Park and Yellowwood State Forest will be considered high conservation value forest areas in an effort to preserve the yellowwood tree population. The Forest Stewardship Council’s certification is a way to ensure that 591 acres where the trees are growing are managed so they remain part of the landscape, says Mike Spalding, resource specialist with Monroe-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests. Civilian Conservation Corps workers in Brown County State Park first discovered the trees in 1933. Forester T.E. Shaw and Charles Deam, Indiana’s first state forester, verified and documented the discovery. One theory was that the yellowwood trees were brought north by Kentucky settlers, but that was proven false when the trees were analyzed. The results showed the trees were genetically distinct and had been in the area for thousands of years.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: Organizers of an emergency warming shelter say they will have to close because the space doesn’t meet fire code regulations. The Waterloo Warming Center opened Jan. 6 at Jubilee United Methodist Church’s Freedom resource center. But after an inspection, officials noted the space didn’t have a sprinkler system and ordered that the center close by Tuesday. Organizers began searching for a new location and implored city officials not to force them out of the current site until a replacement can be found. Temperatures are supposed to remain below freezing until later this week. “We understand and appreciate the need for fire safety regulations, but we cannot close this location down until a new appropriate location has been secured,” Black Hawk County Supervisor Chris Schwartz told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. “The alternative is leaving folks out to freeze to death on our streets.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Former governor and plastic surgeon Jeff Colyer is about to add Chaka Khan backup singer to his resume. Colyer is part of a student and faculty choir that will join the “Queen of Funk” on stage for a Martin Luther King Day event hosted by Georgetown University at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, The Kansas City Star reports. “I get to be a backup singer for Chaka Khan. That’s pretty cool,” said Colyer, who was was a fellow at Georgetown’s Institute of Politics and Public Service during the fall semester. The performance will include a piece composed by Khan, who achieved success in the 1970s as a vocalist in the funk band Rufus and as a solo artist in the 1980s with her hit single “I Feel For You.” Colyer, of Overland Park, was lieutenant governor in 2018 and rose to the top job after fellow Republican Sam Brownback resigned to take an ambassadorship.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Inmate populations and deteriorating prisons are sapping the state of money needed for priorities like education and health care, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says. Stepping up his push for criminal justice reform as the “fiscally responsible thing to do,” Beshear said Friday that the state needs to reduce incarceration rates, which in turn would create opportunities to consolidate prisons. “Criminal-justice reform isn’t just the right thing to do – and I believe it is – it’s the moral thing to do,” he told reporters at the Capitol. “It is absolutely necessary to do for this budget and most especially for every budget” after that. Beshear, who previously served as the state’s attorney general, stressed that he wants to revamp the criminal-justice system in a way that doesn’t compromise public safety.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Plans are on again to implode a hotel building that partially collapsed last fall, killing three workers, city officials said Friday. Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Fire Superintendent Tim McConnell said at a news conference that the implosion is expected to take place in mid-March. Implosion had been considered and then rejected in the weeks after the Oct. 12 collapse at the planned Hard Rock Hotel on Canal Street, at the edge of the French Quarter. But on Friday, officials said the implosion plan was back on. It was deemed safer than having workers dismantle the structure. “Putting more people at risk, I cannot live with that and will not support that,” Cantrell said. And it will mean commerce and traffic can return to the area around the unstable building more quickly. Implosion will also bring the building down ahead of hurricane season, which begins June 1.\n\nMaine\n\nWestbrook: What goes around comes around. An ice disk appears to be forming in the same river where an unusually large one formed last winter and quickly gained international fame. The City of Westbrook tweeted an aerial view of the disk in the Presumpscot River with the message: “ICE BREAKING NEWS: Ice Disk 2020 is making a run for it…It’s not a perfect circle yet, but it is rotating counter-clockwise again & the seagulls are along for the ride.” The ice formation comes just about a year after a disk measuring about 100 yards in diameter was spotted in the Presumpscot River. It eventually had a devoted webcam; social media users compared it to an alien spacecraft and the moon; and ducks used it as a raft. A video of the disk shows a nascent ice blob that is thinner and less circular than the famous disk of 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city will formally name a courthouse after the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings in the first half of 2020. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young on Friday unveiled the renderings of the bronze plaques that will be affixed to the building’s exterior. One includes an image and biography of the congressman, and the other reads “Elijah E. Cummings Courthouse.” The powerful Democratic congressman and civil rights champion died Oct. 17 at age 68 of complications from long-standing health issues. He had represented Maryland’s 7th Congressional District, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore, since 1996. Cummings graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law and practiced in Baltimore. “Elijah was a son of Baltimore. He was proud of Baltimore,” his widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, said during the unveiling ceremony. “His career as a legal professional started in this courthouse.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A push to expand school breakfast programs is making its way through the Legislature. The state Senate last week unanimously approved legislation aimed at increasing participation rates in the programs. The bill would require public schools with 60% or more of students currently eligible for free or reduced-price meals under the federal National School Lunch Program to offer breakfast after the school bell rings. Massachusetts currently requires all high-poverty schools to provide breakfast to every eligible student. Because breakfast is typically offered before the bell, participation levels are less than 40%, compared to up to 90% participation for free and reduced lunch. Supporters of the bill say moving breakfast to after the bell will boost participation and ensure all students have the nutrition they need.\n\nMichigan\n\nOwosso: A whopping $43,170 in forgotten cash was discovered inside a footstool donated to a resale shop. Howard Kirby bought the piece and other furniture for $70 after Christmas. He was stunned Sunday when his daughter-in-law unzipped the cushion and shouted. After the shock wore off, he began the extraordinary step of returning the money to the former owners. “I do what I can to be as much like Christ as I can, and this is the moral thing to do,” said Kirby, 54. “This is going to help them. I’m so happy for them.” The footstool was part of a living room set donated to a Habitat For Humanity store by Kim Fauth-Newberry and her husband. The furniture had belonged to her grandfather, Phillip Fauth, who died in July. Fauth-Newberry said Fauth was a frugal man who always paid in cash, even $9,000 for a new roof. The newly discovered money was separated with paper clips and topped with handwritten notes.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state’s voters on Friday became some of the first in the country to cast ballots in the presidential primaries as early voting began for the Super Tuesday contest. Eligible Minnesota voters can now vote at county courthouses across the state and early voting stations in some cities, and they can also request absentee ballots for the March 3 primary. But the votes won’t be counted until primary night. Fifteen candidates are on the Democratic ballot, even though some already have dropped out of the race. The GOP ballot lists only President Donald Trump, though write-in votes are allowed. It’s Minnesota’s first presidential primary since 1992 after years of using precinct caucuses to kick off the process of selecting national convention delegates. Voters must request either a Democratic or Republican ballot, and their names will be shared with the state’s major parties.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Board of Education is keeping the state’s U.S. history exam, despite months of pressure from teachers and others to cut testing. The board voted unanimously Thursday to keep the test, one of four public school students must take in high school. A testing task force in August had recommended the state do away with what’s the only state test not required by federal law. “It was extremely disheartening that board members placed so much confidence in a staff recommendation over the recommendations of the task force, commission, and multiple surveys of practitioners throughout the state that favored elimination of the assessment,” Mississippi Professional Educators, the state’s largest teachers group, wrote in a message to members.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The president of a predominantly black police union says the city prosecutor’s lawsuit is correct in pointing out racial concerns in St. Louis, including biases within the police department itself. Ethical Society of Police President Heather Taylor stopped short of endorsing Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner’s federal lawsuit accusing “entrenched interests” of impeding her efforts to reform racist practices, but Taylor questioned how anyone could ignore the department’s “long history of racial discrimination.” She said in a statement that denying racial bias within the department is “a slap in the face to minority and non-minority officers with whom we are proud to serve.” She said the union has often cited racial disparities in discipline, promotions and job placement.\n\nMontana\n\nChoteau: An ice jam that has caused flooding along a creek in central Montana had nearly submerged a town park and was rising into residents’ basements and crawl spaces, leading the city to declare a state of emergency Friday. The ice jam came after subzero temperatures and was exacerbated by high ground water. It is likely to remain until warmer temperatures thaw the blocked culverts and stream beds. Water up to 6 inches deep was reported on some streets after ice traveling down Spring Creek was backed up, weather officials said. The ice jam came after temperatures dropped to 20 degrees below zero, officials said. Residents were encouraged to take shorter showers and reduce the amount of times toilets are flushed to avoid overwhelming the sewer system. Sewer main lines were completely filled, and crews sandbagged manholes in the area to avoid further surface water infiltration, city officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Want to try your hand at waterfowl or turkey hunting, but leery of the expense of buying blinds and decoys? The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has a solution. UNL’s Outdoor Adventure Center is now offering that equipment for rent to the public. The rentals had previously been offered for about a year only to the university’s students. Officials recently decided to expand the policy to allow the public to rent the equipment, too. Micaela Rahe with the National Wild Turkey Federation and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said it’s the first program of its kind in the state. Hunting gear currently available for rent includes a pop-up blind, layout blind, duck decoy set of 14 birds and a jake/hen turkey decoy combination. Each is individually available to the public for $6 per day, $12 for three days or $16 for a full week.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A pigeon wearing a tiny sombrero was discovered following sightings of its cowboy hat-wearing cousins in Las Vegas, a city manager says. Reno City Manager Sabra Newby tweeted about the bird Wednesday, saying it’s quirky and fun but still inhumane, KOLO-TV reports. It is the first known sighting of hat-wearing birds in the region, Washoe County Regional Animal Services officials say. The sighting comes after a pigeon in Las Vegas with a miniature cowboy hat glued to its head died last week, animal officials say. People who see the bird are encouraged to call animal service dispatch officers, officials say. It is unclear who put the hat on the bird. “Reno cares about our animals,” Newby says. “They need protection and don’t need to become a punchline.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A group that organized a big memorial bike ride following the deaths of seven motorcyclists in a collision with a pickup truck is presenting the state agencies that helped out with a custom-made, wooden U.S. flag. The flag is etched with the victims’ names from the June crash in Randolph. A presentation by the Ride for Fallen 7 Foundation is scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday at the state Incident Planning and Operations Center, where the flag will be displayed. The building houses agencies from the safety and transportation departments. An estimated 3,000 motorcycles, with 4,500 riders from around the country, took part in the Ride for the Fallen 7 in July. They rode 90 miles from Laconia to the crash site in Randolph, where a memorial service was held. Those killed were members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Barring health insurance that excludes coverage for preexisting conditions and letting children stay on their parents’ plans until 26 would be preserved under a slate of new laws the state enacted last week, even if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in court. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the nine bills Thursday. They’re aimed at shoring up key provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, which is opposed by Republicans in Congress and the White House. Democratic and Republican attorneys general are fighting in court over the law, sometimes referred to as “Obamacare.” New Jersey has about 800,000 people benefiting from the law, with about half a million people getting covered through Medicaid expansion under the law and 300,000 on the individual marketplace.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nJemez Springs: A national preserve in northern New Mexico that is sometimes referred to as the “Yellowstone of the Southwest” has added another piece of property to its land holdings that contains sulfuric acid hot springs, volcanic fumaroles and steaming mud pots. The National Park Service announced last week that it recently completed the purchase of a 40-acre parcel known as Sulphur Springs within the Valles Caldera National Preserve. Many of the geothermal features on the property are found nowhere else in New Mexico, and similar sites are very rare in the Western United States, officials said. The acidic pools and streams in the area also are home to a range of “extremophile” algae and bacteria. Acquiring Sulphur Springs was critical to protecting the breadth of geothermal features within the preserve, officials said. The $500,000 purchase was made through the Land and Water Conservation Fund and nonprofit groups.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Federal authorities are turning to a new tactic in the escalating conflict over the city’s so-called sanctuary policies, issuing four “immigration subpoenas” for information about inmates wanted for deportation. “This is not a request – it’s a demand,” Henry Lucero, said a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. “This is a last resort for us. Dangerous criminals are being released every single day in New York.” Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration said Saturday that the city would review the subpoenas. “New York City will not change the policies that have made us the safest big city in America,” spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein said in an email. The development came days after ICE sent similar subpoenas to Denver, a move that reflected the agency’s mounting frustration with jurisdictions that do not honor deportation “detainers” or provide any details about defendants going in and out of local custody.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilson: Wilson County plans to add four new historical markers this year to commemorate African American heroes, including a 1946 effort to organize tobacco workers. Called Operation Dixie, the unionization effort was led by black women demanding better working conditions in the tobacco industry. The state unveiled a historical marker in Rocky Mount in 2011. The local chapter of the Tobacco Workers International Union formed in Wilson in 1946. Other markers to be unveiled in Wilson this year will honor the Wilson Normal and Industrial Institute, Dr. Frank S. Hargrave, and Charles H. Darden, the Wilson Times reports. The marker for Hargrave describes him as the founder of Mercy Hospital, which treated African Americans in an era when even hospitals were segregated by race. In 1914, he was elected president of the National Medical Association, which was the African American equivalent of the American Medical Association.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum announced Friday that he has pardoned 16 people convicted of low-level marijuana crimes, the first wave in what may be thousands under a new policy the first-term Republican said gives former offenders a second chance. The policy adopted last year allows people with low-level marijuana convictions to petition to have their records wiped clean if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions as if they never occurred, and records are shielded from public view. Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both supported the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities. Past convictions can be problematic for people trying to find jobs and housing. Burgum has said the policy change could help address North Dakota’s workforce shortage and grow its economy, while removing the stigma for what are minor cases from years ago.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A woman who was among the “Freedom Riders” who challenged racial segregation in the 1960s will be the keynote speaker at a breakfast honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center says Betty Daniels Rosemond will speak Monday at the King Legacy Awards Breakfast recognizing participants in a youth leadership program. Three students will be given awards for their work. Rosemond grew up in New Orleans and joined the Congress of Racial Equality, a leading civil rights organization. She was among bus riders, black and white, who braved possible violence to advocate for racial equality in the segregated South. The center invites guests to join in the 45th annual MLK Coalition March in downtown Cincinnati after the breakfast that will include an interfaith prayer service at Fountain Square.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state panel that includes appointees of Gov. Kevin Stitt has approved more taxpayer subsidies for the Jenks-based company the governor founded and ran until after his election in 2018. The three-member Quality Jobs Program Incentive Approval Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to approve an application from Gateway First Bank. The contract was first reported by the online publication The Frontier. Two of the members who approved the application, Department of Commerce Director Brent Kisling and Oklahoma Tax Commission Chairman Charles Prater, were appointed by Stitt. Under the program, companies that create up to $2.5 million in new annual payrolls within three years can qualify for quarterly cash payments of up to 5% of new payroll costs. The company already has received more than $876,000 in taxpayer subsidies under an existing contract under the program, state records show.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s changing climate and ocean conditions are already harming its native fish and wildlife, officials from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife say. That’s making it difficult for ODFW to meet its statutory mandate to manage the resources in its care. In response, the department is developing a Climate and Ocean Change Policy that will help shape where its limited resources are spent. On Friday, the public and the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission had their first chance to hear about the proposal. “Our climate and ocean are changing in ways that are not favorable for fish and wildlife,” said Shaun Clements, ODFW senior policy analyst. “We’ve been working on trying to address these impacts.” For example, Oregon may have to abandon spending in some areas where species are unlikely to survive, in order to focus on those where they will, said Davia Palmeri, the department’s conservation policy coordinator.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says he will follow through on his plan to close another state prison, announced originally in August as a cost-cutting step amid a declining inmate population and rising prison costs. Wolf’s administration carried out the required hearings on its plan, which was criticized by the corrections’ officers union and state lawmakers whose districts surround Retreat state prison in northeastern Pennsylvania. Retreat, about 10 miles west of Wilkes-Barre, has about 400 employees and about 940 inmates. Closing could occur in four months at an annual savings of $40 million, the administration said. Employees will be offered jobs at another state prison within 65 miles of Retreat, it said. Retreat was particularly vulnerable to closing: Its original buildings date back to the 19th century, and it has the fewest beds of any of Pennsylvania’s 25 state prisons.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Political, community and religious leaders are celebrating the life of Martin Luther King Jr. at the state’s annual commemoration of the civil rights leader. The public is invited to the event, beginning at 4 p.m. Monday at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Providence. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and other elected leaders plan to attend. The Martin Luther King Jr. State Holiday Commission organizes the annual celebration. State Rep. Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat, leads the commission and will serve as the master of ceremonies. Hull said Friday that with the turmoil in the nation today, it’s important to look back and reflect on what King stood for and how he brought people together to cure injustices. The commemoration includes speeches, awards and performances by the Ebenezer Baptist Church Choir and RPM Voices of Rhode Island.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A feature that has helped Furman University receive past honors as one of the most beautiful campuses in America has been taken away. Forty of the decades-old oak trees that lined Furman’s Mall have been cut down. They’ll be replaced with new species of oaks with life spans from 250 to more than 400 years: overcup, Nuttall’s, scarlet and swamp white, the university says. The nearly 70-year-old trees were starting to die, and limbs were starting to fall and become hazardous, according to Clinton Colmenares, spokesman for the university. Their removal is the latest phase in a multiyear project to replace original trees with better species that live longer and are just as big, Colmenares says. Furman broke ground on its current campus in 1953. The trees along the mall were planted between 1956 and 1958, the university says.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem was the sixth-most-unpopular governor in the country in the final months of 2019, according to the Morning Consult’s latest polling. Forty-five percent of South Dakotans surveyed disapproved of the job Noem was doing as governor, and 43% approved, while 12% said they didn’t know, according to the 2019 fourth-quarter governors poll released Thursday by Morning Consult, a research services company. The poll had a 3% margin of error. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Thune was among the top 10 most popular senators in the Morning Consult’s 2019 fourth-quarter poll. Thune had an approval rating of 52%, and U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds had an approval rating of 50%, with a 3% margin of error, according to Morning Consult. Both of their Morning Consult approval ratings have remained in the low- to mid-50s range throughout 2019.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee will introduce legislation this year that would amend a law requiring the state to honor Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Lee’s office confirmed Friday that the Republican, who has previously expressed his displeasure over the honor, was working on the bill. The office did not provide further details. According to the law in question, Tennessee governors must sign six proclamations throughout the year designating as days of special observance Robert E. Lee Day (Jan. 19), Abraham Lincoln Day (Feb. 12), Andrew Jackson Day (March 15), Confederate Decoration Day (June 3), Nathan Bedford Forrest Day (July 13) and Veterans Day (Nov. 11). Lee received national backlash in July when signed the Nathan Bedford Forrest proclamation and declined to answer questions about whether he thought the law should change. Lee later clarified that he didn’t like signing the proclamation and would prefer to see the law changed.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Demolition of the last of the city’s three Columbus ship replicas began Thursday morning despite efforts to raise funds for repairs. The demolition of the La Nina comes after the Columbus Sailing Association was unable to raise enough money to support the reconstruction of a new bottom and main deck. The ship is one of three Columbus ship replicas that first sailed to Corpus Christi in 1992 as part of Spain’s 500th anniversary of the “Voyage to the New World” celebration. La Pinta and La Santa Maria were too costly to repair. The association created a GoFundMe campaign in 2017 to raise $100,000 to fix the damaged La Nina. The fundraiser has raised $4,335.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: About a third of the state’s registered voters are at risk of not being able to participate in March’s Super Tuesday presidential primary if they don’t request ballots. State and county election officials have been sending letters and trying to get the message out before it’s too late. This will be the first time Utah takes part in Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote, after lawmakers moved up the primary to make the state more relevant in the process. The state’s nearly 510,000 independent voters can request a ballot for the Republican or Democratic primary, but the process is slightly different. The Republican primary is closed, so voters who want to cast a ballot must return the form to become GOP registered voters by Feb. 3. The Democratic primary is open, so independent voters can get a ballot without registering with the party. They have until Feb. 25 to request the ballot if they intend to remain unaffiliated but need to send it in by Feb. 3 if they want to become a registered Democrat.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: State transportation officials said they are hopeful upgrades to the rail line between Rutland and Burlington can be ready sometime next year, which will make it possible to resume Amtrak rail service between the cities. Officials have been working for years to upgrade the 75 miles of rail and complete a number of other projects, such as station improvements and rail crossings. One of the major projects on the route, a new rail tunnel through downtown Middlebury, is slated for completion next year. Rutland Mayor David Allaire, who serves on the Governor’s Rail Advisory Council, said he was hopeful the line will be done by the end of next year, the Rutland Herald reports. Once the improvements are completed, officials plan to have Amtrak’s Ethan Allen Express, which now travels between New York City and Rutland, continue to Burlington.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials and U.S. hate-monitoring groups are warning about the potential for violence ahead of a gun-rights rally expected to draw a mix of militias, firearms advocates and white supremacists to the city. Citing credible threats of violence, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a temporary state of emergency days ahead of Monday’s rally, banning all weapons, including guns, from Capitol Square. Virginia’s solicitor general last week said law enforcement had identified “credible evidence” that armed out-of-state groups planned to come to Virginia with the possible intention of participating in a “violent insurrection.” Online, threats of violence have been “rampant” among anti-government and far-right groups, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks white supremacists and other extremists. Conspiracy theories and other misinformation have also proliferated.\n\nWashington\n\nNewhalem: The National Park Service is investigating the desecration of an archaeological site in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex, and the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe is hoping to bring those responsible to justice. The Skagit Valley Herald reports evidence of digging was found over the summer at the Newhalem Rock Shelter camp used by the ancestors of the Upper Skagit tribe. “We were shocked and dismayed that someone would do something like this at a cultural site,” the tribe’s Natural Resources Director Scott Schuyler said. “Some of these places are thousands of years old, and the fact that someone would want to come in and purposely destroy, damage or steal, it’s just unbelievable.” The tribe is working with the Park Service on the investigation and offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to those responsible.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRipley: Health officials are hoping a new initiative will help Jackson County residents quickly inform first responders about their medical conditions. WCHS-TV reports the Jackson County Health Department is offering free seat belt covers that will display personal and medical information that first responders can use during a car crash or other emergency situations. Known as “Medical Seat Belt Safety Days,” the county will provide the free covers March 26-27. People interested should bring their medical insurance information and a list of medications they currently take. Car seat safety checks also will be provided during that time at no charge.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Much of the west side of downtown and some areas east of the Milwaukee River will be inside a security zone during next summer’s Democratic National Convention, officials announced Friday. Police Chief Alfonso Morales said every resident and business in the zone will have access to their property. The main inconvenience for residents will be travel times, officials said. It’s still not known which part of downtown will be behind barriers or fences. Officials said they have outlined a broad security footprint, and the small, more restricted area should be announced later. The main convention venues include Fiserv Forum, UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, Miller High Life Theatre and the Wisconsin Center.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: State wildlife managers are criticizing plans by Grand Teton National Park to shoot nonnative mountain goats by helicopter. Inclement weather has so far prevented the aerial gunning, though park officials recently closed off a wide area of the Teton Range where shooting is to occur. “Having government personnel kill mountain goats from helicopters and leaving them to rot and be wasted is unacceptable,” Wyoming Game and Fish Commission President David Rael wrote to acting park Superintendent Gopaul Noojibail in a recent letter. The commission last week approved a resolution opposing the plans, favoring the use of volunteers to hunt the goats on the ground. The governor-appointed commission sets official policies and procedures for wildlife management, including hunting seasons and quotas, across Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/20"}]}

(Another state, Nebraska, banned TikTok from state devices in 2020.) Last week, the state of Indiana announced two lawsuits against TikTok accusing the Chinese-owned platform of misrepresenting its approach to age-appropriate content and data security.\n\nOn Tuesday, a group of 15 attorneys general wrote to Apple and Google calling on the app store owners to stop listing TikTok as being appropriate for teens, over claims about the prevalence of mature content on the app.\n\nThe mounting pressure on TikTok has come from states led by Republican governors who have highlighted fears that TikTok users’ personal information could wind up in the hands of the Chinese government, thanks to that country’s national security laws.\n\n“South Dakota will have no part in the intelligence gathering operations of nations who hate us,” said Gov. Kristi Noem in announcing the new state policy.\n\nThe flurry of announcements has drawn sharp contrasts with activity at the federal level. Since 2020, when the Trump administration threatened a ban over national security concerns, TikTok and the US government have been negotiating a deal that may allow the short-form video app to keep serving US users.\n\nThere have been years of closed-door negotiations between TikTok and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, an opaque multi-agency panel charged with reviewing foreign investment deals for national security risks. One US official has suggested that CFIUS ban TikTok from the United States outright.\n\nWhatever outcome the negotiations produce is still expected to have big implications for TikTok and its users. But the federal government’s continued inaction on that front, as well as recent reports of delays in the negotiations, has left the door open for states to step in as the app has gained immense popularity among US users.\n\nIn taking these steps, the states are unlikely to disrupt how everyday users access the app. But these recent announcements could nonetheless add to political pressure for tougher action at the federal level, which could in turn be more disruptive to users.\n\n“It feels like the states are stepping into the DC vacuum on TikTok,” said Paul Gallant, a policy analyst at the investment research firm Cowen Inc. “I don’t see those new restrictions disrupting TikTok that much, but it probably adds a bit of pressure for Washington to ‘do something’ on TikTok one way or another.”\n\nThe Treasury Department, CFIUS’s chair agency, said in a statement that the panel is “committed to taking all necessary actions within its authority to safeguard US national security” and declined to comment on TikTok specifically. The White House also declined to comment.\n\n“We’re disappointed that so many states are jumping on the bandwagon to enact policies based on unfounded, politically charged falsehoods about TikTok,” Hilary McQuaide, a spokesperson for TikTok, said in a statement provided to CNN. “It’s unfortunate that the many state agencies, offices, and universities on TikTok in those states will no longer be able to use it to build communities and connect with constituents.”\n\nA long wait for federal action\n\nUS lawmakers have raised bipartisan concerns that China’s national security laws could force TikTok — or its parent, ByteDance — to hand over the personal data of its US users. Security experts have said that the data could allow China to identify intelligence opportunities or to seek to influence US users through disinformation campaigns.\n\nTikTok has said it is working with the US government to address all reasonable national security concerns. It has also taken independent steps to isolate US user data from other parts of its business. Last week, amid the pushback from the states, the company said it would restructure its US-focused content moderation, policy and legal teams under US Data Security, a special group within the company that’s led by US-based officials and walled off organizationally from other teams focused on the rest of the world.\n\nUnder the change, content policies TikTok develops for its global audience must be “reviewed and approved” for US audiences by TikTok’s US Data Security group, to ensure the policies meet the standards of any deal approved by CFIUS, the company said. Content moderation involving US users’ data, TikTok said, will be handled by a US-specific trust and safety team within the US Digital Security group, and not by its global trust and safety team.\n\nTikTok has previously acknowledged that employees based in China can currently access user data, and has also declined to commit to stop sending US user information to China.\n\nHarry Broadman, who leads the CFIUS practice at Berkeley Research Group, a consulting firm, said he isn’t privy to the details of the negotiation between TikTok and the US government but called the continued lack of resolution “a mystery.”\n\n“I’m a little bit mystified why it’s taking so long for CFIUS to deal with this problem,” he said. “There must be some issue that’s going on.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Sen. Marco Rubio, the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, and a bipartisan pair of congressmen in the House, introduced new legislation that aims to ban TikTok from operating in the United States. In a statement, Rubio expressed frustration with the lack of action at the federal level.\n\n“The federal government has yet to take a single meaningful action to protect American users from the threat of TikTok,” Rubio said. “There is no more time to waste on meaningless negotiations with a CCP-puppet company. It is time to ban Beijing-controlled TikTok for good.”\n\nAn opening for Republican governors\n\nWith no deal yet between CFIUS and TikTok, the states led by Republican officials appear to have capitalized on the moment from a “tactical, political, winning-points perspective,” Broadman said.\n\n“I don’t think it reflects a deeper suspicion on the part of the Republicans versus Democrats,” he said. “I think it’s more of a tactical question.”\n\nSince government agencies have clear authority to manage their own devices in ways they see fit, barring public employees from using the app represents low-hanging fruit (and easy headlines), Broadman said.\n\nIn some ways, the states that have restricted TikTok are following the federal government’s lead. Already, the US military, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security have prohibited their own employees from using TikTok.\n\nStates such as Maryland also enacted their TikTok bans on government devices as part of a wider crackdown on Chinese-linked products and services, making the announcement more about China than about TikTok individually. Maryland’s directive also applies to Huawei and ZTE, which the US government has also taken steps to block from US markets.\n\nAt least one state is going even further. Last week, Indiana sued TikTok in two separate cases. One claimed that TikTok lures children onto the platform by falsely claiming it is appropriate for users between 13 and 17 years old; the other claims TikTok has “deceived” consumers about whether user data is sufficiently protected from Chinese government access. TikTok has declined to comment on the litigation but has said “the safety, privacy and security of our community is our top priority.”\n\nSome states could also choose to begin advancing meaningful legislation that effectively limits TikTok on private devices, Broadman said, in a move that would more directly impact TikTok’s American user base. But such a move would likely introduce other issues about the regulation of commerce, and potentially result in legal challenges.", "authors": ["Brian Fung"], "publish_date": "2022/12/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/09/hurricane-milton-re-strengthens-to-category-5-the-excerpt/75584293007/", "title": "Hurricane Milton re-strengthens to Category 5 | The Excerpt", "text": "On Wednesday's episode of The Excerpt podcast: Hurricane Milton is expected to make landfall Wednesday night.

I'm Taylor Wilson and today is Wednesday, October 9th, 2024. This is The Excerpt. Today, Hurricane Milton nears Florida, plus how health insurance rates are climbing even amid cooling inflation. And we discuss a new era of conservative comedy.\n\n♦\n\nHurricane Milton regained category five strength yesterday as it moved through the Gulf toward the Florida Peninsula. The National Hurricane Center said in an early morning update that the storm is expected to make landfall on Florida's Gulf Coast tonight. Sustained winds reached 160 miles an hour overnight. The Hurricane Center is warning about dangerous storm surge conditions in particular, and that they bring an extremely life-threatening situation for the state's western coast. Milton is forecast across the state in a northeasterly direction exiting the east coast somewhere between Daytona Beach and Stewart tomorrow morning. Florida Governor, Ron DeSantis, told residents yesterday that time was running out before the storm made landfall\n\nRon DeSantis:\n\nPrepare for the worst and let's pray that we get a weakening and hope for the least amount of damage as possible, but we must be prepared for a major, major impact to the west coast of Florida.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAt least a million people have been placed under evacuation orders in at least 16 counties. For more on the atmosphere on the ground, I caught up with USA TODAY National Correspondent, Trevor Hughes, as the Tampa area prepared for the storm yesterday.\n\nTrevor, I appreciate you hopping on today.\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nAbsolutely, good to be here.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Trevor, Milton is still barreling toward the Florida coast. We still don't know exactly what strength it will be when it hits and makes landfall, but really how are people preparing? What are you seeing there?\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nWell, there are large portions of this area... I'm in Tampa, in St. Petersburg right now. There are large portions of this area that are under mandatory evacuations and a lot of people have left. The people who are staying are boarding up their windows. They're sandbagging as you might expect, but everyone frankly is exhausted from Helene and now Milton's coming.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah, there are still people displaced from that storm. You mentioned Helene. Where are they going? How is this influencing them?\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nIt's been a real challenge. I spoke with someone earlier who lost his house in Helene. He had two feet of floodwater destroy his house, destroyed his cars, essentially his savings, and he's been living in his car ever since. So when I talked to him, he was at an emergency shelter trying to find a place to rest with his parrot because it's been a real crisis.\n\nPeople can't live in their houses and they don't have anywhere to go right now. So hotels are all booked up, people are staying with friends and family, and then there's quite a lot of shelters that are open and folks are really starting to flood into those.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd Trevor, you're really no stranger to storms. You've covered these for years. What are you most worried about with Hurricane Milton?\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nI think there's a couple of things going on. The storm surge may be significantly larger for this area than it was for Helene, and we're talking about a city, Tampa and St. Petersburg, where there are piles of debris still all over the place from a storm a couple of weeks ago. So there's a real concern that this will actually be much worse in terms of storm surge.\n\nBut the other factor is the mental health. I mean, people here are exhausted, dealing with storm after storm, and you get the sense that there's just this, \"oh my goodness, what is going to happen next\" kind of feeling that's going on. I really feel for those folks.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nIt's so tough, Trevor. I appreciate you being out there and checking in with us. Stay safe and hoping for the best for all the folks in Florida.\n\nTrevor Hughes:\n\nYou bet.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nFor all the latest from Milton today and beyond, stay with usatoday.com and tune into The Excerpt tomorrow morning, right here on this feed.\n\n♦\n\nFormer President, Donald Trump, said in 2018 that the FBI would have free rein to investigate allegations against his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. But a report yesterday from a Senate Democrat found the investigation flawed and incomplete without following up on multiple leads. A report from a member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, criticized the FBI for not investigating more fully claims of Kavanaugh's alleged sexual misconduct described by two women. Kavanaugh has denied the allegations. Whitehouse's report said the FBI did not investigate thousands of tips it received, but passed them along to the White House. Kavanaugh did not respond to a request for comment and Trump campaign spokesperson, Karoline Leavitt, said in a statement that the ridiculous story about the report was a way to delegitimize the Supreme Court and pave the way for Kamala Harris to pack the court with radical-left judges.\n\n♦\n\nEven as spiking grocery bills and car prices have cooled, health insurance rates are climbing. The average cost for a family health insurance plan offered through an employer, increased 7% this year to $25,572 according to the annual Employer Health Benefit Survey released today by KFF, a non-profit health policy organization. The cost of family health insurance jumped 7% for the second consecutive year, after a decade of more modest yearly increases. Family insurance rates increased by just 1% in 2022. As for individuals, insurance costs bumped up 6% to just under $9,000 this year, according to the survey. A year ago, individual plans increased 7%. Health insurance costs have risen at higher rates than the increase in workers' wages. Health insurance rates accelerating after a decade of more modest increases likely reflects the growth of prices in the economy overall according to Matthew Ray, Associate Director of KFF's Health Care Marketplace Project. Ray added, \"people are also accessing healthcare more frequently after skimping on doctor visits and routine medical screenings during the Covid pandemic\".

The lawsuits were filed separately in New York, California, D.C and 11 other states and expand Chinese-owned TikTok's legal fight with US regulators while seeking new financial penalties against the company. The states accused TikTok of using intentionally addictive software, designed to keep children watching as long and often as possible and misrepresenting its content moderation effectiveness. The states say TikTok seeks to maximize the amount of time users spend on the app in order to target them with ads. And New York Attorney General, Letitia James, said \"young people are struggling with their mental health because of addictive social media platforms like TikTok\", in her words. TikTok said last week, \"it strongly disagrees with allegations that it fails to protect children\", saying that \"it has robust safeguards in place for teens and parents\". US Justice Department sued TikTok in August for allegedly failing to protect children's privacy on the app and other states previously sued TikTok for failing to protect children from harm.\n\n♦\n\nFrom podcasts to late night. Are we in a new era of conservative comedy? I spoke with USA TODAY, Congress Campaigns and Democracy reporter, Karissa Waddick, for more.\n\nKarissa, thank you so much for hopping back on the show.\n\nKarissa Waddick:\n\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Karissa, just starting here, how are some comedians finding really an audience with conservatives and who are some of the folks we're talking about here?\n\nKarissa Waddick:\n\nWe're thinking about Joe Rogan, Greg Gutfeld, who hosts a show on Fox News. He's one of the most popular late-night show hosts out there right now. And other podcasters too, like Theo Von. So that's the group we're thinking about. And their popularity has skyrocketed in the last four or so years as a lot of the mainstream comedians on TV, thinking like Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel, people like that, have leaned towards a more liberal leaning audience. There's been a gap for conservative leaning listeners and experts I spoke with said that these comedians, their comedy might not inherently be political all the time, but they've leaned into some of the more anti-woke and conservative stances that relate to conservative viewers.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Karissa, how are Donald Trump and the GOP really approaching this movement and are they leaning in and trying to build their base this way?\n\nKarissa Waddick:\n\nYeah, so Donald Trump is definitely paying attention to this movement. Trump has appeared on Gutfeld. He appeared in mid-September on the show and it was his first late-night show appearance since 2016. He's also been on Theo Von and has said that he's interested in appearing on Joe Rogan's podcast, though he hasn't appeared on that one.\n\nSo Trump and his allies understand the importance of this audience and they want to reach those listeners. They have been trying to gain more support with men and their base, and these platforms have a heavy audience of men, and so it's really important for them to reach those listeners.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKarissa, how is the growth of conservative comedy, this movement that we're talking about, really mirrored some of what we've previously seen on the left?\n\nKarissa Waddick:\n\nSo when you think about left-leaning comedy, one of the people that comes to mind is John Stewart. In the early two thousands, he became popular during the George W. Bush administration. He said the same thing as a lot of the conservative-leaning comedians do now, which is that their comedy isn't expressly ideological.\n\nStewart acknowledged that he had liberal biases, but he said that his goal was to make people laugh. But at the end of the day, his audience leaned more liberal and a lot of his comedy leaned into liberal viewpoints and many of the alumni of his show, we think of Stephen Colbert, we think of John Oliver. People like that have come to define comedy now and our major comedic figures who a lot of people listen to. And so the movement now of conservative-leaning comedy gaining viewership is similar.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd in terms of the tangible impact on this year and this year's election, what impact is all this having on the 2024 race?\n\nKarissa Waddick:\n\nWe all know too well that this race is going to be tight and every vote really counts. It'll be decided on hundreds of thousands of votes in a handful of states. And the two candidates are doing everything they can to reach voters where they are. Like I said, Trump is really focused on building his base with male support. These audiences are key to that. So reaching the viewers that these people have is important for them to cultivate that.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nKarissa Waddick covers Congress, Campaigns and Democracy for USA TODAY. Thank you, Karissa.\n\nKarissa Waddick:\n\nThanks so much.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nHow do perspectives on sex, money, climate change and politics divide generations in the US?

Wade: They’re not backing down.\n\nFrom Minnesota to California to Florida, more than a dozen protests are planned Monday to denounce the Supreme Court’s decision to eliminate the nearly 50-year-old federal constitutional right to have an abortion.\n\nThe fallout was swift: At least 10 states have effectively banned abortion since Friday’s ruling. And 26 states have laws indicating they could outlaw or set extreme limits on abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a research organization that supports abortion rights.\n\nActivists on both sides of the debate rallied in jubilation or devastation.\n\n“Old men, stop telling me what to do with my body,” read one protester’s sign in Washington, DC.\n\n“People’s bodies are more regulated than guns,” read another protester’s sign in Atlanta.\n\nOutside the Supreme Court, an elated Valentina Aaron held up a sign with an image of a fetus. “Forceps off my body,” the sign read.\n\n“It’s incredibly exciting,” Aaron said about the historic ruling. “If I was a baby in a womb, I would want someone to stand up for me.”\n\nBut nearby, abortion rights supporter Joseph Little held a sign saying, “Forced birth is enslavement.”\n\n“Making people give birth is enslavement,” Little told CNN. “When you tell people that they no longer have a voice in their own personal matters, that’s enslavement.

Officers pushed protesters and struck at least one person with batons, video from the scene shows.\n\n“Full House” actress Jodi Sweetin was pushed to the ground by an officer, video from the incident also shows. Sweetin got up and kept protesting, leading a chant of “No justice, no peace,” according to photojournalist and witness Michael Ade. Los Angeles police are aware of the video and the “force used will be evaluated against the LAPD’s policy and procedure,” the agency said in a statement.\n\nIn New York, at least 20 people were taken into custody with charges pending, police said.\n\nIn Greenville, South Carolina, at least six people were arrested at a rally Saturday, officials said. The rally included people protesting and supporting the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn Washington, DC, two people were arrested Saturday after they were accused of “throwing paint over the fence by the US Supreme Court,” US Capitol Police tweeted.\n\nIn Phoenix, about 1,200 people attended an abortion rights rally Saturday, the Arizona Department of Public Safety said. Four people were arrested late in the day after a fence around the House and Senate Plaza was torn down, the agency said.\n\nIn Lynchburg, Virginia, police are investigating the vandalism at a pregnancy center. The words, “If abortion ain’t safe you ain’t safe” were spray-painted near the entrance of the Blue Ridge Pregnancy Center, photos from police show. Security camera footage shows “four masked individuals committing the acts,” police said in a news release.\n\nThe facility did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. On Friday, the center shared its support of the Supreme Court decision on Facebook, writing: “Rejoicing with an overwhelmed heart of gratitude for the life affirming decisions that were made today.”\n\nStates ban abortion as others move to protect access\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling allowed states to immediately begin setting their own abortion policy, leaving people across the country with varying levels of access.\n\nSome states now have outright bans on abortions, with varying exceptions or none at all. They include Alabama, Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Utah and Wisconsin.\n\nStates with abortion bans that are expected to take effect in the coming days and weeks include Wyoming, Mississippi, Tennessee and Idaho.\n\nIn Arizona, abortion providers started canceling appointments immediately after Friday’s ruling. The state Senate Republican Caucus issued a memo demanding the state immediately enforce a pre-Roe law that bans most abortions unless the procedure is necessary to save the life of a mother.\n\nMeanwhile, some Democratic governors are trying to protect access to abortion.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Gov. Tony Evers said he’d fight “with every power we have” after his Republican-controlled state legislature declined to repeal the state’s 1849 law banning abortion, which is taking effect again following the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nIn California, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law Friday protecting non-California residents seeking reproductive health care in the state. It also protects anyone performing, assisting or receiving an abortion in the state from any potential civil action originating outside the state.\n\nGov. Tim Walz of Minnesota issued an executive order Saturday providing similar protections. “Our administration is doing everything we can to protect individuals’ right to make their own health care decisions,” Walz said in a statement.\n\nIn Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee promised to create a “sanctuary state” for reproductive choice for people across the country via an upcoming executive order. The order will direct state police not to comply with extradition efforts from other states seeking to penalize those who travel to Washington to get an abortion. Inslee did not specify when the executive order will be issued or when it will take effect.\n\nThe post-Roe legal battles have started\n\nShortly after Utah banned most abortions, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit claiming the newly enacted law violates civil liberties guaranteed in the state’s constitution – including the right to determine family composition and equal protection.\n\nIn the lawsuit, Planned Parenthood said the law will have a disparate impact on women as opposed to men and violates the right to bodily integrity, involuntary servitude, as well as the right to privacy.\n\nThe suit names the governor and the attorney general among the defendants.\n\nA judge on Monday evening granted a restraining order for 14 days, blocking the ban and allowing abortion services to resume.\n\nGov. Spencer Cox’s office did not immediately respond to CNN’s request Saturday for comment on the lawsuit nor the restraining order. Attorney General Sean Reyes’ office told CNN it had no comment on the lawsuit.\n\nUnder the ban, performing an abortion in Utah would be a second-degree felony in almost all cases, according to the lawsuit. Utah’s law allows for abortion if the mother’s health is in danger, there are uniformly diagnosable health conditions detected in the fetus or when the mother’s pregnancy is the result of rape or incest.\n\n“When the Act took effect, PPAU (Plaintiff Planned Parenthood Association of Utah) and its staff were forced to immediately stop performing abortions in Utah beyond those few that are permitted by the Act,” the lawsuit reads. “If relief is granted in this case, PPAU’s health centers would resume providing abortions that would not qualify for any of the Act’s exceptions.”\n\nAfter the restraining order was granted, the organization said the decision was a win but “only the first step in what will undoubtedly be a long and difficult fight. Planned Parenthood will always stand alongside our patients and providers – no matter what.”", "authors": ["Kelly Mccleary Holly Yan", "Kelly Mccleary", "Holly Yan"], "publish_date": "2022/06/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/12/20/palm-beach-county-schools-may-join-lawsuit-against-meta-others/71920316007/", "title": "PBC schools are likely to join lawsuit against Meta, parent company ...", "text": "Palm Beach County's school district is among more than a dozen in Florida and 650 across the country that intend to sue Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, and other social media giants for what they say was a systematic targeting of children with products designed to become addictive.\n\nOn Wednesday, Dec. 13, the school board voted to hire four law firms to evaluate whether a civil lawsuit against major social media companies could succeed.

Then it went 'bankrupt.'", "text": "Beth Schwartzapfel\n\nThe Marshall Project\n\nThis article was published in partnership with The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization covering the U.S. criminal justice system.\n\nIn 2020, Jonathan Arther sued a dozen state officials and employees of the Arizona prison where, he says, his medical care was bungled so badly that he went blind in one eye. He also sued Corizon Health Inc., the private, for-profit medical contractor that the state had hired to provide care in the prison where Arther was serving time for a DUI conviction.\n\nA few weeks ago, his wife got an email offering the couple $5,000 to settle the lawsuit — an offer she found insulting. The email said there was likely not enough money to cover all the legal claims against Corizon, and the couple could take the small lump sum instead of continuing to fight in court.\n\nThere are more than 100 people like Arther, who argue the medical care they received from Corizon while they were incarcerated was negligent, or worse, and are now dealing with the fallout of the company’s complicated bankruptcy. Attorneys last month announced they had reached a tentative settlement deal in the bankruptcy and expected to bring the terms to the court next week, but the details won’t become public until that happens. Until then, the people who sued Corizon are left to wonder what compensation they’ll receive, if any.\n\nThat’s because Corizon, a company that provided healthcare in prisons and jails across the country, moved most of its debts to a new company called Tehum Care Services that then declared bankruptcy, in a controversial corporate restructuring known as a “Texas Two-Step.” Then, Corizon executives created another company to do business under a new name — YesCare — a move that critics say could allow Corizon to minimize its liability. In fact, YesCare inked a contract worth more than $1 billion in Alabama, even as Corizon’s creditors may be left empty-handed.\n\nTehum, the bankrupt new company created in the maneuver, owes more than $82 million to over 1,000 creditors, including former patients who were injured or neglected, former employees who were hurt on the job, hospitals, doctors’ offices, cities and states. Almost all of Corizon’s assets — worth more than $170 million, according to court papers — went to YesCare, which continues to provide healthcare at prisons and jails.\n\n“These guys are playing hide-and-go-seek with all the money,” said Michael Crawford, the attorney for the wife of a man who died in Arizona prisons when, his family says, he was left unattended by Corizon medical staff in bed for so long that he developed bed sores that became infected by his feces. He ultimately died of septic shock. His family also got an offer of $5,000 to settle its suit.\n\nTehum’s top executives and attorney did not reply to multiple emails. In court documents, the company said that the Texas Two-Step (known in the business world as a “divisional merger”) was “the fairest, most value-maximizing path forward” for Corizon’s creditors. Without the maneuver, liquidating the company would have led to them receiving “pennies on the dollar” in some cases or nothing at all, YesCare said in a court filing.\n\nBut there are big questions about whether Tehum really is insolvent, or, as its creditors allege, is instead taking advantage of the bankruptcy system to avoid paying its debts. A recent article by Business Insider revealed a tangled web of companies — including both YesCare and Tehum — co-owned or managed by a small, secretive group of people who would benefit if the bankruptcy goes ahead. In a lawsuit, a former Corizon executive who was forced out called the merger “an old-fashioned bankruptcy fraud scheme — taking assets and avoiding liabilities, while draining coffers into their own pockets,” Business Insider reported.\n\nFilings in the bankruptcy reviewed by The Marshall Project reveal the breadth of people and companies who say Tehum now owes them money. The cases are at varying stages, from people who had recently notified the courts that they intended to sue, to those who survived years of legal challenges and were set for trial, to those who went to trial and won.\n\nThe bankruptcy proceedings put them all on pause indefinitely. There’s a man who, while incarcerated in a Tennessee special needs prison, had a sexual relationship with his Corizon mental health counselor, which, “as an inmate and mental health patient,” he was “unable to give consent for,” according to his lawsuit. The counselor later admitted the inappropriate relationship to the state health department when she agreed to surrender her counseling license. There’s also a man who entered the Arizona prison system healthy, but stopped being able to walk, couldn’t tolerate light and became confused and incontinent. His lawsuit argues that Corizon employees waited months to send him to the hospital, where, by the time he was diagnosed with Valley Fever and meningitis, it had already done permanent damage to his brain and spine.\n\nThe bankruptcy does not just affect prisoners and their families. The list of creditors includes hundreds of former Corizon employees who filed over $1 million in claims with the court over unpaid workers compensation and sick and vacation days. Still other employees were left on the hook for fees and judgements they expected Corizon to cover.\n\n“Corizon failed to pay the attorneys that were hired to defend us. It has been a nightmare for our family, to say the least,” Ashley Goetterman, the wife of a former Corizon nurse in a Michigan county jail, told The Marshall Project.\n\nWade Jones died in 2018 from alcohol withdrawal — a condition that is very rarely fatal, if treated — while serving a five-day sentence in the Kent County jail for a misdemeanor. Earlier this year, a jury found that Chad Goetterman and two other nurses employed by Corizon at the jail were “deliberately indifferent” to the 40-year-old’s pain and suffering and awarded his family more than $6 million.\n\nThe bankruptcy means the company has not paid the deductible on the nurses’ liability insurance, leaving them personally exposed. The law firm that represented the nurses in Jones’ suit and others also says Corizon owes more than $840,000 for its work.\n\nCorizon was, for a time, the nation’s largest for-profit provider of correctional healthcare, operating in more than 50 facilities in 27 states. Corizon’s fortunes changed in recent years. Between 2016 and 2021, the company lost more than 25 contracts, amid lawsuits alleging subpar care. “Years of mounting costs, including litigation expenses relating to claims asserted by incarcerated individuals, threatened Corizon Health’s ability to continue as a going concern,” YesCare wrote in a court filing last year.\n\nThe divisional merger, created by Texas lawmakers decades ago, allows a company to split into two or more companies. In the 2010s, corporations began pairing the maneuver with bankruptcy to create the Texas Two-Step: Step one, divide the company and distribute most of its assets into one company and most of its debts to the other. Step two, the indebted company declares bankruptcy while the solvent company continues to do business. About a half-dozen companies have reportedly used the Texas Two-Step, but all of those attempts remain tied up in litigation.\n\nTehum’s creditors have tried to pursue YesCare’s money in court, arguing that the two companies are the same in practice, if not on paper, but YesCare has pushed back, saying it is a completely separate company from Corizon and not responsible for Tehum’s debts. The creditors point out that almost all of Corizon’s employees, equipment and contracts are now part of YesCare. And YesCare’s website describes Corizon’s past work as its own. “Over 40 years, the YesCare team has provided quality healthcare services to clients at more than 475 facilities serving over 1,000,000 patients across the nation,” it reads, although YesCare was incorporated last year.\n\nA spokesperson for YesCare did not respond to a detailed list of questions.\n\nMuch of Corizon’s debt appears to be the result of not paying its bills. There are hundreds of claims worth tens of millions of dollars from hospitals, dentists, radiologists and others to whom Corizon sent prisoners who needed specialty care. There’s a bill from an orthopedic supply company in Dallas for $152.93 and one from a hospital in Missouri for $6.9 million.\n\nThe state of Arizona is one of more than a dozen government entities that say Corizon’s Texas Two-Step left them on the hook for bills Corizon promised to pay. Corizon’s contracts commonly included an “indemnity clause” that said Corizon or its insurance policies would cover the costs of any lawsuits or judgments stemming from their care. The city of St. Louis, for instance, says Corizon didn’t cover the $515,000 it was forced to pay to the family of a man who died after a stay in the county jail. Corizon’s “refusal to indemnify the city in the lawsuit was baseless and in bad faith,” the city said in court filings.\n\nFor now, Tehum’s bankruptcy is making its way through the federal court system. Attorneys for some of the company’s creditors are arguing that the Texas Two-Step amounted to fraud, urging the court to unwind the divisional merger and make YesCare’s money available to Corizon’s creditors. The $5,000 offer letters that Arther and Crawford’s client received were part of negotiations between Tehum and one of Corizon’s insurance companies, which covered only certain lawsuits in Arizona. In August, Tehum announced that it had reached a tentative deal with a committee representing all of its creditors. The details are not yet public, but Business Insider reported if the deal goes through, Tehum will provide around $30 million to cover all of its outstanding claims. After attorneys’ fees, that will leave around $20 million for creditors.\n\nThis would amount to pennies on the dollar for most of the prisoners and former Corizon employees with claims, says Valrey Earley, a bankruptcy attorney representing a prisoner in Alabama who lived in her own fecal matter for months because, she said, Corizon staff at her prison did not provide her the proper supplies after abdominal surgery.\n\nThe people in Arizona who received the $5,000 offer, like Brandi Arther, say it’s not nearly enough. After her husband Jonathan’s scheduled release from prison in 2027, the couple’s lives will be forever changed by his inability to drive or do the kind of warehouse work he used to do without his peripheral vision.\n\n“You’re holding Jonathan responsible for what he’s done. Why wouldn’t you hold them responsible? What makes them above the law?” Brandi Arther said. “Because they know a loophole, they get to walk away with clean hands. All they’re going to do is start another business and start all over again.”\n\nThis article was published in partnership with The Marshall Project, a nonprofit news organization covering the U.S. criminal justice system.

But now, even as National Library Week arrives this week, the attempt to limit what materials are available to young people is spilling out from the classroom into the library.\n\nThough battles over access to controversial titles traditionally have been fought district by district, and even school by school, Republican-controlled states including Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Texas are now pushing statewide rules that make it easier for critics to remove books they dislike from school libraries in every community.\n\nAt the same time, although none have yet passed, more red states are seriously debating proposals that would make it easier for critics to force the removal of books even from public libraries serving the adult population.\n\n“The primary target still is school libraries and school librarians, K-12 teachers, but we are seeing this bleed over to public libraries,” says Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American Library Association.\n\nTo the conservatives pushing this agenda, these new restrictions on libraries – like the parallel red-state laws limiting certain discussions in the classroom – are a means of protecting parental rights.\n\n“Parents want education for their kids: They are not interested in indoctrination through the school system,” DeSantis argued late last month when signing a bill facilitating efforts to remove books from school libraries.\n\nBut to a wide array of civil rights, civil liberties and free expression groups, these restrictions represent an effort to enshrine the values of one particular group of parents – conservative Whites – over the priorities and experiences of an increasingly diverse society in which kids of color now compose a clear majority of the public school student body nationwide.\n\nThere is an overarching trend here of interference with the right to learn and the right to access information. Vera Eidelman, a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union's Speech, Privacy and Technology Project\n\nThe parallel battles over how teachers address race, gender and sexual orientation and how libraries regulate access to books represent the broadest attempt to limit what students are taught since the “loyalty oath” demands on teachers during the red scare period of the 1950s, or even the “Scopes trial”-era laws banning the teaching of evolution during the 1920s.\n\n“There is an overarching trend here of interference with the right to learn and the right to access information,” says Vera Eidelman a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union’s Speech, Privacy and Technology Project. On both fronts, she says, critics are “targeting the same set of viewpoints and experiences and aspects of education,” primarily materials relating to race, gender roles and the experiences of LGBTQ individuals.\n\n‘Parallel movements’\n\nThe torrent of laws approved in Republican-controlled states since 2021 to limit how teachers can discuss race, gender or sexual orientation has been part of a much broader current. Since the 2020 election, the 23 states in which Republicans control both the governorship and the state legislature have approved a surge of statutes restricting abortion rights, making it more difficult to vote, barring transgender girls and women from participating in grade school or college sports, banning transgender care for minors and increasing penalties for public protest. Cumulatively, as I’ve written, these proliferating red-state measures constitute an attempt to reverse what legal analysts call the “rights revolution” of roughly the past 60 years, in which Congress and the Supreme Court have generally expanded the circle of basic civil rights and liberties guaranteed to all Americans and reduced the ability of states to curtail those rights.\n\nCritics of the new wave of red-state measures see an especially powerful through line connecting the laws that make it more difficult to vote and increase the legal penalties for disruptive public protest with the bills that censor classroom instruction or empower critics to ban books in school libraries. All three thrusts make it more difficult for opponents to mobilize opposition to the agenda the red-state Republicans are advancing.\n\n“There are parallel movements across voting rights and protest rights and education rights,” says Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education at PEN America, a free-speech group founded by prominent authors. “In each case, you have a kind of flowering of experimentation of legislation to see what kind of things can fit to make it harder for people to vote, to make it more costly to protest and what would make it harder to access information in school.”\n\nThe restrictions on classroom teaching have exploded across the red states since 2021. Jeffrey Sachs, a political scientist at Acadia University in Nova Scotia who tracks these proposals for PEN America, counts at least 13 Republican-controlled states that have approved laws censoring how teachers talk about “divisive concepts,” such as systematic racial inequity, and five more states with GOP governors that have imposed administrative limits on such teachings through state boards of education or other bodies.\n\nThe conservatives pushing these bills portray them as a necessary barrier against liberal attempts to “indoctrinate” students through concepts such as critical race theory, an academic analysis of systemic discrimination, or the 1619 Project, a New York Times project that stressed the impact of slavery on American society. At a recent event with DeSantis, Alicia Farrant, a mother and school board candidate in Orange County, Florida, described her state’s version of these proposals as proof that parents “will not cower to the divisive agendas that are infiltrating our public schools in order to corrupt and destroy the educational foundations of our great nation.”\n\nThis wave does not appear to have crested. The Florida legislation barring discussion of sexual orientation in the youngest grades and limiting it in older grades has spawned copycat bills in other Republican-controlled states. More states are also considering laws that would extend the classroom censorship to public colleges and universities. Other GOP-controlled states, including Missouri, are considering their own bills on race and gender, and some of the states that have already passed such laws are doubling back with new proposals – such as a proposed amendment to the state constitution in Arizona to ban the teaching of critical race theory.\n\n“The level of focus and unity of language that we are seeing across all of these different bills is pretty extraordinary,” Sachs says. “There is an incredible amount of overlap, down to the punctuation of these bills, so we can definitely consider this a national campaign and not one that is responding to the specific context of each state.”\n\nPublic libraries are not immune\n\nThis campaign has developed so much momentum that it has overflowed the classroom to reach the library – particularly those in schools, but now also, for the first time, lapping at the doors of those that serve the public.\n\nIn recent decades, these fights have unfolded mostly locally, with challenges to specific books at individual libraries. Those fights are clearly intensifying: On Monday, the American Library Association reported that in 2021 it had recorded 729 such efforts to ban books at school or public libraries, the most since it began cataloging these efforts in 2000. The most-challenged books, the group reported, were from Black or LGBTQ authors or centered on characters from those communities.\n\nBut this struggle is also expanding to a new level, with multiplying red-state efforts to create statewide policies designed to lead to the removal of more books. In Texas, for instance, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott is pressuring school boards to remove what he calls “pornography” from school libraries. Abbott’s letter followed a more detailed complaint from a Republican state legislator who sent districts a letter inquiring about the presence of 850 books, including several by prominent Black or LGBTQ authors.\n\nIn Florida, DeSantis signed a bill late last month that requires school libraries to post more information about their collections and seek community input on materials they acquire. Most importantly, the new law requires the state Department of Education to collect and publish a report on which books have been removed in any district across the state.\n\nAt the bill-signing ceremony, DeSantis said these provisions would ensure that students are exposed only to age-appropriate books. The new measures will increase schools’ “ability to choose what is appropriate for different age groups,” he argued. “Parents are going to have the ability to have their voices heard.”\n\nBut opponents of the legislation say the requirement for the state Education Department to publish a list of books removed in any district provides a road map for critics to demand the removal of such books in all districts.\n\nFlorida, as is the case with many of the cultural flashpoints now dominating red-state legislatures, has moved fastest and furthest. But Georgia’s Republican-controlled legislature last week passed its own bill facilitating challenges to books in school libraries; measures targeting school libraries have also passed one chamber in the GOP-controlled legislatures in Kansas and Tennessee, though they face uncertain prospects of final approval. Similarly motivated bills have surfaced in Nebraska and Oklahoma as well.\n\nIn another escalation to the book wars, red state proposals are now emerging to ease the removal of books even in public libraries serving the adult, as well as the youth, population. These proposals generally would strip away the protection for librarians (and educators) from state obscenity laws, allowing officials to criminally charge librarians if they stock materials that a prosecutor considers obscene.\n\nWe all live in diverse communities these days … and we firmly believe that as public institutions, both public libraries and public school libraries need to serve the needs of everyone and reflect everyone’s lives in the library collection. Deborah Caldwell-Stone, director of the Office for Intellectual Freedom at the American Library Association\n\nRepublican legislators have introduced bills to eliminate those protections in more than half a dozen states, according to the American Library Association’s tracking. None have yet passed into law, though one has cleared the state House in Idaho. Yet given the pace at which ideas once on the fringe, such as bans on gender-affirming health care for transgender minors, are advancing through the red states, Caldwell-Stone says the library association is “deeply concerned that one of these bills will eventually pass and will be used as a means of both intimidating librarians or actually charging them with crimes – based on this falsehood that mainstream materials, published by mainstream publishers, are somehow illegal speech unprotected by the First Amendment.”\n\nLast fall, a library faced such an investigation in Campbell County, Wyoming, after a local church complained about the presence of LGBTQ and sexual education materials there; a special prosecutor appointed by the county ultimately decided not to press charges.\n\nAll these confrontations underscore the cultural chasm between increasingly diverse younger generations and the socially conservative, predominantly White and Christian, Republican coalition that holds power in the red states. Children of color have constituted a majority of the public school K-12 student body since 2014, according to federal statistics, and now make up nearly 55% of the total. Gallup recently reported that 1 in 5 members of Generation Z, as well as 1 in 10 millennials, identify as LGBTQ, far more than in older generations. And the Public Religion Research Institute has found that more than a third of young adults identify as secular, without affiliation with any organized religion.\n\nSupporters of the efforts to restrict classroom teaching and/or ban books, by contrast, often cite a threat to “traditional” morality as a justification. When DeSantis signed the bill easing challenges to school library collections, one of the speakers he brought to the podium was a mother who had been prominent in protests against school masking requirements in Volusia County. She said her concern about school libraries was prompted in part by a picture book called “Red: A Crayon’s Story,” in which a crayon labeled red discovers that it’s really blue. The mother, Rebecca Sarwi, said she objected to “subliminal messaging for kids that young” that “normalizes them to believe” that they may be “something other than the unique individual that God created them to be.”\n\nServing ‘the needs of everyone’\n\nSuch arguments highlight what may be the core issue in this intensifying dispute: Though the classroom and library restrictions are being portrayed as an effort to strengthen “parents’ rights,” in practice they mean giving one set of parents a veto over educational content not only for their own kids, but others’ as well.\n\nLibrarians “don’t disagree with parents who want to guide their children’s readings … but they stand firmly opposed to one family dictating what is available to everyone else in a school library or a public library,” Caldwell-Stone told me. “We all live in diverse communities these days … and we firmly believe that as public institutions, both public libraries and public school libraries need to serve the needs of everyone and reflect everyone’s lives in the library collection.”\n\nPolls have generally found broad skepticism about the new classroom and library restrictions. A recent CBS survey found that more than four-fifths of Americans opposed banning books because they criticized American history or discussed race. A recent Grinnell College national poll found more than 70% of Americans trusted school officials to decide what materials were appropriate for their libraries. In a recent CNN poll, only about 1 in 6 adults thought parents should have the principal say on how race is taught in schools.\n\nOne element is these (conservative) parents vs. all the other parents, and the other is the parents vs. the students. I don’t think it’s at all clear parents have rights to prevent their children from being exposed to the world. Jonathan Friedman, director of free expression and education at PEN America\n\nOpponents of the restrictive measures are trying to organize greater resistance to them. Red Wine and Blue, a nationwide group of suburban Democratic-leaning women fighting the red-state proposals, has organized a nationwide “read-in” of banned books on Thursday hosted by Dolly Parton’s sister Stella that features the authors of targeted books such as “I Am Rosa Parks” and “Heather Has Two Mommies.” That same day, a House Oversight and Reform subcommittee is holding a hearing on the book ban efforts, which could signal a turn toward greater attention to the issue from national Democrats.\n\n“After a long time of banging my head on the kitchen counter, I do feel like there’s progress and we are seeing some results,” says Katie Paris, Red Wine and Blue’s founder.\n\nParis says thousands of women have gone through the group’s training, which is designed to counter the organizing of the conservative organizations supporting the restrictions, such as Moms for Liberty. Though the number of proposed book bans continues to rise, Paris says, a smaller share of them have been approved in recent months by districts or school administrators, according to the group’s figures. In several cases, others note, students themselves are taking a more visible role in opposing these measures – as in the widespread walkouts in Florida against the “don’t say gay” bill and a lawsuit brought by Missouri students against a book ban in their school.\n\n“One element is these (conservative) parents vs. all the other parents, and the other is the parents vs. the students,” says Friedman. “I don’t think it’s at all clear parents have rights to prevent their children from being exposed to the world.”\n\nStill, even with occasional setbacks, the drive to control the flow of information to young people is demonstrating enormous energy in red states. With Congress unlikely to pass any national legislation combating this trend, opponents’ best chance to slow the tide are legal challenges, some of which are already working through the courts. In the 1982 Pico decision upholding the First Amendment rights of students, the Supreme Court ruled, as the ACLU’s Eidelman puts it, “schools cannot remove books from their shelves merely because they disagree with the ideas expressed in those books.”\n\nYet many observers note it’s unclear whether this more conservative Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority would uphold that standard. What is clear is that more of the red states appear intent on testing the boundaries of what the Supreme Court will allow through new laws facilitating the banning of books from school, or potentially even public, libraries.\n\n“This is one of the key characteristics of the era in which we live,” says Paris. “I think we’ve had to learn there are no bounds. That is what makes this a fight for democracy. This isn’t just a culture war sideshow.”", "authors": ["Ronald Brownstein"], "publish_date": "2022/04/05"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/12/22/tech/tiktok-bytedance-journalist-data/index.html", "title": "TikTok confirms that journalists' data was accessed by employees of ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nTikTok parent company ByteDance has fired four employees who improperly accessed the personal data of two journalists on the platform, TikTok spokesperson Brooke Oberwetter confirmed to CNN Thursday.\n\nTikTok user data from the two journalists, who worked for the Financial Times and BuzzFeed, was accessed while ByteDance employees were investigating potential employee leaks to the press, according to the company. The employees involved, two based in the United States and two in China, were fired following an investigation conducted on behalf of the company by an outside law firm, the CEOs of TikTok and ByteDance revealed to employees in two separate emails Thursday.\n\nThe personal data accessed from the journalists’ accounts included IP addresses, according to the spokesperson. IP addresses can provide information about a user’s location.\n\n“The individuals involved misused their authority to obtain access to TikTok user data,” TikTok CEO Shou Chew said in his email to employees, according to an excerpt of the email reviewed by CNN. “This is unacceptable.”\n\nThe disclosure could further inflame the scrutiny TikTok is facing in the United States over national security concerns given its ties to China. US lawmakers have raised concerns about the security of user data and the ability for the company’s Chinese employees to access information about US TikTok users.\n\nThe criticism ramped up earlier this year after a BuzzFeed News report said some US user data has been repeatedly accessed from China, and cited one employee who allegedly said that “everything is seen in China.” TikTok, for its part, has confirmed US user data can be accessed by some employees in China, but the company says that a US-based security team decides who can access US user data from China.\n\nIn October, Forbes reported that ByteDance planned to use TikTok data to surveil certain US citizens. In a Thursday report, Forbes named three journalists who had been tracked by the company. (TikTok declined to comment on whether a third journalist had indeed been affected.) The New York Times also reported that several of the journalists’ contacts on TikTok had also gotten wrapped up in the tracking, which the company declined to confirm.\n\n“The misconduct of these individuals, who are no longer employed at ByteDance, was an egregious misuse of their authority to obtain access to user data,” Oberwetter said in a statement Thursday. “This misbehavior is unacceptable, and not in line with our efforts across TikTok to earn the trust of our users.”\n\nIn response to the incident, TikTok said it has restructured its internal audit and risk teams, and removed access to US user data for those teams, according to the spokesperson. “We take data security incredibly seriously, and we will continue to enhance our access protocols, which have already been significantly improved and hardened since this incident took place,” Oberwetter said.\n\nThe Financial Times said that “spying on reporters, interfering with their work or intimidating their sources is completely unacceptable. We’ll be investigating this story more fully before deciding our formal response,” according to a statement included in a report from the newspaper.\n\nA spokesperson for BuzzFeed said in a statement to CNN that it is “deeply disturbed” by the disclosure, calling it a “blatant disregard for the privacy and rights of journalists as well as TikTok users.”\n\n“It’s even more troubling that this comes in the wake of a series of reports by BuzzFeed News that exposed major issues within its parent company, from employees accessing American users’ data from China to ByteDance’s attempts to push pro-China messaging to Americans,” the BuzzFeed spokesperson said.\n\nMore than a dozen states, including Maryland, South Dakota and Texas, have announced bans in recent weeks of TikTok for state employees on government-issued devices, and a small but growing number of universities are also blocking access to TikTok on school-owned devices or WiFi networks. The Senate earlier this week passed a bill to ban TikTok from all US government devices. And a trio of lawmakers has introduced legislation aimed at banning the short-form video app from operating in the United States.\n\nTikTok is currently engaged in longstanding negotiations with the US government on a potential deal to address national security concerns and let the app continue serving US customers. It has also said it has taken steps to isolate US user data from other parts of its business, including through a partnership with US-based Oracle.\n\n“No matter what the cause or the outcome was, this misguided investigation seriously violated the company’s Code of Conduct and is condemned by the company,” ByteDance CEO Rubo Liang said in the Thursday email to employees. “We simply cannot take integrity risks that damage the trust of our users, employees, and stakeholders.”", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}]}

All he needed to do was win, and he did, just as he’s done every time he’s played a Grand Slam match this season, whether on the hard courts of the Australian Open, the red clay of the French Open, the grass of Wimbledon or, now, the first of what he hopes will be seven times on the hard courts of Flushing Meadows.\n\nQuickly regaining control after a second-set blip, then wearing down his cramping foe, Djokovic beat Danish qualifier Holger Vitus Nodskov Rune 6-1, 6-7 (5), 6-2, 6-1 in Arthur Ashe Stadium to reach the second round.\n\n“It wasn't the best of my performances,” Djokovic acknowledged, “but at the same time, he played well in the second set when it mattered.”\n\nWhat a difference between the two players. Djokovic is 34; Rune 18. Djokovic is ranked No. 1; Rune 145th. Djokovic owns 20 Grand Slam titles, the men’s mark he currently shares with rivals Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, who both withdrew from the U.S. Open with injuries; Rune had never played a single match in the main draw of a major tournament until Tuesday. Djokovic’s on-court career earnings entering this week were more than $150 million; Rune’s were less than $150,000.\n\nRune came in on a 13-match winning streak, built on the lower-level ATP Challenger Tour and the qualifying rounds in New York. And the crowd — back at the U.S. Open after all fans were banned last year because of the coronavirus pandemic — gave him some serious backing, responding to his pumped fists and uppercuts and pleas for more noise when he was playing at his best level in the second set.\n\nWhat at first sounded like booing was actually “Rune-ing,” and the kid clearly loved the moment. So did his mother, clapping and smiling in his guest box, which also included Patrick Mouratoglou, Serena Williams’ coach. Rune has trained at Mouratoglou’s tennis academy.\n\nWilliams came so close to going 4 for 4 at the majors in 2015, before losing in the semifinals at the U.S. Open against Roberta Vinci in one of the biggest upsets in tennis history. Had Djokovic lost this, it would have been even more of a stunner.\n\nEarlier on Day Two, the top-seeded woman, Ash Barty, made a successful return to Flushing Meadows, the site of one of the two Grand Slam tournaments she has yet to win.\n\nThe biggest holdup for Barty during her 6-1, 7-6 (7) victory over 2010 U.S. Open runner-up Vera Zvonareva came early in the first set, when there was a delay of more than five minutes because the Hawk-Eye Live electronic line-calling system went down when a TV camera wasn’t working.\n\n“Just needed to make sure all cameras were spot on, and just, I think, plug one back in,” said Barty, the champion at the French Open in 2019 and Wimbledon this July but never past the fourth round at the U.S. Open, “and we were all right to go.”\n\nShe missed the tournament in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic; she remained at home in Australia for most of the season after the outbreak.\n\nThis year, for the first time, every match on every court these two weeks is operating without any line judges. Instead, the only human officiating is the chair umpire, while every shot is ruled in or out by a system that uses cameras to detect where balls land.\n\nLast year, the U.S. Open first tried relying on solely electronic calls for each match except those played at the biggest two arenas, Ashe and Louis Armstrong Stadium, where people made the rulings. It was during a fourth-round match in Ashe against Pablo Carreño Busta that Djokovic was defaulted after dropping a game in the first set when he smacked a ball that inadvertently hit a line judge in the throat.\n\nCarreño Busta, who eventually made the semifinals in New York for the second time and then beat Djokovic for the bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics this August, was a surprise first-round loser Tuesday. He was eliminated 5-7, 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 (7) by Maxime Cressy, a Paris-born American ranked 151st.\n\nCressy played college tennis at UCLA, as did Mackie McDonald, the American who defeated No. 27 seed David Goffin in straight sets.\n\nIn other action, the two Olympic tennis singles gold medalists won: Germany’s Alexander Zverev extended his winning streak to 12 matches with a 6-4, 7-5, 6-2 victory over Sam Querrey, and Switzerland’s Belinda Bencic beat Arantxa Rus 6-4, 6-4.\n\n“I hope I can keep the level up and maybe even play better,” said Zverev, the runner-up at the U.S. Open last year, “because to beat Novak here is going to be an extremely difficult task.”\n\n___\n\nMore AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/tennis/2019/06/04/choreography-comes-to-clay-no-replay-review-at-french-open/39542961/", "title": "Choreography comes to clay: No replay review at French Open", "text": "AP\n\nPARIS (AP) — There's a bit of choreography on clay whenever a player disagrees with a line call at the French Open.\n\nThe ball lands. The aggrieved player winces and squints at the spot, then scrapes the clay with a racket to underline the mark. The player stands in place, hands on hips, waiting. The chair umpire clambers down to the court, speed-walks over to locate the mark, thinks about it, then renders judgment — by holding an index finger aloft to indicate \"Out\" or holding a palm flat to indicate \"In.\" Sometimes, an argument ensues.\n\nHappens every match, it seems. More than once, usually. The whole dance can take mere seconds. Or last several minutes. Or change the complexion of a match entirely, such Martina Hingis' infamous meltdown against Steffi Graf in the 1999 French Open final, 20 years ago Wednesday.\n\nIt's unique in Grand Slam tennis to Roland Garros, because the other three major tournaments use the Hawk-Eye review system during matches, the way most sports have embraced this sort of thing. The thinking goes: Unlike on the hard courts at the U.S. Open and Australian Open, or the grass courts at Wimbledon, balls leave an indelible imprint on the red dirt, so let's dispense with any technological assistance and instead just check the mark with our own eyes.\n\nOld-fashioned? Yes. Less than perfect? Of course. Which is why some players are calling for clay tournaments — the French Open, which concludes Sunday, in particular — to make this pas de deux a relic of the past and give chair umpires and line judges some help. After all, television broadcasters often show viewers what Hawk-Eye would have determined.\n\n\"They use it for the TV,\" 2011 U.S. Open champion Sam Stosur said, \"so why can't you use it for us?\"\n\nStill, no one should expect a change anytime soon.\n\n\"Of course we've thought about it. Technology is something every sport should use, as much as possible,\" tournament director Guy Forget said in an interview.\n\n\"If we don't use it — and I don't think we ever will — it's ... because, historically, we've been judging the course of a ball and where it lands on the court by the mark it leaves on the clay,\" Forget said. \"Would you like to have a court with no chair umpire, no linesmen, just electronic line-calling? Is that something we really want in the future? I think we'd miss something.\"\n\nThere's the human element.\n\nThe theater of it all.\n\nA certain je ne sais quoi that makes the French Open stand apart from other majors.\n\nAnd yet ...\n\n\"I am 100 percent for having replay. They should use it,\" said Chris Evert, who won seven of her 18 major trophies in Paris. \"Because of the way they sweep the lines on clay courts, sometimes you can't see for sure if the ball hit the line or not. I also think that some chair umpires vary. They all view whether it's in or out differently. I'm not calling them cheaters, of course, but it doesn't look sometimes like it's all the way out but they go, 'Out.'\"\n\nThis is not a new concern. Back in 2013, for example, Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine was fined $2,000 for pulling out his cell phone during a first-round loss at the French Open to snap a photo of a mark he thought was misjudged.\n\nBut the chorus seems to be louder now, because of the perception that there have been \"so many mistakes from the umpires this year,\" said Borna Coric, a Croatian seeded 13th at Roland Garros.\n\nAll non-clay ATP tournaments are required to use electronic line-calling; the statistics kept by the men's tour show that the number of calls reversed on review has been between 28-29% in each of the past five years, including in 2019. At last year's U.S. Open, the figure for all events was 29.1%.\n\nCould simply be a result of more and more players posting on social media when they believe a ruling was wrong.\n\n\"It's something I'm really trying to push for, because I feel like there's way too many controversial calls. There's so many close calls from day-to-day, from every match,\" said Denis Shapovalov, a Canadian seeded 20th in Paris. \"Sometimes, just, the call is so close, it's impossible to call it. You need a system to have justice.\"\n\nThe main objection voiced by Forget and others is whether Hawk-Eye, which has a tiny margin of error, would be accurate enough on clay courts, where the crushed brick gets blown by the air or kicked around by players' feet and covers lines. And there are, to be sure, players who are just fine with the status quo.\n\nUsually, the discussion wraps up quite quickly, such as on the very last point of three-time major champion Stan Wawrinka's 5-plus-hour victory Sunday, when his backhand barely landed in, grazing the outside edge of the sideline. He had to wait to celebrate.\n\n\"I was just hoping that the umpire would confirm it,\" Wawrinka said. \"So I was, (for) half a second, not sure.\"\n\nThat's nothing compared to the 4½-minute delay over a disputed serve during 2009 U.S. Open champion Juan Martin del Potro's third-round win over Jordan Thompson on Saturday.\n\nAs spectators whistled derisively or jeered, the scene devolved into a sort of existential debate — best had over an espresso and a cigarette, perhaps — about, essentially, what the definition of \"line\" is and whether, as chair umpire Manuel Absolu posited, one can \"imagine there is a mark.\"\n\n\"There are so many arguments ... just like that one,\" Thompson said. \"If we had Hawk-Eye, it would have been over in 20 seconds, and we would have been back playing.\"\n\n___\n\nAP Sports Writer Andrew Dampf contributed.\n\n___\n\nMore AP Tennis: https://www.apnews.com/apf-Tennis and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2018/01/19/2018-olympics-could-computer-hacks-produce-wrong-winners-betsy-cooper-column/1040288001/", "title": "Could computer hacks produce wrong winners at the 2018 Olympics?", "text": "Betsy Cooper\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nImagine if, at next month’s 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics, the women’s figure skating competition were to be halted mid-event.

Security firm McAfee recently reported that hackers are targeting organizations affiliated with the Winter Olympics, including hockey teams and infrastructure providers. With the increased digitization of major sporting events, the risks are only increasing.\n\nMore:Fifty miles from North Korea, a Winter Olympics that could ease tensions\n\nMore:2018: What could possibly go wrong? Five possibilities.\n\nMany events at the upcoming Winter Olympics will rely on digital technology as part of competition. Speed skaters start their race at the sound of an electronic smart pistol, wear transponders around their ankles for accurate lap-timing, and have their photo-finishes captured at 10,000 frames per second. Bobsledding teams use wireless sensors to measure speed and angular velocity instantaneously during races, and alpine skiers push off for their runs through a Snowgate, which officially records their start time when the gate reaches a precise angle.\n\nThis turn toward technology in sports is not surprising given the many potential benefits of digital scoring systems, which can detect outcomes more accurately, and give officials flexibility to focus on other aspects of the event. But the risks are also significant. Hackers have already tried to use major sporting events to their advantage. Last year, it was revealed that attackers tried to hold NFL player data for ransom. Olympic athletes already know this story all too well; in 2016, Russian hackers released sensitive health care data on many of the top Rio Olympics stars.\n\nOur research suggests that, at the same time the push for digitization is increasing, cyber-attacks have the potential not just to reveal sensitive data, but to threaten the integrity of sporting event results themselves. Gamblers are among those who could benefit from sports result manipulation, as are nations that draw pride from their teams’ victories. Moreover, because sporting events have so many possible attack surfaces, any incident will breed deep uncertainty.\n\nThe concern is ripe precisely because so many Olympic sports are integrating digital systems into scoring. For example, international gymnastics officials have reported that they plan to pilot 3-D laser software as a scoring aid at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. Meanwhile, both track and field and swimming use digital systems to determine false starts and identify who finishes first; and major tennis matches commonly use the Hawk-Eye system, which allows players to challenge whether a ball is in or out of the tennis court. Importantly, Hawk-Eye is the ultimate arbiter for any player challenging a line call; if the human official and Hawk-Eye disagree, Hawk-Eye’s decision is considered final. (While not yet incorporated into the Olympics, Hawk-Eye’s technology is already being used in professional hockey.)\n\nAs digitization of scoring increases, so will the risks. What can be done? One lesson is the need to balance opportunity and risk. The decision to adopt a new technology, especially when the stakes are as high as they are at the Olympic Games, should always be made with potential cybersecurity risks taken into account.\n\nMore:Olympic committee schools Trump on Russia: Our View\n\nPOLICING THE USA: A look at race, justice, media\n\nWhen it is appropriate for a sport to adopt a new technology, some of the most important steps are simple. For instance, over the course of this project, we were able to read sensitive information at three different professional sporting venues using nothing more than a low-end digital camera to zoom in on a computer screen. We also watched officials type passwords into digital systems while spectators were already in the stands, making it easy for a careful observer to gain access.\n\nDuplication is another key principle: Every digital device used at an event needs to have a backup in case of failure, and humans should provide oversight to verify that any digital technology used in competition is producing the correct result. Stopwatches should be used as backup for electronic timers, automated photo finish results should be reviewed by a human, and the raw data fed into Hawk-Eye and similar systems should be continuously validated for accuracy. While this may seem like unnecessary duplication — in the vast majority of cases, the digital equipment will be accurate — it will only take one serious cybersecurity failure to call the integrity of a sporting event into question.\n\nWe are lucky that we have yet to see (or at least recognize) a hack affecting the outcome of a major sporting event. Such events are only meaningful if we have trust in the results. A hacked Olympic Games would be a huge loss for everyone.\n\nBetsy Cooper is executive director of the Center for Long-Term Cybersecurity at the University of California-Berkeley.

Commissioner Bud Selig initially wanted to add trap plays and fair/foul calls down the lines for 2013, but change was put off while more radical options were examined.\n\n\"My opinion has evolved,\" Selig said Thursday after MLB executive vice president Joe Torre gave an update at a quarterly owners' meeting.\n\nTorre hopes to have proposals by the Aug. 14-15 session in Cooperstown, N.Y.\n\nUmpires are under heightened scrutiny following two wrong decisions last week. After initially failing to award Oakland's Adam Rosales a tying home run in the ninth inning at Cleveland on May 8, Angel Hernandez's umpiring crew reviewed video and still didn't award him the homer even though replays showed the ball clearly went over the fence.\n\nThe following day, umpire Fieldin Culbreth's crew allowed Houston manager Bo Porter to improperly switch relievers in the middle of an inning, leading to a two-game suspension for the crew chief.\n\n\"Have we had a bad week or so? Yeah,\" Torre said. \"One was a rules thing; it had nothing to do with replay.\"\n\nIn tests last year at Yankee Stadium and Citi Field, MLB experimented with the Hawk-Eye animation system that is used to judge line calls in tennis and the TrackMan radar software used by the PGA Tour.\n\nWhile initially assigned to a large \"special committee for on-field matters\" that Selig established in 2009, replay recommendations will now come from a subcommittee of three: Torre, former St. Louis manager Tony La Russa and Atlanta president John Schuerholz, who is chairing the group.\n\n\"There are a lot of hurdles,\" Torre said. \"You could start replaying stuff from the first inning on and then time the game by your calendar. That would be crazy. We have a rhythm in this game that we certainly don't want to disrupt.\"\n\nThe group is examining whether to have replay officials in booths at ballparks or at a central location, and whether to have umpires wear headsets, as soccer officials do. Torre is against giving managers a challenge system, as NFL coaches have, but says opinion is split.\n\n\"Managers have to make enough decisions,\" he said. \"We've tried to stay away from technology telling us what to do.\"\n\nThe NFL, NBA, NHL, some NCAA sports and major tennis tournaments all use a form of replay, and even FIFA and the English Premier have adopted goal-line technology.\n\nSeattle's Eric Wedge opposes a challenge system, maintaining: \"I'm in favor of the human element.\"\n\nYankees manager Joe Girardi favors a challenge system and said more replay would cut down on arguments and would help umpires, too.\n\n\"Years ago they made mistakes, but it wasn't shown to millions of people,\" he said. \"I think it would take pressure off them because, bottom line, the call is going to be right.\"\n\nTorre said his decision to examine a big expansion came after Jeff Nelson missed a call at second base in the second game of last year's AL championship series. Yankees second baseman Robinson Cano tagged Detroit's Omar Infante, and Nelson ruled him safe instead of calling an inning-ending out. Detroit stretched its lead from one run to three and went on to a 3-0 victory and a four-game sweep.\n\n\"That really caught my eye and caught my attention with the fact that there was more conversation about that instead of the game itself,\" Torre said. \"There's no question we're considering much more than the trap play and fair/foul. But again, one of the decisions we have to make is how much of this do we want to do without really disrupting and putting people to sleep?\"\n\nPlayers seem to be generally in favor of more replay.\n\n\"I like the idea that it is 2013, and since there are things available, at least consider the idea of taking a look at them,\" Yankees All-Star outfielder Curtis Granderson said. \"It is a very traditional sport, but a lot of these things weren't available back when the game was originated. But now that you do have the ability to slow it down, freeze it, this that and the other, it's definitely something to look into.\"\n\nOn other topics:\n\n— Selig wouldn't discuss the investigation of players alleged to have received performance-enhancing drugs from a now-closed Florida anti-aging clinic other than to say the probe was ongoing.\n\n— Selig said there was no news on Oakland's quest for a new ballpark in San Jose and the San Francisco Giants to give up their territorial rights there. Selig said the committee he appointed in March 2009 is still at work.\n\n— Executive vice president Rob Manfred is negotiating with the players' union over the possibility of starting an international draft in 2014. Management has until June 1 to inform the union it intends to begin a world draft, and the union has until June 15 to reject it.\n\n— While average attendance through May 15 declined 3.1 percent, from 29,740 to 28,823, Selig blamed the decrease on weather that was \"really bad, painfully bad\" and said \"I'm not overly concerned.\" MLB has had 21 weather-related postponements, matching the total for all of last season.\n\n— Selig said an international opener is possible for 2014. Australian baseball officials have expressed interest.\n\n— While the pension plan for non-uniformed employees was discussed, no action was taken. MLB has considered eliminating its league-wide plan and allowing teams to make individual decisions.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2013/05/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/17/nbc-paris-olympics-brodcast-streaming-information/74362895007/", "title": "Inside NBC's extravagant plans for 2024 Paris Olympics on TV ...", "text": "For more than two weeks this summer, NBC will command the eyes of the sporting world from the Unites States at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nAnd there is a staggering number of ways to consume the countless hours of competition from the 32 sports on display, along with the discussion and viral moments that build off the action.\n\nTo make the best viewing decisions at home, here is everything you need to know about NBC’s plans to cover the 2024 Paris Olympics in the United States, including which channels Team USA’s biggest stars will air on, the streaming options available throughout the day and how the network will plan its nightly “Primetime in Paris” show.\n\nGet Olympics updates in your texts! Join USA TODAY Sports' WhatsApp Channel\n\nWhat channels are the Paris Olympics on? How can you stream it?\n\nNBC, which saw strong viewership during Olympic trials, will be the daytime and primetime home of the network’s coverage. But the full might of NBCUniversal will be behind the operation.\n\nPeacock will stream every sport and event, including all 329 medal events. Full-event replays will be available on demand on top of all NBC programming, curated video clips and original content.\n\nUSA Network will be the primary home for team sports and programs with longer run-times, such as swimming heats, track and field, soccer, basketball, 3x3 basketball, beach volleyball, rugby, cycling, volleyball and water polo.\n\nCNBC will feature boxing, cycling, rugby and skateboarding. E! has coverage of track and field, gymnastics, canoeing, diving, equestrian, artistic swimming, breaking, fencing and water polo.\n\nGOLF Channel carries live golf competition from Le Golf National.\n\nWhat Olympics sports will air live daytime vs. primetime?\n\nAll events are available live in the U.S., whether that’s on one of the cable networks, NBC, or strictly Peacock. There will be live competition content to consume daily from 4 a.m. ET to 6 p.m. ET.\n\n“Really, the consumer can find whatever they’re looking for live during the day,” NBC Olympics president and executive producer Molly Solomon told USA TODAY Sports in June. “And that’s the beauty of the European time zone.”\n\nIn primetime, starting at 8 p.m. ET (2 a.m. the following day in Paris), NBC’s marquee broadcast will air live and focus on the biggest events of the day with “Primetime in Paris.” That block will have a storytelling lens with more in-depth coverage opportunities. Mike Tirico will be the host from Paris’ famed Trocadero, with the Eiffel Tower serving as the backdrop.\n\nThe show will typically open with highlights from a Team USA gold medal and the last hour of the show will revolve around the event of the night.\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nNBC’s plans for Olympics opening ceremony in Paris\n\nSolomon credited Paris 2024 organizers for throwing out the “tradition playbook” and setting the opening ceremony on the Seine River, with athletes floating through the city.\n\n“When people ask, ‘What are you most excited about?’ It has to be the opening ceremonies because something like this has never been done before,” Solomon said.\n\nShe added: “It’s audacious, it’s bold, it’s daring, and it’s going to be unforgettable.”\n\nFrom a technical, television perspective, it will be the most complicated event that has ever been produced. The Olympic Broadcasting Service (OBS) will have 100 cameras along the parade route. Each delegation will have access to a live mobile phone camera on the boat. NBC will be tracking the U.S. team’s route, and the Americans will be second-to-last down the river because the U.S. hosts the 2028 Games in Los Angeles.\n\nNBC will have an additional 40 cameras on the scene. Reporter Maria Taylor will be embedded with Team USA interviewing athletes from the water. “Today” show hosts Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb will be on a bridge over the Seine.\n\nKelly Clarkson and Peyton Manning will join Tirico as hosts on the broadcast. Live coverage begins at noon ET and primetime starts at 7:30 p.m. ET.\n\n“France is throwing the world’s biggest party,” Solomon said, “and we get to be there.”\n\nHow many times has Mike Tirico hosted the Olympics?\n\nThe face of NBC’s coverage is Tirico, who is also the network’s frontman for NFL games. This will be his fifth Olympics assignment and fourth time as the television host of the games; he first replaced Bob Costas in that role at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.\n\nAt the Beijing 2022 Winter Games, Tirico returned to the U.S. to call Super Bowl 56 between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals.\n\nTirico will be on double-duty in strictly a Parisian sense this time. He will be around for about three hours of live coverage during the daytime and then once primetime begins at 8 p.m. ET.\n\n“There haven’t been many people who have the chance to be the lead voice on a sport like the NFL and be the Olympic host, and I love the fact I get to do both and get the opportunity,” Tirico told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nWhat is NBC's Olympic 'Gold Zone'?\n\nFor football fans who like their football Sundays with a helping of “NFL Red Zone,” there is good news. There could be up to 40 events happening simultaneously, so NBC green-lit “Gold Zone,” a whiparound format that shows the action as it is happening.\n\nBringing in Scott Hanson, who anchors “Red Zone” during the fall, “was kind of a layup,” Solomon said. The built-in credibility he brings to the audience helps.\n\nSolomon traveled to Los Angeles to sell Hanson on the idea. Since then, she said, he has been invested to the point of making sure the set design can sustain that type of broadcast. Hanson would know. He has pushed producers and voiced his ideas.\n\n“Because he knows that this is even more difficult than the NFL … I’ve been so impressed by his work ethic,” Solomon said. “He is so committed to making this a success and doing it well.”\n\nHanson will also be joined by Andrew Siciliano, Matt Iseman and Jac Collinsworth as “Gold Zone” hosts. “Gold Zone” will stream live on Peacock from 7 a.m.-5 p.m. ET daily from July 27-Aug. 10. Collinsworth replaced Akbar Gbajabiamila, who is the newest member of \"Good Morning Football.\" The revamped version of that show debuts July 29, impacting Gbajabiamila's availability.\n\nWill Michael Phelps be back at the Olympics?\n\nThe most-decorated American male athlete in Olympic history is back as a broadcast contributor.\n\nMichael Phelps will be a contributor in Paris similar to how the network deployed him three years ago. Should another massive story come about, such as Simone Biles’ mental injury in Tokyo, Phelps would be asked to provide analysis and perspective from his point-of-view in a studio format. Other times, he will be at the pool deck with Dan Hicks and Rowdy Gaines helping call the swimming action.\n\n“We definitely flex according to where we think he is best positioned to contribute,” Solomon said.\n\nIs Dwyane Wade auditioning for big NBC job during Olympics?\n\nNBC tabbed Noah Eagle to call Team USA basketball, and on the men’s side, assigned Dwyane Wade to be the color commentator.\n\nSolomon said that she is always looking for new voices and that Wade checked the box of having international competition experience. She knows that he hasn’t done a lot of game calling, but had been impressed by his previous work in the studio with TNT – being friends with LeBron James also helps.\n\n“He’s so thoughtful, and of course, has experience with so many members of the team,” Solomon said. “So I think there’ll be a lot of personal storytelling. He’ll have access to members of that team to get new insight. And I look forward to hearing a new voice in the basketball space.”\n\nAnd after this summer, Wade could be in line for a more permanent job at NBC with the network gaining NBA rights in the league’s newest media deal set to begin at the start of the 2025-26 season.\n\nLaChina Robinson will join Eagle for Team USA women’s basketball contests.\n\nWho are the Olympic gymnastics broadcasters?\n\nGymnastics coverage will be paramount, and NBC knows that. Explaining the complex scoring system can be confusing to the casual viewer at home.\n\nSolomon feels like reporter/analyst John Roethlisberger has a strong chance of being the network’s breakout star in Paris because of his ability to analogize what’s happening on the mat to other sports fans may be more familiar with. And the three-time Olympian can also dive into the weeds of judges’ opinions should that be necessary.\n\nHe’ll be joined by the other 2024 Paris Olympics NBC announcers for gymnastics:\n\nPrimetime show: Terry Gannon (play-by-play), Tim Daggett (analyst), Samantha Peszek (analyst), John Roethlisberger (analyst/reporter), Zora Stephenson (reporter)\n\nTerry Gannon (play-by-play), Tim Daggett (analyst), Samantha Peszek (analyst), John Roethlisberger (analyst/reporter), Zora Stephenson (reporter) Live daytime: Rich Lerner (play-by-play), Laurie Hernandez (analyst), Justin Spring (analyst), Zora Stephenson (reporter)\n\nWho is calling track and field at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nThe 2024 Paris Olympics NBC announcers for track and field are:\n\nLive finals and primetime: Leigh Diffey (play-by-play), Paul Swangard (play-by-play), Ato Boldon (analyst), Sanya Richards-Ross (analyst), Kara Goucher (analyst), Trey Hardee (analyst), Lewis Johnson (reporter)\n\nLeigh Diffey (play-by-play), Paul Swangard (play-by-play), Ato Boldon (analyst), Sanya Richards-Ross (analyst), Kara Goucher (analyst), Trey Hardee (analyst), Lewis Johnson (reporter) Live preliminary heats: Bill Spaulding (play-by-play), Dawn Harper-Nelson (analyst), Shannon Rowbury (analyst), Lewis Johnson (reporter)\n\nWait, is Alex Cooper part of NBC’s Olympics coverage?\n\nNBC wants to broaden its audience, particularly among young people, and brought in contributors “to bring that enthusiasm and maybe a different perspective to what we’re doing,” Solomon said. The contributors, such as “Call Her Daddy” podcast host Alex Cooper, have different fan bases demographically.\n\n“That’s really why we wanted to integrate pop culture into what we’re doing,” Solomon said. “But I always want to maintain that competition is at the core of what we do.”\n\n“Watch with Alex Cooper” will stream on Peacock as a series of live, interactive, picture-in-picture watch parties streaming on Peacock that serves as sort of a companion-cast to the action. (Think “Manningcast” vibes without the detailed football analysis.) The show will include social media reaction and guests.\n\n“We are trying a lot of different things to make sure we elevate the Olympics and the stories, and that’s why we went for some different voices this time around,” Solomon said.\n\nAt a media event this summer, Cooper said she wants Gen-Z women to participate in the Games in a less-intimidating way. She sat down for an interview with Simone Biles in which the gymnast opened up about her \"twisties\" experience in Tokyo in 2021.\n\nIs Snoop Dogg back at the Olympics?\n\nWith his mind on the Olympics and the Olympics on his mind, Snoop Dogg is, indeed, back. He’s primed for a bigger role three years after his reactions to the dressage competition with Kevin Hart went viral.\n\nSnoop will be a regular on “Primetime in Paris.” Parts of the primetime show being taped allows for Snoop to spend time with Team USA athletes, their families, or explore Paris and relay findings and insights to the wider audience that night.\n\nSnoop expressed interest about a year ago, and Solomon was struck by his passion for telling athletes’ stories and his love for the Olympics. He was at track and field trials in June to start laying the groundwork for his summer job.\n\n“‘Where is Snoop?’ I hope it becomes a popular guessing game of what we’re doing that day,” Solomon said.\n\nHart and Kenan Thompson will host a commentary series called “Olympic Highlights with Kevin Hart and Kenan Thompson.”\n\nHow will NBC cover Israel-Palestine, Russia-Ukraine, and other world events at the 2024 Olympics?\n\nInternational relations bleed into Olympic competition. That is the nature of the Games. The Olympics also produces lots of news. The plan, Solomon said, is to cover it as the news happens and to collaborate with NBC News.\n\n“Are we going to cover controversy? Of course we’re going to cover controversy,” Solomon said. “But unless it is huge news, we’re not going to live in it. We’re going to cover it and we’re going to cover the Olympic Games.”\n\nCan I watch the 2024 Paris Olympics in Spanish?\n\nYes. Telemundo is the exclusive Spanish-language home for the Olympics in the U.S. Peacock will livestream all Telemundo and Universo programming. Telemundo will present a two-hour recap show that airs at 12 a.m. ET.\n\nHow many people work for NBC during the Olympics? Where are they?\n\nBroadcasting the Games is a 3,000-person effort. Most of NBC's production team will be based at the NBCUniversal's Stamford, Connecticut, headquarters (approximately 2,000). There, they can use the hundreds of graphics production machines and hundreds of edit rooms to which they are accustomed.\n\nThe remainder will be stationed at the network's on-the-ground facility near Charles de Gaulle airport outside of Paris. It is a temporary structure that will be deconstructed at the Games' conclusion in accordance with Paris 2024's sustainability goals.\n\n“It just becomes very, very difficult to build this up in an Olympic host city,” Solomon said. “When you have a state-of-the-art facility back home, it just makes too much sense.”\n\nKey announcers and hosts will be onsite. NBC has reporters at every venue during competition.\n\n\"We think we’ve got the right balance,” Solomon said.\n\nLooking for reliable streaming options?

And this time under the lights at Roland Garros Stadium. Khelif is fighting for a chance to win a silver or gold medal.\n\nKhelif has advanced to the semifinals of the welterweight division (146 pounds). She’ll be facing a familiar foe – Thailand’s Janjaem Suwannapheng. Khelif, 25, beat Suwannapheng in the semifinals of the 2023 world championships before Khelif was disqualified for allegedly failing what the organizers called a \"gender eligibility test.\"\n\nThe International Boxing Association (IBA), a discredited organization with no role in the Olympics, disqualified Khelif and Taiwanese boxer Lin without providing evidence of any failed tests. Lin is scheduled to fight in her semifinal match Wednesday.\n\nRound 3: Khelif ends fight with energy\n\nKhelif’s quest for a gold medal continues with all five judges awarding the round to Khelif.\n\nRound 2: Khelif takes the round\n\nKhelif moves quickly out from her corner. More chants, muffled now, and Khelif takes a big swing – and misses. Suwannapheng looks content with the pace and connects with a jab and a right. Khelif struggling to find an opening as Suwannapheng shows poise and good footwork. Khelif rushes in, but her opponent safely sidesteps. But all five judges award the round to Khelif.\n\nRound 1: Judges award round to Khelif\n\nWearing blue, out comes Khelif. The boxers circling at the center of the ring. Her opponent lands a combo and Khelif fires back. A left from Khelif. More chants of “Imane’’ go up from the crowd. Boxers looking a little tentative. But the Thai boxer showing more aggression. Khelif scores with a right as they get tied up. Raucous cheers. All five judges award the round to Khelif.\n\nImane Khelif makes her entrance\n\nFans were chanting “Imane’’ before Khelif even entered the arena. And when she was officially introduced, spectators erupted in cheers and chanted yet again.\n\nImane Khelif to box on center court\n\nNo signs of stray tennis balls at Roland-Garros Stadium, home of the French Open. In fact, if not for the tennis history oozing out of the walls, you might think the place regularly serves as a venue for boxing.\n\nThe boxing ring has been set up directly on top of the tennis court. Without any sign of the red clay.\n\nThe Olympic boxing competition during the Paris Games started at North Paris Arena, a more humble venue, before moving to Roland-Garros for the medal rounds. And no matter how good the boxing is, the reigning heavyweight champ will be Rafael Nadal, who’s won a tournament-record 14 titles here in the boxing ring, er, center court.\n\nImane Khelif draws strong Algerian support\n\nFlag-wearing Algerian spectators sang and chanted outside Roland-Garros Stadium in support of Khelif more than two hours before her fight was scheduled to start. Among them was Nassym Labbas, a French citizen of Algerian descent draped in the green, white and red Algerian flag.\n\nLabbas said he and his cousin drove an hour from their home in a suburb outside of Paris and paid $200 each for tickets to attend Khelif’s fight.\n\n“To support her,’’ Labbas said, noting he thinks racism has fed into the controversy.\n\nWhen is Imane Khelif’s next fight?\n\n4:34 p.m. ET, Tuesday.\n\nHow to watch Imane Khelif’s next fight\n\nThe fight will be broadcast on NBC/Peacock.\n\nWhere will the match be held?\n\nRoland Garros Stadium, home of the French Open\n\nWhy is Imane Khelif guaranteed bronze?\n\nA victory for Khelif would vault her into the finals, where the winner would win gold and the runner-up would take silver. But she’s already guaranteed bronze.\n\nIn Olympic boxing, bronze medals are awarded to both losing semifinalists in the single-elimination format tournament.\n\nOlympic boxing basics\n\nBouts are scheduled for three rounds and are scored by five judges. Using a 10-point system, each judge awards 10 points to the boxer they deem won the round and at least nine points to the boxer they deem lost the round.\n\nBarring a stoppage, the winner of the bout will be determined by points based on the judges' scorecards. A boxer earns one point for each judge who deems the boxer has won at least two of the three rounds.\n\nImane Khelif’s road to the semifinals\n\nIn Khelif’s opening bout, Italy's Angela Carini abandoned the fight only 46 seconds into the match. Khelif demonstrated she could deliver a punch – one solidly connected with Carini’s face before the Italian quit fighting – and Khelif secured a spot in the quarterfinals.\n\nIn Khelif’s quarterfinal bout, she beat Hungary’s Anna Luca Hamori on points by unanimous decision, 5-0. This time she had nine minutes to perform and showed impressive boxing skills in dominating Hamori.\n\nKhelif, who made her amateur boxing debut in 2018, is 38-9 with five knockouts as an amateur, according to BoxRec.\n\nWho is Janjaem Suwannapheng?\n\nThe 23-year-old won her first two bouts by split decision. The victories came against Brigitte Mbabi of the Democratic Republic of The Congo and Busenaz Surmeneli of Turkey.\n\nShe made her amateur boxing debut in 2019 and is 14-5 with one knockout, according to BoxRec.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/08/05/paris-olympics-live-updates-results/74190961007/", "title": "Paris Olympics highlights: Lyles wins 200 heat; US wins discus gold", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nSimone Biles added yet another medal to her collection on the final day of gymnastics at the 2024 Paris Olympics.

This will be the first time, other than on uneven bars, that she has made a final and not won a medal.\n\nItaly's Alice Domato won gold while China's Zhou Yaqin took silver and Italy's Manila Esposito secured bronze in a final that saw multiple gymnasts fall during their routines.\n\nSuni Lee's right foot slipped off the balance beam at the end of her aerial series, causing her to split the beam and then take a hard fall onto the mat. The result was a score of 13.100. The 21-year-old appeared frustrated as she re-mounted the beam and finished her routine after the fall, and as she walked away afterwards. But then she started to gradually lighten after talking with her coach, Jess Graba, and Biles. Within moments, Lee was smiling and laughing again, perhaps remembering the breadth of what she's already achieved in Paris. After returning from a pair of kidney ailments, Lee won a second consecutive all-around Olympic medal – this time a bronze – to go with team gold and another bronze on uneven bars Sunday. — Nancy Armour, Tom Schad\n\nAmericans struggle for tops in boulder qualification of sport climbing\n\nSport climbing is officially underway at Le Bourget. Despite the heat, the stands are packed to watch the men’s boulder semifinal and women’s speed qualifications. American Jesse Grupper completed the four boulder problems and finished in 18th place with a score of 18.9, and U.S. teammate Colin Duffy finished boulder in 10th place with 33.8 points. Neither American was able to find a top, but there were few to be had in the round.\n\n\"The style of bouldering is very flashy. You want to have cool moves for the crowd, but sometimes that can lead to an extra hard round like we saw today,\" said Duffy.\n\nThe men will compete in the lead portion of the event on Wednesday. Only the top eight finishers will move on to the finals. — Sandy Hooper\n\nAaliyah Butler, Alexis Holmes moving on to 400 semis\n\nAaliyah Butler and Alexis Holmes automatically qualified to the semifinals in the women’s 400 meters.\n\nButler finished behind Dominican Republic’s Marileidy Paulino to place second in the fifth heat of the 400. Paulino produced a 49.42, which is the top time entering the semifinals. Butler got through in 50.52.\n\nHolmes ran a 50.35 to place second in the sixth heat. Ireland’s Rhasidat Adeleke won the heat in 50.09.\n\nKendall Ellis, who won the U.S. Olympic track and field trials in the 400, didn’t automatically qualify to the next round. However, Ellis does have an opportunity to advance in the repechage round.\n\nThe women’s 400 is wide open in Paris. But we do know there will be a new Olympic champion. Defending Olympic champ Shaunae Miller-Uibo of the Bahamas pulled up in the fourth heat of the 400 and didn’t finish. — Tyler Dragon\n\nWomen's pole vault sending 20 to finals\n\nIt'll be a crowded field Wednesday night when women's pole vaulting finalists gather for the medal competition at the Paris Games. That's because 20 of them qualified Monday morning, eight more than the format called for, due to a massive gridlock of a tie for the last available spot.\n\nKatie Moon was the lone qualifier for Team USA with a vault of 4.55, but the tie came at 4.40. Nine athletes tied for the 12th and final qualifying spot. Although other non-qualifiers also vaulted 4.40, the nine tied for the fewest attempts advanced.\n\nThe standard for automatic qualification to the medal rounds was 4.70, which no vaulter achieved. — Chase Goodbread\n\nUSA's Delany Schnell sneaks into 10m platform diving semis\n\nIt was close, but Team USA diver Delany Schnell snuck into the 10-meter platform diving semifinals after finishing 17th in Monday’s prelims. The top-18 divers out of 29 total at Olympic Aquatics Centre in Saint-Denis, France moved on to keep their medal hopes alive.\n\nSchnell – who finished sixth in the women’s synchronized 10-meter platform at the Paris Olympics ‒ almost didn’t advance out of the five-round prelims after poor second and third dives, which left her ranked 25th.\n\nBut the 25-year-old two-time Olympian from Michigan recovered well on her final dive with an inward 3 1/2 somersaults in the tuck position and a 3.2 degree of difficulty to finish with a score of 278.15.\n\nFirst-time Olympian Daryn Wright ended prelims ranked 19th with a score of 272.25, just missing out on advancing. Wright – a 20-year-old diver for the Purdue Boilermakers – had a strong first round off a forward 3 1/2 somersaults in the pike position with a 3.0 degree of difficulty and was tied for eighth place. But she dropped to 22nd after the fourth round before finishing outside of the top 18 in her only Olympic event.\n\nChina’s defending Olympic gold and silver medalists, Quan Hongchan and Chen Yuxi, finished prelims ranked first and second, respectively. Quan’s top score was 421.25, while Chen in second posted a score of 382.15.\n\nSemifinals for the women’s 10-meter platform are set for 9 a.m. ET Monday, and finals are Tuesday also at 9 a.m. ET. — Michelle Martinelli\n\nPARIS – Stop the bullying, says Algerian boxer Imane Khelif.\n\nKhelif, who was dragged into controversy over gender eligibility criteria at the Paris Olympics, has spoken out for the first time since the Games began. She and Taiwan’s Lin Yu-Ting have been subjected to abuse on social media and inaccurate online speculation about their sexes even though the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has said they both have met all criteria and that there’s no question they are women.\n\n\"I send a message to all the people of the world to uphold the Olympic principles and the Olympic Charter, to refrain from bullying all athletes, because this has effects, massive effects,\" Khelif said in an interview with SNTV, according to The Associated Press. \"It can destroy people, it can kill people’s thoughts, spirit and mind. It can divide people. And because of that, I ask them to refrain from bullying.\"\n\nKhelif and Yu-Ting have advanced to the semifinals at the Olympics, ensuring they’ll win at least bronze medals. — Josh Peter\n\nRai Benjamin qualifies for semis in 400m hurdles\n\nTeam USA hurdler Rai Benjamin qualified for the men's 400m hurdles semifinals at the Paris Olympics on Monday, clocking a time of 48.82 seconds for a first-place finish in the opening heat.\n\nIn Olympic preliminary heats, the top three finishers in each of five races automatically qualify for the semifinals, as well as the next three fastest times, for a total of 18 semifinal qualifiers.\n\nBenjamin, 27, won silver in the event at the Tokyo Games in 2021, along with a gold in the men's 4x400 relay. He's not competing in the 4x400 relay in Paris, however, so the 400 hurdles is his lone chance at a medal.\n\nAlso qualifying for the semifinals for Team USA was CJ Allen, who ran 48.64 to finish second in Heat 3.\n\nThe semifinals for the 400m hurdles will be held Wednesday night, and medal races are scheduled for Friday. — Chase Goodbread\n\nPARIS — The United States team of Seth Rider, Taylor Spivey, Morgan Pearson and Taylor Knibb took silver in the mixed triathlon relay Monday at the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\nThe U.S. finished in a time of 1:25.40, 1/100th of a second behind gold-winning Germany and just ahead of bronze medal-winning Great Britain in a photo finish.\n\nGreat Britain, which won gold in 2020, led most of the race with Germany in second, but Knibb closed the gap for the U.S. with strong legs in swimming and biking in the final rotation before Germany's Laura Lindemann pulled ahead in the final moments of the run for the win. — Dave Birkett\n\nOlympics schedule today\n\nHere are some Olympic schedule highlights.

They also allow landlords to toss renters' belongings on the curb immediately after an eviction, instead of placing the property in storage.\n\nCall it the Landlords' Legislature.\n\nIn all, about one out of five of state lawmakers who voted on these bills owns or manages rental properties, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel found in its review. At least five lawmakers who double as landlords sponsored the various measures, each of which passed on mostly party-line votes.\n\nRELATED:Assembly passes bill to help Wisconsin landlords by limiting housing inspections, making some evictions easier\n\nARCHIVE:Senate passes bill giving landlords more power in tenant dealings\n\nARCHIVE:Walker signs bill scaling back some rights of tenants\n\nThere are other examples of lawmakers voting on measures that affect their income, such as physicians and nurses voting on medical matters. But the landlord-driven bills stand out for the volume, quick passage and the fact some came in direct response to specific problems faced by the lawmaker landlords.\n\n\"It's obvious they're trying to help their own financial interests rather than the people of the state,\" said Richard Painter, the former chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush's administration who last year ran for U.S. Senate in Minnesota as a Democrat. \"This is the kind of thing that just makes the Legislature look bad.\"\n\nFormer Republican state Sen. Frank Lasee, who owned four rental properties while serving in the Legislature, was the lead Senate sponsor on all five measures. State Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Saukville, who has ties to about a dozen rental properties, sponsored three of the bills.\n\nTwo other lawmakers are property managers, including state Rep. Samantha Kerkman, R-Salem, who manages Vos' Whitewater rentals.\n\nLasee of De Pere acknowledged he also sponsored one measure in response to an issue his mother was having with a tenant.\n\n\"People tend to legislate in areas that they understand the best,\" he said.\n\nRepublican wave washes in changes\n\nSince 2013, Vos has been the Assembly's gatekeeper, making him the one person who can decide which bills advance to the floor for a vote.\n\nIn an interview in his Capitol office, the Rochester Republican said there was no conflict of interest in his support for bills benefiting landlords, including his own property rental company.\n\n\"The idea of having a citizen legislature where people have experience is what everybody says they want, right?\" said Vos, who had held elective office since 1994 and owns an array of businesses. \"They don't want professional politicians.\"\n\nWisconsin landlord-tenant law had changed little for years before the 2010 election.\n\nThe Republican wave that swept the party into total control in Madison sparked a series of pro-business initiatives such as scaling back environmental rules; making Wisconsin a \"right to work state\" and overhauling regulations on various industries.\n\nThe first landlord bill, which limited the powers of municipalities in policing the rental industry, was sponsored by Vos and Lasee in May 2011.\n\nThe bill barred local governments from limiting background searches of prospective tenants or preventing landlords from renting out units while they were still occupied, two issues of importance to college-town property managers.\n\nCombined, Republican lawmakers have made at least 100 changes to landlord-tenant law — most of which Vos acknowledged favored landlords.\n\n\"As a conservative, I fundamentally believe in the idea of private property rights,\" he said.\n\nVos showed reporters a legal opinion from the nonpartisan Legislative Council that said it is OK for lawmakers to vote on bills even if the measures impact them financially — provided the lawmaker isn't the primary beneficiary of the legislation.\n\nThe opinion, requested by Vos, was dated May 8, 2019, almost eight years to the day after he was lead Assembly sponsor of the first landlord bill. He requested the legal opinion after the Journal Sentinel began inquiring about the law changes.\n\nThe speaker's staff argued that a 2011 legal opinion about a Vos-sponsored bill involving legal fees had cleared him of any conflict of interest when he ushered the landlord bills through the Legislature.\n\nBut that opinion, from the state's ethics board, focused on a legal dispute involving Vos and a former tenant. It said it was OK for Vos to sponsor legislation that limited attorney fees the losing side has to pay to the winner's lawyer.\n\n\"That opinion was reconfirmed verbally over the years,\" Kit Beyer, a Vos aide, wrote in an email in response to Journal Sentinel questions. \"We requested the May 8th opinion after learning you were doing this story in order to provide you with a more recent one in writing.\"\n\nA lawsuit, then a law\n\nThe case that prompted the ethics opinion illustrates how Vos' work as a lawmaker has become intertwined with his rental business.\n\nHis properties, mostly located in Whitewater, appear to be typical college-student housing.\n\nSince 2012, the City of Whitewater has fined Vos and his companies $11,866 for a variety of minor infractions, such as not mowing the lawn, not shoveling snow and not cleaning junk from the property, city records show. The fines for the nearly 300 violations ranged from $25 to $300 each.\n\nVos companies also have dealt with more serious problems.\n\nWhen five student renters moved out of a house saying they had lost electricity at least two dozen times during the summer of 2010, a Vos company sued them for breach of contract. One student, who had paid her rent in advance, filed a countersuit demanding a refund.\n\nVos' company settled the case in October 2011 by agreeing to pay the tenant $2,175, court records show.\n\nDuring an ensuing fight over the legal fees, the tenant's lawyer, Brian Schuk, was stunned to learn that Vos was sponsoring legislation that effectively capped legal fees at three times the amount awarded in compensatory damages.\n\nThis would have meant a limit of about $7,000 in the case. Legal fees were actually more than $20,000, Schuk said at the time.\n\nThe bill was moving through the Legislature at breakneck speed. It went from introduction to the governor's desk in less than one month.\n\n\"It did seem like there was a rush,\" Schuk said.\n\nAt the time, public discussion about the bill largely focused on limiting court-ordered fees collected by attorneys who sue car makers in lemon law cases.\n\nAfter it was disclosed that the bill could also benefit Vos personally in the landlord-tenant lawsuit, Vos sought the ethics opinion.\n\n\"They know this bill is going to pass and they know the gravy train is going to end,\" Vos told the Journal Sentinel at the time.\n\nSchuk said the whole matter was nerve-wracking.\n\n\"I knew where my case was at, and I knew who the other side was, and I knew this law was coming out, so it was a trifecta of issues — I was concerned about all of them,\" Schuk said. \"It's rare that you’re up against somebody who's in the Legislature.\"\n\nSchuk argued in court that the new law should not be applied retroactively. In the end, Vos' company paid the tenant's legal fees of about $20,000, court records show.\n\n\"Did I lose?\" Vos asked. \"I don't even remember that.\"\n\nOfficials say laws undercut local efforts\n\nVos and officials from landlord groups argue the changes they've made to state law ensure uniformity in the state's 72 counties. Local officials say the GOP actions limited how they run their own cities.\n\nThe changes prompted some cities, including Milwaukee, to drop programs that targeted neighborhoods, such as college housing or areas with older houses, for increased inspections.\n\n\"I call it the Bad Landlord Protection Act,\" said Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, saying the bills \"create a business model where it is cheaper to violate the law\" than to follow it.\n\nBarrett said it is more efficient for unscrupulous landlords to not repair some code violations and simply pay the reinspection fees, which are now capped by state law. What's more, it can take years for those fees to catch up with the cost of a major repair.\n\nThe city can take a landlord to court for failing to make the repairs, though collecting Municipal Court fines can be a difficult task.\n\nThe city lost $3 million to $4 million from 2014 through 2017 as a result of the new state laws, officials said. The bulk of the drop — $2.58 million — was caused by the new limits on fees charged when an inspector finds a violation and has to return to reinspect the property.\n\nFirefighters joined the legislative fray in an effort to douse a GOP-pushed bill that loosened requirements for sprinkler systems in apartment buildings. The law voided ordinances that mandated sprinklers in buildings with fewer than 20 units.\n\n\"They'd sprinkle everybody's home if they could,\" Lasee said in an interview. \"Truly that is what they want.\"\n\nRepublican lawmakers and then-Gov. Scott Walker also targeted liberal city governments, such as Madison, by barring municipalities from enforcing a variety of ordinances such as ones requiring landlords to provide voter registration information to tenants.\n\nThe Legislature banned city governments from requiring landlords to disclose any information to tenants unless federal or state government already mandated the disclosure.\n\nFor example, some cities had ordinances requiring landlords to provide written reasons for turning away potential tenants, said Matt Kozlowski, finance director at Madison's Tenant Resource Center.\n\n“The state did away with those rules and said, ‘No, no, no, no. Madison, Milwaukee, you can't have that,’ ” Kozlowski said.\n\nShifting the balance of power\n\nNearly a dozen Democrats who have served in the Legislature since 2011 are also landlords, though they routinely voted against the bills.\n\nThe three largest Democratic landlords are state Rep. Gary Hebl of Sun Prairie, who listed more than a dozen properties owned by him or family members on his 2017 ethics report; Milwaukee Sen. Lena Taylor, who listed five; and Sen. Fred Risser of Madison, who listed three.\n\n\"I have a couple of rental properties of my own and I think that the bills that were promoted were way too lopsided in favor of the landlords,\" Risser said. \"I think they were unfair.\"\n\nLandlords and tenant advocates agree that the changes fundamentally shifted the balance of power between landlords and tenants.\n\n\"This new law will benefit landlords and 'good' tenants. 'Bad' tenants … will not like this new law,\" Tristan Pettit, a Milwaukee landlord lawyer wrote in a 2013 blog post.\n\nPeter Koneazny, litigation director at the Legal Aid Society of Milwaukee, said in a May interview that it's not that simple.\n\n\"It’s not always easy to say who’s a good tenant or a bad tenant, and also there’s bad landlords as well as good landlords,\" Koneazny said.\n\nKoneazny added that \"the number and the pettiness of some of these things certainly was a surprise. Any landlord who had a gripe about something could get the law changed in some way to address that gripe.\"\n\nThat's exactly what Lasee tried to do.\n\nThe former senator said his then-72-year-old mother had long rented out an upstairs apartment with no problems. Then the tenant's \"no good son\" also moved in and \"things started to go downhill,\" he said.\n\nLasee said his mother evicted the woman and her son, but \"got stuck with a $500 water bill.\"\n\nToday, thanks to a 2013 Lasee-sponsored law, a lien on behalf of the landlord can be placed against tenants who leave without paying the water bill. Unlike the major landlord bills, this measure passed with the help of four Democrats.\n\n\"Wisconsin was a very bad-tenant forgiving state,\" said Lasee.\n\nPower shifts to landlords\n\nSome of the changes appear to be aimed at the Eviction Defense Project — which provides free lawyers to Milwaukee County tenants facing eviction, said Koneazny, who works with the project.\n\nA new law requiring lawyers who do free work for a legal clinic to disclose information about themselves has made some lawyers hesitant to volunteer.\n\nOther new state mandates eliminated some defenses and tactics used by Eviction Defense Project lawyers to prevent or slow down evictions. Tenants can no longer have an eviction suit dismissed because the landlord listed the wrong amount of rent owed in court filings.\n\nThe changes were \"created solely to eliminate what had been a viable legal defense for tenants,\" said Raphael Ramos, director of the Eviction Defense Project, which launched in December 2016.\n\nPettit argued that some tenant lawyers were taking advantage of the old laws by using various strategies to drag out the eviction process.\n\n\"I want to be honest with you, but I also don't want to bad-mouth tenant advocates, but tenant advocates were taking advantage of that,\" he said.\n\nPettit is a former president of the Apartment Association of Southeastern Wisconsin, a trade group that helped push for most of the bills. He noted full control by Republicans opened the door for landlords seeking changes to state law.\n\n\"It all depends on who's in Madison, what can be done,\" he said.\n\nRecords show lawmakers were not flooded with campaign contributions connected to the bills, but lobbyists on both sides flocked to the Capitol.\n\nThe statewide political action committee for landlord trade groups gave $10,450 to Republican candidates and campaign committees — about 10 times the amount they gave to Democrats.\n\nOpponents included Milwaukee, Madison and various nonprofits that advocate for low-income people and domestic violence victims. A measure that speeds up evictions if a landlord suspects criminal activity could result in domestic violence victims becoming homeless along with their abusers, advocates warn.\n\nRELATED:Advocates: Wisconsin domestic abuse victims could be evicted more quickly under bill for landlords\n\nThe state-imposed limits on inspections have irked Wisconsin mayors in cities where some neighborhoods, particularly those housing college students or low-income tenants, used to be targeted for inspections.\n\n\"Tenants don't want to call and complain and risk eviction or rent increases or other problems,\" said Oshkosh Mayor Lori Palmeri.\n\nWhile Milwaukee axed its neighborhood inspection program, Oshkosh is still trying to retain aspects of its program. The city twice scaled back its inspection program in the wake of the new laws and a lawsuit by a local landlord association.\n\n\"It's been kind of a tennis match,\" Palmeri said. \"Actually, a hockey match.\"\n\nLasee said some cities see the inspection fees as a revenue generator. Vos argued cities can still do the neighborhood inspections, though they must follow stricter criteria set by the state.\n\nUnder the 2018 changes, the targeted neighborhood inspection programs can only be done if an area includes blight, a high number of code violations, an increased number of homes being converted to rental units or plummeting property values. Each individual tenant must consent to the inspection.\n\nAs it is, Vos said, inspectors unfairly focus on rental properties.\n\n\"If you're in Whitewater and you have one house that has a car on blocks that's owned by the people who live in it. And the house next door is a rental where they don't mow the lawn every other day.

It should be everybody.\"\n\nKevin Crowe of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel staff contributed to this report", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/07/10/bob-ray-obituary-robert-d-ray-iowa-governor-republican-robert-ray-des-moines/405858002/", "title": "Robert Ray and his remarkable life in Iowa, in 10 chapters", "text": "Bob Ray was the Iowan we all want to be.\n\nFor a generation, Ray embodied the ethos of his native state in a way few public servants can imagine.\n\nHe unified the extremes of the Republican Party in a way no one had before or since, bargained compromise with legislatures both friendly and otherwise; he possessed a keen sense for placing the right person in the right job for the benefit of the public, admirers say.\n\nHe continued in public service well after he left the governor’s office and remained one of the most beloved leaders in Iowa history.\n\nAnd it all began in a humble frame house near Drake University in Des Moines.\n\nPROLOGUE: BIRTH OF A LEADER\n\nThe year 1928 was a good one for Iowa leaders.\n\nA Republican from West Branch named Herbert Hoover won relatively easy election to the White House — the only Iowa native to become president of the United States.\n\nHoover’s presidency was a single term, marred by the 1929 stock market crash and the ensuing economic stress known as the Great Depression.\n\nBut five weeks before Hoover was elected, another great Iowa leader made his debut.\n\nRobert Dolph Ray was born in Des Moines on Sept. 26, 1928, to accountant Clark Ray and his wife, Mildred. He was the Rays’ second child and only son. The family was of modest means and lived in a frame house on 26th Street near the Drake University campus.\n\nBOB RAY, 1928-2018:\n\nCHAPTER ONE: ICE CREAM AND POLITICS\n\nThe future five-term governor of Iowa spent his childhood playing pickup baseball games at Drake Park. He played basketball and tennis while attending Grant, Callanan and Roosevelt schools.\n\nRay developed a lifelong obsession with ice cream at Reed’s Ice Cream on Forest Avenue, where he often stood in line for nickel ice cream bars several times a day. In high school, he worked part-time at Mrs. Smith Butcher Shop on Cottage Grove.\n\nRay was not a standout student, his mother and former teachers would say. He was bright and had an unusual ability to remember anything he saw or heard, but seldom studied hard.\n\n“I know in high school, the teachers would talk to me and they’d say, ‘If he’d just open his book and work hard, he’d be an A-plus student,’” Mildred Ray told journalist John Bowermaster for the 1986 book “Governor: An Oral Biography of Robert D. Ray.”\n\nClassmates remembered Ray largely as a loner. He was friendly, they told Bowermaster, but introverted and quiet. Yet his political chops first appeared in seventh grade at Callanan Junior High School.\n\nAn early win\n\nClassmate George Lilly, who later owned a Volkswagen dealership in the metro, nominated Ray for seventh-grade class president. Ray made banners and posters and gave speeches. He won the office and the admiration of another Callanan student, a young Marvin Pomerantz.\n\nPomerantz would grow up to become one of the most successful real estate developers and businessmen in Des Moines. A Republican, he served in Ray's inner circle of advisers throughout the governor's career and was a top fundraiser for Republicans and Ray.\n\n“Even in seventh grade, I remember being amazed by his political skills,” Pomerantz, who died in 2007, told Bowermaster.\n\nRay’s father and maternal grandfather were staunch Republicans. The two often groused about President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal.\n\nA young Ray listened to the discussions and asked questions of his elders, but Ray was seldom impressed by their answers. He was a Republican at the time because that’s how he was raised, but he could have easily swayed Democrat or independent.\n\nThe love of his life\n\nRay made another important connection while in high school. The Rays attended University Christian Church, now known as First Christian Church, at 25th Street and University Avenue. So did the Hornberger family.\n\nRay took an interest in their daughter, Billie Lee, during a summer church camp, where the two met and began courting. She was named queen of the camp and Ray was named king.\n\nRay graduated from Roosevelt High School in 1946 at age 17. With the permission of his parents, he joined the U.S. Army and spent two years in Japan as part of the first wave of relief troops after World War II.\n\nRay enjoyed his service to his country, but was awestruck and saddened by the destruction that World War II had brought to Japan. He struggled with seasickness on the long boat trip to Japan, and, while there, homesickness for Iowa. But his experiences there began a lifelong fascination with Japan and Southeast Asia that would later influence the creation of the Iowa Sister States program and other humanitarian efforts.\n\nHe returned to Des Moines and enrolled at Drake with the help of the GI Bill. He started a restaurant with his future brother-in-law in downtown Des Moines. Neither really knew what they were doing and sold it before it drove them into debt.\n\nRay worked as a meat cutter at a Cottage Grove butcher shop to help pay for school. He studied business administration and teaching but did not student teach. He considered becoming a coach. He also worked as a reading clerk in the Iowa Senate, which gave him his first exposure to state politics and how bills are made into laws.\n\nAgain, Ray proved popular among classmates. He pledged the Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity and was elected student body president at the same time that famed running back Johnny Bright was blazing up and down the turf at Drake Stadium.\n\nRay worked as a newspaper carrier for The Des Moines Register and rose to district circulation manager while attending Drake Law School. He was offered a job in the Register’s circulation department but turned it down to begin practicing law.\n\nRay continued to date Billie Lee Hornberger, and the couple married in 1951 while he was still a law student.\n\nAfter he finished law school, the Rays joined another couple and spent four and a half months touring Europe.\n\nWhile on the trip, Ray developed what became his lifelong interest in photography, which 28 years later would provide Ray and Iowans powerful insights into the suffering of Southeast Asian refugees.\n\nCHAPTER TWO: PRACTICING LAW, EARLY LOSSES\n\nThe Rays returned from Europe nearly broke. Billie Ray went back to teaching school.\n\nBob Ray shopped around for a job practicing law at firms in Des Moines and elsewhere.\n\nHe eventually landed in the offices of Verne and James Lawyer, two high-profile trial lawyers in downtown Des Moines.\n\nVerne Lawyer, who hired Ray, was a colorful character in Des Moines, with wide-ranging connections. He owned a private plane and jetted around the country. Lawyer once arranged for his friend, famed trial lawyer F. Lee Bailey, to marry an airline stewardess at a club on Fleur Drive. Bob and Billie Ray were witnesses.\n\nLawyer immediately saw Ray had political potential and would prove a powerful early ally.\n\nRay defended criminal cases. He once won a sodomy case, which led to him defending more sodomy suspects.\n\n“Once you get a reputation for winning a case like that, they keep coming back to you, even if you don’t want them to,” Ray told Bowermaster.\n\nThough Ray was a talented and fast-learning lawyer, the lure of politics soon enveloped him. He ran for Polk County attorney in 1956 at age 27. Polk County, then as now, leaned heavily Democratic, and Republicans were little more than sacrificial lambs in the county attorney’s race.\n\nHe lost by 10,000 votes. Still, he showed early flair. Billie Ray sewed costumes for several women she and Bob Ray had known at Drake or around town, and they wore the outfits in public appearances for Ray, including the Iowa State Fair parade that fall. They became known as the Ray Girls and would be a feature of Ray campaigns for the rest of his career.\n\nRay also eschewed the traditional red, white and blue color scheme favored by political candidates in favor of cardinal and gold, reminiscent of Iowa State University’s colors.\n\n“It wasn’t that he particularly favored Iowa State, but he wanted something to be different and stand out,” said David Oman, a former Ray chief of staff. “They became his signature colors.”\n\nRay made his second run at public office in 1958, this time, aimed at the Iowa House. This bid, too, ended in defeat.\n\nAgain, Ray learned. He ran his first television ads, which most candidates at the time were not doing. In one spot, a union electrician explained why he favored Ray.\n\nThe Iowa Republican Party was disorganized in the 1958 campaign. To revitalize the party, Ray worked with Leo Oxberger, one of Ray’s law school classmates, whom Ray would appoint as a judge in the Iowa Court of Appeals in 1976.\n\nThey joined social clubs and community charitable organizations: the March of Dimes, Rotary, Eagles, Moose Lodges. The idea was to spread the word about Republicans wherever possible.\n\nRay said he was doing it to help build his law practice, but he also built a network of contacts that would become the backbone of his statewide campaigns for years to come. Through those clubs and early contacts, he cultivated dedicated local campaign leaders who supported him in each of Iowa’s 99 counties.\n\nDefeated in his bids for elective office, Ray ascended the rungs of internal party leadership. He became head of the Polk County Republican Party in 1962. The following year, at age 35, Ray became the youngest man in 100 years to be elected state chairman of the Iowa Republicans.\n\nThe party struggled with its identity. Conservatives and moderates battled for control of the party both in Iowa and nationally.\n\nThe national GOP convention selected conservative Barry Goldwater to challenge President Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 election. Johnson, riding on the nation’s sympathies after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy a year earlier and pursuing an aggressive domestic agenda, cruised to a landslide victory. Democrats widened their majorities in the U.S. Senate and House.\n\nIn Iowa, popular incumbent Gov. Harold Hughes, a Democrat, easily won re-election to his second two-year term, and Democrats took five of Iowa’s six seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. Democrats carried heavy majorities in both houses of the Iowa Legislature.\n\nRay had planned to go back to his law practice with the Lawyer brothers after the 1964 elections. But the trouncing was so bad, Ray believed he needed to stay on as party chairman.\n\nCHAPTER THREE: GRITTY CAMPAIGNER\n\nIn 1965, Ray took on more executive responsibilities as state GOP chair. He hired more full-time staff. He held schools for candidates to educate them on the issues and drill them so they could defend their positions when questioned by the press, public or opponents.\n\nUnder Ray’s guidance, Republicans hosted $1 fundraisers called Buck Nights statewide. The cheap events brought in farmers, business people and everyday Iowans who rallied around a cheery new slogan: “It’s fun to be a Republican!”\n\nRay ordered tighter controls on how candidates could spend Republican Central Committee money and increased television advertising.\n\nThe results in 1966 were better-coordinated campaigns and huge gains for Republicans in the Legislature. The GOP won three of the state's then-six congressional seats from Democrats and seated 88 new Republicans in the Iowa Legislature.\n\nHughes again won re-election as governor that year. He also befriended Sen. Robert F. Kennedy, the younger brother of President Kennedy and a former U.S. attorney general. The younger Kennedy convinced Hughes to run for U.S. Senate, clearing the way for a wide-open governor’s race in 1968.\n\nRay decided to run for office again, this time for governor.\n\nConservative opponents\n\nRay faced a three-man race for the Republican nomination, squaring off against Donald Johnson of West Branch, a former national commander of the American Legion, and newspaper publisher Robert Beck of Centerville. Johnson and Beck were more conservative than Ray.\n\nAmong other moderate stances, Ray opposed the death penalty. “No man has a right to play God,” Ray said in a campaign appearance.\n\nRay also favored limited abortion rights for women in cases of rape, incest or a threat to the mother’s health. He also opposed a proposal circulating in the Legislature that would have denied state welfare benefits to women with more than one child out of wedlock.\n\n“Heaven help us when we don’t have enough compassion to help those who need us,” Ray said in October 1968.\n\nRay’s views would be considered liberal by GOP standards now, the late Arthur Neu, a former Republican lawmaker and lieutenant governor under Ray, said in a 2012 interview.\n\n“He would be cut to pieces in a primary today,” Neu said.\n\nRay was supported by the Republican inner circle, but he was considered a city man and wasn’t well-known outside Polk County. Residents of smaller cities and rural communities viewed Des Moines, considered the big city, with skepticism.\n\nIn one campaign appearance, a Republican candidate for the U.S. House introduced Ray as “Bob Day.”\n\nBoosted by plane crash\n\nIt took a nearly fatal plane crash to make Ray a statewide name.\n\nOn April 22, 1968, Ray was flying in a small plane with a pilot and campaign staffer when the plane went down near Clear Lake.\n\nAll aboard survived but were badly injured. Ray suffered a broken ankle and leg, which left him laid up in a Mason City hospital. But the campaign marched on.\n\nBefore he ran for governor, Billie Ray made her husband promise she would not have to make speeches on the campaign trail. She would be there with him, but she didn’t want to be out front.\n\nWith her husband injured, the campaign collected Billie Ray from Des Moines. She appeared before crowds and gave an update on her husband’s health. She never talked policy, but Iowans took a liking to the loyal wife and schoolteacher.\n\n“Mrs. Ray was always fantastic with Iowans,” said Oman, the Ray adviser. “She was natural and real. People responded to her like she was one of them, just like they did with Governor Ray.”\n\nWhen Ray returned to the campaign trail on crutches, his grit resonated with Iowans. He won the primary, then took on Democrat Paul Franzenburg, the state treasurer, in the general election.\n\nThe tumultuous 1968 presidential campaign is remembered for the assassination of Robert Kennedy, violence at the Democratic convention in Chicago and the increasing unpopularity of the Vietnam War. It culminated with the landslide election of Republican Richard M. Nixon to the White House.\n\nAnd in Iowa, 40-year-old Robert Ray became governor.\n\nCHAPTER FOUR: FRESHMAN GOVERNOR\n\nThe love affair between Iowans and Ray as their governor did not begin immediately. His first year was marked by a steep learning curve.\n\nHughes, who had been elected to the U.S. Senate in 1968, left office early to begin his transition to Washington, D.C. Lt. Gov. Robert Fulton, a Democrat, assumed the governor’s chair for 16 days to finish out Hughes’ term, but there was little focus on the transition to the new governor.\n\nRay came into an empty office without even a pad of paper, he said later, and was immediately confronted with the troubles of the day.\n\nUnder Hughes in the previous session, lawmakers raised taxes statewide. Farmers, in particular, were struggling with a new formula that taxed more of their land at a higher rate. Agriculture industries suffered, too. Hog prices plummeted.\n\nRepublicans controlled both houses of the Legislature, which in theory could have translated into smooth working relationships between the governor and lawmakers.\n\nIn reality, Republicans in the Legislature were more conservative than Ray, and they often found themselves at odds.\n\nLeaders in the Iowa House privately groused that the new governor didn’t understand the legislative process.\n\nRay stood his ground. He vetoed a bill that would have expanded the government’s powers to wiretap citizens. He supported the distribution of birth control pills in mental health institutions. And he fought off an effort to reinstate the state’s death penalty.\n\n“They thought they were going to be able to tell me what to do,” Ray told Bowermaster, his biographer. “They were wrong.”\n\nCalm amid strife\n\nHis first term also was marked by social strife. Students loudly and sometimes violently protested the Vietnam War, racial inequities and other issues on the state’s three university campuses.\n\nBombs exploded at Drake, a private college, and Iowa State University and the University of Iowa in 1970. There were no fatalities, but tensions ran high.\n\nStudents held sit-ins and confronted campus administrators. In one incident at the University of Iowa, several students used profanity in a protest with a university official present. Some lawmakers thought the campuses were out of control and wanted Ray to enforce strict discipline.\n\nRay refused.\n\n“We’re living in a time when young people are restless and do things older people don’t like,” Ray told the Register in 1970. “But I’m not willing to condemn all for a few who do things out of the ordinary to seek attention.”\n\nIn other states, governors used the National Guard to quell student unrest. This proved deadly on the campus of Kent State in Ohio, where in May 1970 troops opened fire on a group of unarmed students, killing four and wounding nine others.\n\nOne night in 1970, a group of University of Iowa students decided to block Interstate Highway 80 by lying across the road. Ray had the National Guard, the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation and the Iowa State Patrol at his disposal.\n\nRay quietly sent in state troopers to escort the students off the interstate. The situation was defused without serious incident.\n\n“That was a moment where Ray’s touch was just perfect,” said David Yepsen, a longtime Register political reporter who was then a UI student. “At the time, the Iowa State Patrol was second only to God in the respect of Iowans. Sending them in, instead of the Guard, really calmed things down. It was a classic Bob Ray moment.”\n\nIn the summer of 1970, a Chicago concert promotion company rented ground near Wadena in northeast Iowa. The plan was to host a Woodstock-style concert for as many as 30,000 people. Seven out of 10 people surveyed by the Register’s Iowa Poll thought the event should be stopped. A similar concert near Chicago ended in a riot.\n\nRay decided to visit the rock festival himself. He spoke to the crowd of about 25,000.\n\n“Look, I don’t want what happened in Chicago last night to happen here,” Ray told the crowd on a 100-degree late July day. “You’re here to have a good time, so please, have a good time, but we want you all to leave here knowing you had a good time. Try to stay off the stuff, OK?”\n\nAbout a dozen people were arrested. There was no violence or riot.\n\n“There was something very simple and honest about what Ray did there that resonated with even young people,” Yepsen said. “He wasn’t pretending to be one of them. He just wanted people to be peaceful. It worked.”\n\nCHAPTER FIVE: TOUGH IN TOUGH TIMES\n\nRay survived a tough re-election challenge in the fall of 1970 from Robert Fulton, the former lieutenant governor, who had helped engineer Hughes’ successful U.S. Senate campaign.\n\nFarmers still leaned against Ray because of their property tax burdens. Ray won by 34,000 votes, the narrowest victory in his career.\n\n“Bob Ray had not become Bob Ray yet,” Yepsen said. “He wasn’t always viewed as saintly as he is today.”\n\nIn 1971, the national economy struggled through a recession. The state budget surplus was exhausted, and Iowans of all stripes begged for tax relief.\n\nRay’s approval rating dipped to an all-time low: 41 percent.\n\nRay dug in on tax policy. He pushed for a plan that shifted the state’s revenue stream from property taxes to income taxes. He worked with lawmakers to create an education funding plan that equalized per-pupil funding, putting schools in poorer regions of the state on more equal financial footing with those in better-off areas.\n\nThe school plan shifted much of the burden of paying for schools to the state. This eased local property taxes, which lessened the burden on farmers and improved funding for schools, which pleased many voters statewide.\n\n“School funding was one of the most important pieces of legislation we worked on,” said Neu, the former lawmaker. “It set Iowa schools on the path to being the best in the nation. It’s a plan a lot of other states copied.”\n\n‘For the little guy’\n\nRay seemingly sought to have a personal relationship with every Iowan with whom he had contact. He sent handwritten notes to every person who assisted him during his trips around the state, even if they only greeted him or hung up his coat. He also tried to read every letter that came to his office, and took pleasure in surprising constituents late in the evening by phoning them to respond to their questions or complaints.\n\n\"People often thought they received a crank call, hang up and Governor Ray would have to call back,\" Oman said.\n\nBut the moment that many believe cemented Ray in the hearts and minds of Iowans came in spring 1972.\n\nOn March 5, 1968, a Wisconsin Air Guard plane had crashed into the home of Emma McCarville of Cresco. Her home was destroyed. On Dec. 9 of that same year, an Iowa Air National Guard plane wrecked the farm home of Peter and Marie Tjernagel, near Story City.\n\nPeter Tjernagel died 52 days after the crash, which Marie Tjernagel believed was related to the financial stress brought onto the family.\n\nThen for years, the Iowa attorney general and the U.S. Air Force wrangled over who should pay the families for their losses. The Air Force wanted Iowa to pay; Iowa officials believed it was the federal government’s responsibility.\n\nDes Moines Register reporter Nick Lamberto wrote about the families’ struggles, which came as news to Ray. When President Nixon visited Rathbun Lake for its dedication in early 1972, Ray asked him about the problem. Nixon referred it to a subordinate.\n\nRay wrote a letter to the Nixon aide and also had it published in the Register. A school class in Story City gathered a 15,000-signature petition urging the federal government to settle.\n\nIn April 1972, Ray, as commander in chief of the Iowa Air National Guard, took dramatic action. He grounded all Air Guard planes until the two families were made whole.\n\nThe federal government was furious, but eventually paid the families.\n\n“That was the moment people began to see Bob Ray as somebody who stood up for the little guy,” Yepsen said. “He took on the whole federal government for two Iowans. That was when they knew how tough he was.”\n\nChallenge from right\n\nWhen Ray decided to seek a third term in 1972, he faced a Republican challenger: Lt. Gov. Roger Jepsen.\n\nBefore a 1988 amendment to the Iowa Constitution, the governor and lieutenant governor were elected separately rather than as a single ticket.\n\nJepsen, who represented the Iowa GOP’s conservative wing, believed it was his time to run the state’s highest office. Many in the Republican legislative caucus supported Jepsen, who had been a legislative colleague in the Iowa Senate before winning the lieutenant governor’s office in 1968.\n\nRay girded for the challenge by building what supporters called the most impressive campaign effort of his career.\n\nHe again used the political machinery he built in the early 1960s, tapping GOP county chairmen and all those friends he had made rebuilding the party, to build a substantial lead in money and support. Ultimately, Jepsen dropped out of the race before the primary.\n\nMeanwhile, Ray continued to be an innovative campaigner. He introduced telephone solicitations and computerized mass mailings. That fall, Ray ran against Franzenburg again, cruising to victory with 58.6 percent of the vote.\n\nCHAPTER SIX: ‘GOVERNORRAY’\n\nThe old saw about Ray goes that by the time he left office in 1983, he had served as governor so long that a generation of schoolchildren thought Governor Ray was one word. Children would ask their teachers who the “Governorray” was of neighboring states.\n\nThough possibly apocryphal, the story is emblematic of Ray’s widespread popularity in Iowa. By the middle 1970s, he polled at a career-high 82 percent approval. Even farmers, who previously believed the governor didn’t understand the relationship of agriculture to the state’s finances, polled 61 percent in favor of Ray.\n\nRay led trade missions to Asia, including promoting Iowa beef in Japan, and he was among the first U.S. governors to visit China after Nixon's historic visit in 1972. Those missions helped farmers, but it also brought the likable Ray and his staff close to the Iowans over the long trips, Oman said.\n\n\"You can't overestimate his likability,\" Oman said. \"You have to like a person to vote for him and he got to know so many Iowans on a first-name basis through these trips.\"\n\nJepsen, the combative lieutenant governor, left politics for a time and returned to the insurance business. Neu, the newly elected lieutenant governor, had a more collegial relationship with Ray and the Legislature.\n\nThe state and national economy improved in Ray’s third term, and Ray and the Legislature began restructuring state government. Together, they created the Iowa Department of Transportation, which merged half-a-dozen separate departments under one umbrella.\n\nThe new agency issued driver’s licenses with photographs. The renewal date for vehicle registrations was matched with the vehicle owner’s birthday rather than having all licenses expire at the end of the year, which had created jams at renewal stations.\n\nRay signed a Democratic-backed bill to remove sales tax from groceries and prescription drugs, which cost the state about $29 million in revenue. He also signed into law a bill that gave public employees collective bargaining rights.\n\nThe governor’s agenda drew criticism from Republicans Terry Branstad and Chuck Grassley, who were both state lawmakers at the time, before Branstad’s promotion to governor and Grassley’s to Congress.\n\nBut Ray was so popular, it was difficult for legislators in either party to oppose him.\n\n“One of the reasons legislators felt more inclined to oppose him in 1969 and 1970, even in 1971 and ’72, was because his popularity was in the 50 to 60 percent range,” Grassley told Bowermaster. “By 1974, it was between 70 to 85. So it wasn’t bad for a legislator to be lined up with him.”\n\nNixon had resigned in disgrace after the Watergate scandal destroyed his administration, and Vice President Gerald Ford succeeded him. Ray became chairman of the National Governors Association in 1975.\n\nFord twice offered Ray the cabinet position of secretary of the interior, but Ray chose to stay home.\n\nMeanwhile, a change in the Iowa Constitution had extended the governor’s term from two years to four. In 1974, Ray easily won re-election against James Schaben to secure the four-year term.\n\nCHAPTER SEVEN: WELCOMING REFUGEES\n\nIn the early 1970s, Ray was greeted outside his office in the Capitol by a woman wearing the traditional garb of the Yankton Sioux tribe.\n\nThe woman’s name was Maria Pearson, also known as Running Moccasins. She had come to Ray to protest the treatment of Native American graves uncovered during a road construction project in Glenwood. Twenty-six graves had been unearthed during the project. Most were reburied, but the remains of a mother and child were sent to a state lab for study.\n\nRay asked what he could do to help.\n\n“You can give me back my people’s bones and you can quit digging them up,” Pearson recalled in her 2000 book, “Give Me Back My People’s Bones: Repatriation and Reburial of American Indian Skeletal Remains in Iowa.”\n\nRay saw to the return of the remains, and he worked with the Legislature to ensure more care was taken with Native American burial grounds.\n\nThe result was the Iowa Burials Protection Act of 1976, long before the 1990 federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.\n\nAs another term unfolded, Ray’s humanitarianism stretched well beyond the borders of Iowa.\n\nThe U.S. failures in Vietnam left deep scars on the American psyche. The nation that had helped defeat Hitler and the Axis in World War II and kept advancing communist forces at bay in Korea had failed in its mission in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn 1975, not long after Ray’s fourth inauguration, 130,000 South Vietnamese refugees fled the country after Saigon fell. Laos, on the border of Vietnam, fell to communist troops later that year.\n\nIn July, Ford appealed to the nation’s governors to help resettle Southeast Asians. He offered $500 to help with the costs for each refugee. Only one governor responded: Ray.\n\n“I didn’t think we could just sit here idly and say, ‘Let those people die,’” Ray told Iowa Public Television for a documentary on refugee resettlement in Iowa.\n\nRay formed the Governor’s Task Force for Indochinese Development. The governor’s office received a specific appeal from the Tai Dam, an ethnic group from Vietnam.\n\nThe Tai Dam were a closely knit group of about 3,500 people. They hoped to keep their community and culture intact, and wanted to resettle in one place together.\n\nThe U.S. State Department resisted settling a large group in one location. Ray pressured federal officials, including Ford and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, to change their minds. They relented. The Tai Dam refugees started arriving in Iowa in October.\n\nOpening state’s door again\n\nAccompanying the refugees was a State Department official named Ken Quinn, a native of the Bronx, N.Y., who had grown up in Dubuque.\n\nWhile Quinn was assigned to the Vietnam-Cambodia border, he had been the first State Department official to report on the massacres of the Khmer Rouge regime of Cambodian dictator Pol Pot.\n\nQuinn, better than most, knew the terrible conditions faced by refugees. He came to Iowa to give a speech thanking the state for accepting the Tai Dam people.\n\n“After I spoke, I sat down next to Governor Ray, and he tapped me on the leg and said, ‘You would be a good person to have around,’” Quinn said.\n\nJust more than a year later, Quinn returned to Iowa on special assignment to assist Ray’s administration with resettlement efforts.\n\nIn 1979, Ray watched a “60 Minutes” report about the plight of other Southeast Asian refugees from Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. They were called “boat people” because they fled persecution on boats made of oil drums. Many drowned. Others starved to death or died of disease in refugee camps.\n\nRay ordered Quinn to use his contacts to see if the governor could again open Iowa’s borders, this time to 1,500 refugees. Quinn worked the system.\n\nThe move was controversial. A September 1979 Register Iowa Poll showed 51 percent opposed resettling more refugees. Ray’s office was flooded with mail.\n\n“It was split right down the middle,” Quinn said. “About half supported it, and half opposed.”\n\nThe letters that irked Ray most came from those who said refugees would take jobs away from needy Iowans. Ray replied to some of those letters with phone calls in the late evening.\n\n“Ray had an aide count up all the help-wanted ads in an edition of the Sunday Register,” Quinn said. “He would call these people at 9:30 or 10 o’clock at night and say, ‘Just go get one of those jobs before they arrive, and everything will be fine.’”\n\nPhotos of suffering\n\nIn October 1979, Ray and the governors of Michigan and New Jersey took a trip to visit refugee camps in Thailand. Quinn accompanied the group.\n\nThe delegation witnessed suffering, starvation and death, and Ray took photos along the way. The conditions left him and the others badly shaken.\n\nAt one point, Tai Dam refugees took Ray into a hut. On the wall was a map of Iowa filled with pins where Tai Dam people had resettled in the state. Ray, Quinn recalled, choked back tears.\n\nRay and Quinn returned to Iowa and were met at the Des Moines airport by Yepsen, the Register political reporter.\n\nYepsen wanted the scoop on what the conditions were like in the refugee camps.\n\n“I saw people die,” Ray told Yepsen, which became the headline of the next morning’s Register. Accompanying the article were Ray’s photos, which Yepsen had convinced the governor to let the Register develop and publish.\n\n“There was no politics in his feelings about that issue,” Yepsen said. “He truly believed it was the right thing to do to help them, and he went about convincing the people of Iowa it was right, too.”\n\nHe met opposition. Some in the governing body of the Disciples of Christ Church, of which Ray was a member, believed they should not get involved with the politically sensitive issue.\n\nRay traveled to St. Louis to speak to the church’s national convention. He delivered what Register religion reporter Bill Simbro described as more of a sermon than a political speech. Ray noted that Missouri’s motto is the “Show Me State.” Ray believed there was a moral imperative in the slogan.\n\n“Don’t tell me of your concerns for human rights, show me,” Ray said. “Don’t tell me of your concerns for these people when you have a chance to save their lives, show me. Don’t tell me how Christian you are. Show me.”\n\nThe speech turned the tide at the convention, and the church supported aid to the refugees.\n\nBack in Iowa, Ray teamed with the Register’s editorial pages for a statewide fundraising campaign that became known as Iowa SHARES. Donations poured in — more than $2.1 million in today’s money — to aid the refugees. The charity sent doctors, nurses, food and supplies to help.\n\n“Governor Ray was a deeply moral man,” Quinn said. “He believed it was our moral duty to help those people. He could not just let them die.”\n\nCHAPTER EIGHT: TERRACE HILL, BOTTLE BILL\n\nDemocrats couldn’t move Ray out of the governor’s chair, but he did make a move in 1976 — to Terrace Hill.\n\nTerrace Hill is a mansion built by millionaire businessman Benjamin Franklin Allen between 1866 and 1869 on land that overlooks downtown Des Moines. After Allen went broke, he sold the mansion to real estate magnate Frederick Hubbell, whose descendants gave the mansion to the state in 1971.\n\nBillie Ray led a massive project starting in 1974 to remodel the mansion into a governor’s residence and a reception hall for visiting dignitaries.\n\nIn 1976, Bob and Billie Ray and their three daughters moved in, leaving a colonial house at 2900 Grand Ave., which had been the Iowa governor’s official residence since 1947.\n\nHis favorite legislation\n\nThe move to the gilded hallways of Terrace Hill was symbolic of Ray’s stature in Iowa. In the middle of his fourth term, he was a confident governor who commanded the executive branch with a calm demeanor admired even by his opponents.\n\nTimes were good in Iowa during the middle ’70s. Farm prices were strong, and unemployment was below 3 percent, half the national average.\n\nIn 1976, Ray’s approval rating stood at 82 percent, according to the Register’s Iowa Poll. Through the remainder of his governorship, it never dipped below 71 percent.\n\nRay was considered a vice presidential candidate in 1976, but Ford picked Bob Dole, a U.S. senator from Kansas who had more international experience. Ford lost the White House to Georgia Gov. Jimmy Carter.\n\nThe stable times allowed Ray to pursue a pet project, one that he would later say was his favorite piece of legislation during his 14 years as governor.\n\nRay was distressed by the amount of litter along Iowa roads. He pushed for a nickel deposit on beverage cans and bottles sold in Iowa. His aides studied similar bills in Oregon and Vermont. They concluded the bill would not only reduce litter but also increase recycling and ease the burden on landfills.\n\nThe bottle bill, as it came to be known (although it covers cans as well), met opposition from unions, who believed the bill would cost jobs; aluminum manufacturers, who worried about rising costs; and grocers, who would be burdened by collecting and refunding the deposit.\n\nRay, however, refused to bow.\n\nSpecial interests put out “unbelievable” propaganda, Ray told Bowermaster, his biographer.\n\nStill, Ray had the upper hand. Environmental groups such as the Sierra Club joined with the Boy Scouts of America and the powerful Farm Bureau to support the bill. A Register Iowa Poll showed 71 percent of the public favored it.\n\nIt passed both houses, and more than 200 people attended the signing at the Capitol rotunda.\n\n“It was a perfect, if not the perfect, Bob Ray legislation,” Bowermaster wrote. “It wasn’t very sexy, though energy conservation was a hot topic during the 1970s, but it had good, strong public support.”\n\nCHAPTER NINE: THE FINAL TERM\n\nIn 1978, Ray cruised to another easy victory, this time against a three-term legislator, Jerry Fitzgerald, 37, to earn a then-record fifth and ultimately final term.\n\nHis final four years in office would prove memorable. Ray received Pope John Paul II during his historic 1979 visit to Iowa at Living History Farms in front of nearly 300,000 people. Ray took a photograph from the helicopter he rode to the event, which was published in the Register the following morning.\n\nHe greeted Iowa native Kathryn Koob, one of the hostages held by Iran, who was released in early 1981.\n\nMany believed Ray would use the term to position himself as a candidate for national office, either as a vice presidential nominee or a potential presidential candidate.\n\nAs the 1980 Iowa caucuses approached, political campaigns courted him heavily for an endorsement in the first-in-the-nation contest.\n\n“Every day there was either a candidate or somebody from a campaign wanting time with the governor to discuss an endorsement,” said Oman, Ray’s chief of staff. “He listened to them all, and he considered some of them.”\n\nRay no longer had the perceived weakness in foreign affairs that led Ford to pass him over for Dole for the vice presidential nod in 1976.\n\nRay’s work with refugees had made him a national spokesman on the issue, and he had traveled extensively abroad to promote Iowa exports, including stops in China and the Soviet Union in the summer of 1979.\n\nWhile Ray never openly ruled out a White House run, he also never said he wanted national office. And when the 1980 caucuses arrived, he remained neutral, refusing to endorse anyone before the voting.\n\nAfter the caucuses, Ray endorsed U.S. Senate leader Howard Baker, a moderate Republican from Tennessee with a reputation for compromise so renowned that he was known as the “Great Conciliator.”\n\nGeorge H.W. Bush won the Republican Iowa caucuses and ultimately became the vice presidential running mate of future President Ronald Reagan.\n\n“Some people believe Ray could have been Bush’s vice presidential nominee, but I think Bob Ray just liked being governor of Iowa,” said Yepsen, the political reporter. “He was comfortable in that job. He was good at it.”\n\nBudget troubles\n\nRay convinced the Legislature to refund a $50 million surplus to taxpayers, giving back as much as $250 per person. The refund came at a precarious time for state finances. Revenues were leveling off and dropping.\n\nAdvisers suggested using the surplus for a one-time expenditure, such as a prison, but Ray was adamant. His fellow Republicans had rebuffed an idea to repeal the state sales tax on utilities, a move that was popular in other states.\n\nRepealing the utility tax would have been similar to his support for repealing sales taxes on groceries and prescription drugs. Ray believed it was pure tax relief, but he found no support. So instead of letting the Legislature find a way to spend the surplus, Ray pushed for the refund.\n\nThat move would prove costly in 1980 when state revenues plummeted. The state’s cattle industry struggled. Interest rates and inflation climbed to as much as 20 percent. A recession loomed, and Ray found himself needing to cut spending in a hurry.\n\nIn 1980, Ray cut the budget three times for a total of $172 million, almost 10 percent of the state’s total budget. The recession continued through 1981. Ray resisted lawmakers’ pleas for income and sales tax increases, instead lurching forward with minimal budgets.\n\nIt “was a tough year,” Ray said. “Nobody could have predicted the recession would be as deep or as long-lasting as it was.”\n\nPrivate sector beckons\n\nOn Feb. 18, 1982, Ray announced he would not seek a sixth term as governor. He would turn 54 later that year.\n\nAs governor, Ray earned $55,000 a year. Privately, he worried that his prime earning years might be behind him. Turning down federal posts had cost him a higher salary. He doubted he could return to trial law, having been away from the courtroom for nearly 20 years.\n\nLt. Gov. Terry Branstad won the 1982 governor’s race. Branstad, a former Iowa House member from Leland, was more conservative than Ray. At 36, he was the youngest man ever elected to the state’s highest office — four years younger than Ray when he had taken the oath the first time.\n\nThough never as popular as Ray as measured by Iowa Polls, Branstad won four consecutive four-year terms, serving 16 years, two more than Ray. After a stint out of public life, Branstad was re-elected governor again in 2010 and 2014, becoming the longest-serving governor in U.S. history.\n\nRay spent the summer of 1983 as part of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations, a position helped by a nod from then-Vice President George H.W. Bush.\n\nThree months after he left office, Ray joined the Cedar Rapids insurance firm Life Investors Inc., now known as AEGON. His salary was reported at $300,000, with bonuses and stock options. The couple kept their home in Des Moines but lived in Cedar Rapids.\n\n“It was a conscious decision on his part to leave Des Moines for a while,” said Oman, Ray’s former chief of staff. “Governor Branstad was new, and it wouldn’t be fair for him to be hanging around looming. The Rays loved their time in Cedar Rapids.”\n\nHe served nearly seven years at Life Investors, then in 1989 took the helm at Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa. There, Ray oversaw the mergers of IASD Health Service Corp. and Blue Cross Blue Shield of South Dakota, setting the stage for the company to become Wellmark, Iowa’s largest insurer.\n\nRay, no longer the politician, was a successful businessman. But he was not done being a public leader.\n\nCHAPTER 10: LIFELONG LEADER\n\nIn April 1997, popular Des Moines Mayor A. Arthur Davis resigned when his five-year battle with colon cancer made him too weak to continue.\n\nCity officials set a November election to finish Davis’ term, but needed someone in the interim to officiate over everything from the relocation of Martin Luther King Jr. Parkway to tax assessment complaints.\n\nThey turned to Ray.\n\nRay, then 68, had recently retired as president and CEO of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Iowa and appeared headed off to the sunset. He accepted on the condition he not be asked to run for the office on a permanent basis.\n\n“When I was governor, I used to say there is no more difficult job than being mayor of a city,” Ray told the Register in 1997. “You can’t do much of anything without somebody disagreeing with you, and then you’re right there, looking one another in the eye. It’s day-in-and-day-out activity on the street level. So why would I want to do it? Because I might be able to do some good.”\n\nRay held the mayor’s chair until City Councilman Preston Daniels was elected to the job at the end of the year.\n\nAlso in 1997, as a legacy of the 1996 Iowa Sesquicentennial, which Ray chaired, he helped found the Institute for Character Development at Drake University (Character Counts In Iowa), which has blossomed into The Robert D. and Billie Ray Center at Drake. The Character Counts program has served over 500,000 Iowa school-age youth. The center also assists Iowans from preschoolers to corporate and community leaders as a state and global resource in the areas of leadership, ethics and civility.\n\nHelping his alma mater\n\nThen another voice from Ray’s past came calling: his alma mater, Drake University.\n\nIn 1998, Drake President Michael Ferrari, who had presided over the school’s financial and academic resurgence in the 1980s and 1990s, had resigned to take the top post at Texas Christian University.\n\nDrake was in the middle of a $100 million fundraising campaign. It would take at least a year to find a new president.\n\nSchool leaders turned to Ray, one of the school’s most prestigious alumni and a longtime member of Drake’s board of trustees.\n\nRay accepted, but with one condition: He did not want to be an interim president. He wanted the full title and responsibility.\n\n“Governor Ray did not believe he could be as effective as he wanted to be if labeled an interim president,” said Don Adams, a longtime Drake vice president who served as Ray’s chief of staff during his yearlong presidency at Drake.\n\nRay became an active leader on campus and beyond. Some faculty members were skeptical about the selection of a trustee to run the school. Ray solved the problem by inviting the president of the faculty senate to join his Cabinet.\n\n“Bob Ray wanted total transparency,” Adams said. “He didn’t want anyone to think he was there on somebody else’s agenda.”\n\nRay held the post until the hiring of David Maxwell, an experienced administrator who was head of the National Foreign Language Center at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.\n\nMaxwell met privately with Ray as they prepared for the leadership change. Ray planned to return to the board of trustees, but he wanted to make sure Maxwell was comfortable with that.\n\nRay “didn’t want me to feel like he was going to be second-guessing me from the board,” Maxwell recalled. “I said to him, ‘The very fact that you would ask that question tells me we’re going to have a good relationship.’ He was always very generous in that way.”\n\nRay continued his service to Iowa through work on dozens of boards and commissions. A speaker and course program for lifelong learners age 50 and above at Drake, called the Ray Society, is named in his and Billie Ray’s honor.\n\nEPILOGUE: LEGACY\n\nBob Ray was Iowa’s most popular politician of the 20th century. The late Washington Post political columnist David Broder once wrote that “among governors of both parties, few men enjoyed greater respect than Ray.”\n\nHe was not without critics. Some called him timid, lukewarm and uninspiring. “A man whose personality had all the zing of his favorite treat — a scoop of plain vanilla ice cream,” noted a 1997 Register profile of Ray.\n\nYet retired Register columnist John Carlson perhaps best assessed Ray’s hold on Iowa:\n\n“Ray’s greatest talent seemed to be correctly assessing the mood of Iowans and having an uncanny sense of what they would and wouldn’t tolerate,” Carlson wrote. “He always, always remembered that Iowans are moderate by nature and never, ever are they extreme.”\n\nOne of the last formal honors Ray received was the Hoover Presidential Library Uncommon Iowan Award, in October 2015.\n\nRay was too ill to attend the ceremony, and Quinn, who worked on refugee issues with Ray while on loan from the State Department, accepted the award on Ray's behalf.\n\nQuinn recounted that Ray was the first governing leader anywhere in the world to offer to accept the Vietnamese boat people, who were drowning at sea. Ray’s Iowa SHARES campaign rushed doctors and nurses, food and medicine to starving Cambodian survivors of the genocidal Khmer Rouge. And he welcomed the Tai Dam people of Laos to be resettled in Iowa together, allowing them to keep their cultural heritage intact.\n\n“Governor Bob Ray displayed the global moral leadership that thrust Iowa to center stage of international humanitarian diplomacy,” Quinn said, “and placed himself in the pantheon of Iowa's greatest historic figures.”\n\nBut Quinn also described a scene that offers perhaps a greater tribute than any award. Thirty-five years after the end of the Vietnam War, Ray was walking through a grocery store in Des Moines with his wife, Billie, when they encountered an Asian man pushing a shopping cart. The man recognized the governor, walked over from his cart and extended his hand. He told Ray, “You saved my life. I just want to say, ‘Thank you.’”\n\nBOB RAY TIMELINE\n\n1928: Robert Dolph Ray is born on Sept. 26 to accountant Clark Ray and his wife, Mildred.\n\n1940: Ray wins his first election, as president of his Callanan Junior High School seventh-grade class.\n\n1944: Ray meets Billie Lee Hornberger while attending a youth camp sponsored by University Christian Church.\n\n1946: Ray graduates from Roosevelt High School in Des Moines at age 17.

Chuck Edwards, R-Henderson, introduced Senate Bill 535 in April that authorizes the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to add Pisgah View State Park to the State Parks System.\n\nIt was passed unanimously by the Senate and referred to the House on June 24, where it is expected to be heard in committee on June 26, said Rep. Brian Turner, D-Buncombe, who said he worked for “a long time” with Edwards on the bill.\n\nRELATED: Historic Pisgah View Ranch listed for sale\n\nIf it passes committee, the bill would be sent to the House Rules Committee and then to the House floor for a vote and need to be signed by Gov. Roy Cooper before it officially becomes a state park.\n\n“It’s been in our family since 1790. Before that, the Cherokee owned it. But nobody owns everything forever. This will make sure that when we’re gone, this property will remain much as it is today,” Max Cogburn said.\n\n“It is a unique piece of property. It has over 2 miles of ridge line, it has its own watershed, it has headwaters, it looks like it’s surrounded by mountains in a bowl. It’s a fantastic piece of property. We loved having it. It will be bittersweet, but this is the best result for the property and we’re very happy about it. And we’re proud of our contribution,” he said.\n\nAs the chair of the Appropriations Committee on Agriculture, Natural and Economic Resources, Edwards is in the best position to appropriate funds for the new park.\n\n“I recall as a child going to many events on that property. It’s extremely exciting to be a part of helping preserve that land for Western North Carolina in perpetuity,” Edwards said.\n\nRELATED: New zip line safety bill opposed by WNC summer camps\n\nRELATED: Entry fees coming to DuPont State Recreational Forest?\n\nA new state park can only be created after authorization by the General Assembly, he said. The Pisgah View Ranch was opened to the public in 1941 by Ruby and Chester Cogburn. It will be restored and remain open to the public once it becomes a state park.\n\nFor lands to be considered for becoming a North Carolina state park, they must have “extraordinary natural resources representative of North Carolina’s rare or pristine ecosystems, have potential for recreation including facilities and access necessary to support it, and have sufficient opportunities for land acquisition,” said Katie Hall, spokeswoman for N.C. State Parks.\n\nIt appears Pisgah View Ranch meets the standards, according to land conservationists.\n\nThe Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy, an Asheville-based land trust, has been working with the Cogburn Family since the early 2000s on the property deal, said SAHC vice president Jay Leutze.\n\n“It’s very unusual that we get to work on a project of this size. To protect the whole watershed in the Upper Hominy Creek Valley, usually you’d have to buy 30 parcels of land,” Leutze said. “This is kind of a conservation dream come true. I really appreciate the Cogburn family was willing to sell their land. Having this be a state park was a good way for their family’s stewardship and legacy to carry on.”\n\nThe land ranges in elevation from 2,500 feet above sea level along South Hominy Creek to more than 4,600 feet at the Buncombe-Haywood line, said Hanni Muerdter, SAHC conservation director.\n\nShe said the property is critical in the ecological integrity of the region since it serves as a wildlife corridor for large animals like black bear and deer that like to use ridgelines. The Pisgah View Ranch property line is a north-south running ridge that connects with Pisgah National Forest near Mount Pisgah, Muerdter said.\n\n“A large portion of this ridge is forested and used by animals but is currently unprotected, and this Pisgah Ranch land helps secure important unprotected ridgeline for wildlife movement and public enjoyment,” she said.\n\nThe ranch property is within 1.5 miles of Pisgah National Forest and directly abuts the greater 120,000-plus acres of protected landscape of conservation easements, Pisgah National Forest, Blue Ridge Parkway, and state game lands spanning the Pisgah Ridge and Great Balsam Mountains, she said. Other animals expected to use this wildlife corridor and land are box turtles, salamanders and reptiles.\n\nWhile no nitty gritty details are yet available, the Cogburn Family plans to run the resort through the end of the year, Max Cogburn said, with its cabins, outdoor swimming pool, fishing pond, tennis courts and miles of hiking, horseback riding and mountain biking trails.\n\nHe said it’s unclear if State Parks would continue to run these operations, but he can foresee the agency reviving the long-closed campground and enhancing the trail network.\n\n“I think this will be an incredible addition to State Parks and it has the potential to transform that area and really revitalize the local economy of the Candler area,” said Turner, who believes the bill will also receive bipartisan support in the House.\n\nWith its proximity to Asheville and Interstate 40, as well as to the Pisgah National Forest and Great Smoky Mountains National Park and parkway, Edwards said he believes the recreation and scenic values of the ranch could boost it to one of the most visited attractions in the state.\n\n“Not only will the land be preserved, but it will create an incredible economic opportunity for Haywood and southwest Buncombe County in bringing in tourist, giving opportunities for businesses to open and offer services for those tourists,” Edwards said.\n\n“I expect shopping will open up, additional jobs will be created and additional outdoor activity companies will grow and expand.”\n\nLeutze said a lot of people across the state had a hand in the project, but he said the Cogburn Family should be thanked for making a significant contribution to the cost of the property.\n\nValued at times up to $25 million, the land could have easily been subdivided and developed, he said. The SAHC has raised $1 million from private donors toward the purchase price.\n\n“The family was willing to donate a portion of the value of the land,” Leutze said. “It really helps when matching multiple sources of funding that the sellers were willing to reduce the cost to the state.”\n\nMax Cogburn said the family will maintain a small inholding, possibly a few acres, where the family home sits and where some family members still live.\n\nThe bill names the park, and permits it to receive donations of appropriated land or purchase other needed lands for Pisgah View State Park with existing funds from the Clean Water Management Trust Fund, the Parks and Recreation Trust Fund, the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, and other available sources of funding.\n\nIt is expected that land for the park would be purchased for approximately $18.2 million over five years, with the first phase beginning after the contract closes at the end of 2019, Edwards said.\n\nHall, with State Parks, said the time it takes to create a state park varies significantly based on public input, opportunities to purchase the right land for the park, funding to purchase land for the park, funding to construct facilities and establish a staff for the park.\n\nThe most recent parks to open were Mayo River State Park in Rockingham County, which was authorized in 2003 and opened in 2010, and Carvers Creek State Park in Cumberland County, which was authorized in 2005 and opened to the public in 2013.\n\nRELATED STORIES:\n\nNorth Carolina has 39 state parks but there are none in Buncombe County.\n\nPisgah View State Park would join five other parks in WNC including Chimney Rock in Rutherford County, Gorges in Transylvania County, Grandfather Mountain in Avery County, Lake James in Burke and McDowell counties and Mount Mitchell in Yancey County.\n\n“Securing this much acreage for conservation and outdoor recreation is a huge win for the region,” said Carl Silverstein, executive director of the Southern Appalachian Highlands Conservancy.\n\n“We are grateful to the Cogburn family for their willingness to sell their property to create a new state park rather than to a deep-pocketed developer.\"\n\nPisgah View Ranch\n\nWhere: Border of Haywood and southwest Buncomb counties.\n\nHow big: 1,600 acres.\n\nElevation: Range from to 2,500-4,600 feet.\n\nLandscape: Contains the Spring Mountain/Pisgah View State Natural Area, which includes a wide variety of landscape types from exposed cliffs on dry ridges, to oak-dominated forests, mesic coves and wetland areas.\n\nSpecial natural features: Prominent views of Mount Pisgah in the Pisgah National Forest; contains sections of South Hominy Creek and its tributaries.\n\nHuman built features: Cabins, tennis courts, swimming pool, horse stables, trails.\n\nWildlife: The ridgeline sits on an identified wildlife corridor important for movement of large and small animals from black bear and deer to box turtles, birds and salamanders.\n\nSource: SAHC and Pisgah View Ranch.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/26"}]}

Mauro Pimentel/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLatin America and the Caribbean show the greatest regional decline in average population at 94%, with the report warning that the Amazon rainforest is nearing the point of being nonfunctional.\n\nAndrew Terry, director of conservation and policy at ZSL, said in a statement that the index “highlights how we have cut away the very foundation of life … (and that) preventing further biodiversity loss and restoring vital ecosystems has to be at the top of global agendas to tackle the mounting climate, environmental and public health crises.”\n\nCurrently, 1 million plants and animals face extinction, with 1%-2.5% of mammals, birds, reptiles, fish and amphibians having already gone extinct, the WWF reported.\n\nBut the numbers don’t mean that 69% of animals have been wiped off the planet since 1970. WWF International Director General Marco Lambertini told CNN that the LPI works out the decline of a particular species population as a percentage and then averages out all the percentages to come up with the headline figure.\n\n“Normally, when people think of endangered wildlife, it’s all the iconic animals such as elephants, tigers and pandas,” Lambertini told CNN. “Funnily enough, some of these animals have started to bounce back. Tigers are almost double their number and pandas have gone up about 20%.”\n\nLesser-known animals are often the ones in decline. The Amazon pink river dolphin in the Mamirauá Sustainable Development Reserve in the Brazilian state of Amazonas, for example, saw a population decline of 65% between 1994 and 2016, the report found. The eastern lowland gorilla population in the Democratic Republic of Congo’s Kahuzi-Biega National Park fell by 80% between 1994 and 2019, while the Australian sea lion lost 64% of its population between 1977 and 2019.\n\nThe index is based on pre-existing, published research on wild animals, which means there is a bias on which animals make the LPI and which don’t. All the animals included are vertebrates – animals with spines – even though invertebrates, or spineless animals, outnumber them. Invertebrates are not included because it is more difficult to conduct research on them, Lambertini told CNN.\n\nIn 30 years of intervention to halt biodiversity loss, the LPI continues to observe declines, which, the WWF says, act as early warning indicators of ecosystem health. The report emphasized the importance of urgent action by governments, corporations and the public.\n\nResearchers examine a jaguar in Brazil. Carl De Souza/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe planet has warmed by 1.2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times, which is one of the reasons freshwater species showed the greatest overall decline, at 83%. In 2021, ocean temperatures were the hottest on record for the third year in a row. A loss of habitat and barriers to migration routes – for example, dams – are responsible for approximately half of threats faced by fish.\n\nWhile the report finds the natural world near a tipping point, it also reiterates that immediate transformative action can slow and even reverse these devastating results.\n\nThe COP15 meeting of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity is expected to take place in Montreal in December. Lambertini believes this will be an opportunity for leaders to set the direction for the world in providing solutions to stop or “bounce back” on the loss of biodiversity.\n\nHuman-induced climate change is causing wildfires, which destroy ecosystems and reduce biodiversity. João Laet/AFP/Getty Images\n\n“It’s a famous saying, ‘you can’t manage what you can’t measure,’” so a manageable goal is needed. Climate, for example, needs to hit net zero carbon emissions, but net zero loss of biodiversity is not good enough,” he said, because of the amount of loss incurred over a short period of time.\n\nInstead, he reasons that the global goal should be “net positive” on biodiversity, because nature can come back, and is coming back for some species.\n\nUnder discussion is a global framework to double the protection and conservation of nature by 2030. Currently, 15% of land is conserved, and 8% of the oceans, he said.\n\nOn a smaller scale, he said the public can do their bit by following a simple rule: “Consume less, and more sustainably” in a bid to reduce the pressure on nature.", "authors": ["Hafsa Khalil"], "publish_date": "2022/10/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/sciencefair/2017/01/18/primates-apes-monkeys-extinction/96724398/", "title": "Over half of world's apes and monkeys in danger of extinction", "text": "Doyle Rice\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe world's apes and monkeys are in serious trouble.\n\nAbout 60% of Earth’s non-human primate species, including apes, monkeys, gorillas, gibbons and lemurs, are threatened with extinction and about 75% have declining populations, according to a study published Wednesday.\n\n\"This truly is the 11th hour for many of these creatures,\" said University of Illinois anthropology professor Paul Garber, who co-led the study.\n\nIn the case of the Hainan gibbon, a species of ape in China, fewer than 30 animals remain on the planet. The population of the Grauer's gorilla fell from 17,000 in the mid-90s to around 3,800 today, mainly from hunting and mining, the study said. And 22 out of the 26 primate species in China are endangered, Garber said.\n\nThose and many other species will disappear in the next 25 years unless conservation becomes a global priority, Garber said. Of the 500 species of primates in the world, about 300 are threatened or endangered.\n\nHumanity's population expansion is the main cause for the extinction threat, with 5 billion humans living in countries with primates. Habitat loss due to logging, mining and agriculture; hunting; the illegal pet trade; and climate change are all top reasons for the decline, Garber said. \"Most of this has gone on in the past 100 years,\" he added.\n\nThe study, which involved dozens of authors from around the world, is the most comprehensive review of the world's primates ever conducted, the researchers say.\n\nCalling primates the \"canary in the coal mine,\" Garber said that humans will eventually also not be able to live where primates are having trouble surviving now if \"we continue to pollute the environment.\"\n\n\"Governments, non-governmental organizations, corporations and citizens have to come together to change business as usual,\" he said. \"Now is the moment.\"\n\nJan Vertefeuille of the World Wildlife Fund, who was not part of the study, said the report \"raises the alarm\" about the plight of these species.\n\n\"The problem seems far away but there are a few easy things consumers in the U.S. can do to help take some of the pressure off,\" she said.

Locally, within that greater reality, there is some good news.\n\nIt is likely that the work of land managers and scientists in Great Smoky Mountains National Park may have helped to preserve large numbers of species of birds. According to a paper published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, since 1980, requirements set forth in the Clean Air act passed 50 years ago may be to thank for saving 1.5 billion birds across the globe that otherwise would have been lost.\n\n“Our research shows that the benefits of environmental regulation have likely been underestimated,” said Ivan Rudik, a Cornell economist and one of the paper's lead authors. “Reducing pollution has positive impacts in unexpected places and provides an additional policy lever for conservation efforts.”\n\nGreat Smoky Mountains National Park may be one of those unexpected places. “The park is interested in trends in the populations: which species are increasing, which species are decreasing, and whether there are certain areas or habitats where many species are increasing or decreasing together,” said Paul E. Super, the Science Coordinator helping to facilitate research in the park.\n\nFinches, warblers, and sparrows are at the highest risk of illness and death from ground-level ozone, which not only harms avian respiratory systems but also damages vegetation that they depend on for food and shelter. These species may have benefited from the Clean Air act’s ozone restrictions in many regions—including the Smokies.\n\n“Ozone is considered a secondary pollutant,” said NPS Air Resource Specialist Jim Renfro, who works to reduce pollution and improve the Smokies air quality. “It’s not emitted directly by sources but formed by the reaction of sunlight on nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds.”\n\nMore:Word from the Smokies: New bee discovered after fire in Great Smoky Mountains\n\nRenfro says GSMNP has been monitoring ozone since the early 1980s. Five monitors throughout the park report data to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which measures compliance with its public health standards in terms of meeting (attainment) or not meeting (non-attainment) any particular standard.\n\n“The park was designated ‘non-attainment’ for violating the 1997 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standard,” he said. “The Tennessee-side of the park was part of the Knoxville non-attainment area; the North Carolina-side of the park—comprised of just the portions of Haywood and Swain Counties inside the park—was named ‘the Great Smoky Mountains National Park non-attainment area.’”\n\nThough the park doesn’t have exact numbers of bird species lost or preserved, it gets some good information from annual volunteer counts such as the Breeding Bird Survey and the Christmas Bird Count. Super said the park paid for an extensive baseline survey of birds in the 1990s, which has helped with an analysis of the impacts of prescribed fire on bird populations and communities and is being revisited for high-elevation birds Dr. Andrew Laughlin at University of North Carolina–Asheville.\n\nThe park has also benefited from a number of bird surveys by independent researchers, including Fred J. Alsop III whose work provides a long-term picture of the changes in the community of birds using the spruce-fir forest due to the loss of Fraser fir. “These retrospective studies—revisiting sites across a long period—will help us understand what is happening with our bird populations,” Super said.\n\nRenfro says ozone levels have dropped 39 percent since the late 1990s due to reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants, motor vehicles, and industrial sources throughout the U.S. The entire park was finally designated in ‘attainment’ by the EPA in 2015 for meeting the current standard. But GSMNP’s ozone levels remain under scrutiny to ensure the park stays in compliance.\n\nMore:Word from the Smokies: Wildlife biologist for Eastern Band of Cherokee comes 'full circle'\n\nRenfro’s air quality work and Super’s research facilitation are making big strides for the conservation of birds as well as for mammals, fish, reptiles, and amphibians. As the world continues to face species decline, it becomes more and more critical for land managers and scientists alike to collaborate to understand the causes of wildlife loss and discover solutions.\n\nFrances Figart is the editor of Smokies Life magazine and the Creative Services Director for the 34,000-member Great Smoky Mountains Association, an educational nonprofit partner of Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

Mark Stichert, the groundfish and shellfish fisheries management coordinator with the state’s fish and game department, said that more crab were being fished out of the oceans than could be naturally replaced.\n\n“So there were more removals from the population than there were inputs,” Stichert explained at Thursday’s meeting.\n\nBetween the surveys conducted in 2021 and 2022, he said, mature male snow crabs declined about 40%, with an estimated 45 million pounds left in the entire Bering Sea.\n\n“It’s a scary number, just to be clear,” Stichert said.\n\nBut calling the Bering Sea crab population “overfished” – a technical definition that triggers conservation measures – says nothing about the cause of its collapse.\n\n“We call it overfishing because of the size level,” Michael Litzow, the Kodiak lab director for NOAA Fisheries, told CNN. “But it wasn’t overfishing that caused the collapse, that much is clear.”\n\nLitzow says human-caused climate change is a significant factor in the crabs’ alarming disappearance.\n\nSnow crabs are cold-water species and found overwhelmingly in areas where water temperatures are below 2 degrees Celsius, Litzow says. As oceans warm and sea ice disappears, the ocean around Alaska is becoming inhospitable for the species.\n\n“There have been a number of attribution studies that have looked at specific temperatures in the Bering Sea or Bering Sea ice cover in 2018, and in those attribution studies, they’ve concluded that those temperatures and low-ice conditions in the Bering sea are a consequence of global warming,” Litzow said.\n\nTemperatures around the Arctic have warmed four times faster than the rest of the planet, scientists have reported. Climate change has triggered a rapid loss in sea ice in the Arctic region, particularly in Alaska’s Bering Sea, which in turn has amplified global warming.\n\n“Closing the fisheries due to low abundance and continuing research are the primary efforts to restore the populations at this point,” Ethan Nichols, an assistant area management biologist with the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, told CNN.\n\nStichert also said that there might be some “optimism for the future” as a few, small juvenile snow crabs are starting to appear in the system. But it could be at least three to four more years before they hit maturity and contribute to the regrowth of the population.\n\n“It is a glimmer of optimism,” Litzow said. “That’s better than not seeing them, for sure. We get a little bit warmer every year and that variability is higher in Arctic ecosystems and high latitude ecosystems, and so if we can get a cooler period that would be good news for snow crab.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2024/02/03/jane-fonda-urges-action-on-climate-crisis-in-colorado-state-university-talk-fort-collins/72196184007/", "title": "Jane Fonda urges action on climate crisis in talk at Colorado State", "text": "Democracy, in its truest sense, is the key to solving the climate crisis facing humankind, actor and activist Jane Fonda said Friday at Colorado State University.\n\n“This isn’t a partisan issue, this is a will-we-survive issue, and you can all have a big impact on it,” Fonda said in front of a live audience of about 500 students, faculty, staff and community members at the Lory Student Center Theatre and others watching a livestream on YouTube.

Entire ecosystems, habitats and species that have existed for many thousands and in some cases millions of years could disappear in a little as a few decades, thanks to the destructive greed and consumption of one culprit: us.\n\nHumans have burned, cut down, poisoned and torn their way through nature's resources and treasures at a much faster rate than the Earth can sustain. According to the latest Living Planet report, released by the World Wildlife Fund, humanity continues to consume natural resources at an alarming rate. The report says that our demands for the past 40 years have far exceeded what the Earth can replenish.\n\nAt the rate we're going, climate change, deforestation, mining, illegal consumption and even war could ensure that our grandchildren never see some of these natural wonders. And we might not just have to worry about the Earth's beautiful places and animals disappearing: In a new paper published by the journal Science, a group of scientists concluded that human activities \"are destabilizing the global environment.\"\n\nIn other words: We're in big trouble unless something changes.\n\nHere are some of the natural wonders of the world that have been endangered and damaged by humans:\n\n1. The Everglades\n\nThe Everglades National Park's fragile wetlands are home to a large number of birds, reptiles, water habitants, and threatened species. The Florida park is a UNESCO World Heritage site, and since 2010 UNESCO has included it in its list of endangered sites.\n\nEncroaching urban development, reduced water flow and pollution from farms have destroyed more than half of the original Everglades and continue to endanger the habitat with further decline.\n\n2. Amazon rainforest\n\nAs the world's largest tropical rainforest, the Amazon is home to millions of rare animal and plant species, one-fifth of the world's fresh water and more than 30 million people, including 350 indigenous groups.\n\nBut its breathtaking splendors are being threatened by a host of problems, including illegal logging, drought, soil erosion, water contamination, and, of course, old-fashioned climate change. Antonio Nobre, a researcher for Brazil's Earth System Science Center, has warned that both illegal logging and burning the forest to make way for agriculture are threatening its ability to regulate climate.\n\nAn estimated 20% of the forest is now clear, and Nobre warns that reaching 40% could turn the famed rainforest into an \"Amazon savannah.\"\n\nEnding deforestation in the Amazon is one step toward saving it, but even if that ended overnight, various rare species will still slowly die out as the loss of habitat continues to take its enormous toll on the region.\n\n3. Congo Basin\n\nIt's home to the world's second largest rainforest, and stretches across six countries: Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Republic of the Congo, Equatorial Guinea and Gabon.\n\nIllegal and industrial logging, mining, farming, ranching, illegal wildlife trade and guerrilla warfare continue to deplete and threaten the future of this vast wilderness region.\n\nAbundant in natural resources, the Congo Basin lost about 700,000 hectares of forest per year from 2000-2010, according to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\n4. Mount Everest\n\nClimate change has also taken a toll on the world's tallest summit, Mount Everest, resulting in a decrease in glaciers by 13% over the past 50 years, and the snowline shifting upward by several hundred feet.\n\nThe temperature in the Everest region has also increased by slightly more than 1 degree Fahrenheit. While this change may seem miniscule, even small increases in temperature can have devastating consequences, including melting glaciers leading to flooding, rock slides and avalanches that could further alter the snow-covered landscape and ecosystem.\n\n5. Dead Sea\n\nKnown for its low elevation, salted waters and the cornucopia of natural beauty products made from its raw, nutrient-rich minerals, the Dead Sea has been known by many names throughout history, including al-Bahr al-Mayyit in Arabic, Yam Hamelach in Hebrew, Bahr Lot and Lot's Sea.\n\nSadly, this historically significant natural wonder is yet another victim of human greed.\n\nNeighboring countries continue to tap into the Jordan River — the sea's sole source — for farming, agriculture and agricultural purposes, depleting the sea at a rapid rate. Pairing that with the extraction of minerals for potash and cosmetics companies, the Dead Sea's decline has only hastened. This continual pressure on the Dead Sea has resulted in its recession from the shore, the creation of dangerous sinkholes and its shrinking by more than 3 feet a year.\n\n6. Great Barrier Reef\n\nLarger than the United Kingdom and Ireland combined, Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef ecosystem in the world and home to more than 1,500 species of fish, one-third of the world's soft corals, 411 types of hard coral and a vibrant marine life.\n\nMarine scientists have warned that climate change will cause \"irreversible damage\" to this iconic heritage site by 2030 unless immediate action is taken. University of Queensland reef researcher Ove Hoegh-Guldberg told The Guardian \"it is highly unlikely that coral reefs will survive\" if the current average global temperatures continue at what he called the \"business as usual\" pace of hitting 4 degrees Celcius (39 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels.\n\n\"Even under the best-case scenario of 2C (35.6F), corals disappear,\" said Hoegh-Guldberg. \"But with business as usual, it's game over.\"\n\n7. Bamiyan Valley\n\nIncluded in UNESCO's World Heritage List and the List of World Heritage in Danger, the fragile yet beautiful Bamiyan Valley in Afghanistan continues to bear the scars of the country's lengthy war.\n\nSadly, the valley has suffered the brunt of military action with parts of it abandoned and others parts inaccessible due to the presence of antipersonnel mines.\n\nThis article originally appeared on GlobalPost.\n\nMORE FROM GLOBALPOST:\n\nGlobalPost is a USA TODAY content partner providing world news coverage.

But the rapid warming of the planet due to human emissions of heat-trapping gases is causing above average water temperatures, leading to stress events like mass bleaching.\n\nCoral bleaching tends to happen when water temperatures are much warmer than normal. But for the first time, this mass bleaching comes despite La Niña, a weather event which is characterized by cooler-than-normal temperatures across the equatorial Pacific Ocean, the Authority’s scientists said.\n\nThis picture taken on March 7 shows a diver swimming amongst the coral on the Great Barrier Reef, off the coast of the Australian state of Queensland.

This is the fourth mass bleaching event since 2016 and the sixth to occur on the Great Barrier Reef since 1998,” the Australian Government’s Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority said in its findings.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Drone footage captures thousands of turtles nesting 01:27 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef’s waters started warming in December 2021 and exceeded “historical summer maximums.” It was hit by three distinct heat waves throughout the summer until early April 2022, which increased “thermal stress” throughout the reef’s central and northern areas, the report found.\n\nStressed coral ejects algae from within its tissue, depriving it of a food source. If conditions don’t improve, coral can starve and die, turning white as its carbonate skeleton is exposed.\n\n“Even the most robust corals require nearly a decade to recover,” Jodie Rummer, associate professor of Marine Biology at James Cook University in Townsville, told CNN in March.\n\n“So we’re really losing that window of recovery. We’re getting back-to-back bleaching events, back-to-back heat waves. And the corals just aren’t adapting to these new conditions,” she said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback See Australia's Great Barrier Reef create new life in 'magical' spawning event 00:57 - Source: CNN\n\nThe report warned that the climate crisis remains the reef’s greatest threat and “events that cause disturbances on the reef are becoming more frequent.”\n\nIt’s the fourth mass bleaching in six years and the first since 2020, when about one quarter of the reef surveyed showed signs of severe bleaching. That event came just three years after back-to-back bleaching events in 2016 and 2017. Previous bleaching occurred in 1998 and 2002.\n\nScientists say time is running out for the reefs to be able to recover and that governments urgently need to address the root cause: the climate crisis.\n\nThis picture taken on March 7 shows the current condition of coral on the Great Barrier Reef, off the coast of the Australian state of Queensland.

As global temperature rises, Antarctica’s pristine landscape is already changing, and new research shows most of the region’s plant and animal species – including its iconic penguins – are in trouble.\n\nThe study published Thursday in the journal PLOS Biology found that 65% of Antarctica’s native species, emperor penguins top among them, will likely disappear by the end of the century if the world continues its business-as-usual ways and fails to rein in planet-warming fossil fuel emissions.\n\nThe study also showed that the current conservation efforts in Antarctica are not working on the rapidly changing continent. Researchers concluded implementing an extra layer of cost-effective strategies, which they lay out in the study, could save up to 84% of Antarctica’s vulnerable biodiversity.\n\n“Antarctica is not really contributing to climate change; there’s not a large-scale number of people living there, so the greatest threat to the continent is coming from outside the continent,” Jasmine Lee, lead author of the study, told CNN. “We really need global action on climate change, as well as some more local and regional conservation efforts, to give Antarctic species the best chance of surviving into the future.”\n\nEmperor penguin chicks waddle across the ice in Antarctica. Wolfgang Kaehler/LightRocket/Getty Images\n\nAntarctica’s geographic isolation has long protected the continent from the worsening impacts of the climate crisis and other environmental disasters that plague the rest of the world, such as wildfires, flooding, and drought. Scientists have already observed significant changes in its northern counterpart, the Arctic, which is warming four times faster than the rest of the planet.\n\nBut the impacts of climate change are just starting to emerge in Antarctica. Recent data, for example, suggests Antarctica’s sea ice is dropping more rapidly now than decades prior.\n\nThursday’s study shows that disappearing sea ice threatens several species of marine seabirds, like emperor and Adélie penguins, that rely on the ice from April through December to nest their little ones. If the ice melts earlier or freezes later in the season, as a result of rising temperatures, penguins struggle to complete their reproductive cycle.\n\n“These iconic species, like emperor penguins and Adélie penguins, are at risk and it’s really sad to think that Antarctica is one of the last great wildernesses on the planet and human impacts are being seen and felt there,” Lee said. “It’s just incredibly sad to think that we could drive those kinds of species towards extinction.”\n\nHuman presence and activity are also increasing in the region. The study shows that scientific expeditions and infrastructure are expanding, while annual tourist numbers have skyrocketed more than eight-fold since the 1990s.\n\nA separate study from earlier this year showed that increasing human presence in the region is causing more snow melt. Scientists found black carbon – the dark, dusty pollution that comes from burning fossil fuels – settling in locations where people spend a lot of time. Even the tiniest amount of this pollutant can have a significant impact on melting.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nTourists taking pictures of a Barbijo penguin on Half Moon island in Antarctica in 2019.

And finding the funds for conservation can be challenging.\n\nBut the study lays out several measures that are actually cost-effective, with an estimated cost of $1.92 billion over the next 83 years, or around $23 million per year – a fraction of the global economy.\n\nThese strategies include minimizing and managing human activity, transport and new infrastructure, as well as protecting native species while also controlling non-native species and diseases that enter the region.\n\nIt also includes a focus on external policies, like achieving the broader international climate goals under the 2015 Paris Agreement, which aim to reduce planet-warming emissions and stave off a dire rise in global temperature.\n\nAdelie penguins on sea ice in East Antarctica in 2010.

It “makes crystal clear that current conservation strategies are insufficient at doing anything beyond supporting the decline of biodiversity.”\n\nThe latest research comes days after negotiators at the UN biodiversity summit in Montreal reached a landmark agreement to better protect the planet’s vital ecosystems, including a pledge to protect 30% of land and oceans by 2030.\n\nWith the climate crisis now the most pervasive threat to Antarctic biodiversity, Lee said influencing global policy is needed more than ever to save one of Earth’s vast, pristine biomes.\n\n“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” Lee said. “We’re at this huge turning point now not just for Antarctica, but globally, when it comes to climate. We’ve got the opportunity to stop it and if we don’t do something now, then the impacts are going to be much, much worse than what they could be.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/12/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/06/21/alzheimers-jack-hanna-columbus-zoo-david-letterman-animal-guy/70342408007/", "title": "Jack Hanna: How Alzheimer's is stripping away the man the world ...", "text": "BIGFORK, Mont. – As a sunset paints the sky pink on his Montana family farm, Jack Hanna sneaks a chunk of pizza to his golden retriever when a man approaches to greet him.\n\n“Hi Jack,” the family guest says. “It’s a pleasure to meet you.”\n\nThe longtime zookeeper’s famous smile fades into curiosity.\n\n“Where are you from?” Jack asks between bites.\n\n“Columbus, Ohio,” the family guest says.\n\nJack Hanna built the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium into one of the nation's best. He then captivated national audiences on David Letterman’s late-night talk show, \"Good Morning America\" and a number of his own Emmy-winning animal series that still run in syndication. He traveled the globe as a leading animal conservationist promoting Columbus. It was his home for decades. It’s even where he once said he wanted his ashes spread whenever he passes away.\n\nBut in this moment, none of that history feels familiar.\n\nJack pauses, then asks a question. “Have I ever been to Columbus, Ohio?”\n\nThe Jack Hanna the world once knew is gone.\n\nAt age 76, Alzheimer’s disease has stripped away his memory and the life he led in the public eye for almost a half century. He was first diagnosed in the fall of 2019 with early Alzheimer's but now the disease has advanced to the point where he doesn't know most of his own family.\n\nGone is the old Jack who enchanted nearly everyone he met with his Tennessee farm boy charm and endless funny stories. Gone are the khakis and the worn, leather outback hat that he made famous around the globe.\n\nThe Jack that remains now only remembers his wife Suzi, his dog Brassy and, at times, his oldest daughter Kathaleen when she travels nearly 5,000 miles from England to care for her dad. He spends hours baking himself in the sun on the back deck of his lakeside home. He asks Suzi a couple dozen times a day if she has fed the dog. He worries that the air coming out the vents might be hurting the house or the lights on the Christmas tree might catch everything on fire.\n\nOnce, Jack complained to Suzi that he had gone blind. He kept forgetting he had inserted his contact lenses and his doctor discovered he ended up with five in each eye.\n\nQ&A:Families combating Alzheimer's disease are not alone. What you need to know\n\nJack looks close to the same man who the public adored. But his frame is about 20 pounds lighter, his skin is a darker shade of tan, he wears black-framed glasses to avoid another contact mishap, and the eternal smile has been replaced by a strained, vacant expression. On most days, he dresses himself in jeans, a T-shirt, and an old, tattered, tan baseball hat with a rhino patch from his time working at the Columbus Zoo.\n\nThe couple of 54 years used to travel the world together, but for about two years, their life has been contained to a 30-mile radius in Northwest Montana centered around their house and 50-acre farm.\n\nIn Jack's mind, even the slightest change to his daily routine is the enemy. The continuity of his routine calms a man who has little memory of his previous life. Disruptions to it can cause outbursts of frustration or even anger, usually toward Suzi.\n\nHe and Suzi live the same day over and over. Jack is restless at night and often doesn’t fall asleep until 2 a.m. or later – a common experience for those with Alzheimer's. He rises mid-morning and eats the same breakfast – a bowl of blueberries, three scrambled eggs with cheese in the middle, bacon, tomatoes and two waffles with butter and lots of syrup. They take a late-morning, 2-mile walk. And until very recently, they would visit their farm to feed their two donkeys, but the upkeep is simply too much, so the farm went up for sale last month. There isn’t much else to their days except for Jack slowly moving around the house constantly checking the front door to see if it's locked or inside the washing machine but no one knows why.\n\n“My husband is still in there somewhere,” Suzi said. “There are still those sweet, tender moments – you know, pieces of him that made me and the rest of the world fall in love with him. It’s hard. Real hard some days. But he took care of me all those years, and so it’s my turn to take care of him.”\n\nThis is the first time the Hanna family has spoken publicly about their struggle with a disease that afflicts an estimated 6.7 million people in the United States, according to the Alzheimer's Association. There are about 24 million people worldwide living with Alzheimer's, according to the National Institute on Aging. It is the seventh leading cause of death for adults in the U.S. and is the most common cause of dementia among people over 65, according to the NIA.\n\nThe Hannas are telling Jack's story because they want other families to know they are not alone when the struggle with Alzheimer's feels overwhelming.\n\n“If this helps even one other family, it’s more than worth sharing dad’s story,” Kathaleen said. “He spent a lifetime helping everyone he could. He will never know it or understand it, but he is still doing it now.”\n\nOne walk at a time\n\nA few steps into their daily hike on the river trail about 5 miles from his home, Jack stops at the first tree he sees.\n\n\"Hello tree, you are a pretty tree,\" Jack says. \"I love you tree. God bless.\"\n\nA few steps later he touches the leaves on the next tree and holds his hands out in front of it like a preacher performing a blessing in church. What it means only Jack knows.\n\nA few steps after that, he touches another three. Then another and another. Sometimes Jack tempts fate and scares both Suzi and Kathaleen by reaching too far over the rocky, tree-lined ledge where the Swan River races about 50 feet below.\n\nJack is asked why he touches all the trees, but he just says he loves them and continues down the path.\n\nSuzi said the scene repeats itself nearly every day. It takes more than an hour to go a mile because of all the stops, but Suzi, who is 75, doesn’t care. Jack can still walk pretty well for a man with two knee replacements and Alzheimer’s, and the hikes remind her of the life they used to have. The life that took them all over the world together, giving them experiences with both animals and people from cultures around the world that they couldn't dream about when they fell in love as college sweethearts at Muskingum College.\n\n“I want to hold on to these walks as long as I can,” Suzi said. “I remember the day this all officially started. The day the doctor told us what it was. I’ve just tried to hang on to the little pieces of Jack since then.”\n\nIt was Oct. 3, 2019, when Jack Hanna started shaking his head back and forth in defiance the instant Dr. Douglas Scharre told him he had Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n“No way,” Jack said. “I don’t have that.”\n\nJack had every rationalization at the ready.\n\nIt was just old age. He was famous, even beloved, for his 20-second attention span. He always knew he had attention deficit disorder. His life went 100 mph. He was used to traveling more than 200 days a year. All those tests the doctor had him take must be wrong. Jack always said he was never good at taking tests in school.\n\nScharre, a neurologist and Alzheimer’s specialist at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, was kind and positive while explaining the diagnosis to Jack, Suzi, and their daughters, Julie and Suzanne.\n\nScharre explained that the mild cognitive impairment had transformed now into full Alzheimer's. He told the family there was no doubt in his mind that the symptoms that he traced back to 2017 were Alzheimer’s.\n\nJulie cried in disbelief. Suzanne hurt for her dad but wasn’t surprised at all because she had seen symptoms in the past year. Suzi did what she could to comfort Jack, but his mood quickly darkened.\n\nHe lowered his head, stared at the floor and continued to cast doubt on the diagnosis as the devastation set in.\n\n“I know my brain doesn’t work so good sometimes, but I’m OK,” Jack said. “No way, I got this.”\n\nJack didn’t use the word Alzheimer’s that day.\n\nIn fact, he has never uttered it, and those around him didn’t dare use it either.\n\nJack didn’t want the world to know.\n\nAnd when they went back home that night, he made Suzi promise no one outside their family would ever find out.\n\nSuzi said Jack was worried that if the public found out he had the disease his career would be over, and he wasn't ready to stop working.\n\n“People will think I’m dumb, Sue,” Jack said. “We can’t tell anyone Sue. Promise me.”\n\nSuzi vowed to her husband she would keep the diagnosis secret.\n\nThe family didn’t ask Scharre about life expectancy. But the Alzheimer’s expert said that people with Jack’s diagnosis live typically between eight and 12 years after first showing symptoms.\n\nScharre said Jack’s reaction was not out of the ordinary.\n\n“It was fairly typical, nothing dramatic,” Scharre said. “Most Alzheimer’s patients have a bit of denial. The thinking is, ‘Yeah, I am a little forgetful, but so is everyone else.’”\n\nBut the reality is those within Jack’s world already suspected he had something much more than forgetfulness in the months before his diagnosis.\n\nJack's family and friends said there were times leading up to the diagnosis when Jack would forget what city he was in or what he was doing that day. When he would get on stage for his traveling animal shows, he would sometimes forget names and even details about the animals that were his life. Few on the planet had more passion for educating the public about the animals and taking them to their habitats through the power of his television shows.\n\nThere was another time in early 2019 when he was supposed to introduce an old friend who was receiving an award. But when he got on stage, he forgot why he was there.\n\nHis family, friends and those who worked with Jack would cover for him by speaking for him or reminding him where he was or what he was supposed to be doing at that moment.\n\nThey were used to Jack’s mind racing from one thing to the next without worrying about details, but this was something different.\n\nGuy Nickerson, Jack’s longtime friend and business partner, first noticed Jack’s decline while they were producing some of the last episodes of Jack’s popular \"Into the Wild\" television show in the fall of 2018. On a trip in Rwanda, Nickerson explained to Jack all of the details of who they were meeting and when they were going to see the gorillas. Three minutes later, Jack asked Nickerson the questions he had already answered. Suzi constantly tried to cover for him during filming, but there was only so much she could do.\n\nOn Jack’s last major international trip to South Africa in November of 2019, Nickerson said the man he considers to be somewhere between a father and a brother because of the close relationship, just wasn’t there anymore.\n\n“We had an interview set up with a legend in the animal world and a good friend of Jack’s, and when it started, Jack didn’t know who he was talking with,” said Nickerson, who lives in Tampa, Florida.\n\n“I never said a word to Suzi or Jack, but that felt like the beginning of the end. I didn’t know about the diagnosis until the rest of the world, but I knew something medically had to be wrong. I love Jack so much; it was so hard to watch all of that.”\n\nShortly after the Alzheimer’s diagnosis, Jack quietly started making plans to retreat from public life. His last theater performance with animals on stage was in March 2020, and the COVID pandemic canceled about a half dozen more shows. He publicly announced his plan to retire from the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium after 42 years in June 2020. He formally retired on Dec. 31, 2020.\n\nBack on their river trail walk, Kathaleen tears up recalling how hard it was for her parents to give up their public life while hiding the reason for it.\n\n“He would have worked until the day he died. He only retired due to the Alzheimer’s,” Kathaleen said. “He was embarrassed by it. He lived in fear the public would find out.”\n\n'My teeth are fine'\n\nThe second Jack hears the word dentist, he gets back in the car.\n\nHe needs a permanent crown on one tooth and a cavity dealt with on another.\n\nHe won’t budge from the car seat until Suzi lies to him. She convinces him that she is the one who needs to see the dentist, and he is going to hold her hand.\n\nThe soft, caring husband comes out for a few minutes until Jack sees the dentist chair.\n\nHe knows he is really today’s patient and glares at his wife.\n\n“Sue, my teeth are fine,” Jack says in a rising voice. “Let go home. We have to feed the dog.”\n\nSuzi and the dentist coax Jack into the chair, where he continues to protest over and over.\n\nSuzi holds Jack’s hand as the dentist inserts the needle into Jack’s gum.\n\nThe dentist uses the same gentleness he would with a toddler, but Jack squeals in pain and tries to get out of the chair until Suzi calms him and the numbing takes hold.\n\nSuzi and Kathaleen each take shifts comforting Jack, who manages to stay in the chair for more than two hours while his teeth are fixed.\n\nSuzi hates seeing her husband in pain and hates lying even more, but the family has been through far worse.\n\n“If we can get through the week we had a couple years ago, we can get through anything,” Suzi said. “I’m so glad Jack didn’t know what happened. It would have crushed him.”\n\nPerfect storm\n\nOn March 25, 2021, doctors removed another tumor from Jack's daughter's spine, fearing if they didn’t, she would no longer be able to walk.\n\nJulie Hanna almost died from leukemia in 1977 when she was 2 years old. Jack has said helplessly watching doctors try to save her while watching behind a glass wall was among the worst moments of his life. The primitive radiation available back then saved Julie, but it has caused a lifetime of chronic pain, tumors and surgeries.\n\nBut this time, her father wasn’t able to even be at the hospital. The Alzheimer’s had advanced to the point where Jack didn’t really understand what was happening to his youngest daughter.\n\nThen, as Julie continued to suffer severe pain, the Hanna family was suddenly thrust into a new fight – this one for Jack’s legacy.\n\nOn March 29, 2021, The Columbus Dispatch, a member of the USA TODAY Network, reported that Tom Stalf, former zoo president and CEO; and Greg Bell, former chief financial officer, resigned after an investigation by the newspaper detailed their extensive personal use of zoo resources. The zoo's board eventually conducted forensic audits, which confirmed improper spending and questionable business practices by the former top two executives, resulting in more than $630,000 in zoo losses. Stalf and other top executives eventually agreed to pay back hundreds of thousands of dollars to the zoo.\n\nJack hadn’t been an active director of the zoo since 1992 and wasn’t directly involved in the zoo executive controversy.\n\nBut he did have a close relationship with Stalf. And he helped Stalf join the zoo as its chief operating officer in 2010.\n\nJulie, who is now 48, was finally released from the hospital on April 3, 2021 and taken to the Hanna family home just outside the zoo.\n\nWhile the family cared for her and tried to digest the zoo controversy, the next blow was delivered.\n\nThe Hannas learned on the morning of April 5, 2021, that a new documentary called “The Conversation Game” was being released to the public. It alleged that the baby tigers and snow leopards that sat in Jack’s lap on late-night talk shows often didn’t come from the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium and didn’t end up there when the cameras stopped rolling.\n\nInstead, the documentary says, the animals were shuffled among backyard breeders and unaccredited roadside zoos that were compared to “animal prisons” in some cases. The filmmakers say Jack and other celebrity animal conservationists actively misrepresented where the exotic cats came from and where they were going, leading the public to believe they were moving between accredited facilities.\n\nThe Columbus Zoo eventually lost its accreditation for almost 18 months as part of the fallout.\n\nIn the view of some close to the Hannas, the documentary made it seem like Jack didn’t care if animals were being taken from and returned to places where they were abused or neglected.\n\nThe next two days would be among the worst the Hanna family said they ever experienced.\n\nThere were tears and anger and debates on how to handle it all.\n\nKathaleen, the protector of the family, wanted to rush out in front of the television cameras and defend her father. But others thought that would only add more fuel to the story. They decided not to watch the documentary – ever.\n\nKathaleen said Jack wasn't aware of any of the controversy.\n\n“It was hell – absolute hell,” Kathaleen said. “He would never knowingly allow animals to suffer. They created a narrative around my dad that isn’t true, and he couldn’t defend himself. My dad would have faced all this head on like he always did. In hindsight, we all wish things had been handled better by the people working with my dad. And yes, it’s fair to say my dad should have known more about the animals. But he was always moving so fast. He would have wanted every animal to be safe and returned to a safe environment. He dedicated most of his life to protecting animals. It was all so heartbreaking.”\n\nJerry Borin had a front row seat for Jack the showman for almost 40 years.\n\nThey met back in 1984 when Jerry was working in the Columbus Parks and Recreation Department and Jack was transforming the Columbus Zoo from a dilapidated place few visited to a world-class destination for those who loved animals.\n\nBorin was the zoo’s executive director from 1993 to 2008, and then after the zoo executives resigned in 2021, Borin was brought back to be the zoo’s interim CEO for about eight months.\n\nBorin said when he returned to the zoo in 2021, he stepped into a mess surrounding the accreditation issue.\n\nHe said the records or paper trail left behind by those who were responsible for acquiring and tracking the animals was \"not good.\" He said it’s fair to criticize his long-time friend for not paying attention to where some of the animals he used on television came from.\n\n“The records I saw weren’t good,” Borin said. “Jack just didn’t do details. But I don’t think Jack knew what was happening. If someone had told him face to face the animals were coming from unaccredited places, I believe he would have fixed it. It was a massive crisis for sure, but the zoo has recovered and is thriving.”\n\nJack had no idea the controversies were unfolding, and family members took turns keeping him away from the television. But one evening, Jack saw his own picture on the screen and started riddling Suzi with angry questions.\n\nHe thought Suzi had betrayed him and told the media about the Alzheimer’s.\n\n“He just kept saying, ‘Sue, you told them, didn’t you? You promised me Sue, you promised,’” Suzi said. “It would have broken Jack’s heart to hear what was going on at the zoo. If we had tried to tell him, he wouldn’t have understood.”\n\nBut finally, with some demanding a public response from Jack, the family decided they had no choice.\n\nIt was time to tell the world about Jack’s Alzheimer’s. And, yes, the family was aware that some would accuse them of exaggerating Jack’s condition as a way to hide from the media.\n\nKathaleen had lobbied for a long time to go public, but Suzi didn’t want to betray Jack’s wishes. His legacy, however, was more important.\n\nOn April 7, 2021, the family issued a short statement announcing that Jack had Alzheimer’s.\n\nIn the following days, the Hanna family heard from many offering their sympathies.\n\nThat included the celebrity Jack was associated with the most – David Letterman.\n\nOn that call with Letterman, Jack retold a famous story about a beaver from the show. He repeated it to Letterman about four times.\n\nLetterman understood what the family was dealing with and at one point used the word Alzheimer’s while the call was on speakerphone. That caused Suzi to run into the other room, fearing her husband would hear the word they never used.\n\nTo this day, Jack doesn’t know his family told the public he has Alzheimer’s.\n\n“It killed me,” Suzi said, “to break that promise.”\n\nFamily therapy\n\nThe four women to whom Jack devoted his life are all crying when he takes a mid-afternoon break from the Montana sun and shuffles back into the kitchen.\n\nHis wife Suzi is sitting at the table with Kathaleen, while Suzanne and Julie are on the phone from Suzanne’s home in Cincinnati.\n\nJack takes a seat at the end of the table and starts eating a bowl of grapes. He is oblivious to his daughter Suzanne talking about what it feels like to be the first forgotten by him.\n\nHis wife and daughters said Jack's Alzheimer’s has now gone from moderate to advanced.\n\n“He just stopped remembering who I was in all ways,” Suzanne tells her mom and sisters. “Whether it was in person or by phone, he had no idea I was his daughter. I think it’s because he didn’t see me as much because I got married so young and I moved away.”\n\nSuzi hears the pain in her daughter’s voice and attempts to see if Jack can remember Suzanne.\n\n“Jack, Suzanne is on the phone. She is your daughter; can you say hello?” Suzi asks. “Can you tell her you love her?”\n\nJack has no clue who is on the other end of the phone. But eventually he speaks.\n\n“I love you too, sweetie,” he says. “Have fun.”\n\nSuzi is now sobbing and tells Suzanne she wishes she was there in Montana to give her a hug.\n\nWhat they dubbed family therapy continues for hours. They share raw feelings with one another they never have before.\n\nThe responsibility of caring for Jack around the clock weighs on all. Julie feels helpless that her own health problems prevent her from caring for her dad.\n\nSuzanne, 50, has four grown children and helps care for Julie and wishes she could make more trips than she has to Montana. Her dad hasn’t been able attend two of her kids' weddings nor has he met his only great grandchild.\n\nKathaleen, 53, who appeared with her dad on his television shows as a young girl, has two teenagers and a husband back in England. She has traveled across an ocean more times than she can count, juggling two lives to help Suzi care for her dad.\n\nSuzi is reluctant to share with her daughters how hard it is to care for Jack alone, not wanting them to think she can’t handle it. The night Jack threw his back out, for example, he couldn’t get off the floor and Suzi struggled to get him up alone.\n\nJack takes several medications multiple times a day to combat his Alzheimer’s symptoms. Tracking all of them and making sure he consumes them is a part-time job by itself for Suzi.\n\nYet, Suzi refuses to let home health care providers come in and help her when her daughters can’t be there.\n\nThis frustrates and even angers Kathaleen, who has begged her mom for more than a year to get help. Kathaleen has even arranged for more help, only to have her mom cancel it.\n\n“Mom you are 75 now, this is killing you,” Kathaleen says to Suzi. “Let us give you some more help. We have the money. And you need this.”\n\nSuzi brushes aside the plea.\n\nKathaleen turns to her sister Suzanne for backup, but she doesn’t wade into the loving brawl.\n\n“I am Switzerland,” Suzanne says. “Remember?”\n\n“That’s why you are the favorite,” Suzi says, which sparks laughter from all three daughters.\n\n“Thank God we all get along, right?” Kathaleen says in between tears.\n\nThroughout it all, Jack stares out toward the beautiful lake and is halfway through another bowl of grapes.\n\n“I just want it to be your dad and I for as long as I can,” Suzi said.\n\nLasting legacy\n\nThe morning is about half over when Jack emerges from his bedroom bare-chested, wearing only jeans and a heavy lathering of shaving cream on his face.\n\nHe stops, looks around the room, and flashes a sheepish smile at Suzi and his guests, who can’t help but laugh.\n\nThis is a planned performance; one he repeats from time to time pretending to be Santa Claus.\n\n“The showman is still in there somewhere,” Suzi said. “Jack loved making people laugh as much as he loved taking care of animals.\"\n\nThere was a time when Jack couldn't take three steps in Columbus or almost anywhere else in the world without someone asking for an autograph, wanting a selfie, or telling him that they watched him on television while they were growing up.\n\nAt the Memorial Tournament in Dublin, Ohio, Jack would get more attention from the fans than the famous golfers – even Tiger Woods.\n\nAnd Jack would have a pleasant greeting or more for every single person who approached him. Their age or skin color or cultural background didn't matter to Jack. And he left no one out. If he signed autographs for servers in a restaurant, he would walk back into the kitchen to say hello to the cooks and dishwashers.\n\n“Jack's legacy is that he was one of the greatest animal advocates the world has ever seen,” said his friend Borin. “He might have done more to help people than the animals. And the public still loves Jack for all of it.\"\n\nNow when Jack walks into a restaurant in or near this Montana town of about 5,000, the locals might offer a friendly hello, but they give Jack and Suzi their space. Those who know Jack is living with Alzheimer's wait for the right moment to give Suzi a hug of support and tell her to hang in there as the main caretaker.\n\nShortly after finishing his second piece of cheesecake, Jack is eager to head back home.\n\nHe is worried Brassy doesn't have enough food and wants a few more hours of baking in the sun.\n\nSuzi caresses her husband's forehead to counter the anxiety.\n\nAlzheimer's is commonly called the long goodbye as family and friends watch their loved one slowly fade away over time. Suzi has no idea how much longer her goodbye will last with Jack. She tries not to think about the more difficult days ahead – or when it might end.\n\n\"The river, the sun, Brassy, our walks. ... That's what we have left,\" Suzi said. \"The Jack people knew isn't here anymore, but pieces of my husband are. And I'm going to hang onto them for as long as I can.\"\n\nWagner can be reached at mwagner@dispatch.com or on Twitter @MikeWagner48.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/19/middleeast/arabian-leopards-oman-conservation-spc-intl/index.html", "title": "The world's smallest leopard is clinging to life in the mountains of ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: This story was identified by Call to Earth guest editor Erika Cuéllar. She is a biologist and conservationist, and a Rolex Award Laureate.\n\nCNN —\n\nHigh up in the Jabal Samhan Nature Reserve, the world’s smallest big cat stands at a precipice.\n\nThe mountainous reserve in Dhofar, southern Oman, is a world away from the nearby city of Salalah, which looks out over the Arabian Sea. Every year, far below, the coastal desert goes through a spectacular transformation, turning green in the summer monsoon and filling with temporary lakes, rivers and waterfalls. But the phenomenon doesn’t touch these elevations. Up on Jabal Samhan it’s arid and hostile, and it’s here the Arabian leopard calls home.\n\nOf the world’s eight leopard subspecies, the Arabian leopard is among the rarest, and it’s thought fewer than 200 adults live in the wild, says Urs Breitenmoser, co-chair of the Cat Specialist Group at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, that figure is uncertain – data is hard to come by for this elusive creature, more often viewed through a camera trap than with the naked eye.\n\nThe leopard once lived across the Arabian Peninsula, but today the IUCN lists only Oman, Yemen, Saudi Arabia and possibly Israel as its range – and there have been no recent sightings in either Saudi Arabia or Israel. Human-wildlife conflict, the hunting of its prey species and habitat loss are all factors in the Arabian leopard’s precipitous decline.\n\nThe big cat is vulnerable to extinction, but dedicated conservationists are working to ensure it doesn’t share the fate of the lion and the cheetah in the region, and continues to have a future.\n\nThe Arabian leopard’s last stronghold\n\ncourtesy Hadi Al Hikmani/CNN\n\nOman is thought to have the largest population of Arabian leopards and Dhofar is home to around 50 adults living in the mountain ranges of Jabal Samhan, Jabal Qara and Jabal Qamar, according to Hadi Al Hikmani, manager of environmental affairs at the Office for the Conservation of the Environment in Salalah, part of the Environment Authority. The largest single population comprises 20 to 30 adults inside the 4,500 square kilometer (1,737 square mile) Jabal Samhan Nature Reserve, he says.\n\n“It’s very shy,” says Al Hikmani, who last saw a leopard in the flesh two years ago. A leopard can roam over 150 square kilometers (58 square miles), and with only 20 community rangers monitoring the species in the reserve, sightings are rare. “The only way to study these animals is by technology, whether it’s camera trapping or genetic sampling (often via scats),” he says.\n\nHistorically, pastoralists poisoned, shot and trapped leopards to protect their livestock. However killing a leopard or its prey, such as the Arabian oryx or Arabian gazelle, has been illegal in Oman since 1976.\n\nToday Oman is at the forefront of Arabian leopard protection. In 2014, the government launched a program to compensate farmers for lost livestock. It has proved effective, says Al Hikmani. But perhaps more so has been the education program that was rolled out to change attitudes towards the leopard.\n\n“We don’t want to punish people,” he says. “We want to work together with these people to protect this animal.”\n\ncourtesy Hadi Al Hikmani/CNN\n\nAl Hikmani is a walking example of a generational shift towards conservation. His father is one of the few people still herding camels around Jabal Samhan. “Forty years ago, he wouldn’t have hesitated to shoot a leopard. Now his son is leading their only leopard initiative on the ground,” explains Andrew Spalton.\n\nSpalton, a retired conservationist and former advisor of environmental affairs in Oman, first met a young Al Hikmani during fieldwork in the 1990s. The scientist needed a camel to carry his equipment, and the Omani guided beast and burden up Jabal Samhan. After finishing school, Al Hikmani went on to volunteer for Spalton’s Arabian Leopard Survey and later work for the government in conservation, gain a PhD, and co-author books on the leopard and Oman’s wildlife. “He’s a great success story,” Spalton says.\n\nSuccess is also a word tentatively used in relation to the Arabian leopard in Oman. The population, though small, is relatively stable and shows signs of expanding its range. Prey like the ibex and gazelle are bouncing back in Dhofar. However, Al Hikmani cautions that “there is still a lot of work to be done” to secure the species’ future.\n\nThe situation outside of Oman\n\nElsewhere, the Arabian leopard’s prospects in the wild are more uncertain.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, where the last recorded sighting of a leopard in the wild was one poisoned in 2014, it’s “quite certain by now that there is no reproducing population left,” according to Breitenmoser of the IUCN. But efforts are underway to bring the leopard back. The Royal Commission for AlUla (RCU) has committed $25 million to revitalize the kingdom’s indigenous leopard population and established the Arabian Leopard Fund to support conservation region-wide. Spalton is assisting big cat charity and RCU partner Panthera in surveying Saudi Arabia for wild leopards (none have been spotted so far), while a captive breeding program is building a population that could one day be reintroduced into the wild. The latest of 16 cubs was born last April.\n\nIn Aprll 2021, the latest of 16 cubs was born in captivity in Taif, Saudi Arabia as part of the kingdom's Arabian leopard breeding program. The Royal Commission for AlUla\n\nIn Yemen, the ongoing war has thwarted scientific fieldwork. The only recent evidence of Arabian leopards is via harrowing images and videos of dead leopards shared on social media, and in one case, footage of a leopard captured alive. “We simply don’t know whether there are a good number of leopards left (in Yemen),” says Spalton.\n\nIn 2015, the IUCN listed only a small pocket of Israel as “possibly” part of the Arabian leopard’s range. A 2006 study found evidence of just eight leopards and there have been no reports of recent sightings, though it has not been declared extinct in the country to date.\n\nA regionwide reassessment of the Arabian leopard by the IUCN is underway, which aims to redefine the subspecies’ range and provide new insights as to just how rare this critically endangered animal has become.\n\n“We need skilled personnel on the ground”\n\nThe Arabian leopard is one of eight leopard subspecies. Courtesy Hadi Al Hikmani\n\nIn the meantime, Al Hikmani is looking to shore up the leopard’s future in Oman. In 2021, the country announced a second protected area in Dhofar, close to the Yemen border, providing further sanctuary for the leopard.\n\nAl Hikmani also has his sights set on training up more homegrown conservationists. “We need skilled personnel on the ground,” he says, adding that community rangers have excellent local knowledge but lack scientific know-how. He’s drawing up plans to offer scholarships for professional training to empower Omanis living alongside leopards to contribute to scientific fieldwork.\n\nMeanwhile, boosting ecotourism could bring jobs and generate incomes for local communities, says Spalton (even if, he adds, the closest encounter a tourist might get with a leopard is hearing its call – if they’re lucky).\n\nThe end goal is creating a framework – both scientific and economic – in which the mistakes of the past cannot be repeated.\n\n“(We’ve) already lost some of our endemic and iconic species,” says Al Hikmani. “We don’t want to lose the leopard.”", "authors": ["Thomas Page"], "publish_date": "2022/01/19"}]}

Resolute, and resilient, this earth sign is not quite like any other.\n\nTaurus horoscope:Take a look at the week ahead\n\nWondering how to spot a Taurus and what you should know about them?\n\nIn conversation with astrologer Cleo Neptune, USA TODAY explores what makes a Taurus a Taurus, their key personality traits, romantic tendencies, strengths and weaknesses. \"I definitely thought it was just some gimmick in a newspaper ad,\" Neptune tells me of their own journey to loving astrology, \"But once I discovered the depth of astrology, the planets, the asteroids, and how it can help me explain my life experiences, I started to take it seriously.\"\n\nLearn more about each Zodiac sign\n\nPisces | Aquarius | Capricorn | Sagittarius | Scorpio | Libra | Virgo | Leo | Cancer | Gemini | Taurus | Aries\n\nIs it in the stars? Free Daily and Monthly Horoscopes\n\nWhen does Taurus season start?\n\nThe dates of Taurus season run from April 20 to May 20. Taurus is an earth sign and is signified by the bull.\n\nKey personality traits of Taurus\n\nTauruses get a bad rap for being stubborn, but Neptune tells me, unfortunately, the stereotype is very much true. \"When I think of Taurus, I think about the terrible twos,\" he jokes. Tauruses are very fixed in their ways, he says, describing them as creatures of habit that can sometimes get stuck.\n\nTaurus being ruled by Venus, the planet of pleasure, means they are a sign that enjoys the finer things in life, Neptune explains. They are very generous as well, not sharing their own bounty but always bringing along something for you so you can enjoy it together. \"Venus rules over gifts,\" Neptune says, both giving and receiving. \"They want everyone to enjoy the pleasure that they are experiencing.\"\n\nTauruses crave comfort, he explains, so they often settle down and stay in one place, making sure to adorn their home with plenty of those finer things.\n\nCareer\n\nBecause Tauruses are very fixed in nature, they might bring something different to the workplace, Neptune says, if only because in so many other areas of their lives they have been doing the same thing.\n\nNeptune describes Tauruses as efficient, if only because they want to get a task done quickly and be rid of it. Just like in other areas of their lives, in their careers, Tauruses run the risk of getting stuck. \"When it's time for change, they're extremely resistant to that,\" Neptune explains.\n\nAs coworkers, Tauruses are great mentors and champions of others in the workplace, though they keep those relationships professional and don't cross the line into friendship. \"Because they've just been there for so long and they look so comfortable people want to come to them with questions,\" Neptune says of Tauruses.\n\nRelationships\n\nFor Tauruses, when it comes to acquaintances, Neptune describes their approach as a \"free for all\" not very intentional or organized. But for their inner circle, best friends and partners, a Taurus needs someone who is a ride or die.\n\n\"They're kind of scorpionic in their close relationships,\" Neptune explains, \"they need someone who they know will have their back.\" They need someone they can feel safe around, who shows up for them in a tangible way, and who they can entrust with their emotions and trust won't embarrass them.\n\nIn romantic relationships, Tauruses are very much the providers, Neptune says, describing them as real gift-givers, but not always in a 'luxurious' way. Their gift-giving doesn't center around the price tag, it's more about noticing the small things and remembering them.\n\nTauruses are also sensory beings, Neptune explains, calling them sensual partners and lovers who are very touchy-feely but only with those whom they care for deeply. Because of their natural magnetism, people sometimes want to be physical with them. They will be highly put off by this, making themselves seem standoffish to avoid such contact.\n\nTaurus Zodiac sign compatibility\n\nTaurus is compatible with other Earth signs and with some Water signs.\n\nAstrologer Cleo Neptune advises that Tauruses can go well with:\n\nPisces\n\nLibra\n\nVirgo\n\nA Taurus and Pisces know can relax around each other, Neptune says, so they find an easy connection.\n\nAs for Taurus and Libra, they are both ruled by Venus which makes the connection strong.\n\nTaurus and Virgo, belonging to the same element, are both a similar kind of \"earth sign critical,\" Neptune jokes, which makes it easy for them to find shared perspectives.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAside from an innate stubbornness, Tauruses can also be too fixed in their ways, Neptune says.\n\nThough their identity as creatures of habit can help them to tailor a comfortable environment, it can also mean that they can get stuck in it, refusing to break from a traditional approach to something or remaining in the same place for too long.\n\nSince their magnetism can attract even those that they do not hope to attract, Tauruses can also be standoffish and appear unapproachable on purpose.\n\nGiven their love for the finer things in life, Tauruses can sometimes project an air of elitism, Neptune explains.\n\nStrengths\n\nTauruses tend to have very nice voices, Neptune says. As Taurus rules the throat in astrology, their tone is usually smooth.\n\nThey are excellent gift-givers and thoughtful partners. Tauruses have a similar magnetism to Scorpios, Neptune explains.\n\nThey are observant and generous, often showing their love with gifts personally tailored to a partner or friend's desires. As friends, Tauruses are also dedicated and loyal, not trusting many but putting tremendous effort into their inner circle.\n\nNew to Astrology? We've got you covered.

Rival captain Isis (Gabrielle Union) tells her the Toros have been stealing from the Clovers' Black cheerleaders for years. Though the two seemingly make up at the end, it isn't before Torrance tries to remedy her white privilege through trial and error.\n\nNeed a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.\n\nAside from giving viewers an important lesson on race relations, \"Bring It On\" also provided some iconic one-liners, quotes and zingers that have stood the test of time.\n\nTo celebrate the cheerleading movie's 20th anniversary, we're sharing our favorite quotes from the film.\n\n1.\"This is not a democracy, it's a cheerocracy.\" – Torrance Shipman (Kirsten Dunst)\n\nTorrance spent all of one day as captain of the cheer team and is telling everyone to look at her, because she's the captain now.\n\n2.\"She puts the whore in horrifying.\" – Courtney (Clare Kramer)\n\nCourtney and Whitney exchanged jabs about Big Red and singlehandedly opened our eyes to how spelling really works.\n\n3. \"I'm wanted, I'm hot, I'm everything you're not. I'm pretty, I'm cool, I dominate this school. Who am I? Just guess, guys wanna touch my chest, I'm rockin', I smile, and many think I'm vile.\" – Rancho Carne cheerleaders\n\nThe opening cheer that has become a staple in practically every 2000 teen's vocabulary. If you didn't randomly say this out loud, what were you even doing in the early aughts?\n\n4. \"You ripped off those cheers ... Your trophies are (BS) and you're a sad (expletive) liar.\" – Missy Pantone (Eliza Dushku)\n\nMissy turned Torrance's world upside down with these words. It was at this moment that she would find out that the Rancho Carne cheerleaders were performing stolen routines. OMG.\n\n5. \"Were the ethnic festivities to your liking today?\" – Lava (Shamari Fears)\n\nLava read Torrance and Missy for filth when they came to watch the Compton Clovers' cheer performance. You see, at this point, the Clovers were used to Big Red attending their shows and recording their routines to take back to the Rancho Carne Toros. And Lava was all the way fed up with the culture vultures.\n\n6. \"Brr, it's cold in here, I said there must be some Toros in the atmosphere? I know you didn't think a white girl made that (expletive) up.\" –Isis (Gabrielle Union)\n\nWhen Torrance swears she didn't know they were performing stolen routines, Isis utters the comeback heard around the world. Not only did she come for the Toros' lack of creativity, but she also dragged every other culture appropriator out there.\n\n7. \"Every time we get some here, y'all come trying to steal it, putting this blond hair on it and calling it something different.\" – Isis\n\nCultural appropriation can seem difficult to understand at times, but our good sis Isis summed it up in one sentence.\n\n8. \"We learned that routine fair and square. We logged the man hours, don't punish the squad for Big Red's mistake. This isn't about cheating, this is about winning.\" – Courtney\n\nCourtney justifying cultural appropriation (because it's not like she did anything wrong) speaks volumes on white privilege.\n\n9.\"Smile. ... Don't smile.\" – Sparky (Ian Roberts)\n\nSparky did not come to play with the savagery. He came to teach the Toros a thing or two about dance, but he also obliterated every ounce of self-confidence in the cheerleaders with a single retort.\n\n10. \"These are not spirit fingers, THESE are spirit fingers!\" – Sparky\n\nWe know you know. If it wasn't for Sparky, we would not have spirit fingers.\n\n11. \"You want to make it right? Then when you go to Nationals, bring it. Don't slack off because you feel sorry for us. That way when we beat you, we'll know it's because we're better.\" – Isis\n\nTorrance attempts to remedy the tension between the Clovers and the Toros by giving the Clovers a check to help them make it to Nationals. Isis rips up the check and tells Torrance they don't need her sympathy and to just show out at Nationals. Too often Black people have been told they only made it into universities or gotten jobs because of a quota. Isis let it be known that they would win Nationals simply because they were good enough.\n\n12. \"We just understand each other, that's all.\" – Isis\n\nIsis says this when Lava questions the Clovers captain's friendly banter with Torrance. Despite their differences and rocky start, there is common ground between them.\n\n13. \"Ever since I handed the reins over to you, you've run my squad into the ground. If I made any mistakes at being a team leader, it wasn't borrowing cheers, it was announcing you as my successor.\" –Big Red (Lindsay Sloane)\n\nBig Red said the biggest mistake was appointing Torrance captain – and not her cultural appropriation scandal. Not sure we can agree, but whatever helps Big Red sleep at night.\n\n14. \"Can we just beat these Buffys down so I can go home? I'm on curfew, girl.\" – Jenelope (Natina Reed)\n\nJenelope delivered this threat when the Clovers confronted Missy and Torrance after the two watched their routine. Excuse us, we are still dying laughing.\n\n15. \"If you don't have it yet, you don't have it!\" – Missy\n\nMissy was yelling at a team practicing their routine for Nationals late into the night, but her words can really be applied to anything in life.\n\n16. \"It'll be just like high school, only better.\" – Aaron (Richard Hillman)\n\nHow Aaron described college still makes us laugh to this day.\n\n17. \"We'd be doing them a favor. Then they could feel good about sending Raggedy Ann up here to jack us for our cheers.\" – Isis\n\nIsis choosing to not fight Missy and Torrance while simultaneously insulting Big Red is a burn we'll never be able to recover from.\n\n18. \"Missy's the poo, so take a big whiff.\" – Torrance\n\nWe want someone to advocate this hard for us. Courtney and Whitney weren't here for Missy making the cheer squad, but Torrance went hard for her friend.\n\n19. \"The Clash? ... It's a British punk band, circa 1977 to 1983-ish, original lineup anyway.\" – Cliff (Jesse Bradford)\n\nCliff was sporting a T-shirt with a photo of The Clash on it and Torrance asked him if the photo was of his band. Him explaining who The Clash is without judgment is exactly why we stan Cliff.\n\n20. \"You been touched by an angel, girl!\" – Jenelope\n\nJenelope letting Missy and Torrance know they've been spared by a higher being is the energy we were all looking for. In conclusion: \"Next time you come up here trying to steal our routines, you won't be so lucky.\"\n\nMovies turning 20 in 2020:From 'Coyote Ugly to 'Bring It On' and more", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/08/25"}]}

While Biden had been slipping in the polls, particularly after his disastrous debate performance, a new national poll indicated that Harris could secure a victory against the Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, in all seven battleground states that are likely to decide the election's outcome, Trump has maintained a slight lead over his Democratic rivals.\n\nLive updates:Harris pays tribute to Biden in first public remarks since launching campaign\n\nTrump officially accepted the Republican nomination at the GOP convention last week, but the Democratic National Convention will not start until August 19, giving Democrats a little less than a month to amass support for a new nominee. Harris is more than likely to take up the helm, with over 40% of the 1,968 delegates she needs pledging their support to her on the first day of her candidacy.\n\nHere’s how Harris would fare against Trump in the seven key swing states, according to the most recent polls.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nArizona\n\nThough polls from the aftermath of Biden’s exit from the race have not yet been released, an InsiderAdvantage poll conducted on July 15 and 16, days before Biden’s announcement, showed Trump leading over Biden in Arizona. Out of the 800 voters surveyed, 49% supported Trump, 44% favored Biden, 4% chose a third-party candidate, and 3% undecided.\n\nHarris polled slightly below Trump, amassing 42% compared to his 48%. However, as Harris was still the vice presidential candidate when the survey was conducted, InsiderAdvantage political analyst Matt Towery said her weaker ratings were unsurprising, and will likely change in subsequent polls.\n\n“With the mantel of nominee, her numbers could potentially improve,” he said.\n\nRecap:Joe Biden endorses Kamala Harris after he drops out of 2024 election\n\nGeorgia\n\nAn exclusive poll from the Atlanta Journal-Constitution released hours after President Joe Biden announced his departure from the ticket showed former President Donald Trump with a slight lead over Harris, with a 51% to 46% rating respectively, and a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points. Two percent of voters said they were undecided, 1% said they would vote for a third-party candidate, and another 1% said they would not vote for any presidential candidate.\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,000 likely voters between July 9 and 18, as Democratic lawmakers were increasingly calling on Biden to reconsider his bid for reelection and amid the assassination attempt on Trump. It was conducted by the University of Georgia’s School of Public and International Affairs.\n\nBlack voters, a crucial demographic in the Peach State, notably preferred Harris to Biden. Nearly 87% of respondents said they viewed Harris favorably, compared to the 82% who said the same of Biden.\n\nMichigan\n\nAn exclusive poll conducted by the Detroit Free Press and released hours before Biden abandoned his reelection bid, showed former President Donald Trump with a notable 7-percentage-point lead over the incumbent president.\n\nBut with Harris as the nominee, those numbers could change. Recent polling from the Clean and Prosperous America PAC, a left-leaning environmental advocacy group, showed that voters preferred Trump to Harris, with 46% voting for him and 41% choosing the Vice President. However, if Harris were to choose Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer as her running mate, the poll said, the candidates would tie with 46% each.\n\nMore:Where Harris stands on Israel, abortion, climate change, education and the economy\n\nNevada\n\nAn InsiderAdvantage poll conducted on July 15 and 16, days before Biden’s announced that he was dropping out of the race showed Trump leading over Biden in Nevada 49% to 42% in a sample of 800 voters.\n\nPitted against Harris, Trump increased his lead among the voters polled, receiving 50% of the vote compared to Harris’ 40%. But as with the Arizona poll, experts said those numbers will likely if Harris becomes the official nominee.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nThough there are currently no polls pitting Harris against Trump, a recent survey from Emerson College conducted on July 15 and 16 showed Trump leading over Biden by 7 points, scoring 47% of respondents compared to Biden's 38%.\n\nMore:7 takeaways as Kamala Harris clears path to Democratic nomination\n\nPennsylvania\n\nA little over a week after the shooting at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, former President Trump has retained a narrow 4.4% lead over incumbent President Biden, according to polling averages calculated by FiveThirtyEight.\n\nHowever, even before Biden announced his departure from the race, figures from Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling showed that voters were more enthusiastic about Harris than they were for Biden, putting her only two points behind Trump at 43% and 45% respectively.\n\nWisconsin\n\nA Civiqs survey of 514 voters in Wisconsin showed Trump and Harris tied at 48%, with a 4.8% margin of error. The survey was conducted between July 13 and 16, in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s assassination attempt and before Biden withdrew from the race. At the time, 28% of voters surveyed said Biden’s age was the primary concern they had with the possibility of the president’s second term.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/07/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/07/21/presidential-election-date-2024/74492667007/", "title": "What date is the 2024 presidential election and when is early voting", "text": "Just hours after President Joe Biden made his historic announcement to end his bid for reelection Sunday, Vice President Kamala Harris announced she is running for president and her name will be on the ticket this fall.\n\nThe Democratic National Convention takes place in Chicago next month.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, over 100 million Americans voted early in the 2020 presidential election, the Washington Post reported.\n\nEarly voting is beneficial for people who are immunocompromised, those with difficulty accessing transportation, or anyone unable to physically vote in person on Election Day. No matter the reason for casting a ballot early, it provides flexibility to potential voters and increases voter participation, experts say.\n\nBusinesses and nonprofits across the nation advocate for early voting with \"Vote Early Day.\" Similar to other themed days, such as National Voter Registration Day or National Day of Giving, Vote Early Day encourages Americans to stay educated on their state's laws related to early voting.\n\n“If you're a first-time voter, going to the polls for the first time could be intimidating or might be confusing,” Jennifer Park Stout, vice president of global public policy at Snapchat, previously told USA TODAY.\n\n\"Giving our users, and our community, two moments to vote, whether it be on Election Day or during this early voting period, is just an especially powerful tool,\" Stout continued. \"Especially for young people who can be in class or might be working or have other plans for Election Day. It really is providing them with additional tools to exercise their civic responsibility.\"\n\nAs Kamala Harris and Donald Trump duke it out these next few months, here's what you need to know about the current state of early voting, how it has changed in the U.S., and states that are challenging the practice:\n\nMajority of states offer some form of early voting\n\nAs of 2024, 47 states and Washington, D.C. offer early in-person voting, a report from the Center for Election Innovation and Research found. Of these jurisdictions, 37 allow voters to mail in their ballots without requiring a reason.\n\nThe number of states that offer early-in person voting to all U.S. citizens is up from the 2000 general election, when only 24 states had that option. These 24 states accounted for about 40% of the citizen voting age population, the center reported.\n\nWashington, D.C. and the other 47 states that offer early in-person voting account for about 97% of the current citizen voting age population in the U.S., according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nTwelve of the 14 states that do not offer mail-in voting for all citizens have Republican-led legislatures, NPR previously reported. This limitation on early voting reflects a trend of some southern states tightening who can vote absentee and who can turn in absentee ballots.\n\nSince 2020, 12 state legislatures passed new laws stiffening requirements for in-person voter ID. And, under pressure from some Republicans who falsely claim the 2020 election was stolen through fraud, some states are adjusting how they remove voters from the rolls, USA TODAY previously reported.\n\nEarly voting grows in popularity\n\nVoting early, either by mail or in person, has grown in popularity since 2000. The U.S. Census Bureau found that between 2000 and 2022, the share of voters who mailed in their ballots increased from 10.2% of voters to 31.8%.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, early voting spiked, with 69% of voters casting their ballot before Election Day. In 2022, about half of all voting citizens voted before Election Day.\n\nVoting access:Which states passed new election laws in 2024?\n\nWhich states passed new voter access laws?\n\nNew laws impacting voting rights − some expanding access to voting and others making it more difficult to vote − are taking place in key battleground states across the country.\n\nTen states passed laws since the 2020 presidential election shortening the window to apply for absentee, or mail-in, ballots, creating a new administrative hurdle for voters.\n\nAnother eight states have limited the availability of ballot drop boxes. These include the swing states of Georgia and North Carolina, along with states with competitive downballot races including Iowa, Ohio, and Florida.\n\nEarly voting:100 days until the election, but some can vote sooner.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, at least 11 states have passed 14 laws that expand access to voting. Virginia, Washington and Oregon each passed two new laws, the Brennan Center for Justice reported in their 2024 voting laws roundup.\n\nContributing: Rebecca Morin, Victor Hagan, Erin Mansfield, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/11/16/these-states-passed-new-2023-voting-laws-heres-what-it-means-for-2024/70741734007/", "title": "These states passed new 2023 voting laws. Here's what it means for ...", "text": "WASHINGTON − A slate of new voting laws launched in states throughout the past year could serve as a preview for how changes to ballot access may offset the outcome of the 2024 general election, voting rights experts say.\n\nThese laws − some expanding rights for voters and other making it more difficult to participate in the election process − are taking place in key battleground states across the U.S. that Democrats and Republicans are targeting in an effort to turn the tide in their favor.\n\nMore than 40 states have passed new voting laws so far this year that will be in effect for the 2024 general election.\n\nAt least 14 states enacted laws that will make it harder to vote, according to an October 2023 roundup of voting laws from the Brennan Center. More restrictive laws have been enacted in 2023 than in the past decade, excluding a wave of changes in 2021 after the last presidential election.\n\nSeparately, nearly half of all states passed legislation that will make it easier to vote. The Brennan Center estimates there has been nearly three new expansive laws enacted for every restrictive law, marking the biggest ratio since 2020.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\n\"We're seeing a very stark divide between states that are actively making it harder to vote and then states that are aiming to expand voting access,\" Sara Carter, an attorney in the Brennan Center's Democracy Program, told USA TODAY. \"Expansive and restrictive voting laws are being passed all the time and they don't simply cancel each other out, particularly when they're being passed in different states.\"\n\nA post-2020 landscape\n\nThe last presidential election fell at an unusual time: The middle of a global pandemic.\n\nAlmost every state adjusted their voting systems to expand access to mail-in and early voting to make the voting process safer. But since the 2020 election, in part from the efforts of former President Donald Trump to overturn the election results, many states reversed such legislation and rewrote election laws, according to Liz Avore, the senior policy adviser for the Voting Rights Lab, a voter advocacy organization.\n\n\"Since the 2020 election, lawmakers have rewritten – and in some cases, continue to rewrite – the rules that govern our elections and democracy,\" she said. \"For the swing states that will determine the outcome of next year's presidential election, those changes could ultimately tip the scales.\"\n\nAccording to a report from the Voting Rights Lab, which Avore authored, over 560 new laws governing elections are in effect since 2020.\n\nThe report analyzed new voting policy changes over the past three years with a focus on eight competitive presidential swing states − Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia and New Hampshire.\n\nIn two states − Nevada and Michigan − voters will have more access in the 2024 general election. But in four − Georgia, New Hampshire, North Carolina and Wisconsin − voters face new restrictions.\n\n14 states pass more restrictive laws in 2023\n\nFourteen states in 2023 passed legislation that makes it harder to vote − many in states where voters already face difficulties casting a ballot. These laws will be in effect for the 2024 general election.\n\nNew laws target voter registration, mail-in voting and enforce stricter voter ID laws − all provisions that specifically burden voters of color, the Brennan Center's Carter said.\n\nOne law passed in Texas this year changes provisions for consolidating polling places in counties throughout the state, which the Brennan Center predicts could increase wait times at the polls. Another law grants the secretary of state oversight of Harris County’s election administration, a county where Republicans alleged voter fraud in 2020.\n\nNorth Carolina also passed its own package of several restrictive voting bills and election interference laws this year.\n\nThe state Legislature overrode the governor's veto of the package that shortens the window to return mail-in ballots, bans the use of ballot drop boxes and weakens the governor's oversight of elections.\n\nThis package of laws could potentially tee up disputes over election certification within boards of elections, which could give more power to partisan state lawmakers or potentially the courts to solve disputes, Carter said.\n\nStates that passed restrictive voting laws this year mark the homes of several races where candidates won by narrow majorities in 2022 that both Democrats and Republicans are watching closely in the leadup to 2024.\n\nRepublicans, looking to gain more power in the House, have identified several seats in these states as pick-up opportunities, including one currently held by Texas Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez, who won by 11,000 votes.\n\nAlso in Texas, the campaign arm for House Democrats is looking to flip the seat of Republican Rep. Monica De La Cruz, a Trump-backed candidate who won last year with a 10-point margin. They are also eyeing two Florida seats to win back the House currently held by Republican Reps. Anna Paulina Luna and Maria Elvira Salazar.\n\nThe GOP is also looking to flip one seat in North Carolina − where recent redistricting has redrawn districts in favor of Republicans − held by Democratic Rep. Don Davis who won in 2022 by just 5 points.\n\nStates target voter mobilization\n\nOne recurrence among recent restrictive election laws has been targeting get-out-the-vote organizations that are helping voters participate in the election process, according to Sophia Lin Lakin, director of ACLU’s Voting Rights Project.\n\nIn Florida, Republican presidential candidate Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a voting law that imposes new requirements on third-party organizations working to register voters and bans noncitizens from collecting voter registration forms, among additional provisions. It also prohibits third-party mobilization organizations from retaining personal voter information.\n\nA judge temporarily blocked the legislation and the state has since appealed.\n\nLakin said she has seen a shift with restrictive voting laws targeting efforts and fining organizations that help voters through the election. This is in response to the success of get-out-the-vote groups that are helping voters overcome barriers put in place after the 2020 election, she said.\n\n\"It's truly devastating that these groups are providing that service in a lot of instances to help voters navigate what can be a really difficult process,\" she said.\n\nTies to election deniers\n\nThere is a strong focus on passing more restrictive voting laws in response to false claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, Carter said.\n\n\"I think you can draw some connections between states that are battleground states and the laws that are being passed,\" she said, drawing parallels between the states where former President Donald Trump sought to overturn the election results in Michigan, Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada.\n\nCarter added that these states are sites for significant amounts of legislative activity related to voting. State legislators often use election misinformation and claims of election fraud to justify making voting harder, fueling a wave of restrictive voting legislation, she said.\n\n\"Now, going into 2024, we're expecting election deniers to focus their tactics on the same battleground states,\" she said.\n\nMail-in voting has become one target for those who claim election fraud. The Brennan Center found 11 laws that reduce access to mail voting that passed in several states this year:\n\nFour add more stringent voter ID requirements.\n\nThree prohibit election workers from sending unsolicited mail ballot applications or ballots.\n\nFour shorten the period for requesting or casting a mail ballot.\n\nTwo ban the use of drop boxes.\n\nOne makes it a crime to return a mail ballot on behalf of another.\n\nNearly half of states pass expansive voting laws\n\nAt least 23 states enacted 47 expansive voting laws in 2023 including several battleground states like Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada and New Mexico.\n\nA new voting law in Michigan now grants voters an extra nine days for early voting, creates easier vote by mail options and improves access to drop boxes. One law in Nevada makes permanent expanded mail-in ballot rules.\n\nIn New York, a new law requires jails to provide voter registration forms to individuals that are being released. It also requires high schools to distribute voter registration forms to students.\n\nColorado has passed a law with provisions that improve opportunities for in-person voting on Indian reservations and establishes drop boxes at places of worship. It also requires mandatory polling locations on college campuses as well as requires drop boxes at campuses with 1,000 students or more.\n\n\"The wave of pro-voting legislation that we did see this year ... follows the 2022 midterms where voters largely rejected election-denying candidates in swing states,\" Carter said.\n\nDemocrats and Republicans are watching several races in these states that were decided in 2022 by narrow margins.\n\nIn Michigan, Democrats are hoping to win back one district held by GOP Rep. John James, a freshman lawmaker who won by a narrow margin of 1,600 votes last year. They are also eyeing a handful of races in New York where first-year Republican lawmakers won by narrow margins in the last election.\n\nAlso in New York, Republicans are looking for a pick-up opportunity in a district held by Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan, who won by a single-digit margin.\n\nIn Colorado, Republican Rep. Lauren Boebert almost lost her seat last year after businessman Adam Frisch came close to unseating her with just 550 votes separating the two candidates.\n\nWhat does it mean for 2024?\n\nVoting rights advocates say the changes to restrictive voting laws may play into effect for determining the outcome of 2024, pointing to states where the 2020 outcome was determined by less than 2 percentage points.\n\n\"Lawmakers and election conspiracy theorists – two groups with increasing and concerning overlap – will undoubtedly make their mark on the 2024 presidential election,\" Voting Rights Lab's Liz Avore said. \"The outcome of the 2024 presidential election will come down to how voters and election officials respond.\"\n\nThe changing laws also can be confusing for voters.\n\n\"These are quite complicated and we talk about a sort of modern-day literacy test almost,\" the ACLU's Lakin said. \"Some of these rules really are like that.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/09/16/harris-trump-pennsylvania-poll/75236006007/", "title": "Harris narrowly leads Trump in Pennsylvania, post-debate poll finds", "text": "AI-assisted summary Kamala Harris leads Donald Trump in Pennsylvania, a trio of USA TODAY/Suffolk University polls found.\n\nHarris leads Trump 49%-46% in Pennsylvania, a statewide poll of 500 likely Pennsylvania voters conducted Sept. 11 to Sept. 15 found.\n\nHarris also enjoys higher personal popularity among likely Pennsylvania voters, with 49% having a favorable opinion of the vice president, compared to 47% with an unfavorable opinion.\n\nWASHINGTON – Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris narrowly leads former President Donald Trump in the critical battleground state of Pennsylvania and two of the state's key bellwether counties, according to a trio of exclusive USA TODAY/Suffolk University polls taken after last week's debate.\n\nWith 50 days until Election Day, Harris leads Trump, the Republican nominee, 49%-46% in Pennsylvania, a statewide poll of 500 likely Pennsylvania voters conducted from Wednesday to Sunday found. The results are within the poll's margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.\n\nPennsylvania is widely regarded as the most important battleground of the 2024 election, with both nominees' paths to 270 electoral votes severely hampered without carrying it. Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes are the most among the seven top swing states.\n\nThe poll found a wide gender gap that is benefiting the vice president. Harris leads female voters in Pennsylvania 56%-39%, while Trump tops male voters by a slimmer 53%-41%, according to the poll. Harris edged Trump among Pennsylvania's independent voters 43%-38%.\n\nMore:A fierce debate and seven swing state voters: Readers weigh in on Harris-Trump debate\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nMore:'He said concepts of a plan': Harris mocks Trump in first post-debate rally\n\nHarris also enjoys higher personal popularity among likely Pennsylvania voters, with 49% having a favorable opinion of the vice president, compared with 47% with an unfavorable opinion. Forty-three percent of Pennsylvania's likely voters said they had a favorable opinion of Trump, while 54% had an unfavorable opinion.\n\n\"Besides the fact that she's totally qualified, she's decent and confident – and democracy is at stake,\" said Tanya Brown, a 55-year-old social worker from Norristown, Pennsylvania, who plans to vote for Harris. \"I don't know if I can stomach another four years of this idiot,\" she said of Trump. \"It's just the uncouthness. You're constantly on edge.\"\n\nHarris ahead in Pennsylvania's Northampton, Erie counties, polls find\n\nThe polls were conducted in the days after the lone debate between Harris and Trump in the 2024 campaign. After Harris put Trump on defense throughout the 90-minute exchange, even many Republicans acknowledged the vice president outperformed Trump in the debate. Trump last week said he will not take part in another debate against Harris.\n\nPresident Joe Biden won Pennsylvania in 2020 over Trump by 1.2 percentage points, while Trump carried the commonwealth by less than 1 percentage point over Hillary Clinton in 2016.\n\nAlong with Harris' statewide edge over Trump, she leads in Erie and Northampton counties – two bellwether counties that have historically predicted who carries the state – separate USA TODAY/Suffolk University polls of both found.\n\nMore:Kamala Harris needs Latinos to win these swing states. They say she has more to do\n\nHarris leads in Northampton County, which includes the cities of Easton and Bethlehem in East Pennsylvania, 50%-45% over Trump. Biden carried Northampton 50%-49% in the 2020 election. Trump carried Northampton 50%-46% over Clinton in 2016.\n\nIn Northwest Pennsylvania, Harris leads Trump 48%-44% in Erie County, where Biden in 2020 won 50%-49% and Trump in 2016 won 49%-47%.\n\nThree hundred likely voters were surveyed in both county polls, which have margins of error of 5.7 percentage points.\n\nHelping drive Harris' advantage in Northampton – which boasts a Latino population that is 13% of the county's population – is the vice president's 60%-25% lead among Latino voters in the county. Yet the common denominator in both counties and Pennsylvania as a whole is Harris' dominance with female voters.\n\nIn Northampton, Harris leads female voters 55%-37% – an 18-point advantage that is greater than Harris' 17-point statewide lead with female voters. In Erie, Harris leads female voters by an even wider 55%-35% margin. Trump leads among male voters in Northampton 53%-44% and male voters in Erie 52%-42%.\n\n\"This is female-gender advantage on steroids,\" said Dave Paleologos, director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center. \"In all three data sets, the women margin is around almost twice around Trump's edge among men.\"\n\nFew undecided voters left\n\nHarris, who would be the first female U.S. president if elected, has campaigned aggressively on restoring abortion rights following the Supreme Court's 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade and a constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nIn the statewide poll, abortion rights ranked as the most important issue for 11% of Pennsylvania's likely voters. The top issue for likely voters was inflation/economy at 35%, followed by immigration, at 14%, and \"bringing the nation together,\" at 13%.\n\n\"I support Kamala Harris because I believe she's got her head on straight,\" said Kevin Adcroft, 62 an entrepreneur and real estate investor from Scranton, Pennsylvania. \"Kamala has enough experience and is grounded enough that she would not put the country in danger. And I'm fearful that Trump could potentially do that.\"\n\nMore:Who won the debate? Harris' forceful performance rattles a defensive Trump.\n\nAdcroft, an independent voter who leans Democratic, said abortion rights rank as his top issue. He said Harris seemed to \"sidestep\" a question in the debate about whether the economy is better today than four years ago, but he gave her strong marks overall. He laughed when Harris brought up Trump's campaign rallies and prompted the former president to talk extensively about crowd sizes.\n\n\"That was funny. I thought she did an outstanding job. Even her facial expressions and everything was like, 'Wow.' It was like being with a child,\" Adcroft said.\n\nAbout 5% of the statewide poll respondents said they were still undecided. Less than 1% said they planned to back a third-party candidate. Onetime independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. will not appear on the ballot in Pennsylvania after withdrawing from the race last month. Kennedy was not included as an option in the poll.\n\nJack Ross, 74, a part-time pastor from Abington Township, Pennsylvania, was undecided before the debate and is still undecided.\n\nA Republican, Ross didn’t vote for Trump in the two previous elections; he voted for the libertarian candidate instead. He has no intention of voting for Trump now. “He’s worse than he was in 2020 and 2016 in terms of his just going off, his lack of self-control and some of the statements he has made,” Ross said.\n\nRoss finds Harris’ tax-and-spending proposals “abominable.\" He also worries her shifting position on fracking – she now opposes a ban on fracking for natural gas – and other issues are just a case of saying one thing to get elected and doing whatever she wants once she’s in office.\n\n“Am I going to hold my nose and gag as I'm voting for Harris or am I not going to vote for president?” he said. “I'm at that point right now.”\n\nMore:Republican pollster predicts Donald Trump loses the election after Tuesday's debate\n\nMore:'Only losers do that': Democrats celebrate, GOP regroups after Harris, Trump debate\n\nHarris overcoming Republican gains in voter registration in Pennsylvania\n\nHarris' narrow lead in Pennsylvania comes despite Republicans making significant recent headway to reduce Democrats' massive voter registration in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania today has 354,152 more registered Democrats than registered Republicans, down from a voter registration advantage in 2020 that was 666,202.\n\nIn Pennsylvania's U.S. Senate race – a contest critical to control of the upper chamber – incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey leads 47%-43% among likely voters against Republican challenger David McCormick, the statewide USA TODAY poll found.\n\nDaniel Mason, 39, an independent voter from Lansdale, just outside of Philadelphia, was undecided on the presidential race but is leaning toward Trump after the debate.\n\nMason had hoped Harris “was going to come out and say what the hell she has really been doing over the last couple of years.”\n\nBut “it really seemed like she just kept saying, ‘Oh, we’re going to do this. We’re going to do this,’” he said. “Why haven’t you started any of this stuff?”\n\nMore:Donald Trump says he won't debate Kamala Harris again\n\nMason, a chef, said he thinks Trump’s business background could help him turn the economy around. “Our country is failing right there,” he said. “I am struggling myself. I had to pick up another job this year – the first time I’ve ever had two jobs in my whole life. It sucks, but it’s what I’ve got to do.”\n\nGiven its crucial status, Pennsylvania has become a recurring stop for both nominees on the 2024 campaign trail. Harris held rallies in Johnstown and Wilkes-Barre Pennsylvania on Friday, while Trump held a rally in Johnstown last month. Harris is set to visit Philadelphia on Tuesday for a \"fireside chat\" with the National Association of Black Journalists.\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X, formerly Twitter, @joeygarrison.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/09/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/01/02/georgia-elections-2024-dates-and-deadlines/71883496007/", "title": "Mark your calendars: Here is every date you need to know to vote in ...", "text": "With the beginning of 2024 approaching, election season is just around the corner, and Georgia voters have an important role to play in selecting local, statewide and national representatives.\n\nAs one of the most competitive battleground states, Georgia is also expected to play a major part in the 2024 presidential election, meaning that exercising the right to vote is more important than ever.\n\nWith several newly-drawn districts for state and federal legislative seats, voters should check their My Voter Page at https://mvp.sos.ga.gov/s/ to view the most up-to-date information about their registration status, polling locations, and elected officials.\n\nHere are some important dates and deadlines to keep in mind as the election season begins.\n\n2024 election dates to remember in Georgia\n\nPresidential Primary & Special Election: March 12, 2024\n\nSpecial Election Runoff: April 9, 2024\n\nPrimary Election: May 21, 2024\n\nPrimary Election Runoff: June 18, 2024\n\nGeneral Election: Nov. 5, 2024\n\nGeneral Election Runoff: Dec. 3, 2024\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nGeorgia elections:Important dates, how to register, and what to know ahead of 2024\n\nGeorgia 2024 presidential primary election dates to remember\n\nThe first election of 2024 will be the Presidential Preference Primary (PPP), in which voters cast their ballots for president and vice president.

There are more than 7 million active voters on the state rolls, according to the secretary of state’s office.\n\nRaffensperger, who is up for election this year and effectively overseeing his own contest, said “reports of long lines were minimal” but also acknowledged that “there were some reports of voters waiting in line for more than 30 minutes from a few popular voting locations in metro areas.”\n\nGeorgia is home to a series of critical midterm races for the US Senate, US House and statewide posts from governor to secretary of state. Its new elections law allows in-person early voting for parts of the next three weeks – no fewer than 17 days in all – through Election Day on November 8. But following the implementation of a restrictive new voting law, which made it harder to vote through the mail, civil rights groups are paying close attention to this first general election under the revised guidelines. Among the changes: Poll locations are required to be open on weekdays and at least two Saturdays in the run-up to Election Day – but must be closed on the final weekend and Monday before.\n\nAn earlier version of the controversial measure had sought to block all Sunday voting, but the version that was enacted by state Republicans last year allows it at the discretion of the counties.\n\nThough the raw vote totals on Monday exceeded some expectations, wait times at polling places in some Atlanta-area suburbs were reportedly more than an hour. Some of those wait times are due to a brief failure of the state’s voter registration system, called eNet, which has caused issues in the past. Officials said the system was quickly back up and running – they have not determined the cause of the eNet issue, but say it was not caused by an outside attack – and insisted overall delays were minimal.\n\nBut some watchdog organizations were less optimistic going forward and pointed to the state’s strict new law, which makes absentee balloting more difficult, as a factor in the delays. Faith Works, a group formed by religious leaders to combat voter suppression, said it had contacted the Justice Department to flag its concerns.\n\n“Faith Works has received multiple reports from congregants around the state regarding significant irregularities at the polls, especially in heavily African-American communities such as North Fulton, Cobb, Gwinnett, and Henry,” the group said in a statement.\n\nTurnout has been expected to top the state’s last midterm figures but also to fall short of 2020, a presidential election year. Joe Biden won Georgia in 2020, becoming the first victorious Democratic presidential nominee to win since Bill Clinton won in 1992. Then, in early January 2021, Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff defeated a pair of Republican Senate incumbents in runoff elections to deliver their party a majority in the chamber – and Democrats a governing trifecta in Washington.\n\nBut an uneven economy, headlined by inflation and rising gas prices, along with the traditional backlash against a first-term president, has endangered Democratic control of Congress. The fate of the Senate, which is split 50-50, could turn on Warnock’s contest with Republican nominee Herschel Walker – a close race that has recently been clouded by controversy over allegations Walker, a staunch opponent of abortion, paid a woman to have the procedure. (CNN has not independently verified the claim, which Walker denies.)\n\nIn the House, where Republicans only need to flip a handful of seats to retake the majority, the 2nd Congressional District in southwest Georgia is home to perhaps the only competitive partisan race in the Deep South. Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop, who was first elected three decades ago, is facing a challenge from Republican Chris West, for whom House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy headlined a Monday fundraiser that, according to an invitation, was expected to include Georgia GOP figures including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and former Sen. Kelly Loeffler.\n\nVoting also began in key statewide races, beginning with Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s campaign for a second term in a rematch against Democrat Stacey Abrams. Kemp has led in polling of the race and clashed with Abrams during a Monday night debate in Atlanta.\n\nAbrams again denounced the law and, picking up a line of attack from their first contest, described Kemp as having “assiduously denied access to the right to vote.” More recently, Abrams borrowed from her criticisms of four years ago, calling Kemp – who was secretary of state during the 2018 campaign – “the chief architect of modern day voter suppression.”\n\nKemp countered by pointing to high turnout numbers over the past few elections and said the law made it “easy to vote and hard to cheat.”\n\nRaffensperger, the Republican secretary of state, is also on the ballot. He is being challenged by state Rep. Bee Nguyen, a Democrat, and Libertarian Ted Metz, who ran for governor four years ago.\n\nThis will be the first major election held in Georgia since the enactment of the new voting law was passed last year. The law prompted an outcry from civil rights and corporate leaders. Major League Baseball moved its All-Star Game from Atlanta in response to the law – which includes a shorter window for voters to request mail-in ballots, new voter identification requirements and a cap on drop boxes during early voting – which critics said was designed to suppress minority turnout following Democrats’ sweep of the presidential and US Senate elections.\n\nEven before the mixed reviews came in on Monday, Democrats said that high turnout should not be taken as evidence that concerns over the new law were unfounded.\n\n“There is no question that SB 202 (the new law) makes voting harder – and that is the intent,” Warnock said in his Friday debate with Walker. “And the fact that many of our voters are overcoming this hardship doesn’t undermine that reality.”\n\nThe election also follows a federal court ruling against a suit filed by Fair Fight Action, a voting rights group founded by Abrams after the 2018 election, that had asserted that Georgia’s “exact match” voter registration policy, absentee ballot cancellation practices and registration inaccuracies were unconstitutional and in violation of the Voting Rights Act.", "authors": ["Gregory Krieg"], "publish_date": "2022/10/18"}]}

The commission also voted to offer State Treasurer John McMillan the job of executive director of the new agency that will run the medical cannabis program. McMillan – who served two terms as state agriculture commissioner and is a former commissioner of the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources – told the news outlet he expects to accept the job, which would require him to resign as state treasurer. Al.com reports Commission Vice Chair Rex Vaughn said he has been in discussions with lawmakers about moving up the start date for licensing cultivators from Sept. 1, 2022 to early 2022. The time required to grow the plants, which will be raised in greenhouses, is 90 to 110 days. The 14-member commission oversees a new agency that will license and regulate cultivators, processors, secure transporters, testing laboratories and dispensaries of medical marijuana products. It will be a seed-to-sale intrastate program, with products made from plants grown in Alabama. A special legislative session is expected this fall on redistricting. Another might be held on prison construction.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy said President Joe Biden’s push to require millions of U.S. workers to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is “ill conceived, divisive and un-American.” “At a time in which we are called to work together, forced medical procedures run counter to our collective sense of fairness and liberty,” the Republican governor said Friday. Biden on Thursday outlined plans to mandate that employers with more than 100 workers require their employees to be vaccinated or tested for the coronavirus weekly. When asked Friday about critics who might sue over the plan, Biden said: “Have at it.” Dunleavy has faced some criticism for not issuing a statewide mask mandate and for not implementing a new disaster declaration to deal with a recent surge in COVID-19 cases. He has instead asked lawmakers to act on legislation intended to address staffing concerns raised by health care facilities. In a letter to legislative leaders this month, he said the virus is now “endemic,” and his administration is “adapting and proposing changes that make the response to the challenge more durable, and not subject to the whims of 30-day proclamations or health orders.” Still, in his statement, Dunleavy said it is “clear from the data and empirical evidence over the last year that the vaccine is the most effective way to fight COVID-19.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state has sold off $93 million in Unilever bonds and plans to sell the remaining $50 million it has invested in the global consumer products company over subsidiary Ben & Jerry’s decision to stop selling its ice cream in Israeli-occupied territories, the latest in a series of actions by states with anti-Israel boycott laws. The investment moves state Treasurer Kimberly Yee announced last week were mandated by a 2019 state law that bars Arizona government agencies from holding investments or doing more than $100,000 in business with any firm that boycotts Israel or its territories. Arizona appears to be the first of 35 states with anti-boycott laws or regulation to have fully divested itself from Unilever following Ben & Jerry’s actions. While Ben & Jerry’s, based in Vermont, is owned by London-based Unilever, it maintains its own independent board, which Unilever said makes its own decision on its social mission. Ben & Jerry’s announced July 19 that maintaining its presence in the occupied territories was “inconsistent with our values.” The Arizona law enacted in 2016 and revised in 2019 had broad, bipartisan support and was signed by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey. He tweeted that the Ben & Jerry’s decision “is discrimination.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: An appeals court has reversed a lower court judge’s order that the city must reinstate a police officer who was fired for fatally shooting a Black motorist. The Arkansas Court of Appeals panel on Wednesday reversed Pulaski County Circuit Judge Tim Fox’s decision last year regarding the firing of former Officer Charles Starks over the fatal shooting of Bradley Blackshire. Starks fired his gun at least 15 times through the windshield of a car Blackshire was driving in February 2019. Fox reversed the Little Rock Civil Service Commission’s decision to uphold Starks’ firing and instead imposed a 30-day suspension and reduction in salary. Starks resigned in September and accused the police chief of making his working conditions “intolerable” after his reinstatement. Starks pulled over Blackshire because the car he was driving had been reported stolen, though Blackshire’s family has said he borrowed it from a friend. Surveillance and dashcam footage showed that Starks instructed Blackshire to exit the parked car. Instead, Blackshire began to slowly drive away and bumped Starks, who fired into the windshield four times. The car briefly stopped, and Starks got onto its hood and fired at least 11 more times into the car as it continued to move.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: State lawmakers have approved what advocacy groups say are the nation’s strongest protections against falsely labeling items as recyclable when they in fact are destined for landfills. The measure sent late Thursday to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom for his consideration would reserve the “chasing arrows” recycling symbol for items that actually can be recycled. The bill’s author, Democratic Sen. Ben Allen, said in a statement that it will force truth in advertising and “will reduce contamination in the recycling stream and improve the sorting process, thereby saving cities and ratepayers money while empowering consumers to make more informed decisions.” It’s among efforts in several states to ease confusion about recycling and increase recycling efforts. A Consumer Brands Association report recently asserted that confusion has led to “a broken recycling system in America.” A coalition of 14 opposition groups countered that the bill would have “resounding impacts” on the state’s goal to divert 75% of trash from landfills and hinder efforts to recycle packaging. The bill would likely require regulators to create a list of eligible items that “is extremely limiting,” potentially including just 15, the groups said – eight types of paper materials, two forms of glass, two types of metals, two types of plastics and one type of colored plastic.\n\nColorado\n\nGolden: Security workers will accompany nurses and staff members of Jefferson County Public Health’s three mobile vaccine units for the foreseeable future after months of harassment and abuse. One weekend this month, the agency was forced to pull vans off the street after a driver in Gilpin County, which contracts Jefferson County’s health agency, drove toward and destroyed signage around the van. Others “verbally abused” staff members Sept. 4, said Dr. Dawn Comstock, the agency’s executive director. These types of attacks have been going on for months, she said, but they’ve escalated to a higher degree. For instance, last month someone threw live fireworks into a tent of nurses and staff members, the Gazette reports. Despite the ongoing barrage of attacks and harassment, the county was still set to hold its COVID-19 vaccine events. “JCPH will not be intimidated out of its public health mission,” Comstock said. “We’ve arranged additional security measures to keep staff safe and will be working with our law enforcement partners to assure these handful of extremists are not allowed to infringe on the rights of those who want to be vaccinated.” Each incident has been reported to law enforcement, but each time the perpetrator has left the scene before officers arrived.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Tourism officials plan to spend more money than usual promoting the state’s fall foliage in an attempt help the industry rebound from the pandemic. Gov. Ned Lamont helped launch the $1.4 million “Full Color Connecticut” marketing campaign Friday, which he said will link leaf peeping to other attractions across the state. Tourism officials said the play on the fall colors is meant to highlight other colorful destinations in the state, “from the golds of corn mazes and the pinks of cotton candy to the blues of coastline sails and the ambers of craft beer.” The campaign’s budget is nearly triple the amount typically invested in a fall marketing program, officials said. It is designed to reach about 33% of the market in Connecticut, New York, Massachusetts and Rhode Island – compared to 10% in recent years – and expand into other markets, such as Philadelphia. The campaign also will take advantage of the state’s high COVID-19 vaccination rates, which tourism officials have said helped bring visitors to Connecticut this summer. The campaign will run through Nov. 20 and feature hundreds of tourism-related businesses, from the state’s parks and orchards to its casinos and shops.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Decades of structural defects and water damage have put a 30-year-old condominium complex at risk of collapse, but disagreements among condo owners over annual fees have prevented repairs from moving forward. “The buildings are deteriorating. We’ve been paying through the nose,” Michael “Mick” Donnelly said, comparing the situation at Le Parc, where he’s lived since 2009, to that of a condo that collapsed in June near Miami. “It’s been a nightmare situation similar to Surfside because the buildings are nearing condemnation and the people here don’t deserve it.” The fatal collapse of the 12-story condominium complex in Surfside, Florida, put many Le Parc residents on edge. Most of the issues found to have contributed to the collapse of the over 130-unit Champlain Towers South on June 24 mirror long-standing problems Le Parc owners have endured. Le Parc Condominiums – consisting of three four-story buildings housing 76 units – has faced similar issues to those at Champlain Tower South, including shoddy construction practices, design flaws, the developer going bankrupt, and decades of deterioration and water infiltration. While some emergency work was done, a permanent fix – estimated to cost $4.5 million – has been on hold nearly five years due to a lack of funds and financing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, who has a doctorate in education, joined D.C. middle school students and families Friday, welcoming them back to classrooms and honoring the educators who made it all possible, WUSA-TV reports. The first lady spoke at Brookland Middle School and delivered words of encouragement while acknowledging the challenges of the past year and a half during the coronavirus pandemic and highlighting goals to come. “We are going to partner with you because we don’t always know what the future holds, but we do know what we owe our children,” she said, while affirming that the administration will ensure schools like Brookland have the resources and support to continue in-person learning. “We owe them a promise to keep their schools open as safe as possible. We owe them a commitment to follow the science. We owe them unity so that we can fight the virus, not each other.” Meanwhile, the president emphasized the necessity of COVID-19 shots. “Parents, get your teens vaccinated – you’ve gotten them vaccinated for all types of other things,” he said. “The COVID-19 vaccine is safe, easy and convenient.” Biden also celebrated D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser’s vaccination efforts and her success in setting up 20 inoculation sites at local schools\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami Gardens: The most notable catch in Saturday’s NCAA football game between Miami and Appalachian State didn’t happen on the field. It wasn’t even a football. It was a cat. The animal somehow got into Hard Rock Stadium, then got caught by one of its paws off the facade of the upper deck in the first quarter. It eventually fell to the lower level of the stadium, where fans using an American flag as a makeshift net were able to safely break its fall and catch it before it was carried off to safety. “They were trying to grab it from above, and they couldn’t reach it, but they were scaring it downward,” said Craig Cromer, a facilities manager at the University of Miami and season ticket holder who with his wife, Kimberly, brings the flag to each home game. “It hung there for a little while with its two front paws, then one paw, then I was like, ‘Oh my goodness, it’s coming soon.’ ” That’s when the Cromers unhooked the flag from the railing and hoped for the best. The petrified cat fell, bounced a bit off the flag, and eventually was secured by some in the student section before being brought away by stadium security. “I’ll tell you, if the cat will help us in our red-zone offense, I’m going to see if we can give it a scholarship,” Miami coach Manny Diaz said. Some videos of the incident were posted on Twitter, tagged #HardRockCat.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city’s transit authority is soliciting public input for the exterior graphic design of new railcars. The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority is encouraging current and potential future riders to vote for one of four design options through its website or on its social media pages. All four designs include MARTA’s traditional color scheme and are inspired by “the dynamism and movement of trains,” according to a news release. The transit authority says more than 1,300 people participated in a similar crowdsourcing effort in the spring that sought input on the interior design of the railcars. Those votes and comments revealed that the most popular interior features are digital maps, next station and destination displays, and Americans with Disabilities Act accessible seating and signage, the release says. “We were thrilled with the response we received on the interior features and are eager to see what riders think of the exterior design options,” MARTA General Manager and CEO Jeffrey Parker said in the release. The new railcars are slated to arrive in stations in 2023.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige is requiring government contractors and visitors to state facilities to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination or a negative coronavirus test. Ige’s executive order issued Thursday takes effect Monday, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. State contractors must attest to their employees’ vaccination status or provide weekly tests for unvaccinated staff. Contractors also must wear masks and maintain physical distance while on state property. The order also applies to visitors to state facilities. It does not apply to beaches or outdoor state properties. Inmates at correctional facilities, patients at state hospitals, and children under 12 or students attending state public or charter schools are exempt. Travelers arriving at airports are also exempt. The order says it is intended for the “safety of the government workforce during this ongoing escalation in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, and deaths resulting from the delta variant.” Last month, Ige issued an executive order requiring state and county employees to be either vaccinated or tested weekly.\n\nIdaho\n\nCoeur d’Alene: Northern Idaho’s long, deep streak of anti-government activism has confounded attempts to battle a COVID-19 outbreak overwhelming hospitals in the deeply conservative region. A deadly 1992 standoff with federal agents near the Canadian border helped spark an expansion of radical right-wing groups across the country, and the area was for a long time the home of the Aryan Nations, whose leader envisioned a “White Homeland” in the county that is now among the hardest-hit of the pandemic. Hospitals in northern Idaho are so packed with COVID-19 patients that authorities announced last week that facilities would be allowed to ration health care. “This is extremism beyond anything I ever witnessed,” Tony Stewart said of people who refused to get vaccinated and wear masks. Stewart is a founding member of the Kootenai County Task Force on Human Relations, which battled the Aryan Nations for decades and helped bankrupt the neo-Nazi group. “I’m almost speechless in seeing so many people have lost concern for their fellow humans.” Anti-government sentiments are strong in northern Idaho. State Rep. Heather Scott, R-Blanchard, refused an interview request, saying reporters were liars. She has promoted mask-burning protests and is among lawmakers who have frequently pushed COVID-19 misinformation on Facebook.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Lawmakers are considering whether to put a statue on state Capitol grounds of Ronald Reagan, the Illinois native who served as the country’s 40th president. Members of the House Statue and Monument Review Task Force met Wednesday to discuss Reagan’s legacy and whether to memorialize him at the statehouse in Springfield, where there are statues of two of the four U.S. presidents who were either born in or launched their political careers from the state, the Chicago Sun-Times reports. Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses Grant are represented on the Capitol grounds, but not Reagan or Barack Obama, who started his political career in the Illinois Legislature. Reagan was born in Tampico and raised in Dixon. He later had an acting career in Hollywood before becoming governor of California. Rep. Mary Flowers, D-Chicago, the chairwoman of the task force, said that “whether we agree with his policies or not … (Reagan) had a profound impact on the direction of this country.” She noted Reagan’s “made-for-TV” presidency produced images and ideas that remain with the U.S. today – for better or worse. His “It’s Morning Again in America” campaign ad created an idealistic vision of the country, she said, but he also is credited with the offensive phrase “welfare queen.” The task force will continue to take public comment.\n\nIndiana\n\nLogansport: The body of a Marine who was among 13 U.S. service members killed in a suicide bombing during the U.S.-run evacuation at Afghanistan’s Kabul airport was returned Sunday to his northern Indiana hometown. A military procession marked the beginning of memorial services for Marine Corps Cpl. Humberto Sanchez, 22, of Logansport. Sanchez’s body arrived Sunday morning at Grissom Air Reserve Base. The procession then headed about 20 miles to Logansport. People lined the route to show their respects, many with American flags, and jets flew overhead as the procession approached downtown Logansport. It stopped briefly downtown, where the hearse carrying Sanchez’s body paused under a garrison flag. The procession included Indiana State Police and vehicles carrying Sanchez’s family, followed by thousands of motorcycles. Sanchez was among 17 members of his Logansport High School class who joined the military after their 2017 graduation. He died in the Aug. 26 attack in Kabul, where he had been transferred after serving as a U.S. embassy guard in Jordan, according to his obituary. A public visitation is scheduled for Monday at LifeGate Church in Logansport. The funeral is set for 11 a.m. Tuesday at the church. Burial will follow at Mount Hope Cemetery.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A state court judge declined Friday to halt enforcement of a law that prohibits school boards from enacting mask requirements, saying there is no evidence that any school board would immediately impose a mask mandate if the law weren’t in effect. The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by Frances Parr, a mother of twin boys from Council Bluffs. She sued the state, Gov. Kim Reynolds and several state officials last month in Polk County District Court, seeking an order halting enforcement of the law. Judge Celene Gogerty, who was appointed to the bench by Reynolds in November 2018, said Parr has presented no evidence that a temporary injunction would alleviate Parr’s alleged harm caused by the law. Parr has asserted the law violates her constitutional rights. Her sons were set to start first grade in the Council Bluffs Community School District this fall, but she is teaching them at home over fears for their safety because the school cannot require other students to wear masks. Parr also has asked Gogerty to issue an order for a universal mask mandate for all students and school personnel until a voluntary plan can be implemented that separates mask-wearing students and staff from those who refuse. That request has not yet been argued before the judge but is another available remedy, Gogerty said.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Hospitals across the state will receive $50 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds for extra pay for nurses to keep them on the job but will be required to report monthly on how many nurses they’ve lost and why, under a plan a state task force approved Friday. Kansas law required a bipartisan pandemic response task force to spell out how the $50 million would be spent, and the task force added the reporting requirement. The task force’s meeting came a day after President Joe Biden imposed new vaccine requirements for as many as 100 million Americans. Republican officials in Kansas and across the nation strongly criticized Biden’s mandate. Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover, proposed the reporting on nurses who’ve been terminated. He called Biden’s new federal vaccine requirements “dictatorial edicts.” “We’ve had front-line workers – I mean, you can call them heroes – on the front lines for the last year and a half,” Masterson said. He also said he worries that “we’re gonna get some of them premium pay, and we are going to give some others a pink slip.” Earlier in the week, Masterson proposed to make hospitals with vaccine mandates ineligible for retention incentives – a proposal that failed on a 5-2 vote.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Lawmakers grabbed the quarterback role to direct the response to COVID-19, but when it came time to lead, the GOP-led Legislature “punted” the decision on mask-wearing in schools to local boards, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear said Friday. A day after a special legislative session ended, Beshear gave a blistering response to the Legislature’s decision to halt statewide mask mandates to combat Kentucky’s worst surge of the coronavirus pandemic. He declared that the Legislature “owns this pandemic moving forward.” Legislators passed bills Thursday that scrapped a statewide mask mandate for public schools and imposed a ban on any statewide mask rules until June 2023. Beshear vetoed the mask-related language, but Republican lawmakers overrode him before ending their three-day session. “The masking decision the General Assembly made was wrong. And it was also a punt,” Beshear told reporters. “I’ve been willing to make the calls, to take the hits, to make the plays. And the Legislature asked to go in … at QB. And what did they do? They punted on first down. When you’re in charge, it means you’ve got to make the decision. This one was to push the decision to others.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Supply trucks are once again delivering beer on Bourbon Street, and the landmark Cafe Du Monde is serving beignets, fried pastries dusted with powdered sugar, even though there aren’t many tourists or locals around to partake of either. With almost all the power back on in New Orleans nearly two weeks after Hurricane Ida struck, the city is showing signs of making a comeback from the Category 4 storm, which is blamed for more than two dozen deaths in the state. More businesses are opening daily, gasoline is easier to find, and many roads are lined with huge debris piles from cleanup work. Thousands are still struggling without electricity and water outside the metro area, and officials say oppressive heat is contributing to health problems and misery. It could still be weeks before power is restored in some areas, and many residents who evacuated haven’t returned. “It is not lost on anybody here at the state level and certainly not on our local partners just how many people continue to suffer,” Gov. John Bel Edwards said Thursday. “While things are getting better, and we can be thankful for that … this is going to be a very long-term recovery.”\n\nMaine\n\nPhippsburg: A group wants to create an oyster reef off the town’s coast to improve water quality, protect a shoreline from storm surges and act as a habitat for other smaller shellfish. The oyster reef is part of the fight against “the immense amount of change” that’s taking place because of climate change in waters off the Maine coast, Marissa McMahan, a senior fisheries scientist at Manomet, a Brunswick-based conservation nonprofit, told the Times Record. The project is the continuation of a two-year pilot program the Nature Conservancy began in 2017. The conservatory’s goal was to see if an oyster reef could be grown on the ocean floor in the Gulf of Maine, which is warming faster than 99% of the world’s large bodies of saltwater, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Phippsburg group is growing oysters in bags that float on the surface of the water. They’ll eventually be released into the ocean with a hope that they’ll attach to one another and grow as a vertical structure. Oysters benefit the environment because they filter algae, creating clearer, cleaner water that can support underwater grasses used for habitat by crabs, scallops and fish. They also can break up waves and reduce shore erosion.\n\nMaryland\n\nBethesda: Activists are calling for the return of a Black cemetery to a church decades after it was erased by development. The Rev. William J. Barber II and Rev. Liz Theoharis, co-chairs of the Poor People’s Campaign, spoke by Zoom to participants at a Friday rally, which organizers said included descendants of those buried at the Moses African Cemetery and members of the Macedonia Baptist Church. The church plans to restore the cemetery and build a monument and museum on the site. The Bethesda African Cemetery Coalition sued Montgomery County’s Housing Opportunities Commission last month claiming that part of the cemetery is beneath the parking lot of the Westwood Tower Apartments, news outlets report. The housing agency owns the property and apartment building and uses the rental income to cover costs of the agency. An estimated 500 bodies of enslaved people or relatives of the enslaved rest at the cemetery, the lawsuit says. The plaintiffs argue that selling the parcel that was used as a burial ground without court approval violates state law. Last week, a Montgomery County judge temporarily blocked the $51 million sale of land that includes the Westwood Tower Apartments, WTOP-FM reports. The temporary restraint forbids the sale until a Sept. 27 hearing on the matter.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nLawrence: The body of a U.S. Marine killed in a suicide bombing in Afghanistan returned home Saturday in a solemn procession through Massachusetts on the 20th anniversary of the attacks that led to America’s longest war. Sgt. Johanny Rosario Pichardo died in the Aug. 26 bombing near the Kabul airport where people were being evacuated amid the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan. A dozen other U.S. service members and 169 Afghans were killed as people struggled to get into the airport and on flights out of the country. Dignitaries including Gov. Charlie Baker, Boston Mayor Kim Janey and U.S. Sen. Edward Markey paid their respects to Rosario Pichardo’s family as her body arrived at Boston’s Logan International Airport. In her hometown, Lawrence, people lined highway overpasses and streets waving American flags as the vehicle procession made its way through the city near the New Hampshire state line. A Marine honor guard carried the flag-draped draped casket into the Farrah Funeral Home as police, firefighters and others stood and saluted. “We will never forget her name,” Lawrence Mayor Kendrys Vasquez said afterward. “We are proud to have her home.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday vetoed a Republican-sponsored bill that would have restricted state officials’ ability to use the Public Threat Alert System to announce new laws or executive orders. The Democratic governor, whose veto had been expected, said the system has only been activated once in the five years since it was created, for an active-shooter situation. The state used a different, federal system last year to send alerts to wireless devices about Whitmer’s stay-at-home and mask orders due to the coronavirus pandemic. That angered GOP lawmakers who said it should only be activated for “immediate” threats. That system would not have been affected by the state legislation. In a letter to legislators, the governor said the bill “would add complexity to the administration of the state’s public threat alert system, making it harder for law enforcement officers to do their jobs and making Michiganders less safe. … There is no need to further limit or complicate its use.” The measure had cleared the Republican-controlled Legislature mostly along party lines. The federal Wireless Alert System allows four types of messages: presidential alerts, imminent threat alerts, AMBER alerts and – as of 2019 – public safety messages designed to save lives or safeguard property. People can opt out of the latter three.\n\nMinnesota\n\nIsabella: Authorities said Sunday that a vast majority of the Greenwood Lake wildfire in northern Minnesota is contained, one month after lighting ignited the blaze in the Superior National Forest. The U.S. Forest Service reported that the nearly 27,000-acre fire was 67% contained as of Sunday morning. The Forest Service had said last week that the fire was nearly half under control as hundreds of firefighters were still being dispatched to the area. “I think the team is feeling really good about how things are looking out there. There’s been a lot of great work done and progress made taking advantage of this cooler weather,” Fire Service spokeswoman Stefani Spencer said. “The containment is pretty much growing every day.” Spencer added that the public is happy to have roads open, including all traffic opened along Highway 2. She said the closure was an inconvenience and frustration for folks traveling to Ely and the popular Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness, the Star Tribune reports. The fire started Aug. 15 about 10 miles southwest of Isabella has destroyed 14 cabins and homes along with 57 outbuildings. Some residents in the affected area who were evacuated have recently been allowed to return to homes and cabins after the fire lost intensity.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Physicians who spread misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines could now have their licenses to practice medicine suspended or completely revoked, according to a new policy adopted by the Mississippi State Board of Medical Licensure. The policy, adopted Sept. 7, says doctors have an “ethical and professional responsibility” to practice medicine in the best interest of their patients and share factual and scientifically grounded information with them. “Spreading inaccurate COVID-19 vaccine information contradicts that responsibility, threatens to further erode public trust in the medical profession and puts all patients at risk,” the policy says. Whether physicians “recognize it or not,” they possess a high degree of public trust due to their specialized knowledge and training, giving them “a powerful platform in society,” it says. The policy specifically warns doctors against spreading misinformation on social media and strongly recommends physicians separate their personal and professional content online. “Physicians must understand that actions online and content posted can affect their reputation, have consequences for their medical careers, and undermine public trust in the medical profession,” it says.\n\nMissouri\n\nLiberty: Thieves in the Kansas City area have in the past month have taken two churches’ fruit harvests. Hosanna! Lutheran Church in Liberty had planned to harvest grapes it grows after a Sunday worship service earlier this month, WDAF-TV reports. But members discovered that all 1,500 pounds of grapes had been stolen, apparently cut off their vines. The church has for about 15 years had the grapes bottled for communion wine. The harvest is a big annual event, especially for children in the congregation. The grapes were valued at $1,500. “This wasn’t really about theft of grapes,” said Pastor Mike Kern. “We don’t care about the value. It was more of a theft of joy.” Kern’s church was not alone. St. Peter and All Saints Episcopal Church in Kansas City reported that four of its apple and pear trees were recently picked clean, too. The anticipated harvest was three or four years in the making. The Rev. Jonathan Frazier said the Episcopal church donates its fruit to a nearby food pantry and a downtown homeless shelter. “So it’s just really sad because for somebody to take that quantity of fruit, they’re probably going to sell it,” he said.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Glacier National Park’s reservation system for Going-to-the-Sun Road, which ended last week after a three-month trial run, caused countless headaches for locals and outsiders who struggled to secure $2 tickets, but park officials say it worked as intended, alleviating traffic congestion inside the park and preventing long lines of cars from spilling onto U.S. 2. “Generally we do feel it was a success because it met our major goals,” Glacier spokesperson Gina Kerzman told the Daily Inter Lake. Kerzman noted the park never had to close the west entrance, as it has been forced to do in past seasons, and there were never more than about 15 cars backed up on the highway. In recent years, she said, traffic jams have stretched for miles from West Glacier to Coram. Additionally, the reservation system helped ensure that many visitors could find parking and access their desired trailheads and campsites. “We feel that we were able to manage the number of visitors and be able to ensure a good experience for everybody,” Kerzman said. Of course, not everyone was enamored by the new approach to crowd control. One recent review on tripadvisor.com called the reservation system “a disgrace” that made it “impossible” to access the park and prompted the author to cancel their visit, losing money on a hotel booking.\n\nNebraska\n\nNorfolk: Starting in early 2022, public transit will be more widely available in the city and surrounding communities. To address the increasing demand for public transit in Northeast Nebraska, the newly renamed North Fork Area Transit announced new services that will provide “safe, efficient and affordable” public transportation. A new flexroute bus service called “Forklift” will provide rides along three routes and the addition of almost 100 bus stops across the community, said Steve Rames, Norfolk’s public works director. The Norfolk Daily News reports that Forklift, which will operate seven days a week, will also allow anyone who lives within three-quarters of a mile from any marked bus stop to schedule curbside service. The flexroutes will run from 6:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on weekends. The system will likely rotate on 30-minute cycles during peak times and one-hour cycles during non-peak times, Rames said. The North Fork Area Transit’s existing call-ahead ride service will continue but under a new name, “Telelift.” With Telelift, riders are able to schedule a ride 24 hours in advance. Service is available up to 30 miles around Norfolk, seven days a week, Rames said.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A change in newly issued Nevada driver’s licenses means airport security screeners may have to manually check the credentials because their scanners can’t read the bar codes, officials said. The Transportation Security Administration hasn’t yet updated its scanning system to account for a minor change to the bar code on the state’s new license design, said Kevin Malone, a state Department of Motor Vehicles spokesman. TSA agents at U.S. airports can manually inspect a license if the scanning system won’t read the bar code, TSA Lorie Danker spokeswoman said. The state began issuing licenses with the new design in July. A note on the DMV’s website recommends that travelers allow extra time to complete airport security screening.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBrentwood: Dozens of families have challenged mask-wearing policies in New Hampshire school districts during the coronavirus pandemic, with two cases in court Friday calling for injunctions to stop enforcing them. A lawyer representing families in the Epping, Londonderry and Timberlane districts argued at a Rockingham County Superior Court hearing that mask mandates violate the parents’ rights to make health care and medical decisions for their children, and they are illegal restraints under a state law that limits the use of child restraint practices in school. “Their children have difficulty breathing with these masks on,” attorney Robert Fojo said. “It’s causing them to be afraid; they suffer anxiety and stress as a result of wearing these masks, experiencing lightheadedness and trouble concentrating. Masks irritate their skin, cause acne. It exacerbates already inherent problems that they have, such as asthma, difficulty with speech, learning-related disabilities, and obviously a distraction. They inhibit social interaction, which is what these children should be doing in school.” Attorneys for the school districts have argued for the case to be dismissed, saying the districts have been following a “tool kit” for schools from the state Department of Health and Human Services that recommends mask-wearing.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Four more counties have received a major disaster declaration from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, paving the way for residents of Essex, Hudson, Mercer and Union counties to access federal assistance in the wake of the remnants of Hurricane Ida, Gov. Phil Murphy confirmed. The declaration comes after Bergen, Gloucester, Hunterdon, Middlesex, Passaic and Somerset counties received declarations from the White House last Monday. The declaration allows for assistance with needs like grants for temporary housing and home repairs, among other things that will help residents and business owners in the aftermath of Ida. There also will be federal funding available to all levels of government as well as some nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work to repair or replace facilities damaged by the storm in the designated counties. Many in Essex County had been pushing for a disaster declaration after the area got crushed by Ida. Montclair officials had hoped for FEMA to include the county after the storm brought “devastating” flooding. In Montclair, which received 7.5 inches of rain, at least 50 drivers were rescued from cars and countless more ruined, more than 150 basements needed to be pumped out, officials said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Native American communities across the state are putting the finishing touches on proposed redistricting maps aimed at greater self-determination in future public elections, as competing plans wind their way toward the Legislature for consideration. Participants in a redistricting commission for New Mexico’s Indigenous pueblo communities said Friday that map proposals may be finalized as soon as this week. The maps will be submitted to a seven-member Citizen Redistricting Commission that is reviewing and vetting redistricting maps for the Legislature, which can adopt recommendations or start from scratch. The seven-seat commission has no Native American representation. New Mexico is home to 23 federally recognized tribes, whose growing political clout is reflected in the election of Laguna Pueblo tribal member Deb Haaland to Congress in 2016 and her promotion this year to secretary of the interior. Attorney Joseph Little is working with a broad alliance of Native American communities to turn redistricting principles into action using results of the 2020 census to track population changes. Major redistricting changes are most likely in the heavily Native American northwest region of the state and an oil-producing region in the southeast.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: For the first time in 550 days, an audience was inside the auditorium at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts on Saturday night, attending a Metropolitan Opera performance of Verdi’s “Requiem.” The night of multiple extended standing ovations was in commemoration of the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks but in fact marked much more. The company was performing in its home for the first time since hundreds of thousands of deaths caused by the coronavirus pandemic, including Met violist Vincent Lionti, assistant conductor Joel Revzen and chorister Antoine Hodge. It also marked the first performance in the house since the death of conductor James Levine, the Met’s towering figure of the last half-century. He died in March at 77, a little over three years after was he was fired for sexual improprieties. Levine’s successor as music director on the podium is 46-year-old Yannick Nezet-Seguin. The pandemic caused the Met to cancel more than 275 performances, including its entire 2020-21 season, plus an international tour. The gap was the longest since the company began in 1883. A series of Broadway shows will start opening this week. The New York Philharmonic begins Friday at Alice Tully Hall, while David Geffen Hall undergoes reconstruction expected to last another year.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A judge has set a mid-October deadline for state lawmakers to follow a court-ordered plan to provide full funding for improving public education, or he will take action himself. State Superior Court Judge David Lee said he was “very disheartened” that the General Assembly is funding a small part of a plan calling for at least $5.6 billion in new education funding by 2028, news outlets report. Lee has scheduled a court hearing Oct. 18 and said if the plan isn’t fully funded by then, he will consider options on how the court can resolve the matter. Pat Ryan, a spokesman for Senate leader Phil Berger, also accused Lee of overstepping his authority, The News & Observer of Raleigh reports. Lee’s warning marks the next stage in the Leandro school funding case first filed in 1994 by low-wealth school districts to get more state funding. The case is named after a Hoke County student who has since graduated from college. The North Carolina Supreme Court assigned Lee to oversee the case after Judge Howard Manning retired. Over the years, the state’s highest court has ruled that the North Carolina Constitution guarantees every child “an opportunity to receive a sound basic education” and that the state wasn’t meeting that standard.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State agriculture officials have confirmed a second case of cattle anthrax in Kidder County. The case was confirmed by the North Dakota State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory on Friday, according to the state Agriculture Department. The first case was reported in August. Officials say producers in the county and surrounding areas should check with their veterinarians to see if they should start vaccinating their cattle for anthrax. The disease is caused by bacterial spores that can lie dormant in the ground for decades and become active under ideal conditions, such as drought. Anthrax vaccines are readily available, but it takes about a week to establish immunity, and the vaccine must be administered annually. Two cases of anthrax were reported in North Dakota in 2020. In 2005, more than 500 confirmed animal deaths from anthrax were reported, with total livestock losses estimated at more than 1,000.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The Cincinnati Police Department is pledging to increase recruitment of female officers to reach the goal of a force composed of 30% women by the year 2030. The department announced it is joining the New York University School of Law’s “30x30 Pledge.” In addition to recruitment, Cincinnati police also want to improve the retention and promotion of women in policing. According to a memo from the Cincinnati City Manager’s Office, the force is currently 22.7% female, compared to the national average of 13%. Officials say about 100 departments throughout the country have signed the pledge. “The goal of the pledge is not only to inform agency progress but also to identify and understand barriers to progress such as resources, capacity or authority,” the manager’s office reported. Officials said the police force should also be representative of the population it serves, which is 51% female.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Supreme Court has rejected a request to remove two members of the state’s Pardon and Parole Board from a high-profile death penalty case. The court’s brief ruling Friday denied a prosecutor’s request to remove Adam Luck and Kelly Doyle from considering the commutation request of Julius Jones, who was sentenced to death for the 1999 killing of Edmond businessman Paul Howell. The ruling came after a lawyer for District Attorney David Prater argued before a court referee that unless members Luck and Doyle were barred from taking part in the decision, the five-member board would likely recommend that Jones’ sentence be commuted following a hearing Monday. Prater, who argued that Luck and Doyle have a conflict of interest because of their work with released inmates, said in a statement that he respects the high court’s decision. “This is the system I operate in every day and I believe in it, though decisions don’t always go as I desire,” Prater wrote. He said his office is prepared to present “the truth of the circumstances” surrounding the fatal shooting of Howell during a carjacking. “If the Board objectively considers the truth, they will quickly vote to deny the killer’s commutation request,” Prater wrote.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Transportation Commission has granted conditional approval to a plan to expand Interstate 5 through Portland’s Rose Quarter as well as build a cap over the freeway to allow for the redevelopment of a Black community destroyed when the interstate was first built. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the commission’s unanimous decision Thursday follows the recommendation of Gov. Kate Brown that the Oregon Department of Transportation pursue “hybrid option 3.” That plan would essentially tunnel the freeway and provide economic opportunity for the region’s Black community in an effort to reclaim the Albina district. Supporters say the idea is to remediate historic harm caused by the freeway’s original construction and displacement of community members. Approval of the hybrid 3 model is contingent upon ODOT providing a thorough analysis of the project’s cost structure and funding sources by December. It also requires ODOT and its contractors to update its diversity and subcontracting plans and to reevaluate the project’s initial environmental impact study. The project’s cost has risen significantly from its initial price tag of between $715 million and 795 million to upward of $1.18 billion.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Some physicians are offering stock doctor’s notes for use by parents wishing to have their children exempted from wearing masks in school, according to state health officials who say they have referred the matter for possible disciplinary action. A statewide, universal mask mandate for Pennsylvania schools went into effect Tuesday as the Wolf administration seeks to keep school buildings open for in-person learning amid the latest surge in COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths. The acting health secretary’s face covering order contains an exemption for students for whom wearing a mask would cause or worsen a medical condition. But parents in districts that require a doctor’s note or other medical documentation have complained it’s been difficult to find a physician who will sign off. The Health Department said some doctors are pushing stock exemptions available to anyone. “The administration is aware that some physicians have indicated that they intend to offer blanket ‘exemptions’ to individuals with whom they have no treatment relationship, and regardless of whether the individual’s physical condition required an exemption,” the department said in a statement. Those doctors “have been and will be referred to the appropriate licensing boards for possible disciplinary action.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingstown: A pond has been closed to shellfish harvesting after seven people reported becoming ill after consuming raw shellfish harvested in the area last month. The state departments of health and environmental management said Saturday that Potter Pond in South Kingstown will be closed until further notice. The agencies said two of the sickened individuals tested positive for Campylobacter Jejuni. People with Campylobacter infection usually have diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps as well as nausea and vomiting, the agencies said. The symptoms usually start after two to five days and last about one week. The agencies advise anyone who consumed shellfish from the area and is feeling ill to seek medical attention, as more serious complications can develop. Health officials say they’ve contacted all commercial harvesters in the area to ensure that any product harvested during the time frame under investigation is not sold at restaurants and markets. They’re also urging recreational harvesters who collected shellfish between Thursday and Saturday in the pond to either discard them or avoid consuming them raw or undercooked. Officials say quick steaming isn’t sufficient to prevent illness, but cooking the shellfish until it reaches an internal temperature of at least 145 degrees Fahrenheit can reduce risk.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A lawsuit filed in federal court is asking a judge to overturn a requirement in state ethics laws that makes it illegal for anyone who files a complaint against a public official from talking about it unless the complaint is found valid. The lawsuit is filed by a whistleblower who says a state lawmaker broke ethics laws by voting in favor of a special interest that paid the legislator $108,000 over three years through contracts with firms with ties to the lawmaker. The State Ethics Commission rejected the complaint after discussing it behind closed doors, saying the lawmaker taking money from a subsidiary of the special interest didn’t affiliate him with the interest, the whistleblower’s lawyer said in a lawsuit obtained by The Post and Courier. In the lawsuit, attorney Chris Kenney called the finding a “legal absurdity.” Kenney, who works in state Sen. Dick Harpootlian’s law firm, told the newspaper he can’t further identify the lawmaker or the special interest without a ruling in his favor from the court. Ethics laws prevent people who file a complaint from talking about it publicly before the complaint is heard and also if the commission rules against it, even on a technical issue. Critics of that provision have said it violates free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nDeadwood: The first sporting bets have been wagered in the city, bringing to fruition an effort that began several years ago after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that banned commercial sports gambling. Four casinos in Deadwood opened sports betting Thursday: Tin Lizzie, Cadillac Jack’s, Gold Dust and Mustang Sally’s. Betting is only allowed at licensed facilities in Deadwood. People can place their bets with tellers at a window, at a digital kiosk or, soon, through an app on their phone. The app will only work within the facilities. The South Dakota Commission on Gaming issued a final ruling Wednesday on a list of sporting events on which gamblers will be able to place bets, including Olympic events and professional and college-level sports, the Rapid City Journal reports. Deadwood Gaming Association Executive Director Mike Rodman said Thursday’s opening was a success. “We’re very pleased that we got to this point,” he said. “And it’s been a long haul getting there. We’re happy to be there today.” In 2019, the Deadwood Gaming Commission attempted to get the Legislature to legalize it but came up three votes short. In 2020, South Dakota voters legalized sports gambling with about 58% approval, and the Legislature passed the gaming laws in 2021.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The federal Environmental Protection Agency is proposing the addition of a former munitions factory just outside the city to a list of prioritized Superfund toxic cleanup sites, U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen said. The EPA has proposed adding the National Fireworks site in the Memphis suburb of Cordova to its Superfund National Priorities List for removal of toxic chemicals detected in groundwater, Cohen, D-Memphis, said in a statement Thursday. National Fireworks made flares, grenades, incendiary bombs and large caliber rounds for the U.S. Army and Navy from 1942 to 1945, the EPA said. Metals and chlorinated solvent contamination have been identified in the soil and groundwater on the Superfund site, the EPA said. The 260-acre site was redeveloped in 1986 as an industrial park. The listing would make the site eligible for cleanup funding as one of the nation’s highest priority contamination sites. The site is “dangerously close to Memphis’ Shaw Wellfield that provides drinking water to 79,000 people,” Cohen said.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: The CEO of Salesforce said the company will help employees leave the state, and he did so while retweeting a story linking the offer to concern about Texas’ new anti-abortion law. Salesforce, which sells customer-management software, joins a small number of companies that have reacted against the law. CNBC reported that the San Francisco-based company told employees in a Slack message that it will help them move “if you have concerns about access to reproductive healthcare in your state.” On Friday night, CEO Marc Benioff retweeted a post about the story, adding: “Ohana if you want to move we’ll help you exit TX. Your choice.” Ohana is a Hawaiian term for family. The company did not return messages for comment. The Texas law passed the Republican-controlled Legislature and was signed by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in May but didn’t go into effect until this month. It bans most abortions after six weeks, before many women know whether they are pregnant, and lets private residents sue anyone who helps a woman get an abortion. By a 5-4 vote, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to block the law. Last week the U.S. Justice Department sued Texas to block the law.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Thirteen Utah hospitals will postpone many nonemergency surgeries starting this week as health care workers are overwhelmed by another surge in coronavirus cases from the faster-spreading delta variant, a major health care company said Friday. Intermountain Healthcare announced that the hospitals will postpone non-urgent procedures for several weeks starting Wednesday. The announcement comes a week after state hospital leaders made emotional pleas for vaccinations and universal masking to curb the state’s ongoing COVID-19 surge. Hospital utilization in Utah is nearing its previous peak in December, when intensive care units were 104% full, and 606 COVID-19 patients in hospitals. There were 516 people hospitalized for COVID-19, and ICUs were 93% full as of Thursday, state data shows. About 62% of Utah residents ages 12 and older were fully vaccinated as of Thursday. Utah reported 10 new deaths from COVID-19 on Thursday, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 2,703. Several Utah hospitals postponed nonemergency surgeries at the start of the pandemic in 2020 to alleviate some of the strain on health care networks.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The city’s annual marathon has been shortened so that fewer health care professionals will be needed at the race next month amid a surge in COVID-19 infections, organizers said. The People’s United Bank Vermont City Marathon & Relay will be a half marathon and modified relay event Oct. 24, RunVermont said. “After extensive review and discussions with professionals associated with the health care field, RunVermont believes it would be insensitive to ask those professionals to step aside from their duties to attend to the needs of the race at a time when the medical community is under some significant strain,” the organization said in a statement. Marathon runners can switch to a half marathon, select a virtual marathon option or defer the race until May 2022, organizers said. They can also chose to enter one of three races on a complimentary basis if space is available: the Mad Marathon in Vermont on Sept. 12; the Adirondack Marathon in upstate New York on Oct. 3; or the Eversource Hartford Marathon in Connecticut on Oct. 9.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Arrests on marijuana-related charges have fallen dramatically this summer in and around the capital city since a new law legalized possession of small amounts of pot and residents keeping a few cannabis plants, according to a newspaper report. Twenty-five marijuana-related arrests occurred in Richmond and in Chesterfield, Hanover and Henrico counties in the first seven weeks after the law took effect July 1, compared to 257 arrrests during the same period last year, the Richmond Times-Dispatch reports, citing local law enforcement data. “A 90% reduction in marijuana arrests indicates that the public policy is performing as intended and in a manner that is consistent with post-legalization observations from other states,” said Jenn Michelle Pedini, executive director of the Virginia chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. The law legalized possession by adults age 21 and over of up to 1 ounce of marijuana and the cultivation of four pot plants per household, among other decriminalization provisions. Selling marijuana remains illegal until the state launches a regulated market in 2024 and issues licenses. A regulatory board will help carry out the details.\n\nWashington\n\nLa Conner: The Swinomish Tribe is threatening to sue the federal government to speed up estuary restoration and salmon preservation on the Skagit River delta. Much of the estuary has been drained and closed off with tide gates to facilitate agriculture, but such habitat is crucial for juvenile salmon. The tribe says that under an agreement reached in 2010 – following a prior lawsuit – the Army Corps of Engineers isn’t supposed to grant construction permits to dike districts for work on the tide gates unless they first restore estuary habitat. But for the past five years, the Corps has been doing just that, the tribe says. During that time, at least 660 acres should have been restored. The restoration efforts are now behind the agreement’s schedule, which calls for restoring 2,700 acres by 2035. At the current pace, it will take a century to complete that, tribal scientists say. The tribe notified the Army Corps last week that it intends to sue within 60 days, saying the agency has allowed the dike districts to violate the Endangered Species Act. Skagit River Chinook salmon are protected under the law. The Army Corps and NOAA Fisheries said they are reviewing the tribe’s claims.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nMorgantown: West Virginia University is expanding its mask mandate to include all indoor campus spaces, officials said Friday. Masks will be required beginning Monday in all buildings and facilities regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status through Oct. 6, when public health conditions will be reevaluated, the school said in a statement. Last month, the university began requiring masks to be worn in classrooms and labs, citing several factors, including that not enough students and employees have submitted proof that they have been inoculated against COVID-19. The numbers of cases and quarantines involving university employees and students remain manageable, but officials said they decided to take the precautionary step due to the recent, significant increase of COVID-19 cases in the state. The mask requirement won’t apply in personal office spaces, small gatherings in residence halls, or while eating or exercising, officials said. Meanwhile, Gov. Jim Justice said Friday that cases in West Virginia are still rising, and there are a record number of patients in intensive care units and on ventilators. He continued to urge residents to get vaccinated. “This thing is running rampant right now,” he said. “These vaccines are incredibly safe, and they’ll stop this.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A woman who admitted to helping stab a classmate to please online horror character Slender Man will be freed Monday from a mental health institution under strict conditions, a judge ruled Friday. Anissa Weier, 19, will be released after spending almost four years at the Winnebago Mental Health Institute in Oshkosh. A conditional release plan calls for her to live with her father, submit to around-the-clock GPS monitoring and receive psychiatric treatment, among other things. She won’t be allowed to use the internet except at home, and the state Department of Corrections will monitor her online activity. Weier and a friend, Morgan Geyser, both were committed to Winnebago after pleading guilty to attacking Payton Leutner when they were all 12 years old. Geyser stabbed Leutner multiple times as Weier urged her on. Leutner suffered 19 stab stab wounds – including one that narrowly missed her heart – and barely survived. Waukesha County Judge Michael Bohren said the conditions of Weier’s release were fair, and the plan “provides for the protection of the community” as well as for Leutner and for Weier herself. Weier, dressed in a dark suit and smiling occasionally, said nothing during the 20-minute proceeding. “She looks forward to moving on into a productive life,” her attorney, Maura McMahon, told the judge.\n\nWyoming\n\nSheridan: Artifacts found this summer at Medicine Lodge Archaeological Site are slated for radiocarbon dating, which could tell researchers more about when the Crow, or Apsaalooke, people came to the area, according to the state archaeologist. “This summer, we found Crow ceramics, as well a range of things, from thousands and thousands of flakes and 10 arrow points (or arrowheads) and preforms to make arrowheads to animal bone from bison as well as bighorn sheep, as well as obsidian,” Wyoming State Archaeologist Spencer Pelton said. “We really hoped to find Crow ceramics to radiocarbon date, to have a better idea of how old those ceramics are.” Sharon Peregoy, a member of the Montana House of Representatives who represents the Crow Agency, said this type of work may help date early people of the area, preserving – or recovering – history that can otherwise be lost. “It helps dispel the concept that the Crow, Apsaalooke, people were new transplants to the area,” she said, adding that in this context, “new” means an arrival of 500 years ago. “The findings of these types of excavations and research correlates with our Crow oral history, which dates from time immemorial … prehistoric,” Peregoy said. “History is important to preserve a homeland for future generations.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/16/stolen-atm-plan-lawsuit-huge-trout-news-around-states/50842757/", "title": "Stolen ATM, Plan B lawsuit: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: People with relatives and loved ones in Alabama prisons rallied outside the state Capitol Friday to decry what they described as inhumane conditions behind bars and a parole process that sees few inmates released. More than 200 people joined the rally outside the Capitol. Tombstones were placed on the white marble steps of the Alabama Capitol to represent the men who died in Alabama prisons from suicides, murders and overdoses. The rally followed a three-week work strike at many prisons aimed at seeking changes to state sentencing laws and the parole system. Inmates refused to show up for jobs in prison kitchens, janitorial services and laundries, jobs that keep the prisons functioning but for which the inmates receive no pay. The Alabama Department of Corrections said Friday that two facilities for men continue to have complete work stoppages, and three facilities have partial work stoppages. Inmates and activists have accused the Department of Corrections of using pressure tactics in an attempt to end the demonstration. Officials said the reduced rations and the lack of visits were the result of a prisoner labor shortage. The U.S. Department of Justice is suing Alabama over the conditions in its prisons, saying the state is failing to protect male inmates from inmate-on-inmate violence and excessive force at the hands of prison staff. The case is slated for trial in 2024. Alabama officials have acknowledged problems but deny that the living conditions violate constitutional standards.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Mayor Dave Bronson’s administration officials approved a contractor to spend millions on building an emergency shelter without getting needed approval from the Assembly, Alaska Public Media reports. Public Works Director Lance Wilber said the city had given Roger Hickel Contracting the go-ahead to spend $4.9 million on the construction of a shelter and navigation center in East Anchorage. “The error on our part was that, in the traditional construction contracting process, we should have gone to the Assembly initially, and asked to amend the Hickel contract,” Wilber said. Anchorage municipal code states that any city contract of more than $50,000 has to be approved by the Assembly, according to the news outlet. The Assembly was supposed to vote on the contract in September, but the vote was pushed to Oct. 25 after concerns over costs. The East Anchorage shelter has been key to the Bronson administration’s response to homelessness.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Officials say eviction filings are continuing to rise in Arizona’s largest county, with the average judgment against tenants nearly doubling from four years ago. Maricopa County Justice Courts spokesman Scott Davis said this week that September was the third month in a row in which the filings were higher than they had been since October 2008. Maricopa County is home to Phoenix, the fifth largest city in the U.S. The average judgment against an evicted tenant has hit $3,337.50, up from $1,750.58 in 2008, said Davis. He also noted the number of eviction cases being sealed to protect tenants is rising due to a new law, with 248 cases sealed in just two weeks. Cases can be sealed to protect the tenant from future credit problems if, for instance, the rent is paid or if the paperwork is found to be deficient. Maricopa County had among the highest levels of evictions in the United States before state and federal eviction moratoriums slowed lockouts during the pandemic. Those eviction bans have long since ended.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Medical marijuana patients in the state are on track to spend more at dispensaries in 2022 than they did in 2021, a spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration reports. Overall, purchases made by patients at Arkansas dispensaries totaled $31 million in 2019, then $182 million in 2020, $264.9 million in 2021 and so far this year, $205 million through the first nine months of 2022, said Scott Hardin, spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Finance Administration. “By the end of December, our overall sales for 2022 should certainly be above the $264.9 million sold in 2021,” Hardin said. While Arkansans approved medical marijuana in November 2016 in what is now Amendment 98 to the State Constitution, the first dispensary did not open in the state until May 2019. Arkansas limited the number of dispensaries allowed to sell medical marijuana. A limit on the number of dispensaries is also proposed in the Issue 4 state question on ballots for voters to consider legalizing recreational marijuana Nov. 8. “The reason sales were so low in 2019 was the number of dispensaries in operation. There were only a few dispensaries open for an extended period in 2019,” Hardin said. The number increased to 14 dispensaries by the end of 2019. There are currently 38 dispensaries. State tax revenue generated from medial marijuana totaled $2.9 million in 2019, $21.2 million in 2020, $33.1 million in 2021 and $23.9 million in 2022 through the first nine months. Overall, that is $81 million generated in state tax revenue since mid-2019.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCamp Pendleton: The Marine Corps has halted some operations of its new amphibious combat vehicles after one of the armored vehicles rolled over in surf during training. The eight-wheeled vehicle flipped over at about 7:45 p.m. Thursday at the Marines Assault Amphibian School at the base north of San Diego, authorities said. The three crew members weren’t injured, a Marine Corps statement said Friday. The vehicle had a “mechanical malfunction,” according to the Marine Corps, which banned the vehicles from going into or out of surf zones, except for testing, while more analysis is performed. The vehicles can still be used on land, in protected waters and in the open ocean. It was the second time this year that restrictions have been placed on the use of amphibious combat vehicles. Open water operations were halted after one of the vehicles rolled onto its side and another was disabled in unusually high surf on July 19 during another training exercise. The pause was lifted last month. The new vehicles, which are being tested and used in California, are designed to transport troops and their equipment from Navy ships to land. They are being rolled out to replace the Marine’s aging amphibious assault vehicle, which is lighter, slower and runs on tracks instead of wheels.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: The city is starting a multiday cleanup and outreach effort at Fountain Creek alongside partner agencies Monday to address environmental health and safety concerns. According to a news release from the city, the area has been identified as a concern for city officials, residents and business owners and there have been growing concerns of trash and people experiencing homelessness who often use the space as an encampment. Pueblo Code Enforcement unit is organizing the effort to gather community partners, including the Pueblo police and fire departments, for the cleanup. “The city of Pueblo’s biggest concern is the safety and health of the individuals in Pueblo and the protection of our waterway. We know this cleanup will provide much-needed outreach and the environmental protection in the area,” Mayor Nick Gradisar said in the release. Community partners involved in the effort are expected to provide outreach to the individuals experiencing homelessness in the area to meet their needs and connect them to resources. Loaders and skid steers will be used to transport trash, and once the cleanup is completed, boulders will be placed at various points in the area to discourage people from driving in and camping or living there.\n\nConnecticut\n\nPlainfield: Turbo-charged donations collected over the last two years from popular Plainfield motorcycle events helped the town secure a state grant that will add a bevy of new recreational offerings at a local park. Since first introducing the Plainfield Bike Night events two years ago, the overseeing event committee has taken in $22,500 from sponsors, sales and entrance fees, money later funneled into the town’s Recreation Department for use for parks and other improvements. But the “real” amount of those contributions is closer to $80,000 – a four-fold jump – thanks to the use of matching grants, town officials said. “From the very beginning, we planned on collecting money to help improve parks and anything else recreation-related,” said Leon Lefevre, president of the Plainfield Bike Night Committee. “But it wasn’t until last week when we made our latest check presentation that we found out how much in total it actually represented.” The group on Oct. 6 presented a $10,000 check to the recreation department, slightly less than the $12,500 raised in 2021. That check, along with last year’s donation, played a pivotal role in the town winning a $605,000 state Small Town Economic Assistance, or STEAP, grant that will jumpstart a $2 million planned phased upgrade to Lions Park.\n\nDelaware\n\nChristiana: Hobby Lobby, the national arts and crafts retailer, is planning to open a store in Christiana in January. The new store is taking a portion of a Burlington on Route 273 in University Plaza. It will be the first Hobby Lobby in New Castle County and the second in Delaware, joining a Hobby Lobby on Route 13 in Dover that opened in 2020. Burlington reopened in March in a smaller store to the right of their original University Plaza entrance when viewed from the parking lot. The entrance to Hobby Lobby will be to the left of the new Burlington. With more than 900 stores, Hobby Lobby says it’s the largest privately owned arts and crafts retailer in the world. Their stores offer home decor products, tableware, art supplies, fabrics and jewelry-making supplies. Adjacent to University Plaza, construction crews last summer cleared woods for a Wawa. A Wawa spokesperson did not respond when asked when the store will open. Approved plans also call for two retail pads – one for a fast-food or quick-service restaurant and the other for a larger restaurant. The Wawa will have gas pumps, according to the plan. New Castle County on Aug. 30 issued a building permit for Wawa. The permit expires after a year, but can be extended.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Initiative 82 is on the minds of voters in D.C., WUSA-TV reports. It would, over time, eliminate the tipped wage system that exists in some restaurants and bars. The debate has been an ongoing battle for years. “Change can be hard,” Andy Shallal of Busboys and Poets said. He hopes Initiative 82 gets support in November. “I really see tipping as something that is a past relic. Something that needs to, not be eliminated, but certainly not have people depend on it to make their living,” he said. The minimum wage for non-tipped employees in D.C. is $16.10 per hour, but just $5.35 for tipped employees. If passed, Initiative 82 would be slowly rolled out. Tipped employees will start earning $6 per hour by January 2023, $8 by next July and then two dollar raises each year until 2027, WUSA-TV reports. Shallal said it gives businesses time to make changes. “It should give time for a lot of businesses to make that adjustment and make it work, and you know, I think in the long run we’re going to be looking back at this years later and think, what were we thinking,” he said. But not all restaurants agree. Some say they can’t afford another mandatory increase in wages to stay afloat.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: The trial of a Florida woman accused of dressing up as clown in 1990 and fatally shooting the wife of a man she later married has been postponed following the disclosure of a law enforcement file containing information about other clown-sighting leads at the time. Prosecutors informed defense attorneys for Sheila Keen Warren on Wednesday that they had found a “clown sighting file” which defense attorneys had been demanding but prosecutors had been saying they didn’t have, according to a court filing by defense attorneys in Palm Beach County case. Defense attorneys in the motion asked for a delay in the first-degree murder trial which was scheduled to start the next week. The jury trial was canceled on Friday. Defense attorneys also are seeking sanctions against prosecutors for what they say are instances of failing to disclose evidence to the defendant and are asking that Keen Warren be allowed pretrial release from jail. The 25-page “clown sighting file” has the names, addresses or phone numbers of 40 credible leads, according to the court filing from defense attorneys. “Needless to say this will take the defense considerable time and resources to investigate,” the defense attorneys said. Marlene Warren was fatally shot in the face in May 1990 by someone in an orange wig, red nose and white face paint who handed her carnations and foil balloons after she answered the door of her upscale South Florida home.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal lawsuit filed Thursday accuses Bartow County of violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it fired two Black men two years ago. U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan of the Northern District of Georgia said the county, which is about 45 miles north of Atlanta, subjected former employee Carlen Loyal to a racially hostile work environment and retaliated against former employee Bobby Turner before dismissing them both. “No one should be forced to labor in an environment where employers condone racial slurs and employees are expected to tolerate them,” Buchanan said in a news release. “It is also unacceptable for an employer to foster a work environment where employees with the courage to report such abhorrent behavior experience retaliation from supervisors and face termination of their jobs. Our office will vigorously and continuously leverage our resources to address this type of illegal discrimination in the workplace.” Loyal worked for the county’s Road Department for almost 10 years and Turner, who is his brother-in-law, was also employed there for several years, according to the news release.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Maui County has a new contract to save taxpayer money by reducing energy, water and fuel usage, Hawaii News Now reports. The county announced Friday it’s partnering with Johnson Controls to save the county $73 million by improving energy at 141 locations. Johnson Controls plans to hire 40 workers to retrofit buildings with LED lighting, install electric vehicle charging stations, replace plumbing fixtures and much more, according to the news outlet. “This is a fiscally responsible project that saves taxpayer dollars, creates local jobs, reduces our carbon footprint, and importantly, frees up clean water that we can use for affordable housing,” Mayor Michael Victorino said. “Reducing dependence on fossil fuels means we are taking money out of an oil tanker and keeping it right here, investing in jobs for our residents.”\n\nIdaho\n\nIsland Park: A huge trout reeled in by an angler broke a state record, the Idaho Statesman reports. Hailey Thomas was on the lake with her family when a “heavy fish” took Thomas’ bait, according to an Oct. 12 news release from Idaho Fish and Game. She began reeling in the catch from Henrys Lake. “Hailey did a phenomenal job fighting the fish and keeping it out of the abundant weeds, notorious for knocking large trout off the line,” her husband, Shane, told the state department. “After a stressful minute or so, I reached out and scooped up the fish. The net I usually use for chasing carp looked so small, as the fish barely fit in!” The angler had reeled in a “monster” rainbow/cutthroat hybrid trout, officials said. It measured in at 36 inches long with a 21-inch girth, according to the release. Experts estimate it likely weighed between 17 to 20 pounds. Thomas posed for photos with her catch, then released it back into the lake, officials said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A Chicago police officer with ties with the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, was suspended for 120 days but won’t be fired, the city’s watchdog agency has announced. In its latest quarterly report, the Office of Inspector General said that a lengthy internal police department investigation was resolved through a “mediation agreement” in which the officer agreed not to dispute the allegations against him, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. The officer was not named in the report, but in previous articles in the newspaper Officer Robert Bakker has acknowledged that he took part in Proud Boys group chats, and the police department confirmed that Bakker was, in fact, the subject of the investigation. The investigation into a link between Bakker and the Proud Boys was first reported two years ago. Since then, the group that has been designated extremist by the Southern Poverty Law Center has found itself at the center of a criminal investigation into the siege at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Bakker, who was also under investigation for not disclosing to the police department that he was under FBI investigation, could not be reached for comment. The police department declined to comment. The inspector general’s office determined that a police department investigation by its internal affairs bureau found that Bakker “made a contradictory statement” about his participation in a Proud Boys’ chat group and lied about attending a Proud Boys-sponsored barbecue, the newspaper reported. Bakker has acknowledged to the newspaper after being contacted for an article about him in 2020 that he posted messages on the Proud Boys Telegram channel but maintained that he was never a member of the group.\n\nIndiana\n\nFort Wayne: The Fort Wayne City Council has asked the city’s attorney to answer several questions stemming from Mayor Tom Henry’s recent drunken driving crash and the suspension of his driver’s license for 90 days. Council President Jason Arp sent the letter to City Attorney Malak Heiny on Friday and asks for a reply by the close of business Wednesday. The questions seek information on 12 topics such as leasing information for the Chevrolet Impala the mayor was driving, insurance coverage and whether Henry was ever stopped by police previously. Henry’s blood-alcohol level was 0.152 after he was arrested the evening of Oct. 9. Indiana’s legal limit to drive is 0.08. Police said Henry was driving and his wife and mother-in-law were passengers when his vehicle went left of the center line and struck another car. The other driver was not injured. The 70-year-old Democrat pleaded guilty Monday to operating a vehicle while intoxicated endangering a person.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics employees who say that overtime and other payments were improperly paid will receive $15 million as part of a class-action suit that was filed in 2019, according to documents filed Friday. The healthcare system and about 11,000 workers have argued that managers didn’t pay overtime, bonuses or accrued leave as quickly as state and federal laws require. Lawyers for the employees said the settlement figure could have been as high as $64 million. However, they were worried that a higher court could have reduced the amount to as low as $11 million after lawyers for the Iowa Board of Regents threatened to appeal a judge’s ruling for partial summary judgment, the Des Moines Register reported. Based on that prospect, attorneys for the class members said in documents they “believe they have obtained a great result” with the settlement. The six employees who led the lawsuit will each receive $10,000. The other workers will each receive a share of the remaining $11.6 million, based on how many payments employees allegedly received from the hospital later than the law allows. The lawyers will take home $3.4 million. A spokesperson for the Board of Regents did not immediately return an email seeking comment.\n\nKansas\n\nStilwell: A Stilwell nurse practitioner is suing CVS, arguing she was dismissed last year for not filling prescriptions for contraceptives despite previously having a religious exemption. The lawsuit, brought by Suzanne Schuler in the U.S. District Court for Kansas on Wednesday, argues the company changed its policies earlier this year to deem filling prescriptions for birth control or Plan B were “essential” functions and that a religious exemption was no longer an option. The lawsuit said that Schuler’s Nazarene faith prevented her from “providing, prescribing, or facilitating the use of any drug, device, or surgical procedure that can cause abortion,” believing life begins at conception. In 2009, Schuler was hired as a nurse practitioner at a MinuteWell clinic at a CVS in Olathe. Two years later she sought and obtained a religious exemption from prescribing contraceptives and did the same in 2015 when asked to prescribe Plan B. Instead, she would send customers to nearby stores to obtain those services – though she argues this was a rare occurrence and one the lawsuit argues didn’t prompt customer complaints.\n\nKentucky\n\nInez: Martin County’s top elected official is resigning from office, leaving a vacancy in a post that has been plagued by instability in recent years. Martin County Judge-Executive Colby Kirk announced his resignation on Friday, WYMT-TV reported. Kirk is taking a job as CEO of One East Kentucky, a group that recruits business and investment to the region. “I have been proud to serve the people of Martin County and am grateful beyond words to all who have supported me in this role,” Kirk said. He is withdrawing from the November election, where he was unopposed after defeating another Republican candidate in the May primary. Kirk was sworn in as an interim replacement in January after the departure of Judge-Executive Victor Slone. Slone, who had been battling cancer, died in January about a month after announcing he was leaving the elected post. Slone replaced William Davis, who abruptly resigned in March 2021. The small Appalachian county has long struggled with issues in its aging water line system and funding the costly repairs. Kirk said he would help ensure a smooth transition for the next office holder. He will serve until Oct. 28.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Fans of New Orleans’ Mardi Gras season can expect another year of shortened parade routes. The Mayor’s Mardi Gras Advisory Council said Thursday that the shorter routes of 2022 will continue in 2023, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reported. “Due to the manpower shortage that we’re seeing across the country within the law enforcement community, we are going to do the exact same routes that we did last year,” said James Reiss III, the advisory council’s chairman. “I will add that we’re very aware, the city is very aware, that it affects all of us individual parading krewes differently.” The smaller police force and a shortage of other municipal workers led City Hall to cut blocks from the parades routes last year. The continuing surge of retirements and difficulty recruiting new officers has left the police department with the fewest commissioned officers in decades, leading Mayor LaToya Cantrell in August to question whether Carnival parades would even be possible in 2023, the newspaper reported. But Carnival boosters and others noted that even though shortened routs aren’t ideal, they’re better than nothing. “I know we don’t like the shortened routes,” Reiss said, “but if we can work independently with the NOPD to make sure that your individual krewe is doing what it needs to be doing to be safe around that route, it’s very much appreciated by the police department and by the city that we do that.” Mardi Gras 2023’s parade season begins Jan. 6. Mardi Gras will be celebrated Feb. 21.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A storm packing strong winds and heavy rain lashed the New England coast on Friday with the greatest impact in Maine, where more than 100,000 homes and businesses lost power. The storm brought a gust of 72 mph, just shy of hurricane force, to the Isle of Shoals off the Maine and New Hampshire coast, while 50 mph gusts hit coastal communities, said Sarah Thunberg, meteorologist for the National Weather Service. At the peak, nearly 70,000 homes and businesses were without power in Central Maine Power’s territory, officials said. The storm knocked down trees and left others barren of leaves, and brought several inches of rain to much of the region.\n\nMaryland\n\nSmith Island: A community is leaning on faith and neighbors in tornado cleanup. The aftermath of the tornado that struck Smith Island is still visible two months after it carved a destructive path through the sparsely populated Chesapeake Bay archipelago. The EF1 tornado began as a waterspout that continued on land, damaged a number of piers and homes despite not seriously injuring any residents. Efforts by local organizations like Smith Island United – led by Eddie Somers, Johnny Crantz Tyler, Scott Andreozzi, Duke Marshall, photographer Jay Fleming and Pastor Landon – have been at the forefront of rebuilding efforts. The Smith Island United Committee for Tornado Relief met in mid-September to discuss the first round of checks to be issued to uninsured tornado damage claimants. These first round of checks, approved in unanimous votes and distributed within 10 days, total approximately $34,000 that will take care of approximately 50% of claims submitted, according to the group’s social media post.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Federal transit authorities have no plans to try to take over the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority or withhold funds from the agency despite a harsh safety review of the MBTA released in August. Nuria Fernandez, head of the Federal Transit Administration, made the comments Friday in response to a question by Democratic U.S. Sen. Edward Markey during a Senate hearing in Boston on the troubled MBTA. “The Federal Transit Administration does not have the legal authority to take over the day to day operations of any transit agency,” Fernandez said, adding that even if it could take over the MBTA, the FTA would not have the capacity to manage the operations of the transit authority. Some Beacon Hill lawmakers have raised the possibility of placing the MBTA into federal receivership. Fernandez said the FTA will continue its oversight of the MBTA to ensure that it addresses ongoing safety concerns. The FTA report includes four “special directives,” requiring 53 separate actions that the transportation authority must take, including addressing worker shortages, prioritization of safety management, safety communication, and operating conditions, policies, procedures, and training. “The Federal Transit Administration is not currently withholding any funding from the state,” Fernandez added. MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak, said the agency is working to address the concerns detailed in the FTA report. “The system is safe, but we can and will do better,” Poftak said. “Safety has been and continues to be our top priority.” Poftak also said that while there will be some nighttime and weekend shutdowns of portions of the MBTA, including on the Red Line, there are no plans to shut down an entire subway line. The MBTA recently shut down the entire Orange Line for 30 days to complete what they said was the equivalent of five years of maintenance.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Thieves are using cloned key fobs to steal Dodge muscle cars and other high-powered vehicles directly from dealerships and even automakers in the state, then selling them for tens of thousands of dollars less than their value, according to authorities and court records. For one Ohio-based theft ring, it all came crashing down after a January holdup of a U.S. postal worker led authorities to connect several men to brazen car thefts in the Detroit area, long home to the country’s biggest automakers, including Dodge, which is now owned by international conglomerate Stellantis. Investigators then discovered that new Chargers, Challengers, Durangos and Ram pickups worth $50,000 to $100,000 were turning up in Ohio, Indianapolis and East Cost shipping ports after being sold on the street for $3,500 to $15,000, according to a criminal complaint. Thieves in the Detroit area are primarily going after Dodge vehicles with Hellcat engines, including Chargers and Challengers – “the fast ones,” Sgt. Jerry Hanna with the Macomb Auto Theft Squad said. “If a patrol car gets them, they are not stopping and they’re faster than patrol cars. They’re 150 mph all day,” he said. Instead of stealing them off the street, they’re driving them straight off dealership and assembly plant lots. Just this year, about a half-dozen vehicles – primarily Dodge Ram TRX pickups – were taken from a lot outside an assembly plant in Macomb County.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Before attending a packed Sunday morning service, Queen Sonja of Norway praised Mindekirken congregation for having maintained worship in Norwegian for all 100 years that the church has existed in Minneapolis. “It’s extraordinary to realize that, one hundred years after, Mindekirken is still fulfilling that purpose” of building community and preserving culture and language, she said to the nearly 500 people in attendance. They had lined up for more than an hour in this modest neighborhood in brisk fall weather in the 40s to participate in the service. Queen Sonja received a special greeting from Eline Gro Knatterud, 4, who presented the queen with a bouquet of red roses nearly as big as herself. The congregation was founded in 1922, at the tail end of a decades-long migration of hundreds of thousands of Norwegians to Minnesota that made the Twin Cities the “unofficial capital” of the Norwegian diaspora, said Amy Boxrud, the director of the Norwegian-American Historical Association.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Plummeting water levels in the lower Mississippi River are projected to drop even further in the weeks ahead, a projection shows, dampening the region’s economic activity and potentially threatening jobs in one of the country’s poorest states. In Vicksburg, on the Mississippi river’s east bank near the Louisiana line, the water is approaching its lowest level since 2012. The river’s level near that Mississippi city on Thursday was 4.3 feet, and it is projected to drop to 3 feet by Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. Falling water levels have disrupted industrial shipping and tourism in the area and are on pace to keep dropping. “Right now, the latest forecast is going to take us down on Nov. 8 down to 2 feet at Vicksburg and it could drop a lower than that,” Marty Pope, a hydrologist at the National Weather Service Office in Jackson, told the Vicksburg Post. A dearth of rainfall in recent weeks has left the Mississippi River approaching record low levels in some areas across several states. Nearly all of the Mississippi River basin, from Minnesota through Louisiana, has seen below-normal rainfall since late August. The low levels have caused barges to get stuck in mud and sand, disrupting river travel for shippers, recreational boaters and passengers on a cruise line.\n\nMissouri\n\nFlorissant: There is significant radioactive contamination at an elementary school in suburban St. Louis where nuclear weapons were produced during World War II, according to a new report by environmental investigation consultants. The report by Boston Chemical Data Corp. confirmed fears about contamination at Jana Elementary School in the Hazelwood School District in Florissant raised by a previous Army Corps of Engineers study. The new report is based on samples taken in August from the school, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Boston Chemical did not say who or what requested and funded the report. “I was heartbroken,” said Ashley Bernaugh, president of the Jana parent-teacher association who has a son at the school. “It sounds so cliché, but it takes your breath from you.” The school sits in the flood plain of Coldwater Creek, which was contaminated by nuclear waste from weapons production during World War II. The waste was dumped at sites near the St. Louis Lambert International Airport, next to the creek that flows to the Missouri River. The Corps has been cleaning up the creek for more than 20 years. The Corps’ report also found contamination in the area but at much at lower levels, and it didn’t take any samples within 300 feet of the school. The most recent report included samples taken from Jana’s library, kitchen, classrooms, fields and playgrounds. Levels of the radioactive isotope lead-210, polonium, radium and other toxins were “far in excess” of what Boston Chemical had expected. Dust samples taken inside the school were found to be contaminated. Inhaling or ingesting these radioactive materials can cause significant injury, the report said. “A significant remedial program will be required to bring conditions at the school in line with expectations,” the report said. The new report is expected to be a major topic at Tuesday’s Hazelwood school board meeting. The district said in a statement that it will consult with its attorneys and experts to determine the next steps. “Safety is absolutely our top priority for our staff and students,” board president Betsy Rachel said Saturday.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: In addition to the head-to-head races on this November’s ballot, a county is asking the public to decide if it wants to contribute to a public safety mill levy. The levy has several components, including county attorney and deputy salaries, pre-trial services and school safety. The levy amount is 14 mils, which would cost the taxpayer $18.90 per $100,000 of a home’s taxable value annually. Cascade County Commissioner Don Ryan explained that the levy could also go toward general public safety, although the commissioners would have to show how that allocation would make the public safer. Due to legislation that governs how much the county can raise taxes, Ryan said, the additional money for public safety must come from a levy. Ryan said the commission – and to some extent, the public – decides how the money is applied to public safety, and the commission seeks to solve long-term problems. “I’m a big supporter of letting the public determine how this goes,” Ryan said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Pickleball and tennis players might one day have multiple courts dedicated to each of their sports in the four quadrants of the city, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. The growing demand for courts prompted the city last summer to look at existing courts, gauge demand with a public survey and come up with a master plan. If approved by the Lincoln Parks and Recreation Department Advisory Board, the plan will guide how Parks and Rec approaches updates and additions to its existing courts. But the plan won’t be fully realized for years, according to the news outlet. “There’s no money to do this,” city parks planner Sara Hartzell told the advisory board, which must approve the plan. “From here, we put the master plan in our 10-year facilities plan and start working on funding.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Nevada Humane Society’s Reno facility is suspending its intake of cats and kittens while it handles a deadly panleukopenia outbreak. Over the past three weeks, more than 50 cats or kittens have shown symptoms of panleukopenia, according to Humane Society Chief Operating Officer Rory Adams. Panleukopenia is a highly contagious viral disease. Kittens are most severely affected by the virus, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. The disease is spread through fecal matter. It is not a threat to humans or dogs but is very contagious between felines; however, felines that have been vaccinated against the virus have a very low chance of contracting it. The shelter usually houses more than 300 cats or kittens, but since the outbreak, it has focused on adopting out healthy felines or placing them in foster care. As of Friday morning, there were 226 cats or kittens at the shelter, plus dozens in foster care. Over the past three weeks, 11 cats have died at the facility from the disease. It’s not uncommon for shelters to see cases of feline panleukopenia, marketing director Nicole Theodoulou said. What’s abnormal this time is the number of cats that have been exposed. The Humane Society experienced a number of panleukopenia cases this year, then noticed a sizable increase in cases in early October. CEO Greg Hall said staff isn’t sure of the cause of the outbreak, but they have tracked some of the cats that came from the same address. The outbreak does not affect the Humane Society’s Carson City facility.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSomersworth: An ATM was stolen from outside Service Credit Union on Penny Lane early Friday morning, and city police say it wasn’t the only crime committed at that time. Somersworth police Capt. John Sunderland said the credit union’s burglary alarms were triggered around 3:04 a.m. and surveillance footage shows the standalone 24-hour drive-through ATM was removed with a pickup truck. Three minutes earlier, police responded to a vehicle fire at 24 Washington St., about two miles away from Service Credit Union. The Fire Department responded and extinguished the fire, which was then investigated by the Somersworth police and the New Hampshire fire marshal’s office. Sunderland said the fire is considered suspicious and the investigation is ongoing. The stolen ATM and the truck used to remove it were recovered by police. Sunderland would not say if the two incidents were connected, nor would he provide specifics about the vehicle set on fire. He said this is because both are still active investigations and the suspects are still at large. Service Credit Union was closed for a short period of time Friday while police and multiple other local and federal agencies, including the FBI, investigated the incident, according to Sunderland. The 24-hour ATM was not immediately back in place Friday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWildwood: Authorities have announced more arrests in connection with chaos during a pop-up car rally in southern New Jersey last month. Cape May County prosecutors and Wildwood police said one man was arrested on a riot charge and another in connection with an alleged assault on a police officer in the unsanctioned rally that occurred on the weekend of Sept. 24. Police across multiple communities struggled to control the chaotic situation as Nj.com reported social media videos showing modified vehicles revving engines and speeding off to cheers from crowds. WCAU-TV reported people hanging out of cars as drivers spun in circles, and also showed burnouts, drifting and crashes. Prosecutors earlier said Gerald White, 37, of Pittsburgh was charged with two counts of death by auto, assault by auto and other counts. They allege his car hit another car, killing a passenger in the other vehicle, 34-year-old Timothy Ogden, and then struck two pedestrians, killing Lindsay Weakland, 18, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Authorities also announced aggravated assault and assault by auto charges against 31-year-old Eryk Wnek of Linden, alleging that he collided with another vehicle and then struck a low-speed vehicle, critically injuring the driver and also injuring a woman and four juvenile passengers. Participants say the event gives enthusiasts a chance to gather and check out cars, but officials in other areas such as Ocean City, Maryland, have reported problems stemming from the event in previous years.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: State-owned public land continued to be a growing source of energy development as oil and gas production’s revenue share swelled in recent years, but renewable energy appeared poised for further growth. The New Mexico State Land Office announced it made $2.4 billion in revenue for Fiscal Year 2022, running from July 1, 2021, to June 30. This followed gradual growth since 2019 when the office raised $1.11 billion, dipping to $1.05 billion in 2020 – the year COVID-19 struck New Mexico and led to declines in fuel demand and reductions in oil and gas production – but recovered to $1.25 billion in FY 2021. Revenue almost doubled in FY 2022, and Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard attributed that to a renewed diversity of uses for State Trust land, in addition to the booming oil and gas industry. Money generated by the Land Office is used to fund public schools, hospitals and other public services in New Mexico.\n\nNew York\n\nQueens: A 15-year-old boy was fatally shot on a New York subway train Friday after a dispute between two groups of people escalated into violence. It was the eighth killing in New York’s subway system this year, at a time when a gradual increase in ridership after a steep decline during the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by riders’ safety concerns. According to police, who didn’t identify the victim, the teenager was in one of the groups that got into an argument on an A train in Queens shortly before 4 p.m. As the train neared the line’s final stop in Far Rockaway, near JFK Airport, someone fired one shot, striking the boy in the chest. A passenger helped him off the train when it reached the station. Police and emergency personnel took him to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police were reviewing security camera footage from the station and the surrounding area. They didn’t say whether they had identified any suspects or a more specific motivation for the shooting. Despite the deployment of more than 1,000 more police officers in the system since the pandemic began, a survey released last month by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority found 70% of riders felt there were too few officers in the system. Barely more than 50% said they felt safe or very safe on trains or in stations.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State government has spent roughly $2.5 million on Executive Mansion repairs during Gov. Roy Cooper’s tenure – expenses that a state official said were needed for critical safety, security and other upkeep for the over 130-year-old building. The Department of Administration, which maintains state-owned buildings, confirmed recently to North State Journal the total for expenditures and associated costs on the governor’s official residence since 2017. The Raleigh mansion, which first opened in 1891 and is a state historic site, also functions as office and venue space in addition to providing housing for Cooper’s family on the second floor. The building had water damage in the basement and walls and needed foundation repairs and brick restoration, along with repairs to 50-year-old plumbing, department deputy secretary Mark Edwards said. “For several months, we had to close all the exterior porches because they were unsafe for people to walk on,” Edwards told WRAL-TV. The needed repairs, after years of tight budgets, caused delays for Cooper to reside in the mansion when he took office in early 2017. The department declined to provide a line-item accounting of the expenses, with Edwards citing the special security measures for the building. But he said everything performed was necessary – with no “creature comforts or cosmetic changes” for Cooper’s family – and went through the required procurement process. Appropriations in state budgets have covered the expenditures over the years.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: Trial is scheduled for early next year for a man accused of setting up an explosives manufacturing operation in his townhouse garage, where police reported finding a large stockpile of bomb-making materials. Police said they seized nearly 1,500 pounds of explosives upon completing the removal and disposal of the materials Friday evening from the townhouse in Williston, in the state’s northwest oil patch. Ross Petrie, 28, of Williston, is charged with a felony called “release of destructive forces.” An affidavit of probable cause said Petrie’s explosives could have had “catastrophic consequences.” A criminal complaint and the probable cause affidavit did not provide a motive for the explosives stockpile though police said more information would be released on Monday. Trial for Petrie is set for Feb. 13. His attorney, Jeff Nehring, did not return a phone message left Saturday afternoon. Officials say they evacuated more than 10 people from the building in which Petrie’s townhouse was located. Authorities said the building will remain empty until police complete their inspection and deem the units safe for residents to return. The affidavit says law enforcement officers began serving a series of search warrants at Petrie’s residence on Oct. 10 after being told a narcotics lab could possibly be in operation. That’s when they discovered explosive materials including powdered metals, according to the affidavit.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: There is an enormous, 900-plus pound hole in the the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium’s polar building. On Wednesday, Anana, a beloved polar bear and long-time zoo favorite, died by euthanasia. The Columbus Zoo announced Anana’s death on Friday via social media, noting that the 16-year-old polar bear did not previously suffer from any medical conditions, but had been acting “unusual” over the past few months. “Extensive testing did not provide a clear diagnosis, and the possibility of an autoimmune syndrome could not be ruled out, so Anana was aggressively treated,” the Columbus Zoo wrote on Facebook. “Although Anana initially improved, her condition declined dramatically over the last week and the decision was made to humanely euthanize her.” Anana, a mother, sister, aunt and independent bear was best known for crafting cozy napping spots, masterfully hunting trout and acting as a “true princess” when refusing to get on the scale to reveal her actual weight, the Columbus Zoo added in its post. The 16-year-old and her twin sister, Aurora, were born on Nov. 25, 2006, at the Toledo Zoo before moving to the Pittsburgh Zoo in 2008. After their stint in Pennsylvania, the sisters arrived at the Columbus Zoo in February 2010, just in time for the grand opening of the zoo’s Polar Frontier exhibit.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: The University of Oklahoma announced a $2 billion fundraising campaign Friday, having raised $600 million over the past two years for the effort. OU began a “quiet launch” on July 1, 2020, for Lead On: The University of Oklahoma’s Campaign for the Future. On Friday, it revealed the campaign’s goal of raising $2 billion by June 30, 2027. The university pledged to dedicate $500 million to scholarships and student support and $300 million to recruit and retain faculty. All three OU campuses – the flagship Norman site, OU-Tulsa and the OU Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City – would benefit, the university said in a news release Friday. It promises to support affordable education, research and health care services, among other initiatives.OU collected $237.9 million in the campaign’s first year. The 2022 fiscal year has been the most fruitful with $317.4 million raised from more than 80,300 donations. Fifty-four of those donations gave $1 million or more.\n\nOregon\n\nPrineville: Authorities are investigating the cause of a house fire in central Oregon city that killed two children. KTVZ-TV reports that members of the children’s family escaped the home in the blaze, which was reported before 6 a.m. on Saturday in Prineville, about 112 miles east of Eugene. Crook County sheriff’s deputies and firefighters arrived to find the home fully engulfed by flames, sheriff’s Sgt. Javier Sanchez said in a statement. “Most family members safely made it out of the house,” Sanchez said, adding that “even with the quick response from law enforcement, Fire and Rescue and residents on scene, two children were not able to get out and are deceased due to the fire.” The children’s ages weren’t immediately released. A telephone message to the sheriff’s office seeking additional information Sunday wasn’t immediately returned. Sanchez asked anyone with information about the fire to contact the sheriff’s office.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork: Prosecutors have dropped plans to seek the death penalty against a man accused of killing a man and wounding a woman when he opened fire inside a movie theater almost three years ago. Anu-Malik Johnson, 23, is charged with first- and third-degree murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangering and related offenses in the December 2019 shooting of 22-year-old Andre White Jr. at Regal Cinemas 13 in West Manchester Township. York County prosecutors told the court they planned to pursue capital punishment if he was convicted of first-degree murder. Two years ago, a judge declined to bar them from doing so, rejecting defense arguments alleging a lack of evidence and citing the defendant’s age. The York Dispatch, however, reports that the district attorney’s office asked last week to withdraw its intent to seek the death penalty, citing a mitigation report submitted by the defense as well as “relevant case law and applicable jury instructions.” Defense attorney Jonathan White hailed the decision, saying he had “hoped and believed” prosecutors would drop plans to seek capital punishment. “I believe they made the right decision,” he said while declining to talk about the contents of the mitigation report. Kyle King, spokesperson for the district attorney’s office, declined comment, saying his office doesn’t comment on “pending matters,” he said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: The Pawtucket Police Department is warning “everyone, parents in particular,” after they seized “numerous” packages of marijuana edibles in small bags that “closely resembled common household snacks.” The police found the bags Wednesday while executing a search warrant on Reservoir Avenue. “Detectives seized a large amount of marijuana and packaging material. Also seized were numerous individual sized packages of marijuana edibles in which the packaging closely resembled common household snacks,” the police said in a news release. The police arrested a man on domestic violence and drug charges. Rhode Island legalized the recreational use of marijuana in May, but people can possess only up to one ounce in public and up to 10 ounces in their home. A license is required for selling. On their Facebook page, the police wrote, “We urge everyone, parents in particular, to pay close attention to the packaging on your food, snacks, and candy, especially as we get closer to Halloween. You will notice while the packaging appears incredibly similar to the normal products, there are slight differences. Some of the differences include the marijuana edible packages saying “medibles,’ having a marijuana leaf symbol, listing THC, and/or having a cannabis alert symbol. Some common cannabis/marijuana alert symbols are included.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Two South Carolina Highway Patrol officers were injured, one critically, when they were hit by a vehicle early Sunday during a traffic stop in Greenville, authorities said. The driver fled but was later taken into custody, according to the Greenville County Sheriff’s Office. The officers were taken to a hospital, and one of them was treated and released. The other officer was critically injured, the sheriff’s office said in on its Facebook page. The sheriff’s office did not update the officer’s condition or identify the suspect.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Class of 2022 in South Dakota fared better than the national average on the ACT this year, despite the nationwide average composite score declining to the lowest it’s been in more than three decades. ACT (American College Testing) is used to gain admission into colleges and universities throughout the country, and for scholarship consideration. South Dakota’s average composite score was 21.5, compared to the nation’s average composite score of 19.8. In South Dakota, 58% of graduates took the test this year, compared to 36% of the nation’s graduates. South Dakota’s statewide average composite score of 21.5 beat those of neighboring states, too: North Dakota (19.2), Minnesota (21), Iowa (21.4), Nebraska (19.4), Wyoming (19.2) and Montana (19.3). State Education Secretary Tiffany Sanderson said South Dakota’s surpassing of the national average composite score on the ACT this year is thanks to the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. “That tells me South Dakota’s commitment to maintaining face-to-face instruction during the pandemic was the right one to support continued student learning,” she said in a news release from the South Dakota Department of Education. But South Dakota’s success can’t be pinned on the pandemic alone. The state has scored above the national average since at least 2009, according to DOE data.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Public housing agencies in Tennessee can no longer include provisions in their leases that bar tenants from having guns in their homes, a state appeals panel has ruled. A three-judge panel of the Tennessee Court of Appeals made the unanimous decision Thursday, saying that the prohibitions in public housing violate the 2nd Amendment rights of its residents. In the ruling, the judges cited a prominent U.S. Supreme Court decision from June that expanded gun rights, while striking down a New York law requiring people to demonstrate a particular need for carrying a gun in order to get a license to carry a gun in a concealed way in public. The Tennessee decision could set up an appeal to the state Supreme Court, which has a majority appointed by Republican governors. The case centers on a lawsuit by Kinsley Braden, who signed a lease agreement with Columbia Housing & Redevelopment Corporation in April 2018 that barred him from having a gun on the premises. In November 2020, housing officials sought to evict Braden when they found out he had been keeping a handgun in his residence at the Creekside Acres low-income housing complex. Lower court judges ruled in favor of Columbia Housing in the initial case and an appeal, then Braden sought another review, the ruling states. In the latest decision, Judge Frank Clement wrote that “a total ban on the ability of law-abiding residents – like Mr. Braden – to possess a handgun within their public housing unit for the purpose of self-defense is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment.” The ruling reasoned that public housing is not similar to other types of “sensitive” government buildings where guns can be banned, including statehouses, polling places and courthouses. Clement also acknowledged that it is “largely unsettled whether public housing developments could constitutionally prohibit firearm possession under both the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and nearly identical provisions of certain state constitutions.” He wrote that states have come to different conclusions on whether such bans are allowed.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A small airplane experiencing technical problems made an emergency landing on a road in a Dallas neighborhood Saturday afternoon. Engine problems forced the plane to land on West Kiest Boulevard around 3 p.m., WFAA-TV reported. The unnamed husband and wife who were operating the airplane escaped injuries and there were no injuries on the ground, Dallas Fire-Rescue officials said. The Federal Aviation Administration said the multi-engine DA-622 landed about 2 miles from Dallas Executive Airport. The plane was en route to the airport from Winston Field in Snyder, Texas, about 250 miles west of Dallas, WFAA reported. There was no fire or leaked fuel at the landing site, but some power lines were knocked down and a speed limit sign was struck, Dallas Fire-Rescue said. Electric utility Oncor said only one customer lost service due to the contact with power lines, WFAA reported.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A man and his son, an Illinois resident, have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Bradley Bokoski, 58, of Eagle Mountain, Utah and Matthew R. Bokoski, 31, of Chicago entered pleas on Thursday, according to documents filed with the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, to one count each of unlawful parading, demonstrating or picketing at the Capitol. Charges of impeding Congress by illegally entering the Capitol will be dropped as part of a plea agreement in each case, according to the U.S. Justice Department. The misdemeanor charges carry a maximum sentence of six months in prison, five years’ probation and a $5,000 fine. Sentencing was set for Jan. 17. According to court documents, the Bokoskis traveled to Washington to hear President Donald Trump speak at a rally on Jan. 6, then followed the crowd to the Capitol, which they entered through a breached Senate door. After the crowd was met by 10 to 15 police officers, both men turned around and left, the complaint said. They were in the building for about five minutes. A tip to the FBI provide screenshots of Matthew Bokoski’s Facebook page, including one post depicting a group of people inside the Capitol and a caption reading, “I was with my dad and walked right up the capital steps and inside with others,” the complaint said. The riot delayed the certification of Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election, but Congress reconvened hours later to do so. Both men were arrested in May.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The school board in Vermont’s largest city plans to sue the manufacturer of chemicals that forced the closure of Burlington High School, officials said. Burlington School District officials on Thursday announced plans to sue agro-chemical giant Monsanto after PCBs were found in the existing building and soil during renovations, forcing the closure of the school, which also housed the Burlington Technical Center. In a statement, Bayer, which now owns Monsanto, said Monsanto “voluntarily stopped producing PCBs 45 years ago and its conduct has been appropriate at all times.” “Until the company terminated their production, PCBs were lawfully used in a number of commercial products that were manufactured by other companies,” the statement said. “We will assess and respond to a complaint if one is filed.” School officials now are planning to demolish the existing building and build a new school and technical center in the same area. Burlington voters will cast ballots next month on a proposed $165 million bond, but the city estimates the total cost of the improvements could be $190 million. Burlington Board Chair Clare Wool said the lawsuit could mean long-term financial compensation for the district, but to move forward with the plans for the new school they still need to have the bond approved. “Even though we plan to pursue this course of environmental lawsuit zealously and aggressively, we are viewing this as a long-term strategy and are anticipating that this work could consume a number of years,” Wool said in a statement. The city did not say when it planned to file its lawsuit. Students have been attending classes at a former Macy’s department store.\n\nVirginia\n\nHarrisonburg: Eight people were taken to hospitals after a shooting early Sunday at an outdoor gathering in Virginia, police said. Someone fired into the crowd at an outdoor gathering on Devon Lane in Harrisonburg, city police said in a statement. Eight people ranging in age from 18 to 27 were taken to hospitals with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, police said. No suspects were on the scene when officers arrived and investigators are looking into how many people fired shots, police said. No arrests have been made. The incident was isolated to the gathering and police said they don’t believe there’s any threat to the greater community. The housing complex where the shooting occured is near James Madison University, but city spokesperson Michael Parks said no students were injured, WTOP-FM reported.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: While celebrating 50 years as a ballet company, the Pacific Northwest Ballet is making history. “This is a moment for us,” dancer Jonathan Batista told KUOW while describing how he felt about becoming the first Black principal dancer in the history of the Pacific Northwest Ballet. The newly promoted Batista joined the organization as a soloist last year and says moving to the highest rank as a ballet dancer last month means the world to him and the Black dance community. “Being the first Black dancer in 50 years of Pacific Northwest Ballet, this is a moment for young Black boys, young Black girls, that want to dance, that want to see themselves on that stage,” Batista said. Originally from Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, Batista has performed with companies from the UK to Canada, sometimes as the only Black member of the company. Batista says he’s grateful to make history through his promotion to principal dancer in Seattle. “It is such an honor to be in this position,” he said. “It also is a moment where I think, ‘Wow, it took 50 years for Black man, for Black person, to become a principal dancer.’ ” The Pacific Northwest Ballet has a total of 46 dancers in its company. Batista is one of nine who identify as Black. In addition, Cecilia Iliesiu and James Kirby Rogers were also promoted to principal dancers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state of is receiving around $1.7 million in federal funding over five years for a behavioral health program treating adults with serious mental illness. The money will be used to serve people living with mental illness who are also living with a physical health condition, chronic disease or substance use disorder, according to a West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources news release. The initiative is called “West Virginia Promoting Integration of Primary and Behavioral Health Care Program.” Participants in 16 counties will receive services from Seneca Health Services Inc., Southern Highlands Community Behavioral Health Center and United Summit Center. Residents of Barbour, Braxton, Gilmer, Greenbrier, Harrison, Lewis, Marion, McDowell, Monongalia, Nicholas, Pocahontas, Preston, Taylor, Upshur, Webster and Wyoming counties are eligible. The grant was awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Enrollment in the state’s public school districts is continuing to decline, while other types of schools have picked up more students, according to the state’s annual late September headcount. The picture isn’t complete, as the count excludes homeschooling and students who pay tuition in private schools. And the numbers released by the Department of Public Instruction on Friday are unaudited. According to the preliminary numbers, the decline for public school districts is less dramatic than earlier years of the pandemic but continues a downward trend that creates more budget holes for public schools. The enrollment total for public school districts fell by nearly 7,000 students to a total of about 808,000, almost a 1% drop from last year. At the same time, the number of students using state-funded vouchers to attend private school rose by over 3,000 to a total of about 52,000, a 7% gain for those programs. Independent charter schools, which are not run by school districts, gained about 460 students to total over 11,000, about a 4% gain. These trends predate the pandemic, though some trends were accelerated with the pandemic. The most extreme enrollment change that occurred during the pandemic was a 10% drop in kindergarten and pre-kindergarten enrollment in public school districts in the 2020-21 school year, when many schools had not reopened.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Motorists have faced a range of road construction activity in the city, particularly downtown or near the central business district, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. One area has had lane closures and occasionally shuttered portions of a busy street. But work on that project coordinated by the Wyoming Department of Transportation is nearing the finish line. For several months, the construction project has resulted in lane closures, mostly to the south of Lincolnway along Warren Avenue. Weather permitting, the project is on track to be finished in the coming week, according to an interview with WYDOT District 1 public information specialist Andrea Staley. According to various officials and construction workers, paving has been underway along Warren Avenue between 16th and 24th streets. “They are paving today and weather-dependent, it could go into next week, through next week,” WYDOT’s Staley told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle on Thursday. “Our contractors are going to be finishing the pavement.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/07/28/lebron-mural-vandalized-seaweed-eating-cows-flash-floods-news-around-states/117686040/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuskegee: Charlotte Morris , the interim president of Tuskegee University, will assume the job on a permanent basis, the school said. Trustees of the historically Black school in east Alabama elected Morris to the position, which takes effect Sunday, officials said in a statement. Morris’ time as interim president began with the departure of Lily McNair, who began in 2018 and and left earlier this year. With more than 30 years at the school, Morris’ previous roles at Tuskegee included chief of staff and secretary to the board. Her inauguration as the school’s ninth president is planned for April to coincide with Founder’s Day. “She understands the needs of this university today – putting the students first – and is the right leader for tomorrow and beyond,” board chair Norma Clayton said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A small airplane reported overdue Monday was found crashed, with the two people on board dead, according to Alaska State Troopers. Austin McDaniel, a troopers spokesperson, said there were two adults on board. He said the plane left from Anchorage, but he did not have immediate details on the purpose of the flight or when it took off. He said by email that the wreckage was found in Chugach State Park. The troopers, in an online log, said authorities were notified about 8 p.m. Monday of an overdue aircraft that had taken off from an Anchorage airport. The statement said the aircraft was believed to have gone up the Knik River Valley toward Knik Glacier and Lake George before heading toward Chugach State Park. A good Samaritan found the wreckage about 10:45 p.m. Monday and was able to land nearby. Recovery efforts were expected to start Tuesday, the troopers’ statement said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A dust cloud that triggered a dust advisory in Maricopa, Casa Grande and Florence on Tuesday night moved north along Interstate 10 to hit the southern edge of Phoenix. The National Weather Service in Phoenix issued a dust advisory affecting parts of Maricopa County, including the Ahwatukee neighborhood of Phoenix, Chandler, Gilbert and Queen Creek until 7:30 p.m. Tuesday. Visibility was below 1 mile in some areas, including parts of I-10, Interstate 8, highway 347, and Highway 85 south of Gila Bend, according to the Arizona Department of Transportation. Just before 7:30 p.m., the weather service said the dust cloud was blowing into the Phoenix area and would cause visibility to drop to 1 to 3 miles, “enough to notice but not low enough to cause significant concerns.” At 7:45 p.m., the weather service said isolated storms across central Arizona would wind down in the next hour or two although dust clouds, heavy rain and gusty winds were possible.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The leader of the University of Arkansas system proposed keeping a statue of the late U.S. Sen. J. William Fulbright on its flagship campus but add “contextualization” about his legacy, despite calls to remove the monument because of Fulbright’s support of segregation. System President Donald Bobbitt cited a new state law preventing the removal of historical monuments without state approval in his proposal, which was scheduled to go before the university’s board of trustees on Wednesday. Bobbitt’s proposal also called for keeping Fulbright’s name on the Fayetteville campus’ college of arts and sciences. The proposal called for adding “a contextualization to the statue that affirms the university’s commitment to racial equality and acknowledges Senator Fulbright’s complex legacy, including his record on international affairs, civil rights legislation, and racial integration.” Fulbright was a University of Arkansas graduate and served as the university’s president for three years starting in 1939. He is known worldwide for creating an international education scholarship in his name. But the university has faced calls to remove his statue and his name from the school over his opposition to integration and civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The San Francisco school board violated state law when it voted to cover up a 1930s mural that critics said is racist and degrading in its depiction of Black and Native American people, a judge ruled Tuesday. Superior Court Judge Anne-Christine Massullo said the board failed to conduct an environmental impact review before it voted in 2019 to cover up the sprawling mural at George Washington High School that depicts the life of George Washington, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. The 1936 mural was painted by Victor Arnautoff, one of the foremost muralists in the San Francisco area during the Depression. In addition to depicting Washington as a soldier, surveyor and statesman, the 13-panel, 1,600-square-foot mural contains images of white pioneers standing over the body of a Native American and slaves working at Washington’s Mount Vernon estate in Virginia. New Deal scholars have argued that Arnautoff, a Russian-born communist and social critic, critically depicts unsavory aspects of American history in his work. But as early as the 1960s, some students at George Washington High School have argued that the mural’s imagery is offensive and racist. District officials told the Chronicle that they were reviewing the decision. Members can’t take any further action until at least September.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A U.S. appeals court has ruled against a web designer who didn’t want to create wedding websites for same-sex couples and sued to challenge Colorado’s anti-discrimination law. A three-judge panel of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver denied Lorie Smith’s attempt to overturn a lower court ruling throwing out her legal challenge. The Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents Smith, argued that the law forced her to violate her Christian beliefs. In the 2-1 ruling, the panel said Colorado had a compelling interest in protecting the “dignity interests” of members of marginalized groups through its law. The anti-discrimination law is the same one at issue in the case of Colorado baker Jack Phillips that was decided in 2018 by the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court decided the Colorado Civil Rights Commission had acted with anti-religious bias against Phillips after he refused to bake a cake for two men who were getting married. But it did not rule on the larger issue of whether a business can invoke religious objections to refuse service to LGBTQ people. The Alliance Defending Freedom said it would appeal the ruling. “The government should never force creative professionals to promote a message or cause with which they disagree. That is quintessential free speech and artistic freedom,” the group’s senior counsel, John Bursch, said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is embarking on a plan to dedicate Medicaid funds to help address the problem of gun violence and other violent crimes. Under new legislation, financially challenged community-based violence prevention services will be able to receive state and federal Medicaid funds. These programs, which are growing across the U.S., typically involve intervention at the hospital after someone has been shot and intensive case management in the months following the injury to try and break the cycle of violence .Connecticut’s new law requires the state Department of Social Services commissioner by July 1, 2022, to amend the state’s Medicaid plan so it will cover the cost of community violence prevention services for beneficiaries who have received medical treatment for an injury “sustained from an act of community violence,” such as a shooting, and have been referred for services by a licensed health care or social services provider.\n\nDelaware\n\nMillsboro:The Mountaire Farms chicken processing plant has been issued a notice of violation from the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control after a contractor digging a ditch for a new pipeline damaged an existing one, causing treated wastewater to spill into Swan Creek. Ironically, the digging was taking place as part of construction of the poultry plant’s new wastewater treatment system, according to the notice. When the pipe broke, the treated effluent filled up the excavated area and ultimately made its way into the new, unfinished pipeline that discharges into Swan Creek. The incident occurred April 24 and Mountaire reported it to DNREC that day, the notice said. An estimated 15,000 gallons of effluent flowed into Swan Creek for about 10 minutes before the source was shut off. DNREC issued the notice of violation to Mountaire on June 15, charging them with unauthorized discharge to surface water. The only action required of Mountaire is that it provide DNREC with documentation of repairs. No fines were levied.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Residents of the 600 block of Irving Street Northwest said D.C.’s urban foresters missed obvious signs that an aging oak tree on the street was ready to topple, WUSA-TV reported. “It was a ticking time bomb,” said Tommy Duren, whose home was badly damaged when the tree came down during storms Monday night. “I don’t know how an arborist gets this wrong.” Two other homes were damaged in the incident. Duren said pruning crews and inspectors should have known the tree was a threat. A spokesman for D.C.’s Department of Transportation, which oversees the Urban Forestry Division, said the last time the tree had been pruned by a city crew was in January. The spokesman described the situation as “force majeure”, a legal term meaning an unforeseeable circumstance. The Urban Forestry Division is responsible for more than 175,000 public trees in the district, according to the agency’s website, which reported the city removed nearly 2,700 trees in the last year.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee:Gov. Ron DeSantis held a private meeting Monday with doctors to oppose mask mandates in public schools. DeSantis said he fears that the federal government might try to force mask mandates in schools, saying children would suffer. On Tuesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended indoor masks for all teachers, staff, students and visitors to schools, regardless of vaccination status. “Our view is that this should absolutely not be imposed. It should not be mandated. And I know our Legislature feels strongly about it,” said DeSantis. He predicted lawmakers would hold a special session “to be able to provide protections for parents and kids who just want to breathe freely and don’t want to be suffering under these masks during the school year.” DeSantis didn’t invite media to the discussion, but his office provided a video and transcript of the meeting in the state Capitol. Florida accounted for a fifth of the nation’s new coronavirus infections last week, more than any other state, according to the CDC. But DeSantis has been firmly opposed to lockdown restrictions, mask mandates and vaccine passports, signing a bill into law that prevents businesses to ask for proof of vaccination and local governments from imposing COVID restrictions.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Delta Air Lines is loosening restrictions on basic economy tickets to reduce the deluge of frustrated travelers facing hourslong waits on customer service phone lines. Basic economy tickets usually do not allow any changes to the itinerary, even for a change fee. The airline temporarily allowed more flexibility during the pandemic, but that policy ended earlier this year. Starting Wednesday, however, Delta will temporarily allow changes to basic economy tickets for travel through Dec. 31, 2021, “to help address call wait times as we increase staffing,” CEO Ed Bastian wrote in an update to customers. The changes can be made online without paying a change fee. Delta cut about 18,000 of its 90,000 employees last year through buyouts and early retirements to cut costs amid the pandemic, leaving it short-staffed when travelers rapidly returned to the skies. “The unexpected pace of the return of our customers has resulted in some unforeseen challenges as we ramp up to meet demand and handle a record-breaking level of calls,” Bastian told customers Tuesday. He acknowledged that “the last thing you want is to experience long hold times when you call reservations or receive a notification that your flight schedule has changed.” To alleviate the problem, the Atlanta-based airline also is hiring more than 5,000 people, including 1,300 reservations specialists who will be trained by September and 3,000 in airport customer service and other areas. Delta has hired more than 2,200 people in Georgia this year.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Hawaii’s Department of Health has updated its guidance to schools a week before the start of another school year during the pandemic. The department’s guidance includes recommendations for wearing masks in all indoor settings and maintaining at least 3 feet of physical distance between students in classrooms, when possible. Masks are recommended outdoors when there’s crowding or prolonged close contact, said acting State Epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Kemble. The department said schools should consider screening testing for all teachers and staff who have not been fully vaccinated regardless of the level of community transmission. The guidance also includes screening testing for those who are not fully vaccinated to facilitate participation in sports and other activities with a higher risk of COVID-19 transmission. Promoting vaccines against COVID-19 for all eligible children and adults is the top strategy for safe in-person learning, Kemble said. Hawaii’s public school students return to classes Aug. 3.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: About 89% of Idaho residents live in communities where officials said masks should be worn again. The Post Register reported Wednesday that 27 of Idaho’s 44 counties have substantial to high transmission of COVID-19. Central District Health also said it supports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s updated recommendation for masks. Central District Health oversees Ada, Boise, Elmore and Valley counties. The city of Boise on Wednesday started requiring masks indoors at its city-owned facilities. In a statement, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare officials said they were concerned about rising COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Idaho has the sixth-lowest vaccination rate, with only about 46% of all eligible residents being fully vaccinated, compared to 56% of all eligible Americans.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A Michigan-based cannabis company on Tuesday ended its challenge of Illinois’ plan to authorize new marijuana business. Sozo Illinois Inc.’s decision to drop its lawsuit will allow Illinois to proceed with awarding licenses to operate marijuana dispensaries. The state on Thursday is to hold the first of three lotteries to award 55 licenses to applicants that scored 85% or better on their applications for recreational cannabis stores. The licenses have been delayed for more than a year, initially because of COVID-19-related issues. Problems with scoring the applications added to the delay. Sozo Illinois Inc. claimed Illinois law unfairly lowered its chances of getting a license. The lawsuit noted part of the law gives bonus points in scoring applications from Illinois-based companies, and another removed a bonus for hiring 10 people from areas hurt by the war on drugs. The lawsuit sought a court order to stop the lotteries. The Chicago Tribune reported Gov. J.B. Pritzker spokeswoman Charity Greene responded to Sozo Illinois’ actions with a statement saying it has a priority of his administration to establish a legal cannabis industry in Illinois that is equitable and reflects the diversity of the state.\n\nIndiana\n\nSouth Bend:Elementary students in South Bend will be required to wear masks when the school year begins next month under the district’s new coronavirus response plan. The plan approved Monday night by the South Bend Community School Corp. board outlines the coronavirus measures that will be in place when the school year begins for students Aug. 11. Students in pre-kindergarten through fifth grade will be required to wear masks indoors, but face coverings will not be required but strongly encouraged among unvaccinated staff and middle and high school students, the South Bend Tribune reported. Staff and middle- and high-school students who are vaccinated can go mask-free, but all visitors to any district school building will be required to wear a mask regardless of vaccination status. Administrators said their decision comes in consultation with health officials and follows similar moves in large school districts, such as Indianapolis Public Schools and Wayne Township, in Indianapolis’ west suburbs. Unlike Indianapolis, which will collect voluntary proof of vaccination for those opting not to wear masks, South Bend’s policy will largely be based on an honor system.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Gov. Kim Reynolds rejected new federal government recommendations about wearing masks to help slow the rapid spread of a coronavirus variant in the U.S.. Reynolds signed a law in May that prohibits local officials from requiring masks to be worn in schools or businesses. Iowa ranks 21st in the nation when it comes to vaccinations, with 49.4% of the population, or 1.56 million people, fully vaccinated. Like many states, vaccination interest has stagnated in recent weeks. Iowa’s seven-day moving average of daily cases was 241 on Monday, the highest level since May 14.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A central Kansas school district is requiring masks in its buildings, and public health officials in one of the state’s most populous counties are recommending that nearly every resident wear masks in indoor public spaces. Top Republicans in the GOP-controlled Legislature ended Kansas’ state of emergency for the coronavirus pandemic in mid-June, citing a decline in new cases. The Salina district’s board of education voted 5-2 during a special Tuesday night meeting to impose its mask requirement, the Salina Journal reported. The district, which has about 6,900 students, appears to be the first outside the Kansas City area to impose a new mask mandate. It joined the Kansas City, Kansas, district and the neighboring Shawnee Mission district in Johnson County, the state’s most populous county, to require at least some students to wear masks. Meanwhile, the Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health department on Tuesday began recommending that anyone age 2 or older wear masks in schools and other indoor spaces, even though the county has among the highest vaccination rates and the lowest total number of COVID-19 cases per capita among the state’s 105 counties.\n\nKentucky\n\nGeorgetown: A public workshop is planned to discuss options for an aging dam on the north fork of Elkhorn Creek, the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources said. The agency said it will lead a discussion on Aug. 3 about the Great Crossing Dam near Georgetown. A study commissioned by Scott County officials found the low-head dam needs repair but isn’t in danger of immediate failure. Fish and Wildlife said it is considering options that include removing the structure from the waterway, which would improve safety for boaters and swimmers and also improve water quality. The meeting will be held at Great Crossing High School in Georgetown. Those attending will have an opportunity to ask questions and provide feedback to department officials.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: As COID-19 vaccine interest plummeted in Louisiana, the state saw a spike in the number of wasted shots, with more than 79,000 doses trashed largely because health providers couldn’t find enough arms quickly enough. Wasted doses of the vaccines numbered fewer than 1,500 only four months ago. But data provided to the Associated Press by the Louisiana Department of Health showed the unused, discarded shots surged to more than 50 times that number by July 23. Meanwhile, another 161,000 doses of the three COVID-19 vaccines available across the state are scheduled to expire within 14 days – a waste the Health Department hopes to avoid either through a possible federal decision to extend the expiration dates or through increased vaccine interest. Waste is not uncommon in mass immunization efforts, and the doses trashed in Louisiana so far represent less than 1% of the nearly 3.5 million vaccines that reached arms. Louisiana already is only drawing down a sliver of the vaccine doses made available by the federal government each week, despite an all-out push to get people interested in the shots that includes offering $2.3 million in cash prizes and scholarships.\n\nMaine\n\nEast Boothbay: A Maine marine science lab has received $5 million to further research into whether seaweed-based food can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions from cows. Bigelow Laboratory has been working in recent years on whether the feed supplements can help cut emissions of methane at cattle operations. Methane emissions, which happen when cows belch, allegedly contribute to climate change. The laboratory said the grant is from the Shelby Cullom Davis Charitable Fund and it will build on a project that began in 2019. Nichole Price, a senior research scientist at Bigelow Laboratory and the project leader, said the funding will help scientists apply their work in a way that is feasible on a global scale. The lab said it has had success in feed trials with individual herds. One of the biggest questions is how the supplement can be produced in large enough quantities and at a reasonable enough cost to make a dent in worldwide farming operations. Price said new parts of the project will “complement our existing search for the right seaweed solution and enable us to look into some creative ways that we can use what we’re learning to actually solve this global problem.”\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury:The Maryland Office of the State Fire Marshal is investigating three incidents of houses being set on fire on Nokomis Avenue in Salisbury. The first broke out on July 21. A social media post from the Salisbury Fire Department showed crews responded to the blaze just before 6 a.m. and were able to extinguish the fire and clear the scene before 7:30 a.m. Two other fires were reported simultaneously on July 23, just before 10 p.m., according to a news release from the fire marshal’s office. The homes are owned by Milford Twilley Rentals, the fire marshal’s office said, and were left with moderate fire, heat and smoke damage. There were no injuries, but the fire marshal’s office estimated the blazes totaled about $110,000 in damages. Smoke alarms were present for two of the fires but did not activate because the fires were set outside at the back of the homes. The fire marshal’s office said neighbors noticed all three blazes and reported them to the fire department. No arrests have been made. Deputy state fire marshals are asking anyone with information to call (410) 713-3780. Callers can remain anonymous.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: An Army officer from Massachusetts who was reported missing in action during the Korean War has been accounted for and is coming home for burial, military officials said. The remains of 1st Lt. Thomas J. Redgate, are scheduled to buried at the veterans’ cemetery in Bourne on Sept. 17, the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said in a statement. Redgate, a member of Battery A, 48th Field Artillery Battalion, 7th Infantry Division, was reported missing Dec. 11, 1950, when his unit was attacked during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir, according to the Army. The exact details surrounding his loss were not known, and his remains could not be recovered at the time. He was 24. In July 2018, following a summit between President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, North Korea turned over 55 boxes that purportedly contained the remains of American service members killed during the war. The remains were examined at the DPAA’s laboratory in Hawaii, and based on anthropological analysis, as well as DNA and circumstantial evidence, one set was determined to be Redgate’s. Redgate, whose hometown was listed as Boston’s Brighton neighborhood, was accounted for in April 2020, but the announcement was made Wednesday because his family only recently received a full briefing of his identification, the Army said. Redgate’s name is recorded on the Courts of the Missing at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific in Honolulu. A rosette will be placed next to his name to indicate he has been accounted for.\n\nMichigan\n\nMarysville:City leaders have enacted a new law banning chickens, pheasants, badgers, kangaroos, coyotes and even cougars and tigers, the Times Herald of Port Huron reported. The new domestic animals and fowl ordinance that goes into effect in mid-August was crafted after some residents complained about neighbors who owned chickens and crowing roosters, according to Marysville City Manager Randy Fernandez. Marysville’s current ordinance bans “animals or domestic fowl within the city except dogs, cats, birds, fowl, or animals commonly classified as pets,” the newspaper reported. “So, what this basically does is tighten the limit on … no more chickens and some other animals that we would consider livestock, that do not belong in the limits of Marysville or any other city,” Fernandez told city council members Monday. Marysville has about 9,600 residents and is located along the St. Clair River, which separates that part of Michigan from Canada. The new ordinance allows Fernandez to deal with addressing future animal complaints “case-by-case if that’s the way that administration wants to,” City Attorney Al Francis said. However, the inclusion of animals such as chinchillas, doves and ferrets on the banned list might have been a little too much, according to Councilman Dave Barber, who said he knows people who keep such animals. “I get the rest of it, and I feel for the folks who have chickens,” Barber said. “But I question those three.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Department of Health officials said they are investigating a COVID-19 outbreak at a camp for teenagers in the northwestern part of the state. Communications specialist Erin McHenry said state health officials are investigating “a cluster of cases” at the Castaway Club Young Life Camp on Pelican Lake, about 45 miles east of Fargo, North Dakota. The facility typically hosts teenagers from about 10 states, camp manager Greg Johnson said. Johnson said he’s aware of 10 virus cases involving staff members over the past two weeks, with no new infections in the last week. The number of infected guests wasn’t immediately known because cases might have been reported in other states, KVRR-TV reported. Johnson said when the outbreak began, special protocols were put into place that included an indoor mask mandate and in some circumstances an outdoor mask requirement.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves does not plan to issue a mask mandate for schools, even as COVID-19 cases are proliferating in a state with one of the lowest vaccination rates in the nation. “Governor Reeves has no intention of requiring students and staff to wear masks when they’re in school this fall,” his spokeswoman, Bailey Martin, said Tuesday. A few Mississippi school districts have started classes, and others are starting by mid-August. Some parents have raised concerns about the virus spreading among children too young to be vaccinated, and many school districts have said they will not require students or employees to wear masks because the governor has not set a mask mandate.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Garth Brooks fans will have a chance to be vaccinated against the coronavirus when the country music star performs at Arrowhead Stadium on Aug. 7. Chiefs president Mark Donovan said the team plans to take every opportunity to offer vaccinations at Arrowhead, The Kansas City Star reported. Donovan said the organization isn’t sure if it will be able to use Arrowhead Stadium as a vaccination site on Chiefs game days this fall but “we’re trying to work through that as well.” A vaccination clinic was held at Arrowhead Stadium in the spring.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Health officials have issued a safety advisory for a lake just outside Yellowstone National Park after harmful algal blooms toxic to humans and animals were detected. The bloom of algae was in Hebgen Lake, a reservoir in southwestern Montana near the borders of Idaho and Wyoming, officials said. NorthWestern Energy monitors six locations across the reservoir weekly, said company spokesperson Jo Dee Black. Warmer water temperatures and a lower-than-usual water level is causing more algae growth earlier in the season than in a typical year, Black told the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. Blue-green algae is native to Montana’s freshwater lakes and reservoirs and not all varieties are harmful. But some algal blooms produce toxins that pose a risk to people, pets and livestock when ingested or through prolonged contact, according to NorthWestern Energy and the Gallatin City-County Health Department. Don’t drink, swallow or swim in water that has harmful blooms, officials said. The blooms can look like pea soup, grass clippings or green latex paint and are typically suspended in the water and can appear as floating mats.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Police have arrested a man accused of attacking and shooting another man in the neck with a BB gun for wearing a mask. The incident happened Tuesday in the vestibule of a midtown grocery store as one man was leaving and another was entering, the Omaha World-Herald reported. One man was not wearing a mask, police said, and ran up to and spit on the other man, who was wearing a mask. A fight ensued, and police said the unmasked man pulled out a BB-gun replica of a pistol and shot the other man. The injured man told officers that when he demanded to know why he was attacked, the unmasked man responded, “You’re on the other team.” The victim suffered injuries to his face, neck and shoulder and had to pull a pellet out of his shoulder, he said. Officers arrested the accused shooter on suspicion of felony terroristic threats and misdemeanor assault.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Nevada print news organization and the American Civil Liberties Union are suing to ensure access to what could be the state’s first execution in 15 years. A federal lawsuit invoking First Amendment rights seeks a court order banning state prisons chief Charles Daniels from preventing witnesses, including reporters, from observing the lethal injection of convicted killer Zane Michael Floyd. State and federal judges have put off Floyd’s execution until at least late October to allow time for appeals to be heard. Aides to Gov. Steve Sisolak and state Attorney General Aaron Ford declined to comment on the lawsuit filed by ACLU attorneys Friday in U.S. District Court in Las Vegas. Ford’s office represents state officials in several court challenges of the execution plan. The lawsuit said witnesses should have “uninterrupted viewing” of the condemned man from the time he enters the execution chamber until he is declared dead, with an unfettered ability to hear and see the process. It points to an execution manual released in June, allowing the prisons chief to choose the number and names of media representatives. Floyd, who was a Marine, received the death penalty in 2000 for killing four people and wounding a fifth with a shotgun at a Las Vegas supermarket in 1999. He also was convicted of repeatedly raping a woman the night before the rampage. The last person executed in Nevada was Daryl Mack, who asked to die in 2006 following his conviction in a 1988 rape and murder in Reno.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu said New Hampshire will not be issuing new mask guidance following the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation that even fully vaccinated people wear masks indoors in areas where COVID-19 transmission is substantial or high. Four of New Hampshire’s 10 counties and the city of Nashua are experiencing moderate transmission, and the rest of the state is seeing minimal transmission, according to figures released by the Department of Health and Human Services. “At this point, it isn’t about the government providing that bubble of safety around individuals,” Sununu told WMUR-TV. Instead, he said it’s about the individual taking on personal responsibility. “It is your choice,” Sununu said. “We have all the power to protect ourselves and the community, and that’s getting the vaccine. It’s safe. It’s easy.” More than 53% of the state has been fully vaccinated. Sununu said he’s frustrated that more residents are not vaccinated, given the extensive effort made by the state to get vaccines out to the public, but he said he understands it is a personal choice.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Vaccinated and unvaccinated residents in New Jersey should wear masks indoors when there is an increased risk of spreading the coronavirus, Gov. Phil Murphy said. Murphy said the state’s coronavirus metrics are going in the wrong direction, and new data suggested the delta variant is more transmissible, “which is why we are making this strong recommendation.” Instances where masks are recommended include: crowded indoor settings, those involving close contact with others who aren’t fully vaccinated and those where someone’s vaccine status is unknown. Murphy made the recommendation in a joint statement with Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli. Murphy’s recommendation didn’t address schools. Murphy spokesperson Alyana Alfaro Post said Wednesday there was no update yet on masks in schools. New Jersey has among the highest percentages of people vaccinated in the country.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: A bountiful wildflower bloom at Bandelier National Monument is drawing some early risers who want to avoid the midday crowds, and the visitors center is responding to accommodate them. Starting Sunday, the visitor center will open a half-hour earlier at 8:30 a.m. Acting Superintendent Dennis Milligan said that will give staff more time to hand out information on trails and safety. The Southwest has been inundated with rain during the monsoon season, bolstering wildflowers. Mariposa lilies, harebells and shooting stars are abundant along trails like the Cerro Grande and Alamo Boundary at Bandelier. Monument officials said the massive wildflower bloom should last for several more weeks. They said visitors should feel free to photograph the flowers but don’t pick them so others can enjoy the view. Visitation to the monument that features canyons and ancient cliff dwellings dropped drastically during the pandemic. Officials said they’re now seeing a 157% increase in visitation since 2019.\n\nNew York\n\nSouthampton: A village in the Hamptons will pay its outgoing police chief more than $774,000 for unused sick and vacation time after village officials voted to end his contract. Southampton Village Police Chief Thomas Cummings’ contract contained provisions that allowed for the large payout, Newsday reported Wednesday. The village board voted on July 20 to end his contract on Sept. 10 and approved the payout. The agreement calculated 686 unused days at $1,095 per day, plus almost $23,000 in retroactive per diem pay. The newspaper obtained the information through public records requests. Cummings, 57, has been police chief in the village of the wealthy enclave since 2011, after joining the department in 1987. He had clashed with Mayor Jesse Warren, who won reelection in June, the newspaper reported. Warren criticized the contract that allowed the large payout in a statement Tuesday. Cummings did not respond to a request for comment from the newspaper. He and his wife will also get medical and dental benefits without premiums for the rest of their lives, unless his wife were to remarry.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: North Carolina’s health department will require workers, volunteers and others at 14 state-run health care facilities to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 by Sept. 30 unless they qualify for a medical or religious exemption, according to a memo. The Associated Press obtained a departmental FAQ about the vaccine mandate that said those who don’t get fully vaccinated or exempted by the deadline could face “disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, for unacceptable personal conduct.” Republican House Speaker Tim Moore first shed light on the development through a news release Tuesday night. Although he is vaccinated and encourages others to get the shots, he said he believes residents should have the ability to make their own decisions without fear of reprisal. The speaker also noted that none of the available COVID-19 vaccines the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved for emergency use have thus far received full FDA approval. North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services did not comment on Moore’s criticism, but confirmed it will require many within the Division of State Operated Health Facilities to get vaccinated. Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper’s office has not responded to questions about whether the governor supports a COVID-19 vaccine mandate for state workers.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWatford City: The operator of an oil well pad where a fire has been burning since last week in McKenzie County has brought in a specialized emergency response crew to get a handle on the blaze. The well pad is located on federal land just south of Lake Sakakawea northeast of Watford City. Its operator, Petro-Hunt, is working with Texas-based Wild Well Control. “They can come in and know how to analyze or diagnose the problem and get to it,” said Dave Glatt, director of the North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality. McKenzie County Emergency Manager Karolin Jappe said authorities have closed roads in the area and are asking people to avoid driving or boating near the fire, the Bismarck Tribune reported. The cause of the fire, which broke out Jan. 22, is unknown. Clouds of black smoke are rising from the blaze, causing state environmental officials to encourage nearby residents to monitor their local air quality at www.airnow.gov. Air quality is already poor in parts of North Dakota because of wildfire smoke from the western U.S. and Canada. Petro-Hunt initially reported to the state that an estimated 100 barrels of oil and 100 barrels of saltwater spilled at the site. The true volume of the spills is not yet known, Glatt said. The fire is contained to the well pad, and it has not resulted in any injuries, according to Petro-Hunt.\n\nOhio\n\nAkron:A vandal defaced a large LeBron James-inspired “Space Jam” mural in Akron. A red clown nose was spray painted on James’ face, along with the words “LA FLOP” sometime early Monday morning on the artwork created by Copley artist Chardae Slater on the front of a West Market Street business. The mural is located not far from James’ alma mater, St. Vincent-St. Vincent High School, and the I Promise School he helped found for at-risk Akron children. Akron Police have been alerted to the vandalism and Slater said she’s hopeful businesses near the mural will be willing to share any security camera footage they might have that captured the culprit or culprits. James’ representatives did not return a request for comment Monday about the recent vandalism. Slater said it might take up to two weeks to fix the mural. “It’s fixable,” she said. “It’s just oh my God. I’m trying to keep positive.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: City employees who are unvaccinated for the coronavirus will not receive hazard leave if they contract the illness, Mayor G.T Bynum said. Hazard leave is paid leave that is not counted against sick days or vacation days, city spokesperson Michelle Brooks said. Affected unvaccinated employees could use sick days or vacation if they become ill with the virus. Ascension St. John Hospital in Tulsa announced its employees would be required to become vaccinated by Nov. 12, with exemptions possible for medical or religious regions. “Tens of thousands of Ascension associates have already been vaccinated with the available vaccines, as have millions of people across the country and the world,” Ascension said in a statement. “But we must do more to overcome this pandemic as we provide safe environments for those we serve.” Ascension joins OU Health, Mercy and SSM Health as hospitals in the state requiring employee vaccinations.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:A former Oregon lawmaker who was expelled for letting violent protesters into the state Capitol pleaded guilty Tuesday to one count of official misconduct. The Statesman Journal reported that Mike Nearman was sentenced to 18 months probation, during which he will need to complete 80 hours of community service and is banned from the Capitol building and grounds. He will also pay $200 in court fees and $2,700 to the Oregon Legislative Administration for damages done during the Dec. 21 riot. As part of the agreement in Marion County Circuit Court, a count of criminal trespass was dismissed. Last month, Nearman, a Republican from Polk County, became the first member of the Oregon House to be expelled in its 160-year history. The House voted 59-1 to remove him from the Legislature for disorderly behavior. Nearman was seen on security video opening a door to protesters on Dec. 21 as lawmakers met in emergency session to deal with economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Protesters barged into the building, which was closed to the public because of pandemic safety protocols, got into shoving matches with police and sprayed officers with bear spray. Some of the protesters had guns.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf said he is not considering a statewide mask mandate as coronavirus cases surge in Pennsylvania and across the country, and his administration said it is not requiring masks in schools. Wolf, speaking on KDKA-AM in Pittsburgh, said his strategy to fight the spread of COVID-19 has been the vaccine, and will continue to be. The masking mandate was for when there was no vaccine, Wolf said. “People have the ability, each individual to make the decision to get a vaccine,” Wolf said. “If they do, that’s the protection.” Wolf’s administration also said it is not considering mandating masks in K-12 schools. However, it said it is recommending that Pennsylvanians and Pennsylvania schools follow federal guidance on mask-wearing.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Rhode Island’s two largest health care systems are requiring all employees to be vaccinated against the coronavirus. The announcements Tuesday by Lifespan and Care New England – which are moving toward a merger – came as the delta variant of the coronavirus continues to spread and the Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention issued new face-covering guidelines. “It is our responsibility to keep our patients, and our staff, safe. This program will be based on the best evidence that we have to date about preventing transmission of COVID-19,” Dr. James Fanale, Care New England’s chief executive, said in a statement. Care New England said it would “move toward” requiring vaccinations by first requiring that all managers receive a first dose before Labor Day. More details will be released within the next seven to 10 days. Lifespan announced that its vaccine mandate will go into effect Sept. 1, and it is the system’s goal to have all employees show proof of immunization within 60 days. Lifespan operates Rhode Island, Hasbro Children’s, Bradley, Newport, and The Miriam hospitals. Care New England operates Butler, Kent, and Women & Infants hospitals.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Health officials are looking for people who might have come in contact with a rabid puppy or its missing littermate along the Georgia-South Carolina border. The Department of Health and Environmental Control said the agency recently identified a rabid puppy that was born in Edgefield County, near Lanier Road in the town of Johnston. The small, tan-and-white pit bull puppy was approximately 7 weeks old and weighed about 5 pounds. The dog and a littermate were taken to Augusta, Georgia, between July 14 and July 17. Both puppies were also taken to a gathering in Clearwater, South Carolina, about that time, the agency said. The rabid puppy was also taken to a birthday party in Florence, South Carolina. Health officials have yet to find the littermate or identify its rabies status. The health agency is now searching for people who attended the Clearwater gathering or might have had contact with the littermate puppy. “We are deeply concerned about all persons involved, as rabies is fatal if left untreated after exposure,” said Dr. Gil Potter, Midlands Region Medical Director. People who came in contact with the puppy’s saliva should seek medical attention, as they might have been exposed to rabies, the agency said. Animals can shed the virus for up to two weeks before showing symptoms of rabies.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:Staff and inmates at South Dakota prisons are no longer required to wear masks following an order from Gov. Kristi Noem lifting the requirement. Among neighboring states, South Dakota is the only one to lift a mask requirement in prisons, the Argus Leader reported. Noem’s move was spurred by a meeting she had with employees at the state penitentiary in Sioux Falls. They cheered when she told them they could remove their masks during a meeting Friday. The governor was at the prison to respond to an ongoing human resources investigation into complaints of low employee morale, shorthanded prison staff and insufficient tactical gear for corrections officers. Noem’s spokesman Ian Fury told the Argus Leader the governor would have made the move even sooner if she was aware of the Department of Corrections policy. He said it was “common sense” given the rate of virus cases and would help boost employee morale. The Department of Corrections said 70% of inmates have received at least one vaccination. It does not track the vaccination rate among staff.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: A group of state Senate Republicans are urging the public to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, a move that comes as case numbers are beginning to again climb throughout the state. “Unfortunately, efforts to get more people vaccinated have been hampered by politicization of COVID-19,” the group of 17 lawmakers wrote in a letter Tuesday. “This should not be political.” Tennessee has faced increased national scrutiny over its low COVID-19 vaccination rates after the Department of Health fired its top vaccination chief and briefly halted outreach for childhood vaccines. Some GOP leaders have since gone on the defensive, with Gov. Bill Lee urging Tennesseans to get a COVID-19 shot after remaining mum on the subject for several weeks. On Tuesday, Senate Republican leadership reiterated that getting the vaccine was a “personal choice” but encouraged people to talk to their doctor about the vaccination.\n\nTexas\n\nLa Porte: Two people are dead and 30 were hospitalized after a chemical leak at a Houston-area plant, officials said. LyondellBasell said that about 100,000 pounds of a mixture that included acetic acid was released in the leak that started Tuesday night at its La Porte Complex. The company said that the “all clear” was given early Wednesday, and that the leak had been isolated and contained. The company said air monitoring was ongoing and hasn’t shown “actionable levels.” Two contractors were killed and 30 workers were taken to local hospitals for evaluation and treatment, the company said. Of those, it said 24 were treated and released. The names of the contractors who died were not immediately released. The cause was under investigation, the company said, adding it was cooperating with authorities. Harris County Fire Marshal Laurie Christensen said that the chemicals involved can severely burn skin and are toxic if inhaled.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Flash floods caused extensive damage in Cedar City and led Mayor Maile Wilson-Edwards to declare a state of emergency. Residents of the basement apartments at University West Apartments said they lost everything they own after the flood waters reached several feet high, Fox13 news reported. Cheryl Beeston said her daughter and son-in-law, Cheyenne and Kyle Brunson, were at work when the floods hit, but their home is ruined. “It’s worse than I ever expected. They’ve been married – it’ll be five months tomorrow – and they’ve lost everything,” she said. One volunteer did manage to find her daughter’s wedding ring, though. “We’re so grateful for that,” Beeston said. “We’re grateful for all the help that’s here.” Parts of the Southern Utah University campus, including the stadium were also damaged alongside entire neighborhoods, business complexes and roads. A Walmart parking lot became a waist-high pond and drivers waded out to their cars with help from Walmart employees.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington:More than a dozen blood donation opportunities are scheduled across Vermont in August as the American Red Cross is reporting a severe blood shortage. The need for donations is higher this summer as more people are seeking treatment after deferring care during the coronavirus pandemic, Northern New England Red Cross spokeswoman Mary Brant told the Burlington Free Press. Organ transplants and elective surgeries have increased. Hospital emergency rooms also are handling more trauma cases, Brant said. The Red Cross has been distributing 12% more blood products to hospitals across the country than it was during the same time last year, the newspaper reported. Vermonters are urged to make an appointment now to give blood by calling 1-800-RED CROSS, visiting redcrossblood.org or downloading the Red Cross Blood Donor app on a smartphone.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam introduced two more spending proposals for the state’s $4.3 billion share of federal coronavirus relief money, calling for investments in clean water projects and more than $860 million to replenish the fund that pays unemployment benefits. The Democratic governor has been incrementally rolling out his spending plans ahead of a special legislative session that begins next week, when lawmakers will vote on how to allocate the money from the American Rescue Plan.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee said the state will follow federal guidance and recommend that people wear a mask in public indoor settings in areas where there is a worrying rate of COVID-19 - including people who are fully vaccinated. Inslee also said the state will continue to require that all students and employees of K-12 schools wear masks when instruction resumes for the upcoming school year. Inslee’s office said the masking guidance for the general public indoors in places with a substantial or high COVID-19 rate is a recommendation only, but the school masking requirement is state law. Health officials in more than a half-dozen western Washington counties were already recommending mask-wearing in indoor public spaces regardless of vaccine status because of a rise in COVID-19 cases and the highly infectious delta variant.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nClarksburg: The Clarksburg Water Board has made $416,000 available in its budget to address lead found in some customers’ household drinking water. The board won’t make capital purchases this year and postponed buying items including lab equipment and three trucks, The Exponent Telegram reported. “These items are needed. Otherwise, they wouldn’t be in the budget,” Jason Myers, the board’s general manager, said at a meeting on Tuesday. “However, with public health in mind … we’re willing to forgo this.” The West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources said funds are available to help with the problem but asked the board to outline how much of its own money could be used, according to Myers. On top of available aid from the health department and the Environmental Protection Agency, the board plans to request funding from the West Virginia Infrastructure and Jobs Development Council. The region’s planning and development council is also helping to find funding sources. Of the 120 water samples collected for lead testing that were returned as of Tuesday afternoon, only one was above an allowable limit set by the EPA. The lead issue was discovered when drinking water samples were collected from the homes of three children diagnosed with elevated blood lead levels. The toxic metal can be particularly harmful to children. Multiple sources of exposure were identified, so the water couldn’t have been the sole cause of the higher levels.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The chairman of the Wisconsin Republican Party said he is stepping down from the volunteer position he has held since April 2019. Andrew Hitt departure comes just over a year before the 2022 midterm elections, where Republicans are trying to retain the U.S. Senate seat held by Ron Johnson and defeat Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. Hitt, 43, said he will leave the post upon election of a successor, which will take place by early September. Hitt, from Appleton, is an attorney with the Michael Best and Friedrich law firm and also is a partner in its lobbying arm, Michael Best Strategies. Hitt said he was leaving to focus on his family and private sector career. “It’s bittersweet to step down now with such an exciting election cycle ahead, but I know it is the right thing to do for my family and employer after the sacrifices they made so I could provide steady leadership at a crucial time,” Hitt said in a statement. Hitt was a visible chairman, working closely with party activists, insiders and office holders, raising money and also being the public face for the GOP in the media. During his time as chairman, the state GOP opened its first office in Milwaukee and also suffered a cyberattack where $2.3 million was stolen.\n\nWyoming\n\nDayton: Investigators found a man dead after a boy allegedly told authorities in Montana he killed his father. The 15-year-old allegedly confessed to authorities in the Hardin, Montana, area, leading investigators to find the body at a home in Dayton early Wednesday, Sheridan County sheriff’s officials said in a statement. Sheriff’s officials didn’t identify the boy or dead man. Sheriff’s officials and Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation agents were investigating, according to the statement. There was no threat to the public and people should keep away from the home to allow a thorough investigation, Undersheriff Levi Dominguez said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/23/nuns-donate-home-canines-court-swine-control-news-around-states/118941372/", "title": "Nuns donate home, canines in court: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFlorence: Archaeologists are analyzing pieces of pottery, nails and glass found at Pope’s Tavern, an inn and stagecoach stop for travelers dating back to the early 1800s before Alabama achieved statehood. A state team funded by a grant recently conducted a dig at the northwest Alabama site, which has a museum that focuses on the history of the city of Florence. Museum curator Brian Murphy told the TimesDaily pottery was the most common item discovered during the work. “They pulled out a bunch of artifacts that are being cleaned and processed right now,” Murphy said. “They will give us a really good image of the types of materials and type of utensils used, and really a glimpse into the daily life of the people who lived there and used that space.” The crew also found the brick remains of an old structure that could have been a hearth or outbuilding, he said. “They are seeing what type of materials are associated with that, using flotation, which brings up microscopic material to a level that can be processed. After they do that, they’re going to get back to us with the larger picture of what it all means and what might be under there still that could be the source of a future excavation,” he said. Pope’s Tavern was built in the the 1830s, he said, and artifacts found on the grounds dated to the 1820s and ’30s.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Officials are aiming to make the first wave of dividend payments to state residents the week of Oct. 11, a Department of Revenue spokesperson said. Genevieve Wojtusik, the department’s legislative liaison, said in an email Wednesday that the first wave would include those who filed for dividends electronically. She said the second mass payments, which would include those who filed paper applications, would go out about two weeks later. The Legislature last week approved $730.5 million for dividends this year of about $1,100 and for administrative and other related costs. Wojtusik said the final check amount is being calculated and is expected to be announced by Oct. 1. Dividends typically are paid in the early fall, but this year’s payout wasn’t finalized until the third special session of the year, which ended last week. Lawmakers earlier this year proposed a roughly $1,100 dividend, using money from various sources, but failed to win sufficient support for use of some of the funds. What was left at that time was a dividend estimated to be $525, which Gov. Mike Dunleavy vetoed.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: This year’s wet monsoon is contributing to a record-high season for the West Nile virus, which is spread through mosquito bites, health officials said. Arizona had 123 cases and four deaths through late last week, the state Department of Health Services said Tuesday. Nearly all of the cases were reported in Maricopa County, where the virus has been detected in record numbers of mosquitos studied, the department said. While most people infected with West Nile don’t get symptoms, older people and those with weakened immune systems are more prone to diseases that be fatal. Health officials recommend wearing long-sleeved shirts and long pants to help prevent mosquito bites on arms and legs and eliminating standing water where mosquitos lay their eggs.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Two men have been convicted of conspiring to kill a federal witness in 2016. A federal jury deliberated for about 61/ 2 hours before delivering the verdicts Tuesday against Donald Smith, 37, of Malvern, and Samuel Sherman, 38, of Batesville, in the shooting death of 44-year-old Suzen Cooper, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Prosecutors alleged Smith, Sherman and Suzen Cooper’s former sister-in-law, Racheal Cooper, conspired to sell methamphetamine and cocaine, and Cooper was a confidential informant who had purchased meth from Sherman. Racheal Cooper was originally charged with capital murder in Hot Spring County but later pleaded guilty to a charge of hindering apprehension, for which she served five years of a 25-year sentence. Smith and Sherman face up to life in prison after being convicted of federal charges of witness tampering resulting in death, conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine, and aiding and abetting the use, carry and discharge of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime. A sentencing hearing has not yet been set. Porter led the police to the grave site, Assistant U.S. Attorney Anne Gardner said. “Suzen Cooper’s body was exactly where Jimmy Porter said it would be,” Gardner said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Residents failed to significantly cut back their water consumption in July, state officials announced Tuesday, foreshadowing some difficult decisions for Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration as a historic drought lingers into the fall. Newsom had asked people in July to voluntarily cut back their water consumption by 15% to help address a severe drought that has left some of the state’s reservoirs at dangerously low levels. But in the three weeks after Newsom’s announcement, residents reduced their water consumption just 1.8%, according to new data released Tuesday and reported by the Sacramento Bee. “On conservation, we’re going to be needing to do more,” board chair Joaquin Esquivel said. Still, Esquivel was hopeful the state’s conservation numbers will improve. Newsom declared a drought emergency in the Russian River watershed along the state’s north coast in April. Data from that region shows people reduced their water consumption by 17% in July compared to 2020. “We see that it takes time for conservation to boot up,” Esquivel said, adding that the 17% figure “shows the responsiveness of communities” to appeals for conservation. Dave Eggerton, executive director of the Association of California Water Agencies, said the numbers “represent a promising start in reducing water use.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Criminal charges have been dropped in connection with the death of a spiritual leader whose mummified body was found in what appeared to be a shrine in a southern Colorado home, according to court officials. The body of Amy Carlson, 45, leader of the Love Has Won group, was found decorated with Christmas lights and glitter in the tiny, rural town of Moffat in April, according to previously released arrest affidavits. Seven people were charged with tampering with or abusing her corpse as well as child abuse, presumably because there were two children living in the home. Charges against six people were dropped during court proceedings, the Saguache County court clerk’s office said in an email Tuesday. It said no case existed for a seventh person who was among those charged with the others in May, though the office did not explain what happened in that case. It’s not known why the charges were dropped. Assistant District Attorney Alex Raines asked a judge to dismiss all the charges during a Sept. 14 hearing, the Valley Courier reports. Defense lawyers also requested that records be sealed, which was approved, it said. A telephone message left for Raines was not returned.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Hundreds of unionized group home workers are threatening to walk off the job next month if settlements aren’t reached on new labor contracts. The New England Health Care Employees Union, District 1199, SEIU, delivered strike notices Tuesday to two private agencies – Whole Life Inc. and Network Inc. – that have about 70 locations across the state that could be affected. The union’s deadline for an agreement is Oct. 5. The threat of a strike, which would involve over 500 workers at group homes and day programs for people with developmental disabilities, comes more than three months after state officials authorized $184 million to increase wages and benefits for group home workers. The union said these remaining two operators have failed to settle on new agreements, despite the added funding. In July, a threatened strike by over 2,100 group home workers at 200 homes was called off after a late-night agreement for higher wages and improved benefits was reached with the Lamont administration’s help. “The State of Connecticut stepped up and provided funding that was adequate,” Rob Baril, the union president, said in a statement. “Now it’s time for these agencies to do the same: to provide people with pensions, affordable health insurance and enough wages that people can take care of their families.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A new law is expected to make it simpler for residents to use solar energy to power their homes through a community-centered program scheduled to start next year. To participate, customers can get credit on their electric bills by subscribing to a centrally located local community solar project, which can be cheaper than paying to install solar panels on their own roofs. Community-owned solar generation facilities have been legal in Delaware since 2010 but included some legal barriers such as requiring the facility to identify all its customers before being built. The bill by Sen. Stephanie Hansen, D-Middletown, removed some of those barriers to make it easier for people to take advantage of the fast-growing industry. Delaware hasn’t had the facilities in the past because the laws weren’t set up to accommodate them, Hansen said. The bill specifically changes regulations for solar facilities that will connect through Delmarva Power, the most prominent energy company in the state. Once facility owners get the green light, Delaware can expect to see the solar panel facilities popping up in open lands like Brownfield sites, undeveloped fields, or on top of parking lots or landfills, according to Hansen.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Artifacts from the racial injustice protests that erupted last year in the wake of George Floyd’s death are being preserved, and their protectors are hoping to find new homes for some of the mementos, WUSA-TV reports. As pro-Trump demonstrators repeatedly targeted a makeshift memorial at the barrier that separated Black Lives Matter Plaza from the White House, “fence guardians” sought to protect artifacts of the movement that shone a spotlight on police brutality against Black people. The Biden administration dismantled the fence earlier this year, but not before Nadine Seiler saved more than 700 mementos. “We were lucky that the Library of Congress took some pieces, and Howard University took some pieces,” Seiler said. “But the vast majority of the collection remained with us.” Hundreds of signs, photographs and pieces of artwork remain in her D.C. storage space. Seiler and fellow “fence guardian Karen Irwin are now finding homes for each item, asking interested businesses, nonprofits and organizations to contact them via Facebook. “Ideally, the Black Lives Matter community would like the pieces to stay in the hands of Black organizations,” Seiler said. “But personally, any organization that would give these treasures a safe home and recognize their value, they should reach out as well.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis named a UCLA doctor and health policy researcher who shares his approach to managing the coronavirus pandemic to serve as the state’s surgeon general Tuesday. Like DeSantis, Dr. Joseph Ladapo said he doesn’t believe in school closures, lockdowns or vaccine mandates. “Florida will completely reject fear as a way of making policies in public health,” Ladapo said. DeSantis said there’s been misinformation spread about COVID-19 to control personal behavior and mentioned monoclonal antibody treatment, claiming that while he’s been advocating it for months, others haven’t been pushing it as vocally. Doctors agree with DeSantis that the treatment, when delivered soon after infection, is effective. Lapado said vaccines aren’t the only way to combat COVID-19. “There’s nothing special about them compared to any other preventive measure,” he said, adding that people should be encouraged to lose weight, exercise more and eat healthier. And Lapado spoke out against lockdowns, saying that “after lockdowns, overall mortality increased ... lots of reasons why they’re bad.” On Wednesday, Ladapo signed new protocols allowing parents to decide whether their children should quarantine or stay in school if they are asymptomatic after being exposed to someone with COVID-19. His new guidelines also tweaked the state’s prohibition against school mask mandates, prompting an administrative law judge to dismiss a lawsuit against the old rule that had been filed by various school boards.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Some of the people living in a homeless camp known as Cooterville say they’re skeptical of a new, government-sanctioned homeless camp planned for the community. The Cooterville encampment under CSX railroad tracks is set to be cleared by Nov. 12, with city leaders trying to time the ejections with the opening of the new camp where homeless will be allowed to stay legally. City officials are looking for an organization to head the government-sanctioned encampment, which will determine what it eventually looks like. The Athens-Clarke County Commission this summer selected a site for it at the North Athens School. Opponents have said they’re concerned it will attract more homeless people to Athens. But supporters say the new camp will come with services aimed at helping homeless people make the transition to permanent housing. In the Cooterville camp, some have expressed feeling left in the dark about the process are are unsure whether they will be secured a spot in the new camp. Oscar Sutton, who’s lived in Cooterville a couple of months, said he has no plans to move to the government-sanctioned encampment and worries about placing so many random people from the homeless community together. “It’s going to be chaos,” he said. “If I have to stay out here, I’ll just find somewhere to stay.”\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man who helped organize a group that opposes COVID-19 vaccines and mandates says he contracted the disease and now has regrets. Chris Wikoff told Hawaii News Now he helped start the Aloha Freedom Coalition last October, believing government shutdowns and mandates were threatening liberties and harming businesses. “They were talking about vaccine passports and vaccine mandates, and it seemed like it was over-the top totalitarianism and control,” Wikoff said. But then he and his wife contracted COVID-19. “We were told the COVID virus was not that deadly. It was nothing more than a little flu. I can tell you it’s more than a little flu,” he said. Wikoff was sent to a hospital on the west side of Oahu but transferred to a facility in Honolulu because hospitals were at or near capacity. “I was in a bed. I can’t move; I can’t breathe,” he recalled. “I was afraid I was going to die.” Wikoff is now considering getting vaccinated because his family and doctors recommend it. “Probably getting COVID again would be more dangerous than getting the reaction from the vaccines,” he said. Wikoff said he asked the Aloha Freedom Coalition to remove his name as a member on state business registration and is warning people not to attend large protests like the ones the group staged in front of Lt. Gov. Josh Green’s home. “Before I thought Josh Green was exaggerating the situation, and after my experience he sounds very rational to me,” he said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Health care workers are exhausted and angry. COVID-19 vaccines are expiring because they have sat unused for so long. And coronavirus case numbers and deaths continue to climb, putting the state among the worst in the nation for the rate of new diagnoses. Idaho’s public health leaders painted a grim picture – again – during a weekly briefing Tuesday. The state continues to set records with 686 hospitalized COVID-19 patients as of Saturday, 180 of them in intensive care beds and 112 on ventilators, Idaho Department of Health and Welfare Dave Jeppesen said. At the moment, there is no end in sight to the surge. The entire state entered “crisis standards of care” last week, officially allowing hospitals to ration health care as needed so that scarce resources can be directed to the patients most in need and most likely to survive. Urgent surgeries have been placed on hold, some patients are being treated in lobbies or field hospitals, and hospital administrators and doctors are desperately trying to shuffle the sickest patients to any facility that has enough open beds or ventilators to treat them. Over the weekend, physicians at one hospital nearly had to face “de-allocation,” in which one patient is taken out of an ICU bed to give it to someone with a greater chance of survival, said Dr. Jim Souza with St. Luke’s Health System.\n\nIllinois\n\nBeecher: A fire destroyed a historic church in Chicago’s far southern suburbs that had appeared in the 2002 film “Road to Perdition.” Officials said nearly a dozen fire departments responded, but by the time the flames were doused, St. Paul’s Lutheran Church was in ruins. No one was injured, and the cause of the fire is under investigation. Flames swept the church Sunday afternoon as members of the congregation were enjoying an Oktoberfest celebration in the parking lot. The building dates to 1865. “Yeah, it is devastating: The 150 years of the weddings and the funerals and the baptisms and all of that are gone. But the church still stands, the people; we still have our folk and our faith,” said the Rev. Michael Stein. The closest fire hydrant was approximately a mile away, prompting an effort to shuttle roughly 91,000 gallons of water to the rural location to extinguish the flames, officials said. The church appeared in Tom Hanks’s 2002 film “Road to Perdition,” WGN-TV reports. “My grandparents are buried there. It’s really sad seeing the church like this,” Beecher resident Zachery Wehling told the station. Stein said it’s an opportunity to rebuild. “It is a dark chapter, and a sad one, and we mourn it, and we grieve it … but we still look to Christ, and we find that hope to go on,” he said.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University said it has nearly 50,000 students this fall, a record fueled by a freshman class of about 10,200. Purdue said it was surprised by an increase in out-of-state students accepted for admission. Families and students told Purdue they were impressed by the school’s response to COVID-19. “Our focuses have been encouraging everyone to be vaccinated,” said Jay Akridge, provost and executive vice president for academic affairs and diversity. “We’re up over 83% of the campus (vaccinated). And then if you’re not, get tested,” he said. “And then students have been great about masking inside. … Just as they did last year, students have been very good about following that protocol.” Purdue was expecting 8,450 freshmen but greatly exceeded that number. Total enrollment is pegged at 49,639.\n\nIowa\n\nFort Dodge: Experts say a cyberattack on a northwest Iowa grain cooperative could signal Russian-linked groups are beginning to target smaller farm businesses in rural America as bigger companies tighten their security. The cyberattack on New Cooperative, a farm services business with headquarters in Fort Dodge, comes on the heels of a ransomware attack on the giant meatpacking company JBS in late May. JBS closed at least one Iowa pork processing plant as well as all nine of its U.S. beef plants before paying hackers $11 million in ransom. Cybersecurity experts say Russian-backed ransomware group BlackMatter is demanding a $5.9 million ransom from New Cooperative. New Cooperative acknowledged Monday that it had experienced “a cybersecurity incident” affecting some of the company’s “devices and systems.” The member-owned business said it’s using “every available tool and resource to quickly restore our systems.” The cooperative said it had notified law enforcement and was working with data security experts to “investigate and remediate the situation.” New Cooperative declined to say more about the attack Tuesday. Chad Hart, an Iowa State University agriculture economist, said “size really doesn’t matter” to hackers, who “are looking for any target that they think could be valuable.”\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: An organization run by rapper Jay-Z has filed a petition seeking records from the city’s police department related to what it calls a history of officer misconduct within the agency. The request was filed Monday in Wyandotte County District Court by Team Roc, the criminal justice division of Jay-Z’s entertainment organization, Roc Nation. The filing said the department has failed for decades to hold officers accountable for misconduct, including planting evidence, fabricating witnesses, and soliciting sex from victims and witnesses, The Kansas City Star reports. “And, thanks to the blue veil of silence and apparent failure to investigate serious allegations, little of it has come to light,” according to the petition. It alleges department officials refused to provide Team Roc with complaints filed against the department’s investigative division, reports or internal investigations against an officer who has a history of abuse allegations and policies relating to supervising detectives. The department responded in a statement that it has given hundreds of pages of documents to Team Roc but that the Kansas Open Records Act does not require the release of personnel records and criminal investigation files.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A drive-by shooting at a school bus stop Wednesday morning left a 16-year-old student dead and another hospitalized, police said. A third child was injured by unknown means as the youths waited at the bus stop just west of downtown Louisville, authorities said. A person in a car drove by and shot at the waiting students, some of whom were not injured, Louisville Metro Police Maj. Shannon Lauder said during a news conference. No suspects were in custody Wednesday afternoon. Police put a photo of a dark gray Jeep SUV on social media and asked for the public’s help in finding it. The vehicle had Illinois license tags, with the plate number BD91644. Mayor Greg Fischer said the shooting – the city’s 145th homicide this year – violated a “sacred space.” Police were working with the FBI and other agencies in investigating the shooting, Chief Erika Shields said Wednesday morning. The chief suggested the shooting could be gang-related, but she said she did not believe the victim was involved with gangs. The bus stop near the city’s downtown was for students of Eastern High School. Jefferson County Schools Superintendent Marty Pollio called the incident “one of the most difficult mornings of my career.” He said support is being provided to students and teachers at the school.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Smoke and flames shot up the side of the Superdome’s roof Tuesday after a pressure washer being used to clean the roof of the sports and entertainment arena caught fire. The New Orleans Fire Department confirmed firefighters responded to flames on the building’s roof shortly after 12:30 p.m. The fire appeared under control a short time later. New Orleans Emergency Management Services said on Twitter that it was transporting one person to the hospital for “minor burns.” Emergency officials called on people to stay away from the area. Crews were power-washing the roof to prepare it to be painted, officials said. “The fire was contained to the exterior gutter system surrounding (the) Superdome, and only a small area of the roof suffered minimal damage,” said a statement from the Louisiana Stadium and Expedition District, a state board that governs the dome, and ASM Global, which manages the Superdome. “Initial assessments suggest that damage is superficial and there appears to be no structural damage or impact to the integrity of the roof’s exterior skin. The building’s outer skin and roof remain watertight.” A photo posted on the city’s emergency management Twitter feed showed firefighters in the trench that separates the Superdome roof from an outer wall as they sprayed down the fire-blackened walls.\n\nMaine\n\nLebanon: Residents will vote on whether to recall several town leaders in a flap that grew out of the select board chairman’s decision to take a farmer’s pot plants. Farmer Eric Kelley accused Select Board Chairman Charles Russell Jr. and board member Ernest “Butch” Lizotte Jr. of swiping $100,000 worth of plants, knowing that the farmer was in jail. In addition, local animal control officers took his livestock. District Attorney Kathryn Slattery confirmed there was an investigation that focused on possible theft. But there was not enough evidence to prove the charges “beyond a reasonable doubt,” she said. Anger over the marijuana episode apparently served as a tipping point for a recall effort targeting Russell, Lizotte and another person who went to the farm that night. The recall also targets a third selectman who’s accused of missing half of this year’s meetings. Russell, who grows medicinal marijuana for household use, consulted for a local pot business and helped draft town marijuana ordinances, acknowledged to the Boston Globe that he pilfered Kelley’s marijuana plants. But he said he did it because he didn’t want the plants getting “into the hands of the wrong people” while Kelley was in jail. He called it a “public safety” matter.\n\nMaryland\n\nCollege Park: National Public Radio can air audio recordings from the trial of the gunman who killed five Capital Gazette newspaper employees in 2018, a federal judge has ruled in a case challenging the state’s ban on broadcasting court proceedings. U.S. District Court Judge Richard Bennett on Tuesday permanently barred the state of Maryland from enforcing its “broadcast ban” against NPR, which intends to use audio from the trial of Capital Gazette newsroom shooter Jarrod Ramos in an upcoming episode of its “Embedded” podcast. Bennett ruled it would be unconstitutional for Maryland to ban NPR from broadcasting recordings of the jury trial for Ramos’ criminal case. NPR’s challenge to the broadcast ban was limited to its use of recordings of Ramos’ court proceedings. In July, a jury rejected defense attorneys’ mental illness arguments and found Ramos criminally responsible for killing five people at the newspaper’s office in Annapolis. Prosecutors are seeking five life sentences without the possibility of parole when Ramos is sentenced. The judge already had ruled in NPR’s favor after a hearing Sept. 13, issuing a preliminary injunction that temporarily blocked the law’s enforcement against the radio network. Tuesday’s ruling granted NPR’s request for a permanent injunction.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A group of high school students had to ride on a party bus complete with a stripper pole and neon lights during a recent field trip – an experience their teacher said highlights problems with the education system. Jim Mayers, an 11th grade Advanced Placement language and composition teacher at the Brooke Charter School in Boston, said in a since-deleted tweet that the original charter bus had fallen through, Masslive.com reports. “It is a funny story, but there actually is a real bus shortage, and it speaks to major flaws in our education system,” he said, adding that the field trip was a success. He is now using the attention he’s getting because of the original tweet to urge people to better understand educational inequities and other problems facing the nation’s schools. “I’m worried that there is too much attention being paid to the tweet itself, or simply the fact that it went viral, instead of attending to the many systemic issues that are facing not just my students, but students all across the country,” he wrote in a follow-up tweet. For example, districts across the nation are struggling to hire enough drivers to shuttle kids to school, and some states have become creative, including Massachusetts, which is enlisting National Guard members to drive school transport vans.\n\nMichigan\n\nPontiac: Plans are underway for the state to construct a first-in-the-nation segment of road that will charge electric vehicles while they’re driving, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer announced Tuesday at the Motor Bella auto show in Pontiac. Michigan’s Department of Transportation and the Office of Future Mobility and Electrification are partnering to make a 1-mile stretch of state roadway in Wayne, Oakland or Macomb counties to allow public transportation and private vehicles to charge while traveling as a part of the Inductive Vehicle Charging Pilot, according to a news release. “Michigan was home to the first mile of paved road, and now we’re paving the way for the roads of tomorrow with innovative infrastructure that will support the economy and the environment, helping us achieve our goal of carbon neutrality by 2050,” Whitmer said in the release. As electric vehicles advance, charging infrastructure has become a priority for Michigan cities that want to draw residents. The city of Saginaw got its first charging stations in September in the hope that those traveling in the east side of the state toward tourist areas in northern Michigan will stop because there is little electric vehicle infrastructure available at most destinations.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Joseph: A small crowd of local business owners and community members gathered around a gray house near downtown Tuesday morning to kick off a project that would give a house used by the Sisters of the Order of St. Benedict a new life. Armed with sledgehammers, Sisters Dorothy Manuel and Karen Streveler posed for photographs outside the house as Habitat for Humanity volunteers in blue hard hats walked around the inside, ready to begin renovating the home that the sisters donated to the organization in December. Next summer a local family will move into the house, addressing a need for affordable housing in the area. “As volunteers and family members begin the kicking out the old to make room for the new and improved, we pray for the safety of all who participate in the renovation project and that everything gets accomplished in a timely manner,” Manuel said as she led a prayer in front of the home. “May this house truly become a home for the family and a blessing for their lives.” The Genesis House was built in 1926 and purchased by the sisters in 1950. It was used to accommodate lay staff from the College of St. Benedict in the past and later to house chaplains, Streveler said. Most recently, some of the sisters lived there for the past seven years.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The authors of the state’s 1890 constitution had racist intent when they stripped voting rights from people convicted of some felonies because they chose crimes they thought were more likely to be committed by Black people, an attorney argued Wednesday in a federal appeals court. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals should overturn most of Mississippi’s felon disenfranchisement plan, attorney Donald B. Verrilli Jr. argued on behalf of people with felony convictions. The case could affect thousands who have lost voting rights. “Because the 1890 provisions were unconstitutional, they were invalid from the moment that they’re enacted,” Verrilli said. Attorneys representing the state said Mississippi dropped burglary from the list of disenfranchising crimes in 1950 and added murder and rape to the list in 1968. They said in written arguments that those changes “cured any discriminatory taint on the original provision.” The Mississippi Constitution strips voting rights from people convicted of 10 felonies, including forgery, arson and bigamy. The state attorney general issued an opinion in 2009 that expanded the list to 22 crimes, including timber larceny, carjacking, felony-level shoplifting and felony-level bad check writing.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The city’s police used force against Black people more than three times as often as on white people, according to a newly released study. The California-based, nonprofit research group Center for Policing Equity examined police report data from 2012 to 2019 and also found that in 9 out of 10 instances in which police pulled out a gun, it was at a Black civilian, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Even as the overall use of force dropped by 18%, police still used it more often against Black people, the report said. “What we typically hear from police officers is that use of force happens predominantly in areas with high crime,” said Hans Menos, vice president of law enforcement initiatives at the center. “So we try to control using neighborhood-level demographics, and even after controlling for that, the number (of Black people who have force used against them) is still higher.” Mayor Tishaura Jones said eliminating racial disparities in policing is key to making St. Louis safer for all of its residents. Outgoing Police Chief John Hayden said this kind of research can bring about scrutiny and questions about policing practices. “However, we embrace the challenge to do better and consider all suggestions from professionals, community stakeholders, and citizens,” Hayden said.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: National Guard soldiers will assist hospitals with their COVID-19 response as the state struggles with a surge in infections, Gov. Greg Gianforte announced Tuesday. A total of 70 soldiers will assist six different hospitals in Helena, Billings, Butte, Missoula and Bozeman. They will begin helping the hospitals either this weekend or next weekend, according to an announcement from the governor’s office. The Guardsmen will support staffing with nonmedical intensive care assistance, environmental services, patient data entry and coronavirus testing. Gianforte has stopped short of issuing any statewide mask or vaccine requirements even as some communities face record-high COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. “While we will not mandate them, vaccines are safe, they work, and they can save your life,” Gianforte said in a statement. The decision to mobilize the National Guard comes after Gianforte announced last week that 10 Guardsmen would begin assisting Billings Clinic, and seven additional Guardsmen would assist in the state lab. The state anticipates additional requests for Guard resources from several other hospitals, according to the governor’s office.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Lawmakers remained at a stalemate Wednesday over how to draw new congressional and legislative maps despite a looming deadline that could force them to postpone the decision until next year and delay the May primary election. Lawmakers have until Saturday to advance both measures, or else Speaker of the Legislature Mike Hilgers has promised to end their special session, forcing them to resume the debate during their next regular session in January. Delaying the new maps until next year would force state officials to reschedule the primary and create major hassles for county election officials and candidates. At issue with the maps are accusations that Republicans and Democrats are trying to draw political boundaries in ways that benefit their party. Republicans enjoy a majority in the officially nonpartisan, one-house Legislature, but they don’t have enough votes to overcome a filibuster led by Democrats and some moderate Republicans, preventing them from forcing through their preferred map. Hilgers said lawmakers have made good progress toward an agreement, and he hoped to pin down specific concerns about the maps to try to reach a compromise so that lawmakers aren’t “just talking past each other.”\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: In their first public opportunity to voice concerns on a proposal to let tech companies that meet certain requirements create semi-autonomous jurisdictions called Innovation Zones, officials from Storey County dressed down the idea in a line-by-line fashion. They called into question the motives of the company that wants to break away from its control. “While I’m sure many would prefer to have no independent government oversight, we don’t make laws based on what is convenient for just one party,” Storey County Commissioner Clay Mitchell told lawmakers Tuesday. Mitchell and other county representatives oppose a proposal backed by Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak that would allow companies that promise a $1.25 billion investment and possess at least 78 square miles of land to apply to form the Innovation Zones. The zones would be governed by three county commission-like board members – two of whom would at first be nominated by the company. They would operate outside the jurisdiction of preexisting local government and eventually could create court systems, impose taxes and make zoning decisions. The company’s proposal has been met with opposition from skeptics of overly powerful tech companies, environmentalists and local officials.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Fall visitors to the Granite State are being asked to keep their tempers in check and their trash off the ground during their leaf peeping trips this year. With interest in outdoor recreation on the rise amid the coronavirus pandemic, state tourism officials last year launched a “Leave No Trace” campaign to remind visitors not to sully the state’s natural resources. This year, they added a new message – “Don’t Take New Hampshire for Granite” – to encourage visitors to be understanding about rules and respectful of other people and property. With foliage season just beginning, officials are again reminding visitors to show courtesy to workers and the environment alike. Fall is New Hampshire’s second-busiest tourism season, and state officials expect 3.2 million visitors to spend $1.4 billion this year, nearly back to pre-pandemic levels. Businesses still are struggling with workforce shortages and supply chain delays, said Mike Somers, president of the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association. That, in turn, has led to an increase in rude and abusive customer behavior. “We’re really asking folks to plan ahead and have a little bit of patience and understanding,” he said. “Just call ahead, find out what the hours of operation are, and please don’t get upset if we’re not open until 11 o’clock at night.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Liquor stores, bars and restaurants are all having trouble stocking their shelves with enough wines, beers and spirits, thanks to COVID-19’s impact on supplies, along with heat waves and frosts that damaged crops. “It’s not just one thing that’s causing the liquor shortage,” said Joe Ringwood, manager of Super Cellars, a fine wine and spirits shop in Ridgewood. It’s a shortage of truck drivers, a scarcity of aluminum, a shutdown of factories, a dearth of containers, extreme weather, tariffs or a lack thereof, and even the greater demand by consumers for premium liquor. “Some of it is directly related to the pandemic,” Ringwood said. “But not all of it.” And it’s not just one category of liquor that’s gone missing. What is in short supply seems to change from month to month, if not week to week. Last year, liquor store owners said, they had trouble getting canned beers, amid a shortage of aluminum. Today, bottled beers and top-shelf tequilas are in particularly short supply. “Every week it’s something else,” said Kathy Mahon, bar manager for Park West Tavern in Ridgewood. Paul Santelle, executive director of the New Jersey Liquor Store Alliance and owner of Garden State Discount Liquors in Perth Amboy, said he has begun to ration over a hundred items so more people will be able to enjoy them.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A coalition of Native American communities has unveiled its proposal for redrawing the state’s political map to boost Indigenous voters’ influence in elections. The proposed changes from New Mexico’s 19 Native American pueblos and the Jicarilla Apache Nation, outlined Monday, would reshape a congressional swing district where Republicans regained control in 2020. They would also bolster Native American majorities among eligible voters in six state House and three Senate districts in northwestern New Mexico. The proposals were submitted to a committee that will provide recommendations to the Legislature at the end of October. The Democrat-led Legislature can draw its own lines. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham must approve the redistricting, and court challenges are possible. New Mexico is home to 23 federally recognized tribes, and the share of New Mexicans who identify themselves as Indigenous by race or by combined ancestry is 12.4%. Four Indigenous tribes have joined together for the first time to form a stronger voting bloc within one Senate district that might unite Acoma, Laguna, Isleta and Zuni pueblos. Other proposed changes would split the Mescalero Apache reservation between two congressional districts, in hopes of expanding that tribe’s voice in Congress.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Four members of Congress from New York demanded the release of inmates and closure of New York City’s troubled Rikers Island jail complex after another inmate was reported dead at the facility. Democratic Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Jerry Nadler, Jamaal Bowman and Nydia Velazquez called conditions at the jail “deplorable and nothing short of a humanitarian crisis,” in a letter Tuesday to Gov. Kathy Hochul and Mayor Bill de Blasio. The demand followed the 11th death reported at Rikers Island this year. The city’s Department of Correction said an inmate died Sunday at the jail after reporting he did not feel well and was taken to the infirmary. His death came on the heels of both Hochul and de Blasio announcing plans to try to improve conditions at Rikers Island, where long-standing troubles were exacerbated amid the pandemic. The House members said the jail has failed to provide inmates with basic services and protection against the spread of COVID-19, and lawmakers on a recent visit to the facility found conditions that were “life-threatening and horrific.” They reported overflowing toilets and floors covered in dead cockroaches, feces and rotting food. State Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas said inmates told her they felt like they were being treated like slaves and animals.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: People attending the 2021 N.C. State Fair won’t be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19, but it’s strongly encouraged, officials said. Also, those going to the fair, which begins Oct. 14, will be required to use clear plastic bags upon entering, and officials say there will be no indoor concerts at this year’s event – a decision they said has nothing to do with the pandemic. A statement from fair officials said any size or type of clear bag is acceptable. Wristlets, diaper bags and medical equipment bags will be accepted at the fair even if they are not clear, but they will require additional inspection. In addition, officials said there will be no concerts inside Dorton Arena. That room will be reserved for vendors. “Moving the vendors, displays and cheesemakers into Dorton Arena will offer a larger space to include more vendors and provide more space for consumers to sample featured products and shop for their favorites,” state Agriculture Commissioner Steve Troxler said in a statement.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The head of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is asking a federal agency overseeing the environmental review of the Dakota Access oil pipeline to cut ties with a contractor conducting the analysis, citing a conflict of interest. Chairman Mike Faith and other tribal leaders fighting the pipeline sent a letter Wednesday to a top U.S. Army Corps of Engineers official, taking issue with Environmental Resources Management, the company doing the review, and its ties to the oil industry, the Bismarck Tribune reports. One of the tribes’ concerns is that the London-based company is a member of the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group that lobbies for the oil industry and has submitted court briefs supporting Dakota Access. Meanwhile, the company that operates the Dakota Access pipeline has asked the U.S. Supreme Court to reverse an appellate ruling ordering additional environmental review, saying it puts the line at risk of being shut down. Texas-based Energy Transfer operates the $3.8 billion, 1,172-mile pipeline. Faith said in a statement that the request by the pipeline operator “is part of an ongoing attempt to “evade accountability.” The pipeline began operating in 2017, after being the subject of months of protests during its construction.\n\nOhio\n\nDayton: The city plans to demolish the 129-year-old historic building that once was the site of the Wright brothers’ first bike shop because the building has deteriorated to a point where it can no longer be maintained and redeveloped. The shop was first built in 1892 to serve as the Wrights’ first bike shop. Soon thereafter, Gem City Ice Cream Co. bought the property and was housed there until it closed in 1975, when the building was sold to another company, the Dayton Daily News reports. Years after a wide array of owners, the city attempted to sell the rundown property to developers, but it failed inspection tests. The building was deemed structurally damaged and in danger of collapse. City officials also attempted to receive approval to bulldoze the property but did not move forward after hearing community concerns, Daytons Landmark Commission staff report said. But multiple inspections in 2019 concluded the building can’t be saved. City staff and nuisance abatement specialists said the building needs to be removed, the report said. This isn’t the first of the Wright brothers’ bike shops to be torn down in Ohio. Their second and third bike shops were torn down, but the fourth is a national historic site in the Wright Dunbar District, according to the newspaper.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Efforts to control feral swine eating their way across fields might seem as futile as trying to catch a greased pig – the hogs are known to destroy crops and land for farmers, who say the animals aren’t picky eaters and will consume just about anything they find growing. But an influx in federal dollars creating pilot eradication projects across broad areas of the state and a new pesticide introduced this month are making the fight just a little more fair for farmers, ranchers and regulators. The two feral swine control pilot projects, paid for by about $3.6 million in federal dollars allocated through the 2018 Farm Act, have combined tracking efforts with hunting and trapping activities across multiple counties in northern and southwestern Oklahoma to blunt swine activity in those areas. The manufacturer of the new pesticide, called HogStop, claims it can decrease the fertility of male swine and help cut rapid reproduction rates for the animal. It was approved for use by the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food & Forestry this month. Any and all tools to fight the infestation are welcome, as feral swine damage across the state has cost landowners hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A broken power-sharing deal, the lingering possibility of a Republican walkout and a COVID-19 case are adding greater uncertainty to whether legislators will successfully redraw the state’s political districts ahead of a tight deadline. Stakes are high as Oregon gained a new, sixth U.S. House seat following the latest census. Lawmakers were told the House would reconvene Wednesday following news Tuesday that someone in the building had tested positive for the coronavirus. But House Speaker Tina Kotek now says the chamber won’t convene until Saturday to give time for those potentially exposed to the virus to be tested and receive results. Democrats say their entire caucus in the House has been vaccinated. The number of vaccinated Republican lawmakers was not immediately available. When the House reconvenes Saturday, lawmakers will have just two days to vote on and pass new political boundaries. If congressional maps are not passed by Sept. 27, the task will fall to a panel of five retired judges appointed by the Oregon Supreme Court. House Republicans showed signs of a possible walkout this week after Kotek, a Democrat, rescinded a power-sharing deal to redraw political maps that she made with the House GOP as Republicans used delaying tactics to block bills during the 2021 legislative session.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state Supreme Court is saying yes to canines in the courtroom, under certain conditions. A trial witness may be accompanied by a “comfort dog” if the animal will help yield reliable, complete and truthful testimony, the justices ruled Wednesday in a precedent-setting opinion that established a “balancing test” for Pennsylvania judges confronted with such a request. Ruling unanimously in a murder case, the Supreme Court pointed to other states that allow witnesses to testify with the help of emotional support dogs. The justices said it’s permissible, as long as steps are taken to minimize any potential harm to a defendant. “Trial courts have the discretion to permit a witness to testify with the assistance of a comfort dog,” Chief Justice Max Baer wrote for the court. “In exercising that discretion, courts should balance the degree to which the accommodation will assist the witness in testifying in a truthful manner against any possible prejudice to the defendant’s right to a fair trial.” The defendant, Sheron Purnell, was convicted of third-degree murder and sentenced to up to 47 years in prison. Purnell’s lawyers argued a judge abused his discretion by allowing a comfort dog to accompany a teenage witness who testified against Purnell, with the defense saying that would “generate sympathy” among jurors for the girl.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Health officials are allowing a little leeway to a state mandate that requires health care workers to receive a COVID-19 vaccine by Oct. 1. State Department of Health Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott announced Tuesday that unvaccinated workers will be allowed to continue working beyond that date if their absence would jeopardize quality of care at a facility. “If there is a risk to quality of care and an unvaccinated worker must continue to work beyond October 1 to mitigate that risk, the employer has 30 days to ensure that role is fulfilled by a fully vaccinated health care worker,” she said in a statement. The change was made to “safeguard patients, residents, and staff by holding health professionals and facilities accountable to the October 1 vaccination requirement, while also preventing disruptions to care in Rhode Island as health care facilities work toward full compliance,” she said. According to the latest state survey, 87% of health care workers in Rhode Island are vaccinated. Many of the state’s nursing homes had expressed concern about the Oct. 1 deadline, saying it would put additional strain on facilities already struggling with staffing shortages.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A tent has been pitched at Prisma Health’s Greer Memorial Hospital to provide additional triage and treatment space, according to a spokesperson for the health system. The 40-by-80-foot tent was erected over the weekend by the South Carolina State Guard but has not yet been activated to provide treatment, according to a statement from a representative of the health system. Prisma spokesperson Sandy Dees said the tent is part of efforts at Prisma emergency departments in the Upstate to “proactively ‘surge up’ and create additional space to treat patients as needed.” Prisma did not respond to a question about the occupancy of its hospital in Greer. “We’re here to take care of our communities and that means taking the necessary steps to ensure we’re ready when and if those additional resources are needed,” Dr. Matthew Bitner, chair of emergency medicine at Prisma Health in the Upstate, said in the statement. “From a traditional ‘all-hazards’ approach, we are preparing not only for COVID patients but also the everyday emergencies such as trauma, heart attack, strokes, illness and injuries.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The nation’s largest domestic hunger-relief organization projects more children will go hungry in South Dakota this year and won’t know where their next meal is coming from. Feeding America said the state’s child food insecurity rate for 2021 will be 16.3%, up from 15.3% in 2019. The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines food insecurity as reduced food intake, disruptive eating, and decreased quality and variety in diets. The USDA recently reported a national trend of increasing food insecurity, which rose to 14.8% in 2020. “I think it is really concerning,” said Lisa Davis, senior vice president of the No Kid Hungry campaign, a national initiative to end child hunger. “Children who face hunger generally have worse health impacts on their physical and brain development. … They don’t do well in school, they graduate at lower rates, and those consequences for kids literally last a lifetime.” Before the coronavirus pandemic, food insecurity was at its lowest rate since USDA started tracking it in the late 1990s. But the pandemic has had a disproportionate impact on food access to households with young children, households of children headed by single women, and households of color, specifically Black and Hispanic, Davis said.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State officials are asking the public to pick their favorite of four redesign options for new license plates that will be available starting in January. Gov. Bill Lee’s office said voting began Monday and runs through Sept. 27 at tn.gov/ratetheplates. The new design will replace the current plate that launched in 2006, with modifications in 2011, 2016 and 2017. State law includes a redesign every eight years if lawmakers approve funding for it. Tennessee law also requires the words “Tennessee,” “Volunteer State” and “TNvacation.com” to be on the plate, and it lets Tennesseans pick an “In God We Trust” option. The winning design of the primarily white and deep-blue options will be announced in the fall.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: After serving as interim police chief for the capital city since March, Joseph Chacon was named Wednesday as the permanent choice for the top spot. City Manager Spencer Cronk announced the appointment of Chacon, whose career with Austin police has spanned more than 20 years, after a nationwide search for a new chief. Chacon has been interim police chief since the retirement of former Chief Brian Manley amid a reckoning over racial injustice and use of force in law enforcement. Chacon, who served as assistant chief in Austin for almost five years before being named interim chief, said he was “extremely excited and humbled” by the opportunity. Chacon’s appointment must still be confirmed by the City Council, which is set to place an item on the appointment on next week’s agenda. Manley, chosen to lead the department in 2018, had been at the center of ongoing criticism following a fatal police shooting in April 2020 of a man driving away from officers and controversial uses of force by officers during protests over the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis in May 2020.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints announced Wednesday that masks will be required inside temples to limit the spread of COVID-19. Church leaders said in a statement that masks will be required temporarily in an effort to keep temples open. The message was the latest in a series of statements from church leaders encouraging masking and vaccination efforts against COVID-19. “As cases of COVID-19 increase in many areas, we want to do everything possible to allow temples to remain open,” the church said in a statement. “Therefore, effective immediately, all temple patrons and workers are asked to wear face masks at all times while in the temple.” In Utah, where the church is based, a summer surge of the coronavirus among unvaccinated residents has continued to grow, while vaccination rates have slightly increased. Data from the Utah Health Department showed that in the past 28 days, state residents who are unvaccinated have been 5.9 times more likely to die from COVID-19 and 7.2 times more likely to be hospitalized than those who are vaccinated. About 64% of Utah residents ages 12 and older were fully vaccinated as of Tuesday, state data shows. Utah reported 25 new deaths from COVID-19, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 2,829.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont State Police has its first director of mental health programs to help coordinate and oversee the delivery of mental health services to people who come into contact with state police, officials said. Mourning Fox, who was deputy commissioner of the Vermont Department of Mental Health for the past four years and has more than 25 years of experience in the field, was named to the position, the Department of Public Safety and state police announced. “This is a crucial position within the Department of Public Safety and for the Vermont public safety community as we pursue short-, medium- and long-term goals with respect to mental health response and reimagining policing and safety services,” DPS Commissioner Michael Schirling said in a statement. Fox, who joined the department Aug. 30, will work with the state police’s 10 barracks and the Department of Mental Health to complete hiring. He will also ensure that each field station has at least one embedded mental health crisis specialist and that training is consistent, officials said. In the long term, he’ll help the Public Safety Department reimagine how police provide services to people who may be experiencing a mental health or substance use disorder crisis or have other unmet social service needs, officials said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A year and a half into the coronavirus pandemic, the Virginia Employment Commission is still swamped with backlogged claims, its call centers are underperforming, and serious staffing problems persist, according to a scathing interim report the state’s legislative watchdog agency presented to lawmakers Monday. The agency’s staff undertook its review after the employment commission came under harsh scrutiny from lawmakers and the public for what by some measures is a worst-in-the-nation response to the surge in jobless claims. Thousands of Virginians have faced lengthy delays while waiting for benefits, and many have been unable to reach anyone for help or information about their case. “While operating in the extremely challenging public health environment created by COVID was understandably difficult … meaningful actions could have been taken sooner to respond to the public’s needs,” said Hal Greer, director of the Joint Legislative Audit and Review Commission. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s secretary of labor, Megan Healy, oversees the employment commission and defended its performance. Although she agreed the agency was not prepared for the pandemic, she argued to lawmakers that the root of the problem was a complicated federal funding formula that has long left the agency starved for resources.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Three new buildings with 165 studio apartments that were supposed to be rented at market rates will instead house people leaving homelessness and people at risk of becoming homeless. The nonprofit Low Income Housing Institute will buy the buildings on Capitol Hill for about $50 million, with city and state housing programs sharing the cost equally, The Seattle Times reports. Seattle is using federal COVID-19 relief funds for its part, Mayor Jenny Durkan said. Two of the buildings will be managed by LIHI for adults. The third will be managed by YouthCare for young adults. Each will have a live-in case worker, said Sharon Lee, LIHI’s executive director. The deals will house people quickly and cheaply, relative to the time and cost required to develop low-income projects from scratch, Durkan said. The three buildings should be occupied by the end of the year, according to the city. “This is the fastest we have ever brought housing online,” Lee said. Tent encampments in parks and greenbelts have grown in Seattle during the coronavirus pandemic partly because the city has lacked shelter and housing spots, Durkan said. LIHI will move people into the buildings from tiny house villages it manages for the city, which should open more of those houses for people living on the streets, Lee said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nLewisburg: Gov. Jim Justice has withdrawn from consideration as the coach of a boys basketball team at a high school where he already is the girls coach and where he’d already faced rejection for the job. In a letter to the Greenbrier Board of Education on Tuesday, Justice asked that a boys coach be named soon at Greenbrier East High School, with practices for the 2021-22 season starting in a month. Last month the board rejected a motion to hire Justice as boys coach. The board is looking to replace former NBA player Bimbo Coles, who resigned in July. “We need to move forward,” Justice said. “Pick a coach. The kids deserve that, and I wish them all the success.” Justice served as the boys coach from 2010 to 2017, his first year as governor. He has coached the girls team since 2000, winning a state championship in 2012. Justice’s second term as governor runs through 2024.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Workers reinstalled two statues Tuesday on the state Capitol grounds that protesters ripped down during a demonstration last year in the wake of George Floyd’s death. Workers reinstalled a 9-foot-6-inch statue of Wisconsin abolitionist Col. Hans Christian Heg as well as a 7-foot statue of a woman symbolizing the state’s “Forward” motto. The statues have no associated racist history, but protesters said they represented a false narrative that Wisconsin supports Black people and racial equity. Demonstrators toppled both statues in June 2020, breaking off Heg’s leg and head. The “Forward” statue was dented and one of its fingers broken off. The demonstration was among several that shook downtown Madison in the days after Floyd’s death in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. Floyd, who was Black and handcuffed, died after white police Officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes. Heg, a Norwegian immigrant who became an outspoken abolitionist, served in the 15th Wisconsin Regiment during the Civil War. He was killed at the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863. His statue, funded by the Norwegian Society of America, had stood outside the Capitol since 1926. The “Forward” statue was a bronze replica of the one that represented Wisconsin at the 1893 World’s Columbian Exposition in Chicago.\n\nWyoming\n\nYellowstone National Park: Rescue crews recovered the body of a 67-year-old man and searched around a lake Tuesday for his half-brother after the pair failed to return from a backcountry canoe trip. A 10-person ground crew was walking the shoreline of Shoshone Lake looking for Kim Crumbo, a 74-year-old former Navy SEAL from Ogden, Utah, Yellowstone officials said. A helicopter from nearby Grand Teton National Park was helping in the effort. Rescuers found the body of Mark O’Neill of Chimacum, Washington, on Monday along the eastern shore, where a canoe, paddle, flotation device and other items were found Sunday. A vacant campsite was found on the south side of the lake. A family member reported the two experienced boaters and former National Park Service employees overdue from their four-night trip Sunday. Shoshone Lake covers 13 square miles and has an average temperature of about 48 degrees Fahrenheit, with survival time estimated to be only 20 to 30 minutes in such cold water, officials said. The lake also can be subject to high winds and sudden storms. Drowning is one of the top causes of death in Yellowstone, behind car and snowmobile accidents and illness, park historian Lee Whittlesey wrote in his book “Death in Yellowstone.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/06/gritty-tick-confusion-barbecues-back-news-around-states/115970016/", "title": "Gritty, tick confusion: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The Montgomery County Commission voted Tuesday to make the use of face masks in county-owned buildings optional, effective immediately. “Commissioners are strongly encouraging the public and employees to exercise personal responsibility and continue to wash hands, practice physical distancing, and wear masks when appropriate,” County Commission spokeswoman Hannah Hawk said in a release announcing the decision. A municipal mandate remains in place through Sunday that requires the use of masks in most public situations. Many major retail outlets, grocery stores and entertainment venues still require anyone who enters to wear a face mask. A spokesman for one of the area’s largest employers, Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama, also confirmed Tuesday that its workers still will be required to wear masks “for the foreseeable future.” The county required masks to be worn by employees and visitors in all county facilities for nearly a month after the state stopped requiring them April 9. Gov. Kay Ivey announced Monday that the current statewide public health order will end May 31 and that Alabama’s state of emergency will end July 6. Nearly 11,000 Alabamians have died from COVID-19 since Ivey first declared the state of emergency March 13, 2020.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Communities across the state have launched a campaign to boost vaccination rates by 25% this month, state health officials said. The Sleeves Up for Summer effort will include events planned jointly by business, health care and community groups to encourage more residents to get a COVID-19 shot and help Alaska move toward herd immunity. Toolkits for communities are available on an Alaska Department of Health and Human Services website, along with information on each borough’s progress toward its vaccination goal. “Vaccination is a choice, and it will not be mandated by the state, but I hope you consider it,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy said, according to the department. “I’m getting the vaccine because I want to help Alaska businesses get back to work and to doing all the things we love to do as Alaskans.” Those who want to volunteer for Sleeves Up for Summer can also sign up online.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Fewer children died from being left in a hot car in 2020, experts say, as a result of the pandemic keeping many people at home. The number of children who died trapped in hot cars dropped by more than half nationwide, from 53 in 2019 to 25 in 2020, according to Kids and Car Safety, a nonprofit dedicated to keeping children and pets safe in vehicles. There were 54 cases in 2018. The only child hot-car death in Arizona in 2020 was of a 3-year-old who got into her mother’s car in a parking lot by herself Aug. 30, 2020. In 2019, there were four hot-car cases in Arizona; all were children unknowingly left in a car. The drastic decrease last year was directly related to the fact that families were sheltering in place at home and working remotely, Kids and Car Safety Director Amber Rollins said in an email. The majority of cases happen when a child was supposed to have been dropped off at day care, she said. “With children staying home with their families, we saw very few cases like this last year,” Rollins said. Among the 25 child hot-car deaths in 2020 nationwide, seven children were unknowingly left in cars. On the other hand, 31 children were unknowingly left in hot cars among the 53 in 2019, according to Kids and Cars. The other cases involved unclear circumstances or parents who might have known.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Tuesday set a goal to have half of the state’s population at least partially vaccinated against COVID-19 within the next three months. The Republican governor set the goal as the state continues to lag most of the country in vaccinations and as President Joe Biden has set a goal to have shots delivered to 70% of adult Americans by July 4. Hutchinson’s goal will require more than 467,000 Arkansans to get shots by early August. “This is a big challenge for us,” he said at his weekly briefing on the coronavirus. Health officials announced a series of “pop-up” clinics they’re holding around the state in the coming weeks to offer the vaccine to help reach that goal. They include one at the Arkansas Travelers minor league baseball game in North Little Rock on Tuesday and at several high school graduation ceremonies planned at War Memorial Stadium in Little Rock this month. Other clinics are planned at events around the state, including at festivals, farmer’s markets and car shows. Nearly 36% of the state’s population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine so far, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: Tourism leaders are urging residents to spend their pent-up travel dollars exploring their home state, as coronavirus case numbers stay low and as the industry reels from a 55% decline in revenue. The state of nearly 40 million people has been among the most conservative in the U.S. with tight restrictions in place to curb the pandemic. Now, California has the lowest infection rate in the country, and on Tuesday, Los Angeles and San Francisco received permission from the state to reopen bars, restaurants, museums and businesses more broadly. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat who faces a recall election this year due in part to his handling of the pandemic, announced that the state is on track to fully reopen its economy in mid-June. As vaccination numbers rise, more people are booking trips to favorite sites such as Northern California wine country, the Santa Barbara coast and Disneyland, which reopened last week after an unprecedented 13-month closure. Tourism revenue in the state plummeted from $145 billion in 2019 to $65 billion last year. The figure is not expected to top pre-pandemic levels until 2024 as international travelers stay away for now, said Caroline Beteta, president and CEO of Visit California, the nonprofit that markets the state.\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: Aims Community College will offer free tuition for the summer semester to Colorado residents living within the Aims tax district with the hope of helping the “community recover from the economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.” “The past year has been tough financially for many people, and our hope is to relieve some of the financial burden for current and new students as they work toward their educational goals,” Aims President Leah Bornstein said in a press release. The offer is available to newcomers, currently enrolled students, and those who took a break during the pandemic but are looking to return to school. Students who qualify will receive the discount when registering for classes; the discount applies to classes at all Aims campuses and online. There is a maximum discount per credit, students cannot take more than 15 credits during the summer semester, and they will still be responsible for paying all fees, according to the Aims website. The college is using institutional funds to cover the cost, and summer classes begin June 1.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: The tick population is increasing this season, due to a variety of factors that include shorter, warmer winters and longer, wetter springs and summers, experts say. The state counted more than double the number of ticks through April 30 that it did last year, the New Haven Register reports. “This is when they come,” Dr. Zane Saul, chief of infectious diseases at Bridgeport Hospital, told the newspaper. “They start late April/early May. The ticks are out there, and people are starting to do lawn work and work in the garden.” The increase includes some new species, including the Lone Star tick, Asian longhorned tick and Gulf Coast tick. These newer ticks can transmit a variety of illnesses and cause other medical conditions; the Lone Star tick has been found to cause a meat allergy in some people, according to Goudarz Molaei, research scientist and director of the passive tick surveillance program at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. Adding to the challenge is that tick-borne illnesses can have symptoms resembling those of COVID-19, leading to some confusion over the source of the symptoms. Ticks are parasitic insects that feed on humans and other species and carry a variety of illnesses, including Lyme disease, that can cause fever, headaches and body aches.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Democratic Gov. John Carney is easing most of the capacity limits he imposed on businesses in an effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Carney announced Tuesday that all capacity restrictions inside restaurants, retail and other business establishments, as well as houses of worship, will be lifted effective May 21. Officials said facilities will be able to use as much capacity as social distancing requirements allow, but masks will still be required indoors. Social distancing requirements will halved from 6 feet to 3 feet. However, gatherings of more than 250 people, whether indoors or outdoors, will still require approval from the Division of Public Health. DPH may also require masks for crowded venues and large gatherings including concerts and sporting events. Officials also said customers must continue to remain seated indoors and outdoors at bars and restaurants, unless DPH approves a plan for dance floors and other areas.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Setting foot in a restaurant for his first time as president, Joe Biden made a Cinco de Mayo taco and enchilada run to highlight his administration’s $28.6 billion program to help eateries that lost business because of the coronavirus pandemic. The president went to Taqueria Las Gemelas on Wednesday and ordered lunch. The D.C. restaurant, owned in part by Mexican immigrants, was a beneficiary of a pilot version of the restaurant relief program. It went from 55 employees to seven during the pandemic, though it was able to rehire some workers through the Paycheck Protection Program that predates the Biden administration. “The restaurant industry was so badly hurt nationwide,” Biden said Wednesday, the anniversary of Mexico’s victory over French forces at the Battle of Puebla, on May 5, 1862. The White House said 186,200 restaurants, bars and other eligible businesses had applied for the program over its first two days of accepting applications. More than half of the applicants are owned by women, veterans or people from historically disadvantaged backgrounds. The aid for eateries was part of the Biden administration’s broader $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis expects to reinstate a requirement later this month that people in the unemployment system submit weekly “work search” updates. Referring to some businesses saying they are unable to find new employees as they regroup from the pandemic, DeSantis said Wednesday that unemployment claimants will likely have to start showing how they looked for work once an executive order waiving a work-search requirement ends May 29. “We suspended that last year at this time because, quite frankly, there weren’t jobs,” DeSantis said at the Satellite Beach Police Department. Florida’s unemployment rate stood at 4.7% in March, with 475,000 people out of work from a workforce of 10.17 million. The rate was 13.8% in April 2020, after the pandemic forced businesses to shut down or dramatically scale back. “I think now we’re in just a different situation. You have a surplus of jobs, particularly in restaurant, lodging, hospitality, that people want to hire,” the Republican governor said. “I mean, you see the signs all over the place. Look, that’s a good problem to have. But we also just want to make sure, like, look, if you’re really unemployed, can’t get a job, that’s one thing. But making sure that you’re doing your due diligence to look for work, and making sure those incentives align, better.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: As part of a return to normal operations, graduates can sit on the field for University of Georgia spring commencement ceremonies, officials announced Saturday. UGA said that due to a change in state COVID-19 regulations, plans for spring graduation have adapted. If they choose, graduates can sit on Dooley Field during the ceremony. Before, it was required that they sit in the stands with their guests. There will also be no limit to the number of guests in the stands, a change from previous restrictions. Masks will be “strongly encouraged.” In February, UGA President Jere W. Morehead announced that the university would hold its graduation ceremony in person with pandemic restrictions in place. Maria Taylor, ESPN reporter and UGA graduate, will be the commencement speaker. Commencement will begin May 13 and end May 15, taking place in Sanford Stadium, and will be held over four ceremonies to comply with social distancing guidelines. Three of these will be for undergraduate students and the fourth for master’s, specialist and doctoral degrees. For those who can not attend the ceremony, a livestream will be available on the UGA commencement website.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Gov. David Ige hasn’t ruled out mandating COVID-19 vaccines for state workers, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. He said in an interview Monday that he’s considered the requirement, noting it would mirror less controversial mandates for students to be vaccinated against diseases like measles and chickenpox, but he has no definitive plans to impose such a rule during the current pandemic. “We’ll consider it, depending on … the virus activity we see in the general population once we get to herd immunity,” the Democratic governor told the paper. He said it’s too early to tell if a mandate would be effective or how well the available COVID-19 shots work in the long term.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lawmakers in the state House who are concerned they could be left out again in spending what could be a billion dollars in federal coronavirus rescue money approved legislation Tuesday to prevent that from happening. The House voted 56-9 to send to the Senate the measure preventing Republican Gov. Brad Little from spending federal relief money without lawmakers’ involvement. The bill changes Idaho law so that federal money not already accounted for that is coming to the state the rest of the year can’t be spent without lawmakers signing off. Lawmakers say they should have had a say in spending the $1.25 billion in relief money that Idaho received early last year. Little formed a committee last year that included the Republican co-chairs of the Legislature’s powerful budget committee as well as a Democrat. The committee provided guidance to Little while allowing him to respond quickly to a fast-changing health crisis. The new legislation would not allow that type of system if President Joe Biden and Congress approve additional relief money for the state this year. A House committee introduced the legislation a few hours before the House vote, fast-tracking the bill as lawmakers rush to wrap up the session this week.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Standing in the massive convention center that was turned into a COVID-19 field hospital almost a year ago, the mayor and governor announced Tuesday that the facility will again host the famed Chicago Auto Show in July. After weeks of announcements about allowing limited numbers of fans into sports stadiums, diners into restaurants and students into schools, the announcement was the strongest signal yet that Chicago has turned a corner in the battle against the deadly virus. “I think everyone is really excited about this announcement because of what it represents,” a smiling Mayor Lori Lightfoot said during a news conference at McCormick Place. “This is setting the stage for the return of big events in the months to come,” agreed Gov. J.B. Pritzker. And while Lightfoot and Pritzker were careful not to make any promises, they both sounded confident that the auto show that has been held for more than a century would be one of many events to return this year. “Our goal is to be fully open by July 4,” the mayor said, adding that this summer in Chicago will more resemble the summer of 2019 than 2020, when the virus swept through the city and forced a national shutdown.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s rate of COVID-19 vaccination shots has remained sluggish in recent weeks, while coronavirus-related hospitalizations have slowly climbed to their highest number since February. State health department statistics updated Wednesday show that about 2 million people have been fully vaccinated in Indiana, or about 37% of those ages 16 and older. Indiana’s vaccination rate has remained at about 40,000 people a day over the past three weeks. That is down from the state’s peak of more than 50,000 a day in early April. State health officials have said they are worried about increased risk from more contagious coronavirus variants at a time when so many people aren’t immunized. The health department’s weekly tracking map updated Wednesday showed four of the five Indiana counties that border Michigan continue to show moderate risk of COVID-19 spread. Those counties have orange risk ratings – the second highest of the four ratings. Most other northern Indiana counties have the next-highest yellow rating. Indiana officials have been watching those northern counties because Michigan continues to have the country’s highest infection rate. Indiana hospitals, meanwhile, reported treating just more than 1,000 coronavirus patients as of Tuesday. That is up about 85% since mid-March.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A third coronavirus variant that was first identified in hard-hit India has been uncovered in the state, public health officials said Tuesday. The Iowa Department of Public Health said it has confirmed two cases of the variant, SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617. Health officials are still learning about the characteristics of this strain, but it is not designated as a variant of concern, “indicating that there is not currently evidence of increased transmissibility or more severe disease caused by this variant,” the agency said in a statement, noting the recent U.S. advisory warning against travel to the South Asian nation. Virus cases are rising quickly in India, where COVID-19 deaths have exceeded 220,000, and confirmed cases have surpassed 20 million. The World Health Organization said in an April 26 coronavirus update that a preliminary study based on genetic sequencing shows the variant has a higher growth rate than other variants circulating in India, “suggesting potential increased transmissibility.” The agency said further study is urgently needed to determine its potential for increased spread and more severe disease. The Iowa cases were detected in two adults in Jefferson County in southeast Iowa. Public health officials are investigating to determine where they were exposed to the virus strain.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Republican state lawmakers advanced a plan Tuesday to provide hundreds of millions of dollars to businesses hurt by coronavirus pandemic restrictions, and they’re poised to give GOP leaders the final say over how the federal COVID-19 relief funds are spent. The Republican-controlled state Senate approved, 26-13, a bill that would dedicate nearly $350 million in coronavirus relief funds for the state and another $350 million for cities and counties to compensate small businesses that were forced to shut down last spring because of the pandemic or had their operations restricted after the economy reopened. GOP legislators have been considering different figures for the total relief, and the Senate began its discussion at $2 billion but reduced it after Vice President Rick Wilborn, R-McPherson, called that number “probably a little rich.” Senators also passed, 33-6, another measure that would provide rebates of up to $7,500 from cities and counties to businesses for the property taxes they paid while they were shut down or their activities were limited. Those taxes are based on property values, not income, so they were owed whether or not a business was open. The two business-relief bills go next to the Republican-controlled House. Lawmakers hope to wrap up the year’s business by week’s end.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Some of the state’s most prominent leaders can start warming up their best zingers, as political speeches will resume at the Fancy Farm picnic after a one-year hiatus caused by COVID-19. Organizers confirmed Monday that the picnic and speeches are on for this year. Bob Babbage, a former Kentucky secretary of state and auditor, will be emcee of the political speaking, a rite of passage for statewide candidates in the Bluegrass State. The picnic – also known for its barbecue – is set for Aug. 7 in the far western Kentucky community of Fancy Farm. Last year’s picnic was scaled back and the political speeches canceled amid the coronavirus pandemic. With more people getting the COVID-19 vaccine, “we feel comfortable of having a traditional picnic this year,” said Steven Elder, chairman of the picnic’s political speaking. “Seeing the (Kentucky) Derby on Saturday, that was a blessing to any Kentuckian,” he said in a phone interview. “And knowing that we are preparing and planning for the Fancy Farm picnic is just another. It’s a normal return to life.” The picnic’s political speaking is the traditional start of the fall campaign season in Kentucky. This is a nonelection year, but attention is already turning to next year’s U.S. Senate race and the 2023 campaign for governor.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State agencies and public colleges would be unable to require COVID-19 vaccines for entry into their facilities if House lawmakers agree to a bill that won overwhelming support Tuesday from the Senate. Senators voted 28-9 for the proposal by Sen. Stewart Cathey, R-Monroe. The measure would prohibit a person from being denied access to any state-owned, state-financed or state-operated facility based on whether that person has been vaccinated against the illness caused by the coronavirus. The Senate spent little time debating the bill Tuesday. It heads next to the House for consideration.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s tourism industry saw visitation drop by about 27% last year during the pandemic, but the impact wasn’t as dire as some feared. A late-summer boost in travel made up for some of the lost ground early in the pandemic, preventing the tourism season from being a total bust. Total spending on restaurants, lodging, shopping and other activities fell to about $4.8 billion, according to the Maine Office of Tourism. The total economic impact dipped to about $9 billion from more than $12 billion the year before, the tourism office reported. Gov. Janet Mills praised the work of health officials and business leaders for pandemic precautions that set the state up for a late-season surge in tourists, the Portland Press Herald reports. The state’s reputation as a safe place helped draw visitors, she said. “You committed to following public safety and health precautions and attended trainings to slow the spread of the virus and keep our visitors, staff and public safe. The innovation and ingenuity of this industry embodied the very essence of this state,” Mills said. Unlike last summer, the state has lifted testing and quarantine requirements for people coming to the state. Occupancy restrictions will grow to 75% indoors and 100% outdoors later this month.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Gov. Larry Hogan announced steps Tuesday to encourage nursing home residents and staff to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Hogan said the state is launching a new data dashboard to show vaccination rates at each of the state’s skilled nursing facilities. An order has been issued to require the data to be reported weekly and posted inside facilities in plain view, Hogan said. The dashboard said 77% of residents in skilled nursing facilities had been vaccinated as of Monday, and 63% of staff had been vaccinated. Maryland has activated mobile vaccination teams to conduct additional clinics for nursing home staff and residents at more than 30 facilities each week. The state health department also is launching a new public service announcement aimed at workers in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other congregate settings that urge them to get vaccinated as soon as possible.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Support is growing for a permanent memorial to the more than 400 Worcester residents who have died from COVID-19. City Councilor Sarai Rivera initially floated the idea in March, and Councilor At-Large Donna Colorio brought it up again last week when she asked City Manager Edward Augustus Jr. to consider a permanent memorial. Other councilors supported the idea. Colorio suggested there might be space at Green Hill Park or on the Common or downtown. “I think it would mean a lot to people,” she said. Augustus said he thought such a memorial should be something that tells a story, perhaps through an informational-kiosk component. Rivera said it has been a challenging year, and future generations should know what the city went through and what it learned.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Calls to the state’s helpline for people struggling with gambling addiction spiked early this year, and researchers believe the timing is linked to the start of online gambling, compounded by the effects of the coronavirus pandemic. The Michigan Problem Gambling Helpline received 563 calls about gambling addiction in February, nearly twice as many as the total for the same month in 2020. The increase followed high interest in online gambling and sports betting that launched in January. “Casinos are at limited capacity right now because of the pandemic,” said Michelle Malkin, a doctoral candidate studying problem gambling at Michigan State University. “The only thing that could really (explain) this is the growth of online gambling. Because that’s really the only big change that’s happened in Michigan.” Gov. Gretchen Whitmer in late 2019 signed a bipartisan package of laws permitting online gambling. Interest has been high since. Alia Lucas, a specialist with the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services’ Gambling Disorder Program, said the COVID-19 pandemic and the addition of online options can make it harder for people to curb problem gambling. “The concern now is that an individual can sit at home on their couch with their phone and gamble to their heart’s content,” Lucas said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Gov. Tim Walz said Tuesday that he’ll announce a dialing-back of the state’s coronavirus restrictions Thursday, and he’s in discussions with legislative leaders about how long he’ll retain the emergency powers that he’s used to manage Minnesota’s response to the pandemic. The governor described it as an “announcement around where we’re at with COVID.” He gave no details about what changes he might order but indicated that rising vaccination rates are making looser restrictions possible. “I think Minnesotans should start assuming that they’re going to have a very normal-looking summer,” he said during a visit to Alice Smith Elementary School in Hopkins. The Democratic governor called on the Republican-controlled state Senate to approve his $150 million summer learning proposal to help students catch up on what they missed due to the pandemic. The Democratic-controlled House passed the plan in March. The Legislature has been in a holding pattern this week as the conference committees negotiating the major budget bills of the 2020 session await final dollar targets that are expected Friday. Among the more contentions issues have been how to unwind the governor’s reliance on emergency powers and how much of a role the Legislature should get in deciding how to spend federal coronavirus aid.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Regal Cinemas will reopen its theaters in the state this month as part of the company’s global reopening after shutting down its 536 sites across the United States in October to prevent spread of the coronavirus. Both Regal UA Parkway Place in Flowood and Regal UA Westbrook in Brookhaven will reopen May 21, according to the company’s website. According to the company’s website, all guests will be required to wear face masks at all times, during showings, while standing in the theater lobby and in restrooms. Masks can be taken off only when eating or drinking. Customers will now have the option to purchase tickets and concession items from the Regal mobile app in advance. Auditoriums will not exceed 50% capacity, and two empty seats will remain between people to maintain social distancing policies during movies. Employees must also wear masks at all times and wash hands frequently throughout the day, at least every 30 to 60 minutes. They will undergo daily health screenings, such as temperature checks, to protect the visitors’ safety.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson has directed all state employees to return to in-person work in the office by May 17, after many spent most of the past 14 months working remotely. Parson’s order, announced Wednesday, also requires that all state buildings be open and accessible to the public during normal business hours. “With COVID-19 vaccines now readily available across the state and virus activity at its lowest levels since early days of the pandemic, we are confident that it is safe to return to pre-COVID-19 work settings and schedules,” Parson, a Republican, said in a news release. The governor’s office said coronavirus screening and testing protocols will remain in place, and the state is encouraging all employees to consider vaccinations. The state health department reported 454 additional confirmed cases and four more deaths. The state has confirmed 504,069 coronavirus cases and 8,818 deaths since the pandemic began.\n\nMontana\n\nBabb: Hundreds lined up in their cars on the Canadian side of the border crossing that separates Alberta and Montana after driving for hours and camping out in their vehicles in hopes of receiving the season’s hottest commodity – a COVID-19 vaccine – from a Native American tribe that was giving out its excess doses. The Blackfeet tribe provided about 1,000 surplus shots last month to its First Nations relatives and others from across the border, in an illustration of the disparity in speed at which the United States and Canada are distributing doses. While more than 30% of adults in the U.S. are fully vaccinated, in Canada that figure is about 3%. Among those who received the vaccine at the Piegan-Carway border crossing were Sherry Cross Child and Shane Little Bear, of Stand Off, about 30 miles north of the border. They recited a prayer in the Blackfoot language before nurses began administering shots, with Chief Mountain – sacred to the Blackfoot people – rising in the distance. The couple have family and friends in Montana but haven’t been able to visit them since the border closed last spring to all but essential travel. “It’s been stressful because we had some deaths in the family, and they couldn’t come,” Cross Child said.\n\nNebraska\n\nKearney: A woman who had been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 recently died of the disease, state health officials said Wednesday. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services said in a news release that the woman was in her 80s and had underlying health conditions. Officials with Two Rivers Health District, based in Kearney, said the woman lived in the district and was hospitalized for more than two weeks well after receiving two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. The news came even as health officials in the Kearney-based health district pointed to a COVID-19 outbreak at a local nursing home of mostly vaccinated residents as a success story. More than half the residents at the Good Samaritan Society-St. Luke’s facility contracted the disease caused by the coronavirus in early April, after most had been vaccinated, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Of the 23 facility residents who tested positive, only two showed any symptoms, which where mild and cleared quickly, officials said. “Overall, the vaccine did what it was supposed to do: It prevented severe disease and prevented people going to the hospital,” said Dr. M. Salman Ashraf, medical director of the Nebraska Infection Control Assessment and Promotion Program.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Some Las Vegas Strip casinos have been allowed to open at 100% capacity, officials said Tuesday, after showing state regulators that at least 80% of their employees have received at least one shot of a COVID-19 vaccine. Wynn Resorts Ltd. and Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas representatives said they gained approval from the Nevada Gaming Control Board over the weekend to lift occupancy and physical distancing requirements and remove clear plastic separators from gambling tables. “Employees and guests will continue to follow health and safety guidelines, including mask compliance, to ensure a safe and comfortable environment,” a Wynn Resorts statement said. The board, which regulates casinos, set an 80% vaccination goal, while Clark County lawmakers with jurisdiction over Las Vegas-area restaurants, stores and other businesses approved plans to allow 100% occupancy once 60% of eligible county residents get a vaccine shot. State health officials on Tuesday reported the Clark County first-dose public vaccination figure at almost 45.5%, with more than 1 in 3 people fully vaccinated. At the Wynn Las Vegas and Encore resorts, company spokesman Michael Weaver said the first- or single-dose employee vaccination rate reached 88%. The Cosmopolitan said 80% of its more than 4,000 employees got at least one shot.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Providers and recipients of services for disabled, mentally ill and older residents pressed state senators Tuesday to fully fund such programs, saying the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated long-standing challenges in all three areas. More than 200 people signed up to testify during the Senate Finance Committee’s public hearing on the proposed two-year state budget. In the first hour, lawmakers heard repeated pleas to increase reimbursement rates for adult day care and senior centers and for home care services that help people with disabilities live independently. Amy Moore, director of Ascentria In-Home Care, said her program and others like it can’t hire enough workers because wages are so low. “We hail these caregivers, these health care workers as heroes during the pandemic, and yet we’re not paying them a livable wage,” said Moore, adding that the current system is failing vulnerable residents. “As someone whose spent many years out in the field, I can tell you I’ve never seen anything like this,” she said. “A 90-year-old woman in Campton, who fell a few months ago, was on the floor for 14 hours before someone found her. A 62-year-old veteran in Tilton, who’s not getting the showers on a regular basis that he needs, so much so that it’s affecting his health. A 39-year-old woman in Lebanon with cerebral palsy who’s supposed to receive 30 hours a week of care but is only receiving 12. She has intentionally overdosed twice in the last two months.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Rebuilding the iconic Atlantic City Boardwalk to enable it to survive future severe storms, improving the look of the city’s main downtown business districts, helping people in underserved communities, and embracing the “blue economy” of the ocean are among recommendations from a state-appointed panel studying ways to improve the seaside gambling resort. It suggested money from legalized recreational marijuana sales could help pay for the work. Gov. Phil Murphy on Wednesday released a report from the Atlantic City Restart and Recovery Working Group, designed to provide a roadmap for the city to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. It was the only such group the state created focusing on just one city’s recovery from the outbreak. “We are facing a recovery challenge unlike any Atlantic City and the state has faced,” said Murphy, a Democrat. “But every challenge also brings with it opportunities. The working group’s report has identified many of these opportunities, and we intend to move forward on a number of them as we emerge from the pandemic.” “Atlantic City has bounced back from adversity time and time again, and it will be no different with COVID-19,” added Mayor Marty Small.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state Department of Health is urging parents to register children ages 12 to 15 for eventual access to COVID-19 vaccines when they’re approved for lower age groups. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorize Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for kids ages 12 and up next week, setting up shots for many before the beginning of the next school year. Health Department spokesman David Morgan said Tuesday that the agency encourages parents to register children right away with the state’s vaccination website to help ensure access. Separately, Health Department spokesman Matt Bieber said the state is trying to address hesitancy toward vaccines by providing mobile and walk-up vaccination clinics that can increase convenience and reach more people who may be unable or unwilling to register online. New Mexico also is encouraging physicians to discuss the vaccines with patients as trusted sources of medical information. And the state is developing an online registration form for groups to request a visit from mobile vaccination clinics. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and top health officials say the state is on track to have at least 60% of residents fully vaccinated by the end of June. That would allow capacity limits at restaurants and other businesses to be lifted and the state economy to fully reopen.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Many Broadway productions are scrambling to resume ticket sales in the coming days to welcome theatergoers this fall after city and state leaders green-lit a reopening of the Great White Way at full capacity by mid-September. “We remain cautiously optimistic about Broadway’s ability to resume performances this fall and are happy that fans can start buying tickets again,” Charlotte St. Martin, president of the Broadway League, said in a statement Wednesday. Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Broadway theaters can reopen Sept. 14 and will be allowed to decide their own entry requirements, like whether attendees must prove they’ve been vaccinated. Selling tickets will allow theaters to gauge interest before stages open, said Robert Mujica, Cuomo’s budget director. The Broadway that reopens will look different. Last May, the big budget Disney musical “Frozen” decided not to reopen when Broadway theaters restart, marking the first time an established show had been felled by the pandemic. Producers of “Mean Girls” also decided not to restart. But there will be new shows, including Antoinette Chinonye Nwandu’s “Pass Over,” slated to reopen the August Wilson Theatre, the venue “Mean Girls” vacated. And a Shubert theater has been promised for playwright Keenan Scott II’s play “Thoughts of a Colored Man.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Lawmakers on Wednesday advanced a proposal to prevent state and local governments from firing or retaliating against employees who decide not to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Rep. Jake Johnson, R-Polk County, hopes state lawmakers will embrace his plan, given that it is narrower in scope than some other proposals that would apply to schools, hospitals and businesses. “I know there’s a couple bills out there that kind of overlap with this and probably do the same thing, but this only refers to state and local employees,” Johnson told members of the House State Government Committee. The bill now needs support from two more committees in order to advance for a House floor vote, where it must be approved by May 13 in order to be considered during the 2021-2022 legislative session. State health officials worry the proposal would conflict with federal rules and create staffing shortfalls if outbreaks occur at state-operated health facilities. “It appears that we could not treat anybody differently because they have or have not gotten vaccinated. That would mean we’d have to treat every employee in one of our state health facilities as if they are unvaccinated,” said Matt Gross, assistant secretary for government affairs at North Carolina’s Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: In response to an executive order extended by President Joe Biden on March 23, Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Dakota will continue to offer a special enrollment period through Aug.15. The extension allows North Dakotans to enroll in or evaluate health care coverage. There are no qualifying event criteria for marketplace-eligible residents to enroll. “Our focus has always been our members. The COVID-19 pandemic has created challenges for North Dakotans, and we’re here to offer support through comprehensive health care coverage that is available from this special enrollment period,” said Dan Conrad, president and CEO of BCBSND. Coverage options will have plan start dates through Sept. 1, 2021. The SEP will offer individual health plans found both on and off the marketplace exchange. “Now, more than ever, we believe North Dakotans need to approach health from a holistic vantage point,” Conrad said. “In addition to comprehensive health care coverage, we ensure other components, such as mental health and financial well-being, are cared for, too.” Members will be able to renew coverage for 2022 during the open enrollment period, which will begin in November 2021.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: One of the area’s loudest pandemic skeptics joined Hamilton County officials Wednesday to add his talk-radio pipes to the rising plea for residents to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Bill Cunningham, an institution at WLW-AM, cautioned that as the national rush to vaccinate slows, public officials need voices such as his to get the attention of people who don’t want the drug, ever. “I did not believe until the fall, when so many friends that I had and associates were getting sick,” Cunningham said. “But now, get the vaccine, even if you’re a man, even if you’re disconnected, even if you don’t believe what the experts are saying.” The radio personality appeared at Hamilton County’s weekly pandemic briefing over Zoom. County Commissioner Denise Driehaus and Health Commissioner Greg Kesterman said 42% of the county’s total population had been vaccinated so far, four months into the campaign. He said Wednesday that of the 142 people hospitalized with the illness in the county, none had been vaccinated, which he said demonstrated the shot’s protection. That strength is especially important as authorities track the inevitable mutations of the new coronavirus and the spread of those variants.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Health officials are no longer accepting the state’s full allocation of COVID-19 vaccines as demand has dropped, Deputy Commissioner of Health Keith Reed said Tuesday. “The allocation would exceed 200,000 a week … I don’t have the exact numbers that we are accepting into the system right now, but it’s more in the tens of thousands versus the hundreds of thousands,” Reed said. States have been allocated doses based on population. However, the White House has announced that when states decline the vaccine they are allocated, that surplus will shift to states still awaiting doses to meet demand. Oklahoma holds about 500,000 doses in reserve should demand rise, according to Reed, who said the number of daily vaccinations has declined from about 28,000 a month ago to 10,000-11,000. More than 2.7 million COVID-19 shots have been administered in Oklahoma, and more than 1.5 million people – 50.5% of the population – have received at least one dose, Reed said. The state’s COVID-19 emergency declaration was ended Tuesday by Gov. Kevin Stitt, who said that Oklahoma’s seven-day average of new cases is down 94% from its peak and that hospitalizations are down 90% and have stabilized.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state adopted a controversial rule Tuesday that indefinitely extends coronavirus mask and social distancing requirements for all businesses. State officials say the rule, which garnered thousands of public comments, will be in place until it is “no longer necessary to address the effects of the pandemic in the workplace.” “We reviewed all of the comments – including the many comments that opposed the rule – and we gave particular consideration to those comments that explained their reasoning or provided concrete information,” said Michael Wood, administrator of the state’s department of Occupational Safety and Health. “Although we chose to move forward with the rule, the final product includes a number of changes based on that record.” Oregon, which has been among those with the country’s most stringent COVID-19 restrictions, previously had a mask rule for businesses, but it was only temporary and could not be extended beyond 180 days. That prompted Wood to create a permanent rule with the intent to repeal it at some point. “To allow the workplace COVID-19 protections to simply go away would have left workers far less protected. And it would have left employers who want to know what is expected of them with a good deal less clarity than the rule provides,” Wood said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: The commonwealth has called in high-profile reinforcements in the effort to battle vaccine hesitancy. The Philadelphia Flyers and the team’s orange mascot, Gritty, are urging fans to “Take Your Shot” in a marketing campaign launching across southeastern Pennsylvania to target those who may be on the fence about getting the vaccine. “We’ve got the pandemic on the ropes,” said Valerie Camillo, vice president of business operations for the team. “We’re ready to deliver the knock-out blow. We want to get back to doing what we love, like sitting in this arena, shoulder to shoulder with thousands of other fans.” Camillo was joined by Gov. Tom Wolf at the Wells Fargo Center on Monday for an event announcing the partnership. Gritty made a brief appearance, presenting the governor with a sticker in recognition of Wolf getting his first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine two weeks ago. As of Monday, more than 50% of the state’s population had received at least one dose, and the state ranks 10th in the nation in first doses. A third of residents are fully vaccinated. But inoculation rates have slowed in Pennsylvania and across the country, worrying officials who say the higher the vaccination rate, the quicker the state can reopen.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Daniel McKee is working on a plan to boost the state’s post-pandemic economy by distributing tens of thousands of $25 gift cards to residents to encourage them to shop at local businesses. The program to distribute anywhere from 50,000 to 100,000 gift cards would be paid for with leftover federal coronavirus relief funds, the Democratic governor said at a briefing Tuesday. He said he would like to see the program in place next month in time for Father’s Day and high school graduation shopping. Details of the program are still being worked out, so it remains unclear who would qualify for the $25 cards, if there would be an application process, how they would be distributed and at which businesses they could be used. McKee said he would have more to share at his weekly COVID-19 briefing Thursday.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia:Applications are now available for residents who need help paying back rent and utilities because of the pandemic. People who qualify can get up to 12 months of aid for rent or utility bills that date back to March 2020. They can also qualify for up to three months of future rental assistance. The SC Stay Plus program aims to help keep evictions at bay and help renters and landlords get back on their feet across the state, WIS-TV reports. Chris Winston, a spokesman for SC Housing, said officials expect as many as 100,000 households to apply. “Maybe they missed a payment or two back in the summer or fall,” he said. “Maybe they’re safe and secure now, but they still have these lingering missed payments over their head, and they’re worried about eviction.” SC Housing launched a similar program, SC Stay, in February. Some $25 million in emergency assistance for renters was distributed through that program, Winston said. “We saw 7,000 applicants in the first six days that the application portal was open – basically exhausting requests for the $25 million,” he said. Winston said SC Housing hopes to distribute all the latest funds by September. Residents in 39 South Carolina counties are eligible; those in some larger counties are operating their own assistance programs.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem isn’t convinced that medical guidance the American public received from federal health agencies was entirely based on science. The first-term governor on Monday accused the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of basing its recommendations for mitigating the spread of COVID-19 on politics and not the best medical data available and criticized attempts to paint South Dakota as a bad actor during the pandemic. “We’ve all recognized that recently with the CDC they change their opinion and their guidance based on political pressure at different times,” Noem said when asked about a recently released report by the agency asserting the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally caused “widespread transmission” of COVID-19. That report, compiled from data from 39 state health agencies, found 649 cases across the country tied to the Black Hills gathering in the two weeks after the 10-day August event that drew more than 460,000 people from 61% of all U.S. counties. Those figures were drastically lower, though, than an earlier study that attributed more than 260,000 cases to the rally. Noem said those studies and the headlines they create are an attempt to “demonize” the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally and discourage states from keeping their economies open.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The city is gearing up for its first large-scale event in more than a year. After a 2020 hiatus because of the pandemic, the Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest returns May 12-15. A sweet, smoky aroma will once again waft throughout Tom Lee Park and the streets of downtown, with a few changes to the event due to COVID-19. Tickets are only available for online advance purchase. According to Memphis in May organizers, the overall daily park capacity will be reduced to about 35% of normal attendance levels. That means fewer teams, judges, staff and attendees. During any given year, upward of 260 teams compete in the WCBCC. This year, only 150 teams will participate. The Patio Porkers division will not compete this year. The park will open later each day and close earlier each night. In past years, the park opened for free admission for lunch on Thursday and Friday. That won’t happen in 2021. Strict COVID-19 guidelines will be in place. In addition to mandatory masks except when actively eating or drinking, capacity within each booth will be limited and enforced. Hand sanitizing stations will be set up throughout the park. Popular events like Miss Piggy Idol and Sauce Wrestling will not happen this year. Nightly musical entertainment has also been canceled.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: In response to the intensifying COVID-19 crisis in India, people in the Austin area – some who said they’ve been affected personally – have started working to send aid to family and friends overseas. Kavita Tewari, who said she is haunted each day by the howl of ambulance sirens ringing through the streets near her home in New Delhi, and a small group of her friends around the world in Texas’ capital are searching for ways to buy and ship medical devices that concentrate the oxygen in the air and make them available to treat COVID-19 patients. They have started a GoFundMe page to raise funds for the effort. The group is working with a nonprofit called Doctors for You USA to ensure the devices are distributed to people who are most in need, according to the GoFundMe page. The Indian population in Texas accounts for the largest portion – 28% – of overall Asian American and Pacific Islanders in the state, according to a Pew Research study published last week. In Travis County, about 24,471 of residents identified themselves as Asian Indian, according to U.S. census data five-year estimates from 2017. Since mid-April, India has reported alarming numbers of new coronavirus cases and deaths. More than 400,000 cases were reported Saturday, setting a new record for a daily increase in new cases globally.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state on Tuesday ended mandated limits on gatherings and social distancing related to the pandemic after Utah reached several metrics laid out in a so-called COVID-19 endgame bill passed earlier this year. The legislation, passed in March, established criteria based on case rates, intensive care unit utilization and vaccine allocations. The state previously lifted its statewide mask mandate April 10. Utah cleared its third and final benchmark Tuesday after the number of vaccine doses allocated to the state reached 1.63 million, health officials said. Masks will still be required in K-12 schools across the state, and businesses can choose to require them. Utah Transit Authority has also said it will require masks and social distancing on all buses and trains until the end of September. In a letter to legislative leadership, health department Executive Director Rich Saunders acknowledged that the legislation has been controversial but urged state leaders to remain hopeful. “Today should give all of us reason to celebrate,” Saunders said. “No matter which side someone falls on, we can all be proud of the outcomes we have achieved so far.”\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state Department of Labor stopped accepting new online applications for unemployment benefits last week after its system was receiving nearly 3,000 new claims a day, more than 90% of them fraudulent, Labor Commissioner Michael Harrington said Monday. The department said Friday that it would no longer accept online first-time claims for unemployment benefits. Residents were told to file their claims over the phone. The change dropped the number of new claims by about 90%. “The hardest part is that these fraudsters have a lot of data points on individuals’ identities,” Harrington said. “It looks like a real person, it feels like a real person, but in the end it’s not.” Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Vermont didn’t have a dedicated fraud unit, and the department dealt with between five and 10 cases of identity fraud a year. That changed when the pandemic hit. Harrington said unemployment insurance fraud has been a problem across the country that law enforcement has linked to national and international criminal organizations that could be using people’s personal information that was stolen many years ago. He didn’t have an estimate of how much money has been paid out fraudulently in Vermont but said it’s likely hundred of thousands “if not millions of dollars.”\n\nVirginia\n\nFishersville: Augusta Health has partnered with churches, the YMCA and other local organizations to help vaccinate the community. Now, it’s hoping to open clinics at local high schools at the request of school districts. As of Tuesday, Augusta Health vaccination clinics had administered a total of 68,709 doses of COVID-19 vaccines and fully inoculated 33,893 community members. The 34 community clinics conducted have administered 4,714 doses, with 1,886 people fully vaccinated. Augusta Health has open slots for on-campus vaccination clinics. According to Augusta Health, appointments are preferred, but walk-ins are also welcome as long as supply allows. Clinics are now open to any Virginia residents, who can find more information and make an appointment online. Anyone who needs assistance to schedule can call Augusta Health’s Vaccination Call Center at 540-332-5122. The call center is open from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Gov. Jay Inslee said Tuesday that all counties will remain in their current phase of the state’s economic reopening plan and won’t face more restrictions because new coronavirus cases are leveling off after a recent spike. Inslee said there will be a two-week pause as the state continues to evaluate virus activity. The surprise announcement came as several more counties were expected to roll back to Phase 2 of the plan, which includes reduced capacity for indoor dining and gyms, based on case counts and hospitalizations. But Inslee said the most recent weekend data from the Department of Health shows coronavirus activity reaching a plateau in the state. “The approach to this pandemic – there’s no real playbook for COVID – we are making very difficult decisions based on the best science we have,” he said. Inslee’s move is at odds with neighboring Oregon, where fellow Democratic Gov. Kate Brown last week imposed more severe restrictions amid a new wave. Washington and Oregon were among the first states to implement sweeping restrictions in the early days of the pandemic. Currently, just four of Washington’s 39 counties are in the more restrictive Phase 2: Cowlitz, Pierce and Whitman, which were rolled back last month, and Ferry County, where health officials voluntarily moved back Friday because of a recent outbreak.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Witness testimony has begun in a landmark opioid trial in which local governments have sued three large drug distributors accused of fueling the opioid epidemic. Cabell County and the city of Huntington argue that drug distributors AmerisourceBergen Drug Co., Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp created a “public nuisance” by flooding the area with 80 million opioid doses over eight years and ignoring the signs that the community was being ravaged by addiction. Similar lawsuits have resulted in multimillion-dollar settlements, but this is the first time allegations have wound up at federal trial. The result could have huge effects on hundreds of similar lawsuits that have been filed across the country. Testifying in federal court in Charleston on Tuesday, a doctor who specializes in addiction medicine explained how opioids can take hold of users and ruin their lives, The Herald-Dispatch of Huntington reports. Dr. Corey Waller said dopamine – a naturally occurring hormone that prompts happiness – is at the center of substance use disorder. People feel more invincible as the amount of dopamine in their bodies rises, Waller said. Levels can reach 100 nanograms per deciliter on a great day but rise to 900 on semi-synthetic opioids like oxycodone, hydrocodone and heroin, according to the doctor.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The coronavirus pandemic caused a 30% decline in direct spending by tourists to the state in 2020, but officials are optimistic the industry will rebound this year. According to the Wisconsin Department of Tourism, spending dropped about $4 billion last year to $9.8 billion. All of Wisconsin’s 72 counties experienced a decline in tourism activity last year compared to 2019. But officials say the first four months of this year are shaping up to be better than 2019. Acting Tourism Secretary Anne Sayers said people are “getting revenge” on COVID-19 and scheduling the vacations they missed because of it, Wisconsin Public Radio reports. Sayers said national research shows 87% of Americans plan to travel in the next six months. “We’re also finding vacations of two or more nights are up, so Wisconsin is already passing 2020, but we are also surpassing 2019, and that was a record-setting year,” she said. Dane and Milwaukee counties, which rely heavily on tourists for sports, cultural events, conventions and business travel, were the hardest-hit in the state. Direct spending was down last year 39% in Dane County and 42.5% in Milwaukee County compared to 2019, according to the Department of Tourism.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The state is still falling far behind the nation in administering COVID-19 shots, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. With just 33.9% of the population having received a dose of vaccine by Tuesday, the Cowboy State trails the U.S. at large, with 44.4% of Americans at least partially inoculated against the disease caused by the coronavirus. Kim Deti, spokeswoman for the state health department, told the newspaper that she believes concerns about side effects and questions about whether vaccination is really crucial seem to be driving much of the hesitancy.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2014/12/30/year-in-review-united-states/20489635/", "title": "Year in review: 50 stories from 50 states", "text": "Compiled by Alia E.

Bennett decided to write a note and send it to UAB, and he included his dollar allowance to help keep the Blazers on the field. The UAB athletics department sent Bennett a few gifts for his amazing act of kindness.\n\nAlaska: The Palin family brawl\n\nIt was a birthday party gone bad, starring former governor Sarah Palin and her family. According to reports, the clan got into a big fight at a party in Anchorage, and Palin was even said to have screamed, \"Don't you know who I am!?\" In October, Radar Online and Extra unearthed what they say is the police recording from the scene. Listen for yourself. Palin eventually addressed the brawl on Facebook, pointing us to her daughter Bristol's version of what went down.

Gov. Jan Brewer had fought to keep driver's licenses out of the hands of dreamers since August 2012, when she issued an executive order denying licenses to anyone approved for President Obama's program.\n\nMore from Arizona:Veterans health care controversy began with whistle-blower allegations in Phoenix VA hospital\n\nArkansas: Voter ID law struck down\n\nIt was unanimous. The Arkansas Supreme Court in October declared the state's voter-identification law unconstitutional. The American Civil Liberties Union and the Arkansas Public Law Center had filed suit on behalf of four voters who argued that the photo ID requirement would disenfranchise them. The justices ruled that Act 595, which required voters to show government-issued photo identification, \"imposes a requirement that falls outside\" the four qualifications outlined in the state constitution.\n\nCalifornia: Storms put dent in state's drought\n\nNASA has said that about 11 trillion gallons of water is needed to end the historic drought in California. That's about 130,000 Rose Bowls full of water. Storms this December offered some relief, but they weren't nearly enough to end the multiyear drought. After the storms, the percentage of the state in the worst drought category — \"exceptional\" drought — dropped from 55% to 32%. That's the state's lowest percentage in six months.\n\nMore from California:Steve Ballmer buys Los Angeles Clippers from Donald Sterling; 'Six Californias' fails to make California ballot\n\nColorado: Lighting up the new year\n\nJan. 1 brought the first sales of legal recreational marijuana to Colorado and the state hasn't looked back. Three more states have now either begun or approved recreational sales, and tens of millions of dollars in new tax money is flowing into Colorado's coffers. The fast-growing industry in 2014 struggled to manage the vast piles of cash it's been generating, and state regulators clamped down on the popular pot-infused candies and treats known as edibles.\n\nConnecticut: Sandy Hook killer carefully planned attack\n\nIt's been two years since the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., shook the nation to its core. A Connecticut agency investigating the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre issued a report in November that found the killer, Adam Lanza, did not \"snap\" but was obsessed with mass murder and had carefully planned the attack. Lanza, 20, killed his mother at their home on the morning of Dec. 14, then went to the school he had once attended and gunned down 20 children and six staff members before killing himself.\n\nDelaware: Beauty queen dethroned for being too old\n\nHere's your dose of Miss America drama. A new Miss Delaware was crowned in June after the one selected earlier that month got the boot — for being too old. Brittany Lewis, 24, originally the contest's first runner-up as Miss Wilmington, got the sparkly crown lost by Amanda Longacre, who was also 24 when she competed. The Miss America Organization website says contestants must be 17 to 24 years old. Longacre was stripped of her crown because she was turning 25 in October. In July, Longacre sued the state and national scholarship pageant organizations.\n\nFlorida: Jeb Bush may ask you to extend his family's presidential dynasty\n\nThe Republican establishment likely has its first candidate for 2016. Jeb Bush made a surprise announcement this December that he will \"actively explore\" a 2016 presidential bid, giving his strongest signal yet about wanting to follow his father and brother to the White House (see how \"actively explore\" became the new \"conscious uncoupling\"). Bush was Florida's governor from 1999 to 2007.\n\nMore from Florida:Officials propose making 'South Florida' 51st state; Red-light camera abuses exposed\n\nGeorgia: Father indicted for murder in son's hot-car death\n\nImmediately after Georgia dad Justin Harris left his 22-month-old son in a hot car, where he died, people rallied around him. But then evidence started mounting that Harris may have actually left his son in the sealed car on purpose. Police found that Harris, 33, and his wife had researched hot car deaths and had two life insurance policies out on their son. In September, Harris was indicted for murder. His trial is scheduled to begin next month.\n\nHawaii: Lava flow is slow-motion horror story\n\nImagine you're kicking back at home and someone tells you that 2,000-degree Fahrenheit lava is flowing toward your house. That's been Hawaii's reality this year. Molten lava emerged from a vent in the Kilauea volcano in June, and a long stretch of the flow began slowly moving toward the town of Pahoa, in a rural region of the Big Island of Hawaii. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes. In late October, the lava crossed a country road at the edge of town, covering a cemetery and claiming a home. Now, the lava is headed for a shopping center.\n\nIdaho: The saga of Bowe Bergdahl\n\nIt was a roller coaster of emotions in Hailey, Idaho. On May 31, the town learned that local boy Bowe Bergdahl, 28, had been released from Taliban captivity in Afghanistan after five years. But joy soon turned to shock. Calls and e-mails blasted locals for planning a celebration June 28 for the Army sergeant who may have walked off his post and whose release involved the Obama administration trading five Taliban leaders. Bergdahl has been accused by some members of his former unit of intentionally leaving his post before he was captured by Taliban insurgents in 2009. This December, the Army decided to forward the Bergdahl investigation for possible court-martial. For now Bergdahl remains assigned to a desk job at an Army headquarters unit in San Antonio.\n\nIllinois: Rahm to Hillary: 'Dead broke? Really?'\n\nHillary Clinton took a lot of heat this summer after she said in an interview with ABC's Diane Sawyer that she and Bill Clinton left the White House in 2001 \"dead broke.\" Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, her old political pal, didn't let the comment slide at an event in Chicago celebrating her memoir, Hard Choices. \"Hillary dead broke?\" Emanuel asked. \"Really?\" Clinton acknowledged to Emanuel that it \"may not have been the most artful way\" of talking about her finances.\n\nIndiana: Colts owner arrested\n\nIt was a tough year for Jim Irsay. The Colts owner was arrested in March for driving under the influence and illegal possession of prescription drugs. Commissioner Roger Goodell disciplined Irsay with a six-game suspension and a $500,000 fine — the maximum allowed under NFL rules. \"I acknowledge the mistake I made last March and stand responsible for the consequences of that mistake, for which I sincerely apologize to our community and to Colts fans everywhere,\" Irsay said in a statement. Irsay, 55, has battled drug addictions and alcoholism for decades.\n\nIowa: Farm families adapt to food-conscious America\n\nThe farm family, with deep community roots and generations living close to the soil, has found itself at the center of profound demographic, technological, economic and environmental change.

Roberts survives close call for GOP\n\nVeteran Republican Sen. Pat Roberts survived a surprisingly strong challenge from independent Greg Orman in November, ensuring that Republicans would continue their 82-year string of U.S. senators from the Sunflower State. Orman, a 45-year-old millionaire businessman who has never held elected office, scared Republicans with his upstart campaign against the three-term, 78-year-old Republican.\n\nKentucky: Cars crash in an unlikely mishap\n\nA 40-foot-wide sinkhole at Kentucky's National Corvette Museum opened up in February and swallowed eight Corvettes.

Security cameras caught the moment the cars slipped into the massive hole as the floor caved in.\n\nLouisiana: Smithsonian will honor family's civil rights efforts\n\n\n\nSmall communities like Bogalusa, La., often are overlooked in histories of the civil rights movement, but a new museum on the National Mall aims to change that. Charles Hicks said it \"feels good\" to know his native town's civil rights contributions will be recognized by the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture. Hicks' father, Robert Hicks, a legendary civil rights activist, died in 2010. The family's involvement in the civil rights movement will be part of an exhibit at the museum, scheduled to open in 2016.\n\nMaine: Unlikely lobsters caught days apart\n\nFirst, a rare sight landed in a lobsterman's trap in October. Jay LaPlante and his 14-year-old daughter, Meghan, caught a blue lobster about 10 miles southwest of Portland. The find is like winning the lottery: Oceanographers estimate that only 1 in 2 million lobsters is blue. Then, a week later farther up the coast, veteran lobsterman Joe Bates discovered what researchers consider a 1-in-100-million find: a white lobster.\n\nMaryland: Boardwalk pole dancer makes waves in Ocean City\n\nIt was a mixture of outrage and awe on the Boardwalk in Ocean City, Md., this summer. A 27-year-old dancer raised First Amendment issues when she set up her own pole-dancing operation on one of the busiest tourist thoroughfares in America. The resort community's officials didn't like it, but thanks in part to two federal court decisions involving Ocean City, Chelsea Plymale's show is legal. That doesn't mean it hasn't riled people, including a nearby store owner.\n\nMore from Maryland:Ray Rice won his appeal, but it's likely he still lost his NFL career\n\nMassachusetts: Going back in time\n\nA time capsule buried in 1795 by Paul Revere and Samuel Adams was unearthed in Boston at the Massachusetts Statehouse this December, possibly the oldest such U.S. artifact ever uncovered.

Ten years ago, gay marriage was explicitly legal in just one state — Massachusetts. Same-sex couples now can marry in 35 states. But there are many parts of the U.S. where LGBT citizens not only lack the right to marry but also lack other fundamental protections. According to the Human Rights Campaign, Southaven, Miss., is one of just five cities scoring zero on their 2014 Municipal Equality Index. Others are in Texas: Irving, Lubbock, McAllen and Mesquite.\n\nMissouri: Michael Brown sparks conversation on race in America\n\nMichael Brown's death in Ferguson this summer set off protests throughout the nation. Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, was fatally shot by white Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Witness reports differ on whether Brown had his hands raised. Wilson said Brown became overpoweringly violent after the officer asked him to stop walking in the middle of a street. In November, a grand jury decided Wilson would not face charges in Brown's death, setting off riots. USA TODAY reporter Yamiche Alcindor was there from the beginning and was with Brown's family when they learned of the grand jury's decision.

The 19-year-old freshman at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati was diagnosed with a rare form of brain cancer and given a short time to live, but she has made a tremendous impact both on and off the court this season. She fulfilled her dream to play college basketball, starting a game with the Lions women's basketball team and scoring a basket (or two) in front of a sold-out arena. Most importantly, she began a massive effort to raise funds for cancer research. Hill is now an honorary coach with the Lions and she's not giving up her fight to live — or the fight to raise awareness.\n\nOklahoma: Death row inmates appeal lethal injection ruling\n\n\n\nCapital punishment in America is in a curious state. Manufacturers are cutting off supplies of lethal injection drugs because of opposition to the death penalty, and prison officials are improvising to make up the deficit — sharing drugs, buying them from under-regulated pharmacies or using drug combinations never employed before in putting someone to death. A group of Oklahoma death row inmates scheduled to die early next year filed notice in December that they intend to appeal the ruling of a federal judge in Oklahoma City who says the state's new lethal injection protocol is constitutional. The four condemned men who have pending execution dates, beginning with Charles Frederick Warner on Jan. 15, maintain the state's use of the sedative midazolam in a three-drug combination poses a substantial risk of unconstitutional pain and suffering.\n\nOregon: Brittany Maynard leaves a legacy\n\nBrittany Maynard, the 29-year-old face of the controversial right-to-death movement, died in November in Portland. When you're 29 years old, you typically don't think about your legacy. You think about the family you want to start, the house you want to buy, the promotion you want to get, the trip you want to take. You think about turning 30 and the amazing life that stretches before you. Maynard moved from California to Portland so she could have access to Oregon's Death With Dignity Act and die as she had planned – in her bedroom, encircled by family and friends. Oregon became the first state in the U.S. with a death-with-dignity law in 1997. Since then, four other states have followed suit.\n\nPennsylvania: One of FBI's Most Wanted captured\n\nIt was a lengthy manhunt that had Pocono Mountain communities near the search area on edge.

Kennedy stayed at Newport's Hammersmith Farm, home of Jacqueline Kennedy's family, according to the Journal. Obama stayed overnight for a morning speech on the economy.\n\nSouth Carolina: Judge throws out black teen's conviction from 1944\n\nWhen George Stinney Jr., 14, was sent to the electric chair in June 1944, he was the youngest person in the country ever executed. In December, a judge threw out Stinney's conviction for the deaths of two white girls. Stinney was convicted of the grisly murders of Betty June Binnicker, 11, and Mary Emma Thames, 7, in Alcolu, S.C. The teen's prosecution had \"fundamental, constitutional violations of due process,\" Judge Carmen Mullen of South Carolina's 14th Judicial Circuit said in her ruling. Her decision effectively exonerates the teen. Stinney's supporters have said he was forced to confess.\n\nSouth Dakota: Case of missing girls solved after 40 years\n\nFinally, some closure. Authorities announced in April that the skeletal remains found inside a car belonged to two teens who had been missing for 40 years.

The disclosure came Monday at a court hearing over inmate Alan Miller’s request to block his scheduled Sept. 22 execution by lethal injection. Miller maintains that prison staff lost paperwork he returned in 2018 requesting nitrogen hypoxia, an execution method that the state has authorized but never used. U.S. District Judge R. Austin Huffaker Jr. asked whether Alabama was ready to carry out executions by nitrogen hypoxia. James Houts, a deputy state attorney general, said the method could be available as soon as next week. He said, however, that a final decision on when to use the new method would be up to Corrections Commissioner John Hamm. The Alabama Department of Corrections did not respond to an email seeking comment about the status of the proposed new execution method. Nitrogen hypoxia, which is supposed to cause death by replacing oxygen with nitrogen, has been authorized by Alabama and two other states for executions but has never used by a state. Huffaker noted the “high stakes” involved with a looming execution date but did not immediately rule on the request to block the lethal injection.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Joseph Hazelwood, the captain of the Exxon Valdez oil tanker that ran aground more than three decades ago, causing one of the worst oil spills in U.S. history, has died, the New York Times reports. He was 75. He died in July after struggling with COVID-19 and cancer, his nephew Sam Hazelwood told the newspaper. The Exxon Valdez, a 987-foot tanker, grounded on Alaska’s Bligh Reef at 12:04 a.m. March 24, 1989, spewing nearly 11 million gallons of oil into the rich fishing waters of Prince William Sound. Currents and storms carried the crude over 1,200 miles of Alaska coastline. The Exxon Valdez Oil Spill Trustee Council estimates the spill killed a quarter-million seabirds, 2,800 sea otters, 300 harbor seals, 250 bald eagles, up to 22 killer whales and billions of fish eggs. It took years for the fish numbers to rebound following the spill, and oil can still be found under the surface of some beaches in Prince William Sound. Hazelwood, whom prosecutors accused of being drunk when the tanker grounded, was the only crew member criminally charged after the spill. He had left a third mate in control of the ship while he went below to do paperwork. Hazelwood was accused of one felony, criminal mischief, and three misdemeanors – reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated and negligent discharge of oil.\n\nArizona\n\nLees Ferry: The National Park Service will poison a Colorado River side channel below Glen Canyon Dam to remove fish that threaten native species, the agency announced. Meanwhile, biologists warn, rising temperatures and declining oxygen levels in water the dam releases into the river’s Lees Ferry stretch are stressing the popular trout fishery there. Nonnative smallmouth bass are known to have passed through the dam’s hydropower-generating turbines for several years to reach the Lees Ferry area, but their successful breeding at that stretch was not documented until this year. If it continues, agency officials fear, bass could establish themselves far downstream and eat humpback chubs, which are protected as a threatened species. “Threats to the native fish are increasing due to the warmer temperatures of water passing through the dam and related increased river temperatures below the dam,” said a statement released by Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, which includes the river segment. The park service announced it will treat the slough with the fish killer rotenone Saturday and Sunday. While the plant-derived chemical is commonly used by fish managers, and the park service said it will carefully protect the environment and human health by isolating it in the slough, at least one Native American tribe with cultural links to the river and Grand Canyon has objected. The Zuni Pueblo of New Mexico consider the river and canyon sacred.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Jason Andrew Vineyard, a Sebastian County Election Commission chairman, has a felony conviction that makes him ineligible to vote and has reportedly been removed from the position. Sebastian County Prosecuting Attorney Daniel Shue said Monday that Vineyard, 43, a Republican, has a 2003 felony conviction. Shue sent a letter to Sharon Brooks, Sebastian County Clerk, notifying the office that Vineyard is ineligible to vote, despite the fact he had continued to cast ballots in elections since his conviction. The letter says that Shue was responding to a recent request from Brooks on whether Vineyard is ineligible to vote. Lee Webb, Democrat election commissioner, said Monday that he was not aware if Vineyard had been removed as chairman. Either the Circuit Court or the Sebastian County Republican Party could remove Vineyard. But Larry Bishop, chairman of the Sebastian County Republican Committee, told reporters Vineyard had been removed from the commission Monday. “It is part of a long list of stuff that has been going on the last few months,” Webb said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Gov. Gavin Newsom wants voters to reject a new tax on rich people that would pay for more electric vehicles in the nation’s most populous state, warning in a new statewide TV ad that a measure on the ballot this November won’t help the environment but is instead “one company’s cynical scheme to grab a huge taxpayer subsidy.” Proposition 30 would raise taxes on people who make more than $2 million per year. It would generate up to $5 billion in new tax money each year, most of which would go to programs that help people buy electric cars and install charging stations. A smaller amount would go to wildfire prevention response and prevention programs. The ballot measure’s campaign is paid for by the ride-hailing company Lyft. Last year, state regulators ordered companies like Lyft to make sure nearly all their rides are in electric vehicles by 2030. Newsom says the ballot measure is Lyft’s attempt to make taxpayers pay for that. “Don’t be fooled. Prop 30’s been advertised as a climate initiative. But in reality, it was devised by a single corporation to funnel state income taxes to benefit their company,” Newsom says in the ad, which will air in all of the state’s major media markets. “Put simply, Prop 30 is a Trojan horse that puts corporate welfare above the fiscal welfare of our entire state.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Police who shot a 22-year-old man after he called 911 for roadside assistance escalated the situation, needlessly leading to his death, the man’s relatives said in a tearful news conference Tuesday in which they called for accountability. After Christian Glass’ June 11 death in the small mountain town of Silver Plume west of Denver, the Clear Creek County Sheriff’s office issued a news release saying Glass was shot after he became “argumentative and uncooperative” and tried to stab an officer when police broke a car window to grab him. “Christian was experiencing a crisis, and he called 911 for help,” said the parents’ attorney, Siddhartha Rathod, “and yet these officers busted out Christian’s window, shot him six times with bean bag rounds, Tased him multiple times from two Tasers, and then shot him five times.” The Colorado Bureau of Investigation handles police shootings, including the Glass case, but the family wants prosecutors to file criminal charges, Rathod said. Videos shared with the Associated Press show Glass refusing to come out of his car while also telling police he’s “terrified” and making heart shapes with his hands to officers. At one point, he also can be seen praying with folded hands and saying, “Dear Lord, please, don’t let them break the window.” When the officers do break the window, Glass seems to panic and grabs a knife.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: An FBI agent struggled to control his emotions Tuesday as he described on the witness stand seeing bodies inside Sandy Hook elementary school – a scene that the conspiracy theorist Alex Jones later claimed was staged by actors. FBI agent William Aldenberg was the first witness to testify as a Connecticut jury began hearing statements in a trial to decide how much money Jones owes for spreading the lie that the 2012 mass shooting in Newtown didn’t happen. Aldenberg broke down as he described being among the first law enforcement officers to enter the two classrooms where 20 children died. “Was what you saw in that school fake?” asked attorney Christopher Mattei, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. “No,” Aldenberg said. “It’s awful. It’s awful.” He also testified about how he and others in the community and law enforcement were targeted with threats and conspiracy theories, including one that claimed he was an actor who also pretended to be the father of a victim. The trial in Waterbury – less than 20 miles from Newtown, where the children and six teachers were shot to death – was attended by more than a dozen family members of victims, including David Wheeler, the father who conspiracy theorists had claimed was the same person as Aldenberg.\n\nDelaware\n\nLewes: The City Council has set a public hearing for Oct.3 to discuss a new ordinance that distinguishes short-term and long-term rentals and establishes certain rules for each. One Lewes couple said they’ve lived in the quaint, historic beach town for more than three decades, but it wasn’t until more recently that they started to see their neighborhood change. As more of the homeowners on their street began to offer short-term rentals through sites like Airbnb and Vrbo, they noticed that their quiet community would drastically switch from a near “ghost town” to “busy beach town” within the turn of a weekend. Knowing that Lewes typically has more year-round residents than many of its neighboring resort towns, another resident who commented at a city meeting last year said he worried that the sense of community in Lewes would start to break down if short-term rentals soon dominated. These residents all had concerns about how these rentals would affect their quality of life – from pressures on parking to issues with trash or noise – if the city did not specifically regulate short-term rentals. For at least the past year, the City Council, the city manager and a designated short-term rental committee have been discussing how to manage these rentals and ensure they do not add costs to the city.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Washington Spirit fans can travel to games with new commemorative Metro SmarTrip cards celebrating their National Women’s Soccer League Championship win, WUSA-TV reports. The transit cards feature an image of the team hoisting the championship trophy after the title-winning game. The limited-edition cards are being sold at Navy Yard, Waterfront and Gallery Place stations in specially marked fare machines topped with a sign. The NWSL championship cards arrive just in time for soccer fans headed to Saturday’s game at Audi Field against the NJ/NY Gotham FC. “We are excited to honor the Spirit, reigning NWSL champs, with this commemorative card. The Spirit’s title run continues the winning tradition in the District of Champions,” Metro General Manager/CEO Randy Clarke said in a statement. “Metro is proud to support the team and fans getting to and from games.” The Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority produced 10,000 of the commemorative cards, and they are only available on a first-come, first-served basis. Fans looking to grab the cards can meet up with starting midfielder Anna Heilferty at the Gallery Place station to grab a card and say hello starting at 4 p.m. Sept. 13.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: State health officials are fining an Orlando abortion clinic $193,000 for violating a law requiring a 24-hour waiting period before abortions are performed, according to a case assigned to an administrative judge Tuesday. The Florida Agency for Health Care Administration filed the complaint against the Center of Orlando for Women this summer. The mandatory 24-hour waiting period rule for abortions in Florida was signed into law in 2015 and was upheld by a judge in April after a nearly seven-year court case. State regulators used patient records to determine the clinic performed 193 abortions that violated the 24-hour waiting period rule between late April and early May of this year, the complaint said. State law allows for a fine of $1,000 per violation of the waiting period law. A clinic manager told officials she was aware of the law but did not know when it became effective, according to the complaint. A lawyer representing the center said the facility contacted the state several times to inquire about the law’s effective date, given the lengthy legal battle over the rule, but received no additional information. “It would be disastrous for the clinic if they had to pay a $193,000 fine to keep their license,” attorney Julie Gallagher said in an interview Tuesday. At least two other Florida clinics are facing similar but smaller fines.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStatham: Republican Gov. Brian Kemp said Monday that he wants the state to provide grants to school districts to help students catch up on what they might have missed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, expand the number of school counselors, encourage teacher aides to become full-fledged teachers and pass a law requiring school lockdown drills. Kemp unveiled a relatively modest set of K-12 education proposals as part of his second-term reelection effort at an elementary school in Oconee County where one of his daughters was a teacher last year. “We have more work to do to address pandemic learning loss, bring more educators and counselors into our schools, and keep our students and staff safe,” Kemp said at Dove Creek Elementary School in Statham, just outside Athens. Kemp made a $5,000 pay raise for teachers a centerpiece of his agenda when he was running in 2018 and delivered the final chunk of the money this year, but he didn’t propose a pay raise for his second term Monday, although in response to reporter questions, he said he would “continue to work support all state employees to make the pay scale competitive in the future.” Democrat Stacey Abrams, who is running against Kemp, has proposed boosting average teacher pay over four years to $75,000 and guaranteeing a starting salary of $50,000.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige on Monday appointed several people, including some prominent Native Hawaiian activists, to a new board charged with managing Mauna Kea summit lands underneath some of the world’s most advanced astronomical observatories. Two of the eight appointees – Lanakila Mangauil and Noe Noe Wong-Wilson – were leaders of 2019 protests that brought a halt to the construction of the Thirty Meter Telescope, the latest observatory proposed for the mountain on Hawaii’s Big Island. Many Native Hawaiians consider the summit sacred, and protesters objected to building yet another telescope there. The summit currently hosts about a dozen telescopes built since the late 1960s. Responding to the protests, the state created the Mauna Kea Stewardship and Oversight Authority this year with a new law that says Mauna Kea must be protected for future generations, and science must be balanced with culture and the environment. Native Hawaiian cultural experts will have voting seats on the governing body, instead of merely advising the summit’s managers as they do now. The eight nominations must be confirmed by the state Senate. The authority will have 11 voting members. The other three are representatives of the Board of Land and Natural Resources, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents and Hawaii County’s mayor.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Chipmaker Micron’s planned $15 billion investment in a new factory in the company’s hometown of Boise will help protect the United States from the vulnerabilities of a globalized semiconductor market, U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Monday. “It is time to get America making things again, with American parts and American labor,” Granholm told a crowd of about 250 guests and Micron workers invited to a tent-covered dirt field for a ceremonial groundbreaking. The event included setting off a ground-clearing explosion far from the crowd that emitted red, white and blue smoke. The U.S. and Europe are pushing aggressively to build chipmaking capacity and reduce reliance on producers that are now mostly based in Asia. Semiconductor businesses have also been trying to diversify their operations to avoid bottlenecks caused by problems – such as a natural disaster or pandemic lockdown – in a specific region. Micron officials said that the high desert, sagebrush steppe area east of Boise is expected to have the largest chipmaking cleanroom, or fab, in the U.S. by the end of the decade, covering 600,000 square feet and creating 17,000 jobs. Construction is expected to start in 2023, with some cleanroom working space ready by 2025 and expanding in phases. Micron is among the nation’s largest chipmakers, with product development sites in five other states and eight countries. Research and development is centered in Boise.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Anne Burke, chief justice of the Illinois Supreme Court, announced her retirement Monday. The 78-year-old jurist will end her 16-year high-court tenure Nov. 30. “I have been blessed to serve as a Supreme Court Justice,” Burke said in a statement. “The past three years as chief justice have been a challenging time due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but I am thrilled with the progress made by the Illinois courts.” The seven-member court, which has the authority to fill interim vacancies, has chosen Joy Cunningham, a justice on the First District Appellate Court, to take Burke’s place. Cunningham will be the court’s second Black woman. The first took her oath just three months ago. Lisa Holder White was appointed to replace the retiring Rita Garman. Burke herself replaced the first woman on the court, Mary Ann McMorrow, in 2006. Burke will leave just weeks after the fall election, in which two seats are up for grabs, and Republicans hope to gain control of the court for the first time in decades. Burke’s husband, Edward Burke, a Chicago alderman for half a century, is scheduled to go on trial next year on federal racketeering and extortion charges. He has pleaded not guilty and denies wrongdoing.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local leaders and community stakeholders have highlighted a proposal to include money for a pilot clinician-led emergency response program in the city’s proposed budget – an initiative at the heart of calls for reform following the death of Herman Whitfield III in police custody during a mental health crisis in April. Mayor Joe Hogsett, alongside representatives from the Office of Public Health and Safety, the City-County Council and Faith in Indiana, voiced their support last week for the program, which would require $2 million in the city’s proposed operating budget for 2023. The program and its budget still need approval from the full City-County Council in October. If it passes, the pilot is expected to begin next year and would include 24-hour coverage of teams made up of mental health clinicians and experts in a limited number of Indianapolis police districts who can respond to calls for nonviolent mental health help. The proposed budget item would also include money to increase mental health expertise at the 911 dispatch center. “This team would be equipped to provide meaningful support for those who in years past would have spent the length of their crisis in a jail cell,” Hogsett said. “This is because we recognize that police are not health care providers and our jails are not hospitals.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The second-largest school district in the state improperly and repeatedly shut students with disabilities in seclusion rooms and restrained them in violation of the federal Americans with Disabilities Act, federal authorities said Monday. The U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division and the federal prosecutor for the Northern District of Iowa announced a settlement with the Cedar Rapids Community School District in which school officials have agreed to end the use of seclusion rooms and reform its restraint practices. The district based in Cedar Rapids, about 120 miles east of Des Moines, also promised in the settlement agreement to improve staff training on how to address and de-escalate students’ disability-related behavior through appropriate measures. A justice department investigation found that the district subdued students with disabilities through unnecessary restraints and improper confinement in small seclusion rooms, sometimes multiple times in a day and often for excessive periods of time. The investigation covered the three school years ending in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Investigators found 4,968 incidents where students were secluded, restrained or transported from class and more than 83% of cases involved a student with a disability.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A Topeka police officer hit a car while driving drunk last October, then told police his wife had hit it, says the body that voided his law enforcement certification last month. The Kansas Commission on Peace Officers’ Standards and Training revoked the certification of Steven Dorsey Smith, it said on its website Aug. 15. “Respondent’s conduct shows that he lacks the personal qualities of integrity, upholding the laws of the state, conduct that warrants the public trust, and upholding the oath required for certification,” the website said. Smith was employed by the city of Topeka from Oct. 7, 2019, through Jan. 21, 2022, said Gretchen Spiker, the city’s communications director. Smith was put on leave after the crash, Spiker said, and he resigned during the investigation, which continued even after he left the department. The investigation’s findings were then sent to the statewide commission. “While unfortunate, the city feels this is an example of an investigation that was handled with the utmost integrity,” she said, “and that all best practices were followed.” Kansas statute empowers KSCPOST to revoke the certification of officers whose actions show they aren’t of good moral character sufficient to warrant public trust in them.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: Three country music superstars, all natives of Kentucky, will come together for a concert to aid victims of this summer’s catastrophic flooding in the eastern part of the commonwealth. Chris Stapleton, Dwight Yoakam and Tyler Childers have announced the Kentucky Rising benefit concert, a special, one-night-only show that will be held at Lexington’s Rupp Arena on Oct. 11. A full 100% of net proceeds from the concert will benefit the Kentucky Rising Fund to support flood relief work and recovery efforts in eastern Kentucky, including support for the many victims, their families and first responders. In August, 39 people died as a result of devasting flooding in parts of eastern Kentucky. The flooding also destroyed many homes, roadways and other infrastructure. Both Childers and Stapleton stepped up in different ways to help out their home state in the days immediately following the flooding. Tickets for the benefit concert go on sale Friday. Visit KentuckyRising.com for more information. For Citi cardmembers, the official presale credit card of Kentucky Rising, sales began Tuesday and run through Thursday at 10 p.m. through CitiEntertainment.com.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The U.S. Department of the Interior said Monday that it wants to reverse some Trump administration rollbacks of offshore safety rules to prevent blowouts like the BP catastrophe that killed 11 people and fouled the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. “This proposed rulemaking will help ensure that offshore energy development utilizes the latest science and technology to keep people safe,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in remarks prepared for an afternoon announcement. “As our nation transitions to a clean energy economy, we must commit to strengthening and modernizing offshore energy standards and oversight.” The changes are a step in the right direction but not far enough, said Diane Hoskins of the ocean environmental nonprofit Oceana. “No operator can promise there won’t be another disaster like BP’s Deepwater Horizon blowout. The only way to prevent offshore drilling disasters is to permanently protect our coasts and workers from new offshore leasing,” she said. Under Trump, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement acted in 2019 to change rules put in place three years earlier while Barack Obama was president. The agency is proposing to change seven out of the scores of revisions and additions made in 2010, director Kevin M. Sligh Sr. said.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The governor said Tuesday that the federal government is moving ahead too quickly with potential new restrictions on the lobster fishing industry and isn’t taking the industry’s concerns about the changes into account. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently announced it was seeking input on new rules to reduce risk to rare whales. The North Atlantic right whales number less than 340, and they are vulnerable to entanglement in lobster fishing gear. Gov. Janet Mills, a Democrat, said the agency’s plan to provide only one chance for public comment about the new rules later this month is not sufficient. She wrote in a letter to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, who oversees NOAA, that lack of input from fishermen will put coastal industries and communities at risk. “As NOAA well knows, effectively reaching an audience of fishermen with challenging schedules absolutely requires in-person meetings and opportunities for comment,” Mills said. The protection of the lobster industry has emerged as an issue in Mills’ reelection race this year. Her opponent, Republican former Gov. Paul LePage, said last week that he would push back at the “Biden administration’s destructive regulatory policy aimed at destroying the livelihoods of our fishermen over the false notion they are harming whales.”\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: Five western Maryland police officers won’t face charges in a man’s death that occurred days after officers shocked him with a stun gun during an altercation, officials announced Monday. Frederick police said Daniel Michael Holley, 23, died at a hospital Nov. 14, two days after officers used a stun gun to subdue him, news outlets report. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is still trying to determine the exact cause of Holley’s death, but the report rules out the officers’ actions as a cause, officials said. The Office of the Attorney General looked into the incident, and nothing in the initial report from the office’s Independent Investigations Division led officials to believe that there was a basis for prosecution, Frederick County State’s Attorney Charlie Smith said. Officers were called to a home for a report of a person behaving erratically and found Holley nude, pacing and talking incoherently, police said. Body camera footage showed an officer use a stun gun after Holley tackled another officer. Officers requested emergency medical services, and Holley was taken to a hospital, where he died, officials said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: President Joe Biden on Monday urged Americans to come together for a new “national purpose” – his administration’s effort to end cancer “as we know it.” At the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum, Biden channeled JFK’s famed moonshot speech 60 years ago, likening the space race to his own effort and hoping it, too, would galvanize Americans. “He established a national purpose that could rally the American people and a common cause,” Biden said of Kennedy’s space effort. “We can usher in the same unwillingness to postpone.” Biden hopes to move the U.S. closer to the goal he set in February of cutting U.S. cancer fatalities by 50% over the next 25 years and dramatically improving the lives of caregivers and those suffering from cancer. Experts say the objective is attainable – with adequate investments. Dr. Michael Hassett, of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, said Biden’s goal to reduce cancer deaths could be met by following two parallel paths: one of discovery and the other making sure as many people as possible are reaping the advantages of existing therapies and preventive approaches. “If we can address both aspects, both challenges, major advances are possible,” Hassett said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The chief justice of the state Supreme Court said Monday that she will step down by the end of 2022, an announcement that followed a major decision affecting abortion rights and more than two years of steering Michigan’s judiciary through the COVID-19 pandemic. Bridget McCormack, a Democratic Party nominee, has been on the court since 2013 and still had six years left in her second term. “After a decade, the time has come for me to move on, to let others lead, and to build on a foundation of progress,” McCormack, 56, said in a statement. She said she would resign no earlier than Nov. 22 and no later than Dec. 31. The timing will depend on the appointment of her successor. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said she will pick a new justice, apparently no matter the results of the Nov. 8 election. Whitmer, a Democrat seeking reelection, called her a “phenomenal public servant.” McCormack is leaving to become president of an international provider of dispute-resolution services, the American Arbitration Association-International Centre for Dispute Resolution announced Tuesday. Kimberly Wiehl, leader of the group’s governing board, said the organization was looking for someone who has “outstanding business acumen” and is committed to expanding access to resolving disputes outside court.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Local police and the FBI are investigating a break-in at a mosque as a bias-motivated crime. According to a press release from the St. Cloud Police Department, officers were called to the Islamic Center at 375 Fifth Ave. S early Thursday. Islamic Center of St. Cloud President Mohayadin Mohamed said the damage was discovered as individuals began to arrive for morning prayer. Police said a man and woman had damaged a door to enter the mosque, then caused damage inside. Both suspects were found before 7 a.m. at a nearby hotel and taken into custody. Mohamed said surveillance footage showed the two inside the mosque for two hours, roughly 1-3 a.m. He said they went into every space; caused damage to an exterior door, office space and the building’s downstairs area; and brought alcohol into the building. Consuming alcohol is forbidden in Islam. CAIR-MN, the Minnesota chapter of national Islamic civil liberties and advocacy group Council on American Islamic Relations, held a press conference at the center Friday morning regarding the incident, which CAIR-MN Executive Director Jaylani Hussein said the group is asking be investigated as a hate crime.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The city hasn’t paid for its trash to be picked up in more than five months, as the mayor and City Council are locked in a battle over who truly won the bidding process, but Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said his administration is proposing a public referendum in which Jackson residents could pick between Waste Management, whose bid a majority of the City Council supports, and Richard’s Disposal, whose bid his administration supports. After the request for proposal blind-bidding process was completed, the mayor’s office maintained that Richard’s won, but the council refused to approve a contract, claiming that Waste Management had been victorious. That led to Lumumba attempting to veto the council’s no-vote on the Richard’s contract. A specially appointed judge ruled that Lumumba could not veto a no-vote, but the mayor has appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court. Lumumba said at his weekly news conference Monday that he trusts the will of the voters to resolve the dispute. The mayor said his legal team has researched statutes on referendums and consulted with the state auditor’s office in order to ensure that such a vote would be legal. Whether one will end up happening now rests with the council.\n\nMissouri\n\nStockton: A Christian boarding school in southwestern Missouri can remain open despite the state attorney general alleging a “dark pattern of behavior,” a judge ruled Monday. Judge David Munton’s ruling allows continued round-the-clock monitoring of Agape Boarding School in Stockton by Missouri child welfare workers. The school serves about 60 boys. The Kansas City Star reported that the state was prepared to call two former Agape students to testify Monday. Agape attorney John Schultz told the judge that there was no proof of any immediate health or safety concern for students and that allowing former students to testify was “simply for publicity,” the Star reports. The judge didn’t allow the testimony but scheduled another hearing for Sept. 21. Attorney General Eric Schmitt’s office first sought to shut down Agape last Wednesday after learning that someone on the state registry for child abuse and neglect was actively working there. On Friday, the attorney general’s office filed an amended motion alleging systemic abuse. “Agape’s operation of a residential care facility must cease because it presents an immediate health and safety concern for the children residing at Agape,” the court filing said. It also accused Agape of providing the state with incomplete information concerning which adults have access to children.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: U.S. officials have withdrawn parcels of public land near the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation from future mining to protect a reclamation area where more than $80 million has been spent to clean up past mining contamination. Mining will be barred for 20 years on 4 square miles of land at the Zortman-Landusky Mine site now administered by the Bureau of Land Management. Canada-based mining company Pegasus Gold Inc. declared bankruptcy in 1998, leaving cleanup at the site to U.S. taxpayers. The BLM has previously said the remaining cleanup work could cost about $70 million and involve moving millions of tons of waste rock and treating hundreds of millions of gallons of water in coming decades. Contaminated water from the shuttered mine site has flowed downstream to the Fort Belknap reservation and fouled its water. Treatment of mine water to prevent further contamination will continue indefinitely, the BLM said in announcing the Sept. 9 withdrawal. About 5.4 square miles were withdrawn from mining in 2000, but that action expired in 2020. A proposal for a new withdrawal on the remainder of the land – about 1.4 square miles – is pending.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Fifteen years after being rejected as too controversial, Malcolm X is the first Black honoree to be inducted into the Nebraska Hall of Fame. The organization’s commission selected the civil rights icon Monday with a 4-3 vote, edging out the late University of Nebraska educator and author Louise Pound. “Malcolm X used the lessons he learned early in life and his intellectual power, dedication and perseverance in the fight for freedom and equality for all during the civil rights movement in America,” said commission Chairman Ron Hull. “His work and his legacy continue to impact the citizens of the world.” Malcolm X was born Malcolm Little in Omaha in 1925 as the son of a Baptist preacher. His family left for Milwaukee the following year after threats from the Ku Klux Klan. The firebrand was first nominated for Nebraska’s Hall of Fame in 2004 but passed over by a commission made up solely of white men who instead selected a U.S. senator who made a name for himself with his campaign to remove gay men from government posts in the 1940s and 1950s. The pick of Sen. Kenneth Wherry was later nixed because of an open-meetings violation. Malcolm X was passed over again in 2007 for little-known botanist Charles Bessey. Each Nebraska Hall of Fame member is immortalized with a bronze bust displayed in the state Capitol.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Demolition has begun at two Las Vegas-area casino properties had been shuttered since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March 2020. A spokesman for Station Casinos declined to comment about work that began Monday at Texas Station in North Las Vegas and Fiesta Henderson in Henderson. Work has not begun at the company’s closed Fiesta Rancho, which is also slated to be razed. Red Rock Resorts, the publicly traded corporate owner of the properties, announced in July that the three casino-hotels would be demolished, and the land on which they sit will be sold. Fiesta Rancho opened in 1994 off Rancho Drive near North Las Vegas Airport, and Texas Station opened across the street in 1995. Fiesta Henderson opened as The Reserve in 1998 off U.S. 95 and was acquired by Station Casinos in 2001. Station Casinos markets its off-Strip properties to Las Vegas residents. It is building a new property, Durango Casino & Resort, off the 215 Beltway southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. Station owns six other casino-hotels in and around Las Vegas and is building a new site near a crossroads southwest of the Las Vegas Strip. It also operates several non-hotel Wildfire properties.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Department of Justice is seeking to assuage concerns about a new state law curbing some enforcement of federal firearms laws. School officials can still report potential shooters on campus, Attorney General John Formella wrote this month. New Hampshire State Police officers can still confiscate weapons from alleged domestic abusers, the New Hampshire Bulletin reports. A new federal firearms law closing the “boyfriend loophole” will still apply in the state. The legal interpretations, issued in a nine-page opinion Sept. 1, are part of an effort by the department to provide more information and cool tensions around the new law, which prevents state and local officials from enforcing federal firearms laws that are not replicated in state law. “Unless expressly delegated by a federal law enforcement agency, state and local law enforcement have never had the authority or jurisdiction to enforce or administer federal firearms violations or laws,” the department wrote in an accompanying “Frequently Asked Questions” document. “HB 1178 has not changed this.” The law was championed by Republicans and Second Amendment advocates as a partial bulwark against federal firearms laws and rules, which include agency rules from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Workers can’t be fired just for testing positive for marijuana, under new guidelines the state released Friday. The long-awaited interim regulations for the nascent industry came as a relief to employers, who said they had been left in the dark on how to keep their workplace free of drugs. While a positive drug test for marijuana won’t by itself be grounds to fire or discipline a staffer or to decline to hire someone, an employee could still be let go if they’re also shown to be under the influence during work hours. “Striking a balance between workplace safety and work performance and adult employees’ right to privacy and to consume cannabis during their off hours is possible,” said a statement from Jeff Brown, executive director of the state Cannabis Regulatory Commission, which oversees the state’s marijuana industry. “We have been doing that with alcohol without thought.” For workers and bosses, the situation has been complicated by medical uncertainty ever since sales began April 21, as well as by fears of how weed could affect worker performance in high-risk jobs with little room for error. Pot and alcohol affect the human body differently, so long-established protocols for substance-free workplaces and gauging if someone’s under the influence hadn’t necessarily applied.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is using a visit to Washington to celebrate Democrats’ flagship U.S. climate and health care bill and to advocate for addition federal wildfire relief. The Democratic governor said she was traveling to Tuesday’s celebration of the Inflation Reduction Act at the invitation of President Joe Biden. Signed in August, the law could save money for some Americans by lessening the cost of prescription drugs for the elderly, extending health insurance subsidies and reducing energy prices. The legislation represents Congress’ largest-ever investment in curbing carbon emissions. It would also modestly cut the government’s budget deficit. While in Washington, the 62-year-old governor and skiing enthusiast also planned to consult with an orthopedic surgeon about a lingering knee injury. Campaign related activities in Washington and New York are scheduled before the Lujan Grisham’s planned return to New Mexico on Friday. Lujan Grisham is seeking a second term in the November general election against Republican nominee and former television meteorologist Mark Ronchetti. He is campaigning on proposals for a permanent annual tax rebate tied oil-field production, new restrictions on abortion access and enhanced criminal penalties to address crime.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The man who shot and killed John Lennon outside his Manhattan apartment building in 1980 has been denied parole for a 12th time, New York corrections officials said Monday. Mark David Chapman, 67, appeared before a parole board at the end of August, according to the state Department of Corrections and Community Supervision. Chapman shot and killed Lennon on the night of Dec. 8, 1980, as Lennon and Yoko Ono were returning to their Upper West Side apartment. Lennon had signed an autograph for Chapman on a copy of his and Ono’s recently released album, “Double Fantasy,” earlier that day. State officials have yet to make transcripts of Chapman’s latest board interview available, but he has repeatedly expressed remorse in previous parole hearings. Chapman called his actions “despicable” during his hearing in 2020 and said he would have “no complaint whatsoever” if they chose to leave him in prison for the rest of his life. “I assassinated him … because he was very, very, very famous, and that’s the only reason, and I was very, very, very, very much seeking self-glory. Very selfish,” Chapman said then. He is serving a 20-years-to-life sentence at Green Haven Correctional Facility, north of New York City, according to online state corrections records.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGraham: A judge has dismissed a lawsuit by civil rights leaders that sought the removal of a Confederate statue in front of a historic courthouse. Superior Court Judge Don Bridges ruled Tuesday against the state NAACP, which had argued that the statue in front of the Alamance County Courthouse was a danger to public safety and violated constitutional rights to equal protection, according to The Times-News. A 2015 state law sharply limits state and local governments from removing Confederate statues and other objects of remembrance. The NAACP had argued in its 2021 lawsuit that county officials had leeway to remove the statue under an exception for public safety. The statue, erected in 1914, has been the site of protests in recent years. Separately, North Carolina’s governor ordered the removal of Confederate monuments outside the state’s historic Capitol in 2020, citing the public safety clause in the law after nearby monuments were damaged by protesters. Demonstrators have toppled other statues in recent years on the campus of the University of North Carolina and in downtown Durham. But Bridges said that he interprets the state law as protecting the Alamance County statue and that the local county commission is entitled to follow it.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Legalizing recreational pot could cut the number of people who are registered to use the drug as medicine by at least 80%, due to access to bigger quantities and more varied products, a state health official said Monday. Supporters of legalizing recreational cannabis in North Dakota succeeded last month in bringing the matter to a public vote in November by submitting more than the required 15,582 valid petition signatures to get it on the ballot. The state has issued more than 8,200 identification cards to qualifying patients since voters approved medical marijuana in 2016. North Dakota’s approved medical marijuana forms are dried leaves and flowers, concentrates, tinctures, capsules, topicals and transdermal patches. Edibles were part of the original initiative, but the Legislature removed them from the list, fearing they could get in the hands of children. The initiative on the ballot in November would allow people 21 and up to legally use marijuana at home, as well as possess and cultivate restricted amounts. Edibles would be allowed. Medical Marijuana Division Director Jason Wahl said thousands medical marijuana users may only purchase 2.5 ounces of cannabis flower in a 30-day period. Recreational users could potentially – though illegally – purchase at least that amount in a single day, as “none of that is tracked,” Wahl said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: An educational experiment happening in one of the city’s poorest neighborhoods could expand to a national model, using tax dollars to establish religious schools. Last month 31 children from the Hilltop and Franklintown areas began attending a new school called Westside Christian inside converted Sunday school classrooms at Memorial Baptist Church. Founders of this “micro-school” call it a new, low-cost way to open private schools in underserved communities using state education dollars – known in Ohio as EdChoice vouchers – instead of private donations. And if it’s successful, they hope to open hundreds more. “Our goal is five to 10 more in Ohio next yea,” Center for Christian Virtue Executive Director Troy McIntosh said. “But we want to take this model and export it to other states.” Public school advocates worry this is a misuse of the EdChoice Scholarship system at best or another step toward dismantling public education at worst. “It’s not about rescuing kids from failing schools,” former Democratic lawmaker and school finance expert Stephen Dyer said. “It’s all about subsidizing private education and mostly religious education.” Traditionally, opening a private school requires millions of dollars in donations that “float” the school until tuition can cover its expenses.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state received almost $17.9million in tribal gaming exclusivity fees in August – the most the industry has ever paid to the state in a single month. The record amount is one sign of the region’s continued economic growth despite rising inflation. Summer is also a strong season for the tribal gaming industry, which generates a large chunk of its business from Texans and other travelers. Officials in both Oklahoma and Texas have said consumer spending as a whole ticked up last month as prices and pay increased. The previous record for exclusivity fees was nearly $17.8 million in May 2021, according to monthly totals published by the Oklahoma Office of Management and Enterprise Services. The fees have added up to $193 million over the past year, 13% more than the same time in 2021. Whether Oklahoma’s tribal gaming industry can keep expanding will depend largely on external forces, especially whether Texas legalizes widespread casino-style gaming or sports betting, said Victor Rocha, a tribal gaming industry analyst based in California. Oklahoma’s largest casinos are near the Texas border and draw heavily from Dallas-Fort Worth. Casinos on the other side of the border would be a game changer, said Rocha, who belongs to the Pechanga Band of Luiseño Indians.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Saying that a police response is often an improper solution to mental health crises, Biden administration officials on Monday announced financial support for expansion of mobile crisis intervention teams in Oregon. The Pacific Northwest state, which has pioneered the use of unarmed intervention teams, became the first to receive the infusion of aid under President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act. The new Medicaid-supported plan will allow Oregon to provide and expand community-based stabilization services to individuals experiencing mental health and/or substance use crises throughout the state by connecting them to a behavioral health specialist, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement. HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra encouraged other states to take advantage of the funding opportunity. Federal health officials said that under the program, 85 cents of every dollar spent by states to expand these services and utilized by Medicaid-covered individuals will be paid for by the federal government. There are more than 1.4 million Medicaid recipients in Oregon, according to the Oregon Health Authority. That’s almost one-third of the state’s population of 4.1 million. An example of such a program exists in Eugene, where teams of paramedics and behavioral health practitioners take mental health crisis calls out of the hands of uniformed and armed officers.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A white Philadelphia police officer became distraught when he learned that a Black motorist he fatally shot after a high-speed chase was unarmed, his lawyer said as the ex-officer’s third-degree murder trial began Tuesday. Prosecutors said former Officer Eric Ruch Jr. shot and killed Dennis Plowden Jr. less than six seconds after arriving on the scene – even as other officers held their fire. A grand jury investigation found that Plowden, 25, was dazed after crashing the car and had his left hand raised as he tried to follow commands on a city sidewalk. However, defense lawyer David Mischak told jurors that Plowden’s right hand remained hidden near a pocket. Only later, he said, did Ruch learn what was inside. “As soon as my client discovered it was heroin and not a gun, he was upset. He was distraught,” Mischak said. He urged jurors to consider not just what happened in the six seconds at the scene but also the two-minute chase beforehand. Police thought the car was linked to a recent homicide. Plowden, who had borrowed the car and was not involved in that case, drove at high speed for several blocks through a city neighborhood before crashing. “It was a tragedy,” Mischak said of Plowden’s death. “To call my client a criminal really compounds that tragedy.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin, D-R.I., said he hopes something good can come from an “outrageous” incident last month in which he nearly had to cancel a congressional trip because an airline wouldn’t let his wheelchair onto a plane. The event caused him to miss his flight and arrive late in Italy, where the House Armed Services Committee member was leading a congressional delegation with the U.S. Navy. The airline, Lufthansa, has acknowledged it made a mistake and has issued an apology. “It’s outrageous that airlines are blocking wheelchair users from traveling with FAA-compliant mobility devices,” Langevin tweeted Monday. “If I was denied boarding on a government trip, what do you think is happening to people with disabilities on vacations, visiting family, or traveling for work?” Langevin, who is quadriplegic, uses a wheelchair powered by lithium-ion batteries. Lufthansa staff at Boston Logan International Airport told him the chair was prohibited because its batteries posed a fire threat. Having had similar trouble in January, he’d taken steps to avoid another problem, with the Navy contacting the airline on his behalf in advance. Discussing the issue with a gate agent and operations manager, Langevin even got the wheelchair’s inventor on the phone to explain that it was safe. “They wouldn’t budge,” he said. Langevin noted that most people wouldn’t have a staff to help under such circumstances. “It’s very expensive to be disabled,” he said. “Not everyone has a backup chair.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Republican state lawmakers will keep trying to enact new abortion restrictions later this month. Speaker Murrell Smith announced Monday that the House will meet Sept. 27, more than two weeks after the Senate sent back a markedly different proposal from the one passed earlier by the lower chamber. Contentious debates among Republicans over exceptions have emerged in a special session on abortion that convened after the U.S. Supreme Court’s June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. It is unclear if the House will take up the Senate’s bill. Smith told reporters earlier Monday that “all options are on the table.” While Smith was disappointed with the outcome last week, he said this is how legislation gets made. “I respect the Senate as a body and their votes,” Smith told reporters. “Obviously, the House is vastly different from their position.” The House passed a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy in late August with exceptions for the mother’s life and rape or incest up to 12 weeks. The Senate passed a six-week ban, based on when cardiac activity can be detected in an embryo, with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest, to save the life of the mother and, when approved by two doctors, in cases of fatal fetal anomaly.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem disclosed Monday that she recently underwent back surgery to treat an injury impacting her spine and that her activity would be limited during several months of recovery. The 50-year-old Republican governor said she traveled to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, for the surgery after receiving medical treatment for several weeks in South Dakota. She said in a video posted on Twitter that she injured her back about two months ago. She said she will be restricted in the amount of travel she can do and the time she can spend standing while she recovers. Noem is in the midst of a reelection campaign and is also considered a potential 2024 White House contender. “I won’t be able to stand for more than 10, 15 minutes at a time. I won’t be able to get out and about South Dakota like I love to do so much,” the governor said in the video, where she appeared slightly dispirited. Dr. Mohamed Bydon said in a statement released by the governor’s office that he treated her for an “acute condition impacting her lumbar spine.” He said that the surgery was successful and that the governor is in “excellent health.” The governor’s office and her campaign spokesman did not immediately respond to a question on how she was injured.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Police have revised the number of people killed in a man’s shooting rampage from four to three after a different suspect was identified in the slaying of a teenager during the tense ordeal. In a Facebook post, Memphis police said the killing of a 17-year-old girl, Corteria McKinnie, was not part of the series of shootings last Wednesday that terrorized the city and led to a shelter-in-place order. The teen was shot as police frantically hunted the man who posted some of his actions on social media. Police said Ezekiel Kelly, 19, carjacked two motorists and drove around Memphis and north Mississippi, opening fire on people. Kelly has been charged with first-degree murder in one of the shootings. More charges are pending, authorities said. Kelly’s next court appearance is scheduled for Friday. The court-appointed public defender has not returned calls seeking comment in his case. At a news conference early Thursday – just after Kelly was arrested – Memphis Police Director Cerelyn “CJ” Davis provided a timeline that included four people killed and three others wounded. In a Facebook post made after-hours Friday, police said the shooting of McKinnie in south Memphis was not carried out by Kelly but by a different suspect. Police said McKinnie reported the shooting at a fire station, but she was shot in her car at a separate location by a man wearing all black.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A woman accused of killing another woman to steal her unborn baby to present as her own went on trial for capital murder Monday. Taylor Rene Parker has pleaded not guilty to capital murder and kidnapping in the October 2020 deaths of 21-year-old Regan Michelle Simmons-Hancock and the daughter who died after being cut from her mother’s womb. Authorities say Simmons-Hancock was stabbed and cut more than 100 times and had her skull crushed with a hammer in her New Boston home before a scalpel was used to remove her unborn baby. She is also charged with non-capital murder in connection with the baby’s death. Assistant District Attorney Kelley Crisp told the Bowie County jury Monday that Parker, 29, acted not because she wanted a baby but to keep from losing her boyfriend. Crisp said Parker disguised herself to make her look pregnant for nearly 10 months, faked ultrasounds, had a gender-reveal party and posted about her fake pregnancy on social media while searching for a possible victim, Crisp said. “How did we get here?” Crisp asked the jury. “How did it get this far? She is an actress, an actress of the highest order. The lies and fraud go on and on; the layers of fraud are staggering.” Leaving the victim’s 3-year-old daughter alone with her dying mother, Parker then drove with the baby in her lap when a state trooper stopped the car and sent the child to a hospital in nearby Idabel, Oklahoma, authorities say. The child later died.\n\nUtah\n\nTooele: Federal wildlife managers say they plan to gather approximately 700 wild horses later this week as part of an ongoing effort to tamp down the horses’ populations along the Utah-Nevada border. The gathering operation is slated to start Saturday and last for two weeks, starting in the proximity of the Cedar Mountain Herd Management Area, west of Tooele, according to the Bureau of Land Management. BLM officials say the herd management area should have between 190 and 390 horses but now has a population of 920. Horses removed from the range will be transported to BLM-contracted off-range corrals in Axtell, Utah. “The Cedar Mountain Horse Management Area wild horse gather supports the BLM’s continuing efforts to manage public lands for multiple use and sustained yield and to manage wild horse populations under the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act of 1971,” Jessica Wade, the bureau’s Salt Lake field manager, said in an email. The agency’s method for rounding up the horses involves low-flying helicopters chasing the horses into corrals – a method that has drawn fire from advocacy groups over the years but that wildlife officials say is the quickest, most effective way to reduce herd sizes and minimize longer-term problems. Members of the public are invited to come and observe the operations, as long as they remain at a safe distance, starting Monday.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The U.S. Department of Education is investigating allegations of antisemitism at the University of Vermont, including that some Jewish students were excluded from campus clubs and that a teaching assistant threatened to reduce the grades of students who support the state of Israel. The complaint filed by the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law alleges that UVM has allowed a hostile environment to exist on campus in violation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The complaint, which was filed last year but acted upon by the Department of Education last month, says that Jewish students have expressed fear about identifying publicly as Jewish, that they hide their Jewish identity and that some have considered transferring from UVM due to the hostile environment. Jewish students are being pressured to disavow their sense of being Jewish if they want to engage on issues like LGBTQ, women’s or immigration rights or climate change, said Alyza Lewin, the president of the Brandeis Center. “It can’t be that today, the only community that’s not welcomed to bring their full identity to the table are the Jews,” she said in an interview with the Associated Press. In a statement, UVM spokesman Enrique Corredera said officials were aware of the investigation by the Office of Civil Rights and look forward to providing the agency with a full response to the underlying allegations, which were reported to the university in 2021 and investigated by campus officials.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The Elizabeth River Project’s latest work will roll with the rising tide. The environmental group is constructing a 6,500-foot resilience lab with an intentional life span of about 30 to 50 years. When sea levels reach a certain height, the structure can be disassembled and moved to allow a living shoreline – part of the design – to take its place. The outdoor pavilion will float when the area floods and is meant as a refuge for people who canoe down the river-like streets after a deluge or for those caught outside. The Pru and Louis Ryan Resilience Lab and Learning Park is scheduled to open next fall. The $8 million project is funded by Pru and Louis Ryan of Norfolk and donations through the ERP’s Next Wave Campaign. The group picked the location because it is a notorious flood zone, and the creek is an important tributary. The lab will be equipped with solar panels, rainwater collection barrels and gray water collection systems. It also will employ natural cooling techniques such as a “green wall” of ivy. The proposed living shoreline will be at the back of the property and planted to restore wetland and oyster habitats. Once in place, it will help trap contaminants and filter the water. There will be two storage sheds, one of which will float, a research dock, and a public boardwalk for people to look out over the creek. A kayak launch will be just off the boardwalk.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Seattle Public Schools said late Monday that it had reached a tentative agreement with the union for teachers who went on strike last week over issues like pay and classroom support. Earlier Monday, the district had canceled classes Tuesday – the fifth school day that students have missed since the strike began began Sept. 7. That was supposed to be the first day for approximately 49,000 students in the district. Details about the agreement weren’t immediately available. Striking teachers said their main concern was educational and emotional help for students, especially those with special needs or learning difficulties. The school district had offered pay raises of an additional 1% above the 5.5% cost-of-living increase set by state lawmakers – far less than the union says it wanted – plus one-time bonuses for certain teachers, including $2,000 for third-year Seattle teachers earning an English language or dual-language endorsement. Teachers in the city have seen healthy raises since their last strike in 2015, with many making more than $100,000, thanks largely to a new state education funding model. The union has said it is primarily focused on winning raises for its lower-paid members, including instructional assistants and front office staff. Paraeducators in Seattle Public Schools start at $19 an hour – nowhere near enough to afford to live in the city, many say. The union says it was opposing the district’s efforts to eliminate staffing ratios for special education students.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The Legislature passed a sweeping abortion ban with few exceptions Tuesday, approving a bill that several Republicans said they hope will make it impossible for the state’s only abortion clinic to continue to offer the procedure. Under the legislation, rape and incest victims would be able to obtain abortions at up to eight weeks of pregnancy – but only if they report to law enforcement first. Such victims who are minors would have until 14 weeks to terminate a pregnancy and be required report either to law enforcement or to a physician. Rape and incest victims would have to report the assault within 48 hours of getting an abortion, and a patient would have to present a copy of a police report or notarized letter to a physician before the procedure could be performed. Abortions also would be allowed in cases of medical emergencies. Lawmakers resumed debate on the bill after failing to come to an agreement in late July, giving up the chance for the state to become the first to approve new legislation restricting access to abortions since the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in June removing its protected status as a constitutional right.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Hundreds of Madison nurses seeking to be recognized as a union canceled a three-day work strike at the last minute after Gov. Tony Evers called the health care workers and their bosses to Maple Bluff over the weekend to hash out a settlement. Evers announced the agreement to avoid striking Monday at a state Capitol news conference, where UW Health health care workers and UW Health CEO Alan Kaplan said the two sides agreed to pursue an analysis from the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission on whether the health system must recognize their union. “I just made an offer to come to the residence, sit down together, and my message was quite clear that people in Wisconsin expect everybody to work together for the best of everyone. And no one wants a strike,” Evers said. The agreement came a day before the nurses were set to start a three-day strike they voted in late August to take if UW Health officials did not agree to negotiate with their union, SEIU Healthcare Wisconsin. Their pursuit of union recognition has been brewing since 2011, when Republican state lawmakers and then-Gov. Scott Walker passed a collective bargaining law that eliminated most collective bargaining for public employees. Kaplan has argued state law prevents officials from bargaining with the union.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Republican U.S. House nominee Harriet Hageman won’t agree to a debate with Democratic challenger Lynnette Grey Bull, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. Hageman, who defeated incumbent U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney in the GOP primary after winning the endorsement of ex-President Donald Trump and pushing his election conspiracy theories, declined an invitation to appear on stage with Grey Bull next month, first citing a scheduling conflict and later saying she wouldn’t take part at all. Grey Bull said voters deserve to hear the candidates discuss their differences and calling the refusal a tactic of the privileged class, according to the newspaper. WyomingPBS officials, who have long hosted statewide debates, also said they were diappointed that Hageman wouldn’t agree to participate in a forum that helps constituents learn about the candidates and issues.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/04/pothole-protest-ernie-pyle-urine-scare-news-around-states/40758581/", "title": "Pothole protest, Ernie Pyle: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: City officials are considering new curfew laws during school hours to try to discourage students from skipping class. The Tuscaloosa City Council’s public safety committee approved a proposal that would make it illegal for minors to be unaccompanied in public from 9 a.m. until 2:30 p.m. any Monday through Friday that city schools are in session. The Tuscaloosa News reports the full council will consider the curfew next month. If it’s approved, a parent could be cited if a minor is found in violation. City Attorney Glenda Webb says the penalties could include up to a $500 fine and up to six months in jail. The curfew wouldn’t apply to children who are homeschooled or attending other types of school programs.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Officials say assessments following an enormous 2018 earthquake showed building damage was worse outside the city’s safety area due to reduced regulation. The Anchorage Daily News reports there was less structure damage in the Anchorage Building Safety Service Area than in the Chugiak-Eagle River area during the 7.1 magnitude earthquake in November 2018. Anchorage municipal officials say 52 red tags indicating severe building damage preventing occupation were issued in Chugiak-Eagle River, while only 17 were issued in Anchorage. Officials say builders outside the safety area can hire private inspectors and do not need to have plans reviewed. Proponents of the independent inspection process say the model is equally effective as the system in the safety area and less expensive for homebuyers.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A state lawmaker wants to require students to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, but the ACLU claims such a requirement is unconstitutional. Rep. John Fillmore, R-Apache Junction, has proposed legislation requiring schools to set aside time each day for the Pledge of Allegiance and a moment of quiet reflection. House Bill 2017 would strike existing law that allows time for “those students who wish” to recite the pledge. Only a parent could excuse a student from the requirement under Fillmore’s proposal. But ACLU Arizona claims that ordering students to recite the pledge unless a parent allows them to refuse is unconstitutional, spokeswoman Marcela Taracena said in a written statement. Similar requirements in other states have led to conflict in the classroom and in the courtroom.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Officials say they may consider revoking medical marijuana licenses for dispensaries that aren’t open by June. Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control officials regulate the state’s budding cannabis industry. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that that those officials say they could begin taking action against inoperable dispensaries at the end of January. But a necessary rule is still being drafted and won’t be ready by then. Officials have said licenses may not be reissued when they are up for renewal in June. Marijuana commissioners have expressed frustration at how long it is taking the 32 dispensaries in the state to open since being licensed this year. Only 11 are operating. Attorney Alex Gray represents several dispensaries. He says cannabis companies have been weighing patient count, product supply and locations of other dispensaries.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: The Los Angeles Police Department will begin testing a device designed to snare a person from a distance, giving officers an alternative to firing a Taser or a gun. The Los Angeles Times reports department officials told the city Police Commission that officers will start testing the tool for free for 90 days beginning in January. The BolaWrap 100 fires a Kevlar cord that wraps around a person 10 to 25 feet away. The device will be distributed to 200 LAPD officers once they are trained. The Times says dozens of police departments across the United States are testing or have purchased the devices.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The first head shop in this state at the forefront of counterculture and legal marijuana plans to close with the new year. Mellow Yellow, a historic head shop that opened in 1969, will officially close its flagship Fort Collins location Jan.1, the store’s new owner Jake Myers confirmed Monday. “The Mellow’s 50 years old. It was the first shop of its kind,” says Myers, who has worked as Mellow Yellow’s general manager for the past five years. Myers says the store was the first head shop in Colorado when previous owner Jerry Weintraub opened it. Weintraub maintained ownership of the well-known shop and boutique since it opened before selling it to Myers two weeks ago, Myers says. He says the Fort Collins inventory will be moved to Mellow Yellow’s Greeley location, which opened in the 1980s.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: It’s unclear whether efforts next year to make the seasonal flu vaccine more accessible to children will get any traction. Given the anticipated debate about whether to end the state’s religious exemption from certain childhood vaccinations, the CEO of the Connecticut Pharmacists Association says his group doesn’t plan to push for a bill in the next regular legislative session that would allow young people to get a flu shot from a pharmacist. Nathan Tinker says concerns raised by parents skeptical about the safety of vaccines could impede efforts to make the flu vaccine more accessible. Groton Sen. Heather Somers, a Republican, says she still plans to resurrect the bill when lawmakers return in February. She says the legislation will save lives. Currently, pharmacists can only administer flu shots to adults.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state will host events throughout 2020 to mark the 100th anniversary of women’s right to vote in the United States. Delaware State News reports the planned celebrations include a march around Legislative Hall that will end with the erection of a monument honoring the women’s suffrage movement. The Women’s Suffrage Centennial Committee also plans to have historical markers installed in each county. A website about the fight for the women’s vote is also up and running.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Allan Gerson, a lawyer who pursued Nazi war criminals and pioneered the practice of suing foreign governments in U.S. courts for complicity to terrorism, has died at the age of 74. Gerson died Sunday at his D.C. home from complications of the degenerative brain disorder Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, said his wife, author Joan Nathan, according to The Washington Post. Gerson wrote an opinion piece for the newspaper in 2017 in which he detailed his lengthy legal career and identified himself as a former “dreamer,” drawing a parallel between his undocumented entry into the United States and those of immigrants currently targeted by the Trump administration. A deputy assistant attorney general under President Ronald Reagan, Gerson was also a child of Jewish refugees who fled Poland during the Holocaust.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The state’s Democratic and Republican parties are united in opposing a proposed constitutional amendment that would let all voters cast ballots in primary elections. Lawyers for both parties asked the state Supreme Court on Tuesday to keep the proposal off the 2020 ballot. The parties said the ballot language is confusing and misleading. A group called All Voters Vote gathered enough signatures to have the item placed on next November’s ballot, but the court has to decide whether that ballot language is clear. If the proposal passes, all voters will be eligible to vote in primary elections for the Legislature, governor and Cabinet. The top two candidates would then move on to the general election, even if they’re from the same party.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A man considered the main suspect in a string of killings of black children and young adults in the city in the 1970s and 1980s has been denied parole. The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles made the decision last month in the case of 61-year-old Wayne Williams. The more than two dozen killings, mostly of black boys, terrorized Atlanta from 1979 to 1981. Williams was sentenced in 1982 to serve two life prison sentences after being convicted of murder in the killings of two adults. While authorities blamed him for the other killings, he was never charged. A Nov. 20 parole board letter to Williams says he hasn’t served enough time given the “nature and circumstances” of his offenses. The board set his next parole consideration for November 2027.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The on-time graduation rate for University of Hawaii at Manoa students has doubled in the past decade. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports the school’s graduation rate now matches the national average for public universities. The University of Hawaii Institutional Research & Analysis Office says the four-year graduation rate reached 36.6% for the class of 2019, up from 17.5% in 2010. The National Center for Education Statistics reports the national rate for public universities was 32.9% in 2010 and 36.9% in 2017. The figures represent first-time, full-time freshmen who graduate from the institution where they originally enrolled. Officials at Hawaii’s flagship campus say the university won an Association of Public and Land Grant Universities national award in 2017 for success in increasing graduation rates, which have continued to climb.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho Falls: State lawmakers have announced a new law targeting uninsured drivers by suspending vehicle registration is expected to take effect Jan. 1. The Post Register reports the state Department of Motor Vehicles can now cross-check vehicle identification numbers each month against its database of registered vehicles. Transportation officials say that means drivers who don’t keep insurance on their vehicles could see their registration suspended after a few months. Officials say uninsured drivers would receive a notice after two months saying they have 30 days to get insurance. Officials say it would cost $75 and proof of insurance to reinstate vehicle registration if it’s revoked. Idaho Falls police say officers wrote 609 tickets for failure to provide proof of insurance and 139 tickets for failure to maintain insurance last year.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A tax on parking places to help finance a $45 billion, statewide construction plan has lawmakers taking a second look. The State Journal-Register reports that the tax, which takes effect Jan. 1, is 9% on spaces that are rented by the month or year. It’s 6% for spaces rented hourly, daily or weekly. It will raise $60 million annually and is part of more than $800 million in new taxes and fees that will finance state construction. But proposed rules would make the tax so broad that even those who rent private property for parking – as dozens in Springfield do annually in August during the Illinois State Fair – would pay the tax. Springfield Republican Rep. Tim Butler suggested reviewing the tax because of difficulty in enforcing it.\n\nIndiana\n\nDana: Republican U.S. Sens. Todd Young and Mike Braun have introduced legislation to rename the post office in Dana after Ernie Pyle, the celebrated war correspondent who was born near the western Indiana town. Pyle was reporting on the U.S. Army’s 305th Infantry Regiment when he was killed April 18, 1945, on the Japanese island of le Shima. Braun said last week that “Ernie Pyle is an American hero who gave his life in World War II, and it’s only fitting to name the post office in Dana, Indiana, after him.” After studying journalism at Indiana University, Pyle won a Pulitzer Prize for his reporting on World War II. The bill was introduced last week.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: In the Labs for Functional Textiles and Protective Clothing at Iowa State University, professor Guowen Song and student researchers are working to improve upon some of the most basic gear for firefighters – heavy-duty gloves intended to protect against searing heat and sharp objects, and as a result too cumbersome for maneuverability. “The current gloves are not really designed to meet the basic elements of protection, comfort and functionality,” Song told the Cedar Rapids Gazette. “Firefighters lose more than 50% of their manual dexterity while wearing these gloves, and that can create a risk to their safety.” The three-year project is funded through a $1.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A man who was banished from the state as a condition of a criminal plea deal could be allowed back under a deal struck Monday, civil rights advocates say. The American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas says it has agreed to drop a civil lawsuit brought on behalf of Bo Dana Rupert in exchange for an amended Montgomery County plea agreement in a related criminal case against him. Court transcripts show Rupert pleaded no contest in 2017 to three felony counts of making a criminal threat and three misdemeanor counts of filing a false report. He was sentenced to 12 months’ probation, and the judge accepted a plea agreement under which he was banished from the state – two apparently incongruous terms. Under the new settlement, Montgomery County Attorney Larry Markle agreed not to prosecute Rupert for fleeing the state, which Rupert contends he did to comply with the banishment terms.\n\nKentucky\n\nGolden Pond: Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area is offering free cedar Christmas tree permits. The permits are available online through Christmas Eve. Permits, maps and guidelines are available online. The permits are also available in person at the park’s Administrative Office from Monday through Friday during the same period. Permits allow the holder to cut one cedar tree in specific areas of the park. Rules and regulations are available on the reservations page. The park says no matter where you get your tree, be sure it’s fresh and isn’t dry because it could catch fire. Water the tree daily, and place away from heat sources. Be sure lights are in good condition.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s farmers have collected more than $180 million from President Donald Trump’s multibillion-dollar bailout package for farmers hurt by the United States’ trade war with China. The Advocate reports that U.S. Department of Agriculture figures show more than 75% of that aid went to Louisiana soybean farmers. But some farmers say the program hasn’t been enough to cover their costs. They’re questioning whether they’ll continue to grow soybeans next year because the federal aid package isn’t offsetting all their losses. Soybeans are a major agricultural product in Louisiana, with a farm value of $800 million, second only to sugar cane. China is the biggest buyer of American soy.\n\nMaine\n\nBuxton: The town’s police say they need the public’s help locating feral pigs, if there are any living in the area. Buxton police ask that anyone who sees the pigs lurking in town should immediately contact the animal control officer. The Portland Press Herald reports the federal government has called on communities in Maine and elsewhere to report sightings of feral pigs or escaped domesticated hogs. Feral pigs represent a major invasive species problem around the country, but they haven’t yet been seen in Maine. They cause crop damage and can ruin private and public property. The public can report any sightings by calling Buxton police at 207-629-5178.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer is now a member of the U.S. Naval Academy’s Board of Visitors. Spicer was sworn in Monday during a board meeting in Annapolis. The board reviews the state of morale and discipline at the academy and its curriculum and fiscal affairs. It includes members of Congress. Spicer holds a master’s degree from the Naval War College in Rhode Island. He served as press secretary for President Donald Trump when he came into office. He resigned from the job in July 2017. The president announced in July that he was nominating Spicer to serve on the board.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nQuincy: The birthplace of the second president of the United States is undergoing restoration work. The Patriot Ledger reports a small historic home in Quincy where John Adams was born in 1735 had been buried under scaffolding as construction workers prepared to replace the south- and west-facing sides of the house. Kevin Kelly, facilities manager for the John Adams Birthplace, says the siding has not been replaced since 1984, and the restoration work is “greatly needed.” The home was built in 1722 by the former president’s father, Deacon John Adams. Kelly says the construction and restoration is expected to be completed before the national park reopens in May. The project is expected to cost $100,000 and will be funded by visitor fees.\n\nMichigan\n\nHickory Corners: A museum that boasts the largest vintage automobile collection in North America plans to open a new building to display muscle cars. The $5 million project at the Gilmore Car Museum would add more than 25,000 square feet of exhibit space. The groundbreaking is set for next year, with plans to open the new addition by 2021. Stacie Longwell Sadowski, the museum’s development and engagement manager, says the popularity of previous muscle car exhibits sparked the idea for the expansion. The museum in rural southwest Michigan currently has 20 muscle cars on display, which is expected to double. The Gilmore Car Museum says it has more than 500 vehicles, and the oldest car on exhibit is an 1899 Locomobile Steam Car.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Peter: Bob and Corrine Johnson got married as teens in southern Minnesota’s farm country and lived together for 68 years. KARE-TV reports they were to be laid to rest Tuesday – after dying 33 hours apart. They lived in their farm home near St. Peter until six months ago. After Bob was hospitalized with cancer, Corrine joined him there with congestive heart failure. He was 88. She was 87. One of their seven children, Dr. Bruce Johnson, says his father went downhill as soon as his mother died Nov. 24 and passed the next day. He says it’s hard to imagine it was a coincidence. Son Brent Johnson says his father always put others first, so it was only fitting that he waited for his mother to go first.\n\nMississippi\n\nMcComb: Residents are protesting a large pothole in their neighborhood by decorating it with holiday cheer. The Enterprise-Journal reports people in the Edgewood neighborhood have topped the pothole and its yellow traffic cone with tinsel, spray-painted pinecones, white leaves and what appear to be holly berries. The newspaper says residents plan to add lights and presents in the hopes of drawing the city’s attention. It’s unclear how long the pothole has gone unattended by the city or what drove residents to start cheerfully protesting it recently.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: State officials are buying a piece of equipment that simulates the experience of being in an earthquake to prepare residents for a big tremblor in a region that saw one of the most powerful earthquakes east of the Rocky Mountains in the 1800s. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the nearly $200,000 simulator is built into a large cargo trailer decorated like a small house. Special hydraulics shake it violently for 5 to 10 seconds, giving riders the feel of a magnitude 8.0 earthquake. It also illustrates how pictures and other household items can become projectiles if not properly secured. Armed with federal funding, the Missouri State Emergency Management Agency submitted documents last month seeking a no-bid contract to purchase the simulator. The plan is to use a two-person team to take the unit through the Bootheel region, where the New Madrid fault is located.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: State trust lands produced nearly $100 million in revenue for education and other recipients from July 2018 through June 2019. The $99.2 million in revenue from forestry, minerals, agriculture and real estate was up about $12 million from fiscal year 2018. However, it’s still well below the $188 million brought in in fiscal year 2010. The revenues dipped as low as $86 million in FY2017. The Independent Record reports the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation gave a ceremonial check for $46 million to Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen. The amount is about 5.5% of the Office of Public Instruction’s $840 million budget. Other money goes to the university system, the Montana School for the Deaf and Blind, the Montana Veterans Home and public buildings.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Nearly 800 Nebraska State Penitentiary inmates – more than half the Lincoln prison’s population – have signed a petition sent to state officials and various news outlets decrying conditions at the prison. The Lincoln Journal Star reports the petition pans administrators for putting the prison in modified lockdown. Because of the lockdown, meetings of self-betterment clubs or organizations have been limited or eliminated, and inmates have seen their use of the prison law library restricted. That restriction, the petition says, impedes prisoners’ access to the courts, attorneys, legislators, judges and other legal sources. The petition also cites multiple changes in policies, procedures, rules, memorandums, protocols and inmate movement as problems.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Environmentalists are warning that a planned geothermal energy plant in northern Nevada could threaten the habitat of a rare toad. The future of a big-eyed, freckled creature known as the Dixie Valley toad is at the center of an expected fight as environmentalists seek federal protection for the amphibian, the Las Vegas Sun reports. The toad, whose existence was unknown until a couple of years ago, lives around the thermal springs on the western edge of the Dixie Valley Playa, east of Reno. Ormat Technologies, the company that plans to build the geothermal energy plant, has proposed mitigation strategies to protect the toad’s habitat. The Dixie Valley toad’s habitat is restricted to fewer than 2.3 square miles, which makes it particularly vulnerable, according to the Center for Biological Diversity.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLebanon: Some counties in the Granite State are cutting back as demand for Meals on Wheels and other food programs for seniors exceeds funding. As of Sunday, the Grafton County Senior Citizens Council had eliminated dessert to save money after state and federal funding ran out. The nonprofit group has had to dip into its reserves to make up for a $125,000 shortfall. The Valley News reports that seven of the 10 agencies providing home-delivered meals in New Hampshire have faced deficits. Strafford Nutrition & Meals on Wheels eliminated Wednesday deliveries years ago and is looking at other measures as demand grows, such as cutting night meals. The Community Action Program for Belknap and Merrimack counties is also looking at options. It already has stopped delivering breakfast as a way to cut costs.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFort Lee: The centerpiece of the city’s holiday tree lighting has grown from a Charlie Brown tree to a 35-foot showstopper. The festivities now draw nearly 5,000 people. And employees start to decorate as early as the summer. This year’s tree lighting Thursday is expected to be the biggest yet, with a holiday carnival, bonfires, snow and, of course, Santa. The event takes place at the Fort Lee Community Center from 7 to 9 p.m. Besides the tree lighting, the community center becomes its own attraction, with nearly every inch of the building covered in 400,000 lights. The night will also include hot chocolate, a holiday carnival, a DJ, carnival rides, animated characters, snow machines, and a choreographed light and music show. Santa Claus will arrive on a Fort Lee firetruck.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A team of researchers is getting federal funding to analyze perishable artifacts to better understand the early inhabitants who lived in and around caves in southeastern New Mexico and West Texas. Officials say the region is under-researched, and the $200,000 grant from the Bureau of Land Management will help fund more work in the Guadalupe Mountains. The University of New Mexico is partnering with the Lincoln National Forest, the New Mexico Museum of Indian Arts and Culture, Guadalupe Mountains National Park, and the Carlsbad Museum and Art Center. The team will use existing museum collections to build a chronology of basket and sandal styles used by those who lived in the area centuries ago. They also will re-document two of the area’s rock shelter sites with new technologies, including a drone and photogrammetric mapping.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A federal judge has barred the state’s prison agency from taking any “adverse action” against correctional officers seeking a religious beard accommodation. The order signed last week is tied to a federal lawsuit filed in August and comes after additional correctional officers accused the prison department of discrimination in its handling of religious beards. Their concerns were outlined in court filings. The lawsuit argues the state prison agency discriminated against two Muslim correctional officers who were suspended over their beards. Attorney Joshua Moskovitz says the judge’s order prevents the agency from retaliating or harassing correctional officers who have a religious accommodation for beards or have applied for one with the agency.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nMaggie Valley: An elk has been running around western North Carolina with a shredded hammock on its head, and apparently a love of apples is to blame. News outlets report Jim Beaver told the Haywood County Sheriff’s Office on Thanksgiving that an elk was stuck in his yard with its antlers tangled up in a hammock. The sheriff’s office says on Facebook that Cpl. Ken Stiles climbed onto the roof, cut the hammock and freed the animal. Beaver says elks often eat apples in his yard and play with his hammock. This elk, however, was too playful. Beaver says he didn’t free the elk himself, in case it decided to attack. He told WLOS-TV that the elk, with pieces of the hammock still in its antlers, has returned to the house a few times.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A photo of Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg at a Native American reservation in the state has been archived at the Library of Congress in Washington. Photographer Shane Balkowitsch preserved the image on a glass plate and titled it “Standing For Us All.” The method known as “wet plate collodion” involves wetting glass with various chemicals before inserting the plate into a camera and developing the photo. Balkowitsch told the Bismarck Tribune it’s his “most important work to date.” The photo shows 16-year-old Thunberg looking into the distance during a visit to the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. She shared it on Twitter when she left North America on Nov. 13. Another image, a close-up of Thunberg’s face, will be featured at the Swedish History Museum in Stockholm.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: With the manmade chemicals known as PFAS – used in products including carpeting, cookware, microwave popcorn bags and firefighting foam – turning up in water and some foods across the U.S., Gov. Mike DeWine says the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency will coordinate the testing of nearly 1,500 public water systems serving communities, schools, day cares and mobile home parks. If the chemicals are detected, the EPA will work with public systems to reduce their levels. The state Health Department will also work with private water system owners on ways to reduce exposure and install treatment systems. The state hopes to complete sampling of public water systems by the end of next year.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s highest court admonished an Oklahoma County judge who failed to pay her taxes and more than 60 parking tickets, but it narrowly decided against filing a petition for her removal. In its 5-4 ruling Tuesday, the Oklahoma Supreme Court determined the allegations against District Judge Kendra Coleman didn’t warrant a trial to have her removed. In its order, the court admonished Coleman for neglecting to pay dozens of parking tickets and various tax obligations for several years. They also reprimanded her for failing to properly file campaign reports to the Oklahoma Ethics Commission. Coleman is facing a felony charge for failing to file state income tax returns. Neither Coleman nor her attorney returned telephone messages seeking comment.\n\nOregon\n\nCorvallis: Experts in this state that’s the nation’s No. 1 supplier of Christmas trees say prices for a holiday evergreen will remain higher this year due to a tight supply. Chal Landgren, with Oregon State University’s College of Forestry, says there are 400 fewer Oregon growers than there were 15 years ago, and land once used for Christmas trees is now being used for less labor-intensive crops. Many tree farms went out of business about a decade ago. On average, consumers paid $78 for a tree in 2018, up $3 from 2017. There are 383 licensed Christmas tree growers in Oregon who sell about 4.6 million trees a year. Most of those trees are sold in the Pacific Northwest, California, Nevada and Arizona. Mexico is the top international importer of Oregon trees.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nLanghorne: The Neshaminy School District will appeal a state commission’s ruling that it can continue to call its sports teams “Redskins” but must remove logos that “negatively stereotype Native Americans.” The school district board voted 9-0 Monday night to appeal last month’s ruling by the state Human Relations Commission, which also ordered the district to educate students about Native Americans. In a statement, the Bucks County district accused the commission of “unsubstantiated allegations of racism” and ordering actions that could cost nearly $1 million. In 2013, the commission, citing a complaint, accused Neshaminy of violating a state human relations law. The high school’s baseball team hats feature a tomahawk, the basketball team’s logo is a profile of a Native American warrior, and the football team is known as the “Skins.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: An anti-abortion group is saying it will appeal a decision by a Superior Court judge to dismiss a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the state’s abortion rights law passed this summer. The lawsuit was filed in June on behalf of Catholics for Life and other anti-abortion activists. They argued the law violates the state Constitution, which they said doesn’t guarantee the right to privacy for a woman seeking an abortion. The Providence Journal reports that after Judge Melissa Darigan dismissed the lawsuit Wednesday, an attorney for the anti-abortion activists tweeted that she plans to appeal the decision to the Rhode Island Supreme Court. The Reproductive Privacy Act – signed into law by Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo in June – codifies the 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling into state law.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The head of the state’s child welfare agency is asking for $127 million more next year to help turn around an embattled agency criticized for failing children. Department of Social Services Director Michael Leach is asking the General Assembly to boost the budget to pay for staff salary increases and the hiring of more caseworkers. The State newspaper reports those are among several spending hikes Leach sought in his first budget request to lawmakers. State budget writers say they aren’t yet sold on spending millions to fix an agency that has been slow to show results. But legislators say they’re encouraged that Leach has shown an eagerness to change agency culture. The department has struggled for years with heavy caseloads, low morale and high turnover of child welfare workers.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Minnehaha County Commission has accepted the resignation of the county state’s attorney in the wake of an investigation for workplace misconduct. Aaron McGowan, a Democrat who held the office since 2009, offered his resignation this week, citing his health and reporting about his work absences. The attorney general investigated McGowan in September over his extended work absences and reported that some employees had told investigators of incidents involving McGowan and alcohol. One employee reported that McGowan’s behavior made her feel uncomfortable. The county will pay McGowan $35,000 as part of an agreement not to sue. Commission Chairwoman Jean Bender said she would not comment on personnel issues.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state Capitol building is now lit for the holidays. Gov. Bill Lee and first lady Maria Lee celebrated “Christmas at the Capitol” on Monday night, overseeing the lighting of the large evergreen on display outside the Capitol building. The KIPP Academy choir from Nashville performed holiday songs before the tree lighting. The Lees then read “The Night Before Christmas” inside the Old Supreme Court Chamber inside the Capitol. The tree was donated by the Diane and Fay Hazen family from Maury County, said Laine Arnold, press secretary for Lee.\n\nTexas\n\nWaco: The Texas Commission on Judicial Conduct has issued a public warning to a judge who refuses to perform same-sex marriages. The Waco Tribune-Herald reports McLennan County Justice of the Peace Dianne Hensley has said her “Bible-believing” Christian conscience prohibits her from doing same-sex weddings. She believes she’s entitled to a “religious exemption.” Hensley has continued to perform opposite-sex weddings. In its order, the commission said Hensley is violating the Texas Code of Judicial Conduct by “casting doubt on her capacity to act impartially to persons appearing before her as a judge due to the person’s sexual orientation.” Hensley has 30 days to appeal the sanction. She and her attorney have both declined to comment on the commission’s warning.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The backlog of untested rape kits is growing in the state even after lawmakers passed a law in 2017 to address the issue, in part because of a lack of funding to hire an adequate number of technicians. The state crime lab asked for $2.4 million for 17 technicians but received $1.2 million to hire nine technicians, said Amy Lightfoot, the deputy director of the crime lab, KUTV-TV in Salt Lake City reports. “Unfortunately, what you’re looking at there is the result of a partially funded mandate,” Lightfoot said. The backlog sits at about 1,900 rape kits now. The state crime lab is on target to process an estimated 3,300 kits by July 2020, which would eliminate the backlog. The lab receives about 120 kits each month. She said the number of rape kits sent in has increased by 535% over the past six years.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Vermont Health Department is offering a new resource to help people learn about how cannabis affects peoples’ bodies, minds and health. The department announced Monday that it had launched a site called “Let’s Talk Cannabis.” The site offers facts, tips and other resources for audiences that include youth and young adults, people who are breastfeeding, parents and health care professionals. The possession of up to an ounce of cannabis is legal in Vermont for people over age 21. Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine says that as with all substance use, consumption of cannabis can be unhealthy. He says the site gives Vermonters the information they need to make safe and informed choices.\n\nVirginia\n\nFairfax County: Local firefighters are taking part in a study aimed at finding ways to reduce their exposure to carcinogens. WTOP-FM reports that the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue Department is partnering with the National Fire Protection Association Research Foundation on a four-phase study. Part of the focus of the study will be on how chemicals can cling to breathing equipment used by firefighters. Firefighters are exposed to toxic chemicals released into the air by burning buildings and vehicles. According to a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health study, firefighters are twice as likely to get skin and testicular cancer and mesothelioma.\n\nWashington\n\nNorth Bend: A movie theater in this small city was evacuated after authorities say a package labeled as containing a “highly contagious human substance” was sent there in error. KOMO reports the package contained a urine sample. Sgt. Paul Graham with Snoqualmie Police says the package arrived at the theater late Friday, and the theater manager found a box with the labeled liquid inside. The theater was evacuated, and local streets were closed as hazmat crews responded. Graham says the package was supposed to have been delivered to a medical clinic in Tacoma. It was unclear how it ended up more than 40 miles away in North Bend. Snoqualmie Police provide police services to North Bend.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBluefield: The city’s Holiday of Lights festival has officially opened. The annual holiday display in Bluefield City Park went up last week and will run until the end of December. The decorations include more than 1.2 million lights throughout the park’s 40 acres. Hay rides, trolley rides and, of course, Santa are part of the festivities. There’s no cost to see the lights, but certain activities come with a $3 fee.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Feminine hygiene products are now available for free in bathrooms at state office buildings. Gov. Tony Evers’ spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said Tuesday that the administration installed or converted menstrual product dispensers in state buildings, including the Capitol. She did not immediately have details on the cost or how many units were installed. Democratic state Rep. Melissa Sargent, of Madison, heralded the move as a win for all women who menstruate. Sargent has introduced bills for years to make tampons and sanitary napkins available for free in women’s bathrooms at state office buildings and schools. The bills have gone nowhere in the GOP-controlled Legislature. Sargent argues making the feminine hygiene products available is no different from having soap or toilet paper in any public bathroom.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The Wyoming Game and Fish Department says the number of state hunting and fishing licenses sold to women has seen a marked increase over the past decade. KGAB-AM reports that at the same time, men are buying slightly fewer hunting and fishing licenses. The agency says 30.5% more women are hunting in Wyoming compared to 10 years ago. Female anglers increased by 14.5% over that time. Meanwhile, the number of men participating in both activities is down by about 5%. Game and Fish Hunter and Angler Participation Coordinator Kathryn Boswell said the agency has been reaching out to women to get them more involved in outdoor activities, and women are starting to see hunting as an activity that is accessible to them.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/12/29/news-around-states/40907031/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nRogersville: A nonprofit group is accepting donations to help clean up Joe Wheeler State Park, which was badly damaged by a tornado earlier this month. The News Courier reported the Alabama State Parks Foundation will take contributions to restore the park near Rogersville. As many as 150 acres of land at the popular park was badly damaged, said superintendent Chad Davis. The damaged areas include campgrounds and day-use areas that are closed indefinitely. Dozens of trees are down and some buildings were damaged. The park would be working with the Alabama Forestry Commission during the cleanup, Davis said. The lodge, marina and some other areas have reopened at the park, which is located along park the Tennessee River. The weather service said it was struck by a twister with 110 mph maximum winds that left a trail of damage as wide as 500 yards.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Transportation officials have launched an updated monitoring system providing drivers real-time road and traffic conditions throughout the state. The Alaska Department of Transportation launched Friday the 511 road condition alert system designed to be more user- and mobile-friendly, the Anchorage Daily News reported. Users can set up notifications and alerts on personalized routes, zoom in and out of the map and click on areas to find out more information, department officials said. The old version was removed from the store and users must download the new version, she said. The system will show traffic speeds and integrates a Google-owned application Waze allowing users to report road conditions, closures or crashes, officials said. The system can be accessed by calling 511, visiting 511.alaska.gov or downloading the mobile app from Google Play or the App Store, officials said. About 450,000 travelers used the 511 website, more than 68,000 calls were made to the 511 phone system and the app was downloaded more than 9,000 times this year, department officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The mood along the streets of central Phoenix was lively, even before the Fiesta Bowl Parade officially began at 9 a.m. Saturday. Historic cars roared their engines as they drove through the blocked-off streets and children holding plastic balloon souvenirs waved hello to a team of police officers mounted on bicycles as they rode through the parade route ahead of its start. A sea of lawn chairs lined Central Avenue, with most of their occupants wrapped in blankets and clutching coffee-filled thermoses as the temperature hovered around 45 degrees — arguably a glacial temperature, by Phoenix standards anyway.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has announced plans for a new outpatient medical clinic in Fort Smith, which is expected to create about 100 jobs. The agency announced plans Thursday for the new clinic, which will have more than double the space now available at the existing VA clinic in Fort Smith. About 15,000 veterans in Crawford, Sebastian and Franklin counties use the facility, officials said. The larger clinic is expected to improve access to medical care for veterans in the area and create about 100 jobs, including positions for doctors, nurses and support staff, the Fort Smith Regional Chamber of Commerce said. The outpatient clinic will offer primary care, mental health, audiology, optometry, radiology and lab services.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: A federal judge has temporarily blocked a California law banning the import and sale of alligator and crocodile products. U.S. District Judge Kimberly J. Mueller also scheduled an April 24 hearing on Louisiana’s request for a longer-lasting order called a preliminary injunction. Both sides agreed to the temporary order, Mueller wrote. It was signed Sunday and made public Monday in online court records. Mueller noted that California is not conceding anything by agreeing to the temporary restraining order and might continue to enforce laws barring the importation of alligator and crocodile bodies and body parts that are forbidden under the Endangered Species Act. American alligators are one of only two alligator species. Chinese alligators are one of the world’s most endangered crocodilians but American alligators are thriving, partly with help from alligator farmers. Their harvest and sale remain regulated, for their own sake and, under an international treaty, because they look like some species that are endangered or threatened. American alligators were removed from the U.S. endangered species list in 1987. The alligator business has played a key part in bringing back the animals and is important in protecting marshes and swamps and other species that depend on wetlands, according to Louisiana’s lawsuit. The big reptiles don’t breed well in captivity, so farmers get permits to collect eggs from the big heaps of plants that alligators pile up as wetland nests. When the alligators hatched from those eggs are 3 to 5 feet long, the number that would have survived to that length in the wild must be returned to the wild, where most hatchlings get eaten if the eggs don’t get eaten first.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: A puppy that was thrown at a vehicle by a homeless man last week was adopted on Friday following a raffle organized by animal shelter officials. Officials with the Humane Society of the Pikes Peak Region set up the drawing in Pueblo. KKTV-TV reported the lucky winner is Beth Sisneros of Peyton. Shelter workers had dubbed the dog “Bob” and Sisneros renamed the pup, Buddy Junior. An anonymous donor paid for Buddy’s $400 adoption fee. The Pueblo Chieftain reported that the puppy was thrown by a man reportedly under the influence of meth at a vehicle that was occupied by a mother and her daughter Dec. 15, authorities said. Amanda Belcher was in the car with her daughter when she said the man approached her vehicle and threw the puppy at the roof of the vehicle with force, authorities said. The man was cited for animal cruelty, authorities said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Guided hikes will be offered on New Year’s Day at 15 parks and recreation areas across the state. The free First Day Hikes, which average one or two miles, are being hosted by the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. It’s part of America’s State Parks’ First Day Hikes initiative, which is taking place in all 50 states on Wednesday. The goal of the First Day hikes is to encourage people to get outside, exercise, enjoy nature and welcome the new year with friends and family. Parks staff and volunteers will lead the hikes. Information about the locations can be found on the Connecticut State Parks and Forests website. Some hikes, such as one planned at Burr Pond State Park in Torrington, allow dogs on leashes. But others, such as a hike through the Candlewood Hill Wildlife Management Area in Groton do not. Those looking for adventure might consider a moderate two-mile hike through Kettletown State Park in Southbury. First Day Hikes began more than 25 years ago at the Blue Hills Reservation, a state park south of Boston.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Davian Higgins-Reeves might not have been in her new home for the holidays, but she has the keys in her hands. She and her family will be living in a new Simonds Gardens home after receiving the keys during a home dedication ceremony by Habitat for Humanity of New Castle County. The home, the fourth either built or renovated by Habitat in Simonds Gardens, will get Higgins-Reeves out of an apartment she shares with her sister and cousin and into housing that will allow her to save money and have something she helped build. Higgins-Reeves, who got the keys Dec. 20 and is expected to move into the house in January, put in more than 250 hours of “sweat equity” – the term Habitat uses for the investment the owner provides before moving into a home. This can be anything from helping build the house to being engaged in their new community. Along with the sweat equity, families in the program attend financial coaching classes, home maintenance training and civic engagement training. Higgins-Reeves will be moving into her new home with her husband and her younger sister.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A 15-year-old boy was arrested nearly a month after two individuals were shot near the ZooLights display at the National Zoo, WUSA-TV reported. Police said on Nov. 30, a group of teens set off fireworks near the zoo, which some visitors mistook for gunshots. During this incident, police said a 15-year-old suspect approached two victims in the 2800 block of Connecticut Ave., Northwest and pulled out a handgun. Then, he shot the victims. The suspect fled the scene, and the victims were taken to a hospital for treatment of their nonlife-threatening injuries. D.C. Police said they arrested a 15-year-old boy from Pittsburgh and charged him with assault of a dangerous weapon (gun). Following the incident, zoo officials looked to increase security measures and tighten up safety precautions. National Zoo spokeswoman Pamela Baker-Masson said that zoo officials held a discussion with D.C. Police, the Smithsonian Office of Protection Services and Metro Transit Police following the shootings to determine what those safety precautions will look like and how they will be carried out. Following that discussion, Baker-Masson said there would be an increase in security staff, as well as temporary screening stations that will include bag checks and wanding. In addition to increased precautions in the zoo, Baker-Masson said D.C. Police would have a heavier presence outside the zoo, as well.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: A cat that went missing two years ago in Florida during Hurricane Irma has been reunited with the pet’s owner. The Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office tweeted late last week that the cat showed up at one of its offices in the Tampa area and deputies were hoping to find the owner. The sheriff’s office provided an update on Friday, saying that the owner had been traced via microchip after deputies took the cat to a local veterinarian. The sheriff’s office didn’t identify Eva’s owner but said the cat disappeared during the 2017 hurricane, whose path cut through the middle of Florida. “Tonight, the owner was reunited with Eva,” the sheriff’s office tweeted. “Eva is now living in luxury. MEOW, that is a great story!”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Supporters of Georgia’s South River are hoping it becomes more popular. They believe that if the river south of Atlanta was used more frequently for recreation, it might bring more funding and protection. The South River traverses for about 60 miles from East Point into DeKalb County, before it winds south through five more metro Atlanta counties into Jackson Lake Reservoir in Butts County, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Part of the South River traverses by Panola Mountain State Park, forming the border between DeKalb and Rockdale counties. The hope is that more use will give it added protection from development and pollution. Despite its history of sewage spills, water quality in the river has improved over the last two decades, officials said, and Jackie Echols, board president of the watershed alliance, said it is safe enough for recreational uses such as kayaking.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Authorities said a pilot mobile homeless center program has seen success after launching multiple inflatable tents at a park on Oahu. The Homeless Outreach and Navigations for Unsheltered Persons project set up 10 tents at Waipahu Cultural Garden Park this month, providing homeless people access to food, showers, restrooms and kennels for pets, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported. The 400-square-foot tents house up to 10 people each, authorities said. People housed in the tents are being helped by social services agencies to find more permanent housing solutions, authorities said. The program is a three-year, $6 million pilot project staffed by the Honolulu Police Department and Department of Community Services. The program expects to spend 90 days in Waipahu before moving to another city-owned park, officials said. More than 20 of those who stayed at the camp and were placed in shelters were from Waipahu, but others have come from Kakaako, Pearl City, Ewa Beach and Waianae, authorities said. The next location for the mobile shelter could be somewhere in the McCully or Moiliili area where many complaints have been received about large homeless encampments, Lambert said.\n\nIdaho\n\nHailey: Authorities said there have been five mountain lion attacks that have killed or injured dogs in the same central Idaho community in the past week. The Idaho State Journal reported a Labrador retriever was attacked early Saturday morning near Hailey after its owners let the dog outside in their unfenced backyard. It marked the fifth case in the Wood River Valley in the span of a week, according to the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. The Labrador has since recovered and returned home, but at least three other dogs have died. The state said there has been an increasing number of predators in the area because elk and mule deer can now be found there year-round. It urged residents to be vigilant in the early morning and evening hours.\n\nIllinois\n\nAurora: A man who made more than 27,000 crosses to commemorate victims of mass shootings across the country is retiring. Greg Zanis came to realize, after 23 years, his Crosses for Losses ministry was beginning to take a personal and financial toll on him, according to The Beacon-News. Zanis has set up crosses after the school shootings at Columbine, Sandy Hook and Parkland. He also placed crosses after the Las Vegas music festival shooting and the Orlando nightclub shooting. In 2016, he made more than 700 crosses that were carried along Michigan Avenue in Chicago to honor each person who had been killed that year. Earlier this year, Zanis found himself making crosses for his hometown of Aurora after a Henry Pratt Co. employee opened fire on his coworkers. Zanis said he hopes to pass on his ministry to the nonprofit Lutheran Church Charities of Northbrook.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:An electric car-sharing service that debuted in 2015 is pulling the plug on its network of rechargeable cars after residents failed to embrace the vehicles. Blue Indy will end its collaboration with the city of Indianapolis on May 21, saying in a statement that the car-sharing service would end “because we did not reach the level of activity required to be economically viable.” When Bolloré Logistics launched Blue Indy in Indiana’s capital in September 2015, the Paris-based company predicted it would be operating profitably by 2020, with at least 15,000 members, 200 stations and 500 cars. But as of August, Blue Indy had just 3,000 active members, a fifth of the total it had projected that it needed for profitability. And it had 92 stations and 200 cars – 80 fewer than it had two years ago. The Blue Indy project cost about $50 million, with the company investing $41 million, the city contributing $6 million and Indianapolis Power & Light Co. covering the remaining $3 million. The company did not say what would happen to the cars’ charging stations, which can be found all over Indianapolis.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:A dozen people have applied to fill a vacant seat on the Iowa Supreme Court left by the death in November of Chief Justice Mark Cady. Court officials said the State Judicial Nominating Commission will conduct interviews on Jan. 9 of the applicants. Those interviews, to be held in the Iowa Supreme Court courtroom in Des Moines, are open to the public. Following the interviews, the commission will select three nominees to be forwarded to Gov. Kim Reynolds. The Republican governor will then have 30 days to appoint the new justice from the three nominees. The applicants are Joel Barrows, a district judge from Bettendorf; Romonda Belcher, a district associate judge from Des Moines; Mary Chicchelly, a district judge from Cedar Rapids; Ames lawyer Timothy Gartin; David May, an Iowa Appeals Court judge from Polk City; Des Moines lawyer Matthew McDermott; Iowa City lawyer Craig Nierman; Muscatine County Attorney Alan Ostergren; Cedar Rapids lawyer Dana Oxley; assistant Iowa attorney general Lisa Reel Schmidt; Theresa Wilson, an assistant appellate defender; and Des Moines lawyer William Miller. Iowan residents can email written comments regarding applicants to the commission no later than 5 p.m. Jan. 7 to sjnc@iowa.gov.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A voluntary recall of several pork products produced in Clay Center will be issued on Monday because of possible listeria contamination, Kansas health officials said Saturday. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment said in a news release that Clay Center Locker Plant will issue the recall for any ready-to-eat product including smoked pork loins, ham hocks and smoked ham from the plant produced on Nov. 21. The department is urging the public not to consume any of the products, including those bought at the retail counter in the plant and hams that were delivered to the Future Farmers of America chapters in Clay Center and Chapman. To date, no illnesses have been linked with the recall, the department said. The department said the recall was initiated after tests from routine samplings by the state Agriculture Department found listeria monocytogenes. Listeria can cause serious and sometimes fatal infections in young children, frail or elderly people, and others with weakened immune systems.\n\nKentucky\n\nVersailles:Jim Beam was fined $600,000 earlier this month after a July warehouse fire sent a nearly 23-mile plume of alcohol into the Kentucky and Ohio rivers, killing fish. The distiller agreed to the fine in a Dec. 6 order from the Kentucky Energy and Environment Cabinet, The Courier-Journal reported. Jim Beam will also reimburse the state agency $112,000. The July 3 fire was started when lightning struck a massive barrel warehouse near the Woodford-Franklin County line. The blaze sent flames shooting into the night sky that could be seen for miles and generated so much heat that firetruck lights melted. About 40,000 barrels of aging whiskey were destroyed, with the runoff pouring into nearby Glenns Creek and then downstream into the rivers. The Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources found dead fish along 62 miles of Glenns Creek and the Kentucky River. There were also dead fish in the Ohio River, but Energy and Environment Cabinet spokesman John Mura has described the impact there as “negligible.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nDonaldsonville: Seven people have been arrested on charges of dogfighting in south Louisiana and officials said more arrests might be pending. Ascension Parish Sheriff Bobby Webre on Friday said deputies responded to a call regarding dogfighting at a residence in Donaldsonville on Dec. 20. Detectives rounded up 10 dogs, two of them had been fighting and were severely injured. One of the injured dogs died. Investigators also searched 10 vehicles left at the scene and seized drugs, guns, cash, dogfighting paraphernalia and drug paraphernalia, news outlets reported. “Cases of animal cruelty will always be taken seriously,” Webre said. “We will not tolerate dogfighting or anything like it in Ascension Parish.” Anyone with information about this case is urged to contact the Ascension Parish Sheriff’s Office at 225-621-4636.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A bill backed by Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine that is designed to protect animals by cutting down on illegal wildlife trafficking and poaching has been signed into law. Collins joined Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon in proposing the Rescuing Animals With Rewards Act. The proposal authorizes the federal government to offer financial rewards for information that leads to disruption of wildlife trafficking networks, the senators said. Illegal trafficking of wildlife is a “transnational crime that requires a coordinated and sustained global effort” to be stopped, Collins said. Collins and Merkley submitted their proposal in May. It has the support of numerous animal welfare organizations.\n\nMaryland\n\nForestville: Ulysses Currie, a powerful former Maryland lawmaker who was censured in an ethics scandal has died. He was 82. Currie’s wife, Shirley Gravely-Currie, told The Washington Post that he died Friday from advanced dementia at his home in Prince George’s County. The Democrat had represented the area as a state lawmaker for more than three decades until his term ended earlier this year. The son of a sharecropper, Currie was a teacher who rose to become a popular and leading black lawmaker. He was elected to the House of Delegates in 1986 and then elected to the state Senate in 1994. Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller praised his former colleague, saying his story “is the story of the best of our state and this country.” Currie was the chairman of the powerful Senate budget committee in 2002 but stepped down from the chairmanship when he was indicted in federal court in 2010 for failing to disclose work for a grocery store chain that paid him about $245,000 over several years. He was acquitted of all charges, including conspiracy, bribery and extortion. The Senate voted unanimously to censure him, making it the first time in 14 years the chamber had disciplined one of its own.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: A couple reunited for extra-sweet wedding vows at the same Dunkin’ Donuts where their young love splintered nearly 30 years ago. Valerie Sneade and Jason Roy were married Friday afternoon, joined by family, friends and customers buying coffee and pastries at the Dunkin’ Donuts on Grafton Street in Worcester. Sneade and Roy mostly didn’t see each other for 25 years after a conversation about their future at the same shop in 1992 led the young, in-love couple to step back from their relationship. Sneade blamed misunderstandings at the time and words that didn’t come out right. Roy joined the Navy, married and had three children. Sneade also had a first marriage and moved to Florida. She became a singer and actress, developing her own cabaret shows. Both later divorced. When Roy learned Sneade was performing a Valentine’s Day-themed musical revue in Worcester in February 2018, he showed up and sat in the front row. Three months later, she moved back to Massachusetts. Roy proposed that New Year’s Eve.\n\nMichigan\n\nGladstone: A small-town tradition in the Upper Peninsula spread holiday cheer and helped a charity. Firefighters riding in fire trucks went door-to-door last weekend in Gladstone, distributing candy canes while collecting food and $465.79 for the local St. Vincent de Paul branch. The Daily Press in Escanaba said the tradition started more than 20 years ago with five volunteers and one truck. Now more than 20 people are involved. Children eagerly looked out their windows as fire trucks decorated with Christmas lights went up and down Gladstone’s streets, playing holiday music. Stockings full of candy canes were donated by Walmart.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: An 11-year-old boy who was overcome by fumes at a western Minnesota grain silo has died, becoming the third victim to die from the farm accident that claimed his father and uncle, authorities said. Alex Boesl was pronounced dead on Friday, according to the Douglas County Sheriff’s Office. The boy had been hospitalized at Children’s Hospital of Minneapolis since breathing in the silage gas on Dec. 21. The boy’s father, 47-year-old Curt Boesl, and uncle, 49-year-old Steven Boesl, also died. Authorities said Curt Boesl and Alex were working on top of the silo near Millerville when they apparently were overcome by fumes. Steven Boesl tried to rescue his brother and nephew and also was overcome. By the time deputies arrived, all three were unconscious. Emergency responders removed the three from the silo. Ambulance personnel declared Steven Boesl dead at the scene. Curt Boesl died on the morning of Dec. 22. Community members in Millerville, a town of about 100 residents, have rallied around the Boesl families. A GoFundMe account set up to be split between the two families had raised more than $65,000 from about 800 donors as of Friday night, the Star Tribune reported.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is asking a federal appeals court to reconsider a ruling that said the state’s ban on most abortions at 15 weeks of pregnancy is unconstitutional. The ruling was issued Dec. 13 by a panel of three judges on the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, dealing a blow to those seeking to overturn the landmark Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. The next day, Republican Gov. Phil Bryant said he wants the state to appeal to the Supreme Court. Papers filed Friday are an in-between step. Mississippi is asking the full 5th Circuit to toss out the panel’s decision and reconsider the case. Attorneys for the state wrote that the panel’s decision conflicted with a Supreme Court ruling in an abortion case “which requires courts to consider not only the burdens a law might impose but the benefits that it provides.” The 5th Circuit panel said U.S. District Judge Carlton Reeves ruled correctly when he blocked the Mississippi law from taking effect in 2018.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state has stopped withholding union dues from the bimonthly paychecks of prison guards in what the union’s grievance officer calls a “pitiful attempt to bankrupt” the labor organization. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that the maneuver by Republican Gov. Mike Parson’s administration has left the Missouri Correctional Officers Association with a funding shortfall as it negotiates a new contract with the state for 5,000-plus guards and sergeants. The decision by the state was announced in a Dec. 9 letter from the Office of Administration, which Parson controls. Stacy Neal, director of the agency’s division of accounting, said in the letter that the state would no longer withhold union dues because the bargaining unit is not covered by an existing labor agreement. The union and the state have been negotiating a new contract since the old one expired Sept. 18. Union members have been working under the terms of the old contract since then. Missouri prison guards are among the lowest paid in the nation even after Parson earmarked money for raises in the current budget.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A minimum of $4 million should be raised to invest in much-needed improvements to Hell Creek State Park in order to make it a “genuine destination park” on Fort Peck Reservoir. That’s the recommendation of Tom Towe, a Billings attorney who was appointed as a special liaison to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Director Martha Williams, the Billings Gazette reported. Towe was appointed by Gov. Steve Bullock in 2017 to lead the discussion of funding for the park. He submitted his suggestions to Williams in a letter dated Dec. 18. The last Legislature’s investment of $700,000 into a new sewer and water system for Hell Creek also demonstrated a political will for supporting Hell Creek, he said. Towe got tangled in the fray that erupted when the previous park director was dismissed and the Legislature latched on to unused park funds. After he was dismissed by the governor, Towe negotiated his term as a liaison, despite the fact that he had lobbied to make state parks a separate entity from FWP. Now he is reporting to the FWP director. In his 13 page letter to director Williams, Towe “strongly” recommended that the lease be renewed with the Corps of Engineers so that the state could enter into a 20-year contract with a concessionaire to operate the marina and hotel. That facility is currently operated by Clint and Deb Thomas. Towe said the contract for the concessionaire should be put out for bid, without the state playing “favorites.”\n\nNebraska\n\nValentine: The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission has declared a fish salvage for Hackberry Lake on the Valentine National Wildlife Refuge. The lake was scheduled to have its existing fish population renovated during 2019 to eliminate common carp on the refuge. But the renovation was not completed because of wet conditions and unsuitable water levels. The Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said length limits are rescinded during the salvage, which runs through Sept. 30, but daily bag limits are maintained. Fish can be taken only by fishing or archery. Game fish can be taken by archery from July 1-Sept. 30, and nongame fish, such as common carp, can be taken any time. Salvaged fish cannot be sold or used for stocking into other public or private bodies of water.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Wildlife officials said the biggest threat to the state’s desert bighorn sheep is bacterial pneumonia, which continues to kill off entire herds statewide. The Las Vegas Sun reported that the problem was first identified in 2012 and has afflicted herds of the bighorn sheep across the U.S. Desert bighorn sheep, Nevada’s official state animal, number about 10,400. Pat Cummings, a game biologist for the Nevada Department of Wildlife, said officials have learned more about the origins and spread of the disease, but “it’s not in any kind of control.” Nevada Department of Wildlife veterinarian Peregrine Wolff said the sheep likely first caught the bacteria generations ago when they were brought to the U.S. from Europe. Wild bighorn sheep had no immunity to the bacteria, unlike domestic sheep, which has left them vulnerable. Wildlife officials are surveying the estimated 100 herds of bighorns in the state over the next few months. They’re collecting tissues from sheep in each herd to try to identify if they have any conditions that could make them more vulnerable once exposed to bacterial pneumonia, and try to determine what percentage of Nevada’s herds are infected.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHolderness: Registration opens soon for an annual program aimed at helping women learn skills for outdoor activities. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Department’s Winter Becoming an Outdoorswoman workshop will be held Feb. 22 at the Owl Brook Hunter Education Center in Holderness. Participants will choose among activities such as ice fishing, winter outdoor survival, snowshoeing and wildlife tracking and woodland target shooting. Registration will open Jan. 10.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nHamilton: A crane being used to remove a tree at a central New Jersey home somehow crashed into the residence on Friday, but authorities said no injuries were reported. The 63,000-pound tri-axle crane came down shortly after noon in Hamilton, while crews were working in the back yard of the Miry Brook Road home. The home sustained some damage in the accident, but the extent and severity was not immediately clear. The crane remained on the home for several hours as emergency responders secured the scene and sought to determine the safest way to right the machinery. The cause of the accident remains under investigation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: A future mother-in-law tasked with making a phone recording of her future son-in-law proposing to her daughter apparently missed the moment. She ended up recording a selfie on her reaction to what she was seeing. KOB-TV reported Susan Griego somehow took a selfie video of herself watching Benjamin Steele Bacon proposed to her daughter Amber. She did capture the moment Bacon popped the question to Amber by the penguin exhibit at the Albuquerque Biopark. The couple said the selfie video made the proposal more memorable. “People have asked about it. I feel like that’s kind of our relationship. Something wacky and random,” Amber said. “It’s the perfect start to this.” Her mother admitted she’s probably “not very good at photography.”\n\nNew York\n\nLatham: The New York Army and Air National Guard are on track to provide military honors at the burials of about 11,050 veterans during 2019, the state Division of Military & Naval Affairs said Saturday. The expected total is close to the numbers in the last two years. Among the veterans who received the honors this year was Sgt. Francis S. Currey, who was one of the last three surviving Medal of Honor recipients from World War II when he died in October at age 94. Currey, of Selkirk, received the medal for his actions during the Battle of the Bulge. The New York Army National Guard also provided honors for Pfc. Needham Mayes, who had successfully appealed to the Army to reverse his 1956 dishonorable discharge, allowing him to be buried in a veterans’ cemetery with military honors. Mayes, of New York City, died on Veterans Day at age 85. In New York, the burial honors generally involve two National Guard soldiers or airmen presenting an American flag to the veteran’s family and sounding taps on an electronic bugle.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFletcher: A small plane landed in a fiery crash near a western North Carolina airport late Saturday afternoon, officials said. There were no serious injuries reported. The crash occurred about 5:30 p.m. at the Western North Carolina Agricultural Center about a quarter-mile from the Asheville Regional Airport, according to local television stations. There were no fatalities and no one was taken to a hospital, Buncombe County Sheriff’s Office public information officer Aaron Sarver said, according to WYFF-TV. Citing the Federal Aviation Administration and emergency officials, WLOS-TV reported a Piper PA-32 crashed east of the airport into a parking lot as it was taking off. Social media posts showed fire and smoke coming from a plane. Firefighters also could be seen watering down wreckage. The crash occurred hours after a small airplane crashed in a Louisiana parking lot, killing five people who were on board.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: A man who was hunting pheasants in the Custer Mine area near Garrison on Thursday shot and killed a mountain lion that had emerged from tall grass and charged at him. Gary Gorney told the Minot Daily News that he expected to see a rooster pheasant after his German shorthaired dog had pointed to the area. Instead he was greeted by a female lion that weighed more than 100 pounds. Gorney said he doesn’t remember dropping his dad’s 100-year double-barrel shotgun and reaching for his 9-millimeter handgun underneath his jacket. “My instincts as a military law enforcement officer took over,” Gorney said. “There was no thought process. It was self-defense.” The lion came within 10 feet of Gorney before she was shot. Both of his dogs sprang into action and jumped on the lion. Gorney said he wanted to pull them off but “wasn’t going anywhere near that lion.” Gorney, who has a picture of himself holding the big cat, said it was the first mountain lion he had seen in 31 years of hunting. He said the grass perfectly matched the lion’s coat.\n\nOhio\n\nAda: A town long associated with the manufacturing of footballs has set a Guinness World Record for the most thrown at the same time. The organization certified the record after the attempt was made Oct. 25 by 950 people simultaneously throwing a football on the Ada War Memorial Stadium football field, the Lima News reported last week. Students from kindergarten through 12th grade joined teachers, coaches, bus drivers, school staff and community members to set the record. The Wilson Football Factory in Ada donated more than 1,000 commemorative footballs for the attempt. Workers at the factory make about 3,000 footballs a day, cutting, stitching and lacing each by hand in a 25-step process. The company supplies the football used by the NFL.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group seeking to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Oklahoma refiled their petition on Friday after facing a fierce backlash over what the plan might do to the state’s burgeoning medical marijuana industry. Two Oklahoma City residents – Michelle Tilley and Ryan Kiesel – filed the new paperwork for State Question 807 with the Oklahoma Secretary of State’s Office. Tilley said the petition was redrafted to make sure there were greater protections for the existing medical marijuana industry and its patients. Kiesel is the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Oklahoma. The state question also includes provisions that would allow certain people with previous marijuana convictions to be resentenced or have their criminal records expunged. Once the petition clears a review and challenge period, organizers will have 90 days to gather nearly 178,000 signatures from registered voters to qualify the question for the ballot. A second, separate petition to decriminalize marijuana in Oklahoma also was filed Friday by a Tulsa man, Paul Tay.\n\nOregon\n\nCloverdale: Authorities are searching for information after three garbage bags full of the remains of ducks and geese were found near the Oregon coast. Oregon State Police said in a release that a person walking their dog on Thursday near the Nestucca River in Tillamook County reported the gruesome discovery. Eight geese and five ducks were found in the garbage bags, with the breast meat removed from three of the geese. The remains were found near where the Cloverdale Boat Launch and the Cloverdale Water District building are located. Anyone with information should contact Oregon State Police troopers in the fish and wildlife division\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHouston: Officials said a large western Pennsylvania public burial ground thought to contain hundreds of remains actually has many more than previously thought – and there’s a new resource available to those who believe a relative might be buried there. Potter’s Field – a term for common graves, those for paupers or unclaimed bodies – was believed to contain as many as 502 people, many of whom might have fallen victim to tuberculosis, The (Washington) Observer-Reporter reported. But research conducted at the behest of Commissioner Harlan Shober, encompassing records kept for 66 years until 1945, concludes that more than 1,300 were likely buried there in unmarked graves. In 1830, state lawmakers mandated that the county care for the poorest of its residents, which often included burial in unmarked graves. Almost 300 grave markers – bearing no names, only numbers – dot the hillside on a field near the site of the old Washington County Home for the Poor in Chartiers Township. A ledger contained the names of 57 people buried from 1879 to 1882, and another microfilm list had deaths from 1912 to 1921. The rest of the data was transcribed from an old, leather-bound ledger listing all deaths at the Washington County Home for the Poor and everyone buried in Potters’ Field from 1912 to 1945, she said. A brief history of the Washington County poor farm, orphanage and homes for aged men and aged women is posted on the county website. The database is available through http://pottersfield.washcopa.org/PottersField/index.aspx.\n\nRhode Island\n\nCranston: The state will receive an extra $50 million in federal funds for bridge improvement and repair projects. The funding was included in a new federal transportation legislation co-authored by Democratic U.S. Senator Jack Reed, the ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation and Housing and Urban Development. The federal transportation bill was signed into law earlier this month. Reed said the additional funds, the maximum amount allowable, will help finance repairs to six bridges in Cranston and Providence. Four of them are considered structurally deficient. Reed said the state has received nearly $350 million in federal funds for road, bridge and mass transit improvements in 2019.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Minimum wage employees of Bon Secours St. Francis Health System are in line for a raise. Salaries for those workers are going up to $15 an hour by 2022, the hospital’s parent company, Bon Secours Mercy Health, announced last week. The move is designed to provide employees and their families “a dignified livelihood while working, and in retirement,” officials said in a news release. More than 8,100 employees, or 14% of the system’s 60,000 workers, will be affected by the change, which represents an additional $17 million investment over the next three years, officials said. Bon Secours St. Francis Health System had 3,452 employees in South Carolina in 2017, according to tax filings. Larry Pitts, human resources director for the hospital, said 475 employees will be affected by the increase locally, The Greenville News reported. The move will make the hospital more competitive by attracting health care workers and reducing turnover, he added. The increase will be phased in at all of the system’s U.S. markets, adjusted for cost of living variances. Exceptions include union workers whose wages are negotiated as part of their collective bargaining agreements, or about 7% of the workforce, and the Ireland market, which joined the health system in 2019, officials said. The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. South Carolina’s minimum wage is also $7.25 according to the National Employment Law Project.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: Two Sturgis police officers who pulled a man from a burning home in May 2018 are among 18 people selected to receive Carnegie Medals, known as the nation’s highest civilian award for heroism. Sturgis Police Sgt. Christopher Schmoker and Officer Dylan Goetsch are being recognized by the Carnegie Hero Fund Commission for rescuing Jason McKee, who had passed out from heavy smoke in an upper-level bedroom., the Rapid City Journal reported. Using water-soaked clothing tied around their faces as makeshift masks, the officers dragged McKee’s unconscious body down a stairway and got him to the home’s front door, seconds before the fire overtook the living room and hallway where they had just been.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: Officials said a bear that decided to make its way through the University of Tennessee campus ended up stuck inside the baseball stadium. The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency said in a Facebook post that the bear was reported on the Knoxville campus and stuck inside Lindsey Nelson Stadium early Sunday morning. Wildlife Sgt. Roy Smith and Wildlife Officer Jeff Roberson responded to the scene, where they quickly tranquilized and removed the bear with the help of University of Tennessee police officers. The agency did not say how the bear got stuck inside the stadium. State officials will now transport and release the bear to a “more suitable bear habitat.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The limestone cliffs of Santa Elena Canyon in Big Bend National Park will soon adorn priority mail postage stamps across the country. Designed by art director Greg Breeding with original art by Dan Cosgrove, the stamp depicts the Rio Grande flowing through the 1,500-feet-high canyon, one of the park’s most visited destinations. The stamp, to be released Jan. 18, is part of a focus in 2020 on stamps that celebrate “the people, events and cultural milestones unique to the history of the United States,” according to a release from the Postal Service. The Postal Service receives about 30,000 suggestions annually for stamp ideas. The Citizens’ Stamp Advisory Committee, made up of experts in fields such as history, science and art, review the suggestions and pare down a list for the Postmaster General. Priority mail delivers a package anywhere in the United States in one to three days.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Utah is about to start requiring nonresidents to get a new type of permit for using an off-highway vehicle in state parks or on public lands. KSL-TV reports that the $30 permit good for 12 months is a result of Utah dropping its recognition of off-highway vehicle registrations from Nevada or any other state. The new requirement takes effect Wednesday. Utah State Parks officials said revenue from permit sales will support recreational areas. Program coordinator Chris Haller said that fewer and fewer states have honored each other’s permits and that only 13 had reciprocity with Utah at the beginning of 2019.\n\nVermont\n\nLewis: The Department of Fish and Wildlife is celebrating eight years of improving trout habitat in northeastern Vermont rivers and streams. Trout thrive in streams that offer places to hide, such as under trees that have fallen into the streams. Fallen trees also create a mix of pools and shallow areas that are used by trout for feeding, reproducing, avoiding high flows and hiding from predators. The Caledonian Record reported that more than 27 miles of brook trout streams have been improved by the placement of large trees in strategic locations. A six-year study in the East Branch Nulhegan River watershed found that on average brook trout abundance tripled in just three years at sites with added trees. The fallen trees store sediment and organic material, helping to reduce the flow downstream of sediment, nutrients and slow runoff, reducing downstream flooding. The work has been done by a variety of organizations including Vermont Fish and Wildlife Department, Trout Unlimited on lands owned by Weyerhaeuser and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: One of the largest school districts in the United States has announced that it will allow students one excused absence per school year to participate civic activities such as protests. Fairfax County Public Schools in Virginia plans to start allowing the absences on Jan. 27, news outlets reported. The district is the largest school system in the state. Students in seventh through 12th grades can use the day for “civic engagement activities” such as attending marches or meeting with lawmakers, according to district spokeswoman Lucy Caldwell. The new policy was introduced by Fairfax School Board member Ryan McElveen, according to The Washington Post. He said the rule might be the first of its kind in the U.S. Students must give at least two days notice before the absence, school officials said. A parent or guardian has to give permission and students must fill out a form to explain the reason they’re missing school, McElveen said. To address worries about accreditation, the student must stop by their school campus at least once on the day of their excused absence, McElveen said.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: A memorial service has been scheduled for a western Washington sheriff’s deputy who died in a car crash while rushing to assist other officers. Pierce County Sheriff’s Deputy Cooper Dyson, 25, will be honored with a public service at 1 p.m. Monday at the Tacoma Dome. The street procession will begin at 11 a.m. at Joint Base Lewis-McChord. Dyson died on Dec. 21 after his patrol car crashed into a commercial building while he was on his way to back up two fellow officers dispatched to a house in Parkland for an urgent domestic violence call. Dyson had been with the department since 2018. He is survived by his 2-year-old child and his pregnant wife. It was the first motor vehicle collision death of a Pierce County Sheriff’s deputy since 1941.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: West Virginia Secretary of State Mac Warner announced the formation of a committee to plan events commemorating the passage of the 19th Amendment in 1920, which gave women the right to vote. Kat Williams, a professor of U.S. women’s history at Marshall University, is helping with the planning. “There will be marches; there will be speeches; and there will be a number of different, exciting events,” she told The Herald-Dispatch. One of the committee’s main goals is to raise awareness of the milestone and its importance, she said. Williams is teaching a special class in the spring 2020 semester that will discuss the history of U.S. women since the passage of the amendment. Helen Gibbins, president of the League of Women Voters of the Huntington Area, said her group is helping to plan local and statewide events. They include a parade on Women’s Equality Day in August, which will begin on Marshall’s campus. A “Right to Vote” Reader’s Theater that the League has performed in years prior will have a special focus on women’s suffrage in 2020, Gibbons said. A complete list of events statewide will be released by the Secretary of State’s Office at the start of the new year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:A water main break flooded streets just south of Interstate 94 in Milwaukee on Saturday. The water main ruptured Saturday morning in the area of Hawley Road and Main Street. Law enforcement rerouted traffic and closed off-ramps on the interstate at Hawley Road. Numerous vehicles were partially submerged. Twitter users posted videos showing water gushing down roads into yards and parking lots, and drivers walking in thigh-high water to reach their vehicles and move them to higher ground, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The cause of the break was not immediately reported.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Landowners have raised concerns about health risks after a potential drilling project was announced near city limits. Samson Energy Company has announced plans to drill 10 to 15 oil wells east of Cheyenne, The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported. The drilling spacing units run from Iron Mountain Road in the north to Interstate 80 in the south and were approved by the Wyoming Oil and Gas Conservation Commission, company officials said. The project would remain 1,000 feet from any occupied structure and cannot even cover the entire area, company officials said. Application for the drilling permit will narrow where the drilling will occur, officials said. Part of the proposed 12-square-mile zone falls within city limits, landowners and residents said. An October report from the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment found people living within 2,000 feet of fracking sites could face an elevated risk of short-term health issues like nosebleeds, headaches, breathing trouble and dizziness, said Wayne Lax, vice president of the landowners coalition. Drilling could begin next summer if permits are approved, company officials said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/08/01/back-school-bash-right-whale-protections-shark-sightings-news-around-states/50550055/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state’s prison system said Friday the execution of Joe Nathan James Jr. on Thursday night was delayed 3 hours because of the time it took to establish an intravenous line to the inmate. The state offered more information on Friday about the hourslong delay that observers said was troubling and unusual. A statement from the Alabama Department of Corrections did not elaborate on how long it took to establish the intravenous line or how many attempts were made. But a prison system spokeswoman confirmed the delay happened because of the time required to establish the IV connection. James was put to death for the 1994 murder of his ex-girlfriend Faith Hall, 26, more than 3 hours after the procedure originally was supposed to begin. The execution was set for 6 p.m. and the U.S. Supreme Court denied James’ request for a stay at 5:24 p.m. Reporters were taken to the grounds of Holman prison by van at about 6:30 p.m. to witness the execution, which did not get underway until about 9:04 p.m. The inmate was pronounced dead at 9:27 p.m. A delay of that length is unusual compared to executions conducted in Alabama in recent years.\n\nAlaska\n\nHaines: More than a year and half later, local and out-of-state organizations are still helping to repair damage from the dozens of landslides that occurred around the borough. The recovery work has evolved over time, said members of the Haines Long Term Recovery Group and other organizations involved in recovery efforts. The landslides, driven by unusually heavy rain, killed two, but were scarcely limited to that, said Sylvia Heinz, coordinator for the LTRG. Smaller landslides across Haines, which has a population of about 2,500, cut off roads, washed through houses and destroyed buildings. Heinz said there’s roughly 50 cases the LTRG is still dealing with, with issues ranging from damaged foundations to broken doors and windows, washed out culverts, driveways rendered impassable or physical or water damage from sliding debris. During the initial response, the borough focused its response on infrastructure projects that would be paid for or reimbursed by Federal Emergency Management Agency, while other organizations focused on individual homeowners, said Harriet Brouillette, tribal administrator for the Chilkoot Indian Association. Organizations had to scramble to help out individual homeowners while the borough government focused on different projects.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Michael Sullivan, a law enforcement official overseeing police reform in Baltimore, has been tapped to lead the Phoenix Police Department, which has been the subject of a wide-ranging civil rights investigation. Sullivan, the deputy commissioner of compliance in Baltimore, will join the Phoenix agency in September as interim chief. He’s expected to serve up to two years while the city – the fifth-largest in the U.S. – searches for a permanent chief. The U.S. Department of Justice is looking into whether officers in Phoenix have used excessive force, abused people with disabilities and people experiencing homelessness, engaged in discriminatory policing practices and retaliated against people exercising free speech, which is protected under the First Amendment. The investigation began last August. Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams announced in May that she’s retiring after a 33-year career in law enforcement, including six as chief. She’s expected to help Sullivan transition into the job.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Supporters of a recreational marijuana initiative have turned in the required number of valid signatures, moving the measure closer to appearing on Arkansas’ ballot this fall, election officials said. A spokesman for the secretary of state’s office said supporters of the proposed constitutional amendment had reached the 89,151 valid signatures from registered voters needed to qualify for the November ballot. The proposal’s name and ballot title still must be approved by the state Board of Election Commissioners to qualify for the ballot. The board is expected to review the measure Wednesday. More than 192,000 signatures were submitted July 8 for the proposal to allow people age 21 and older to possess up to one ounce of cannabis. Arkansas voters in 2016 voted to legalize medical marijuana in the state. The secretary of state’s office did not have a final count on the number of valid signatures verified yet.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: The Bay Area Rapid Transit system is again requiring masks for travelers and employees. BART’s board of directors voted to immediately reinstate the mask mandate on all trains and in stations beyond ticket gates. It runs through Oct. 1 unless it’s extended again. The previous mask mandate started in April and ended on July 18. For 10 days, masking was optional but highly encouraged. BART serves commuters in San Francisco, San Mateo, Alameda, Contra Costa and Santa Clara counties. The board’s vote came hours after Los Angeles County public health officials dropped a plan to impose a universal indoor mask mandate last week as COVID-19 infections and rates of hospitalizations have stabilized. San Francisco and Los Angeles counties are at the “high” level of community transmission set by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nColorado\n\nKeystone: The U.S. Forest Service has stopped construction of a ski resort expansion after contractors mistakenly demolished protected alpine tundra for a temporary road. Officials raised their concern after seeing crews carving the new path into the protected land, beyond the area that the Forest Service and resort had initially agreed upon, The Colorado Sun reported. “We were surprised and disappointed to see this for sure,” said Scott Fitzwilliams, the supervisor of the White River National Forest for the U.S. Forest Service, adding the mistake “is not a catastrophic ecological event.” The federal agency issued a cease-and-desist letter in early July, suspending development of Keystone resort’s 555-acre expansion until the environmental impacts of the unauthorized road are measured. That could delay the opening of the the resort’s 16-trail expansion this winter, one of the largest capital investment plans in the resort industry. The company has since hired a restoration firm to help mitigate and repair the damage.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state plans to install equipment designed to help prevent drivers from going the wrong way down the state’s highways after nearly a dozen wrong-way crashes led to 20 deaths this year. The effort came as transportation officials nationwide struggle to curtail a surge in fatalities on U.S. roads that began during the coronavirus pandemic. Connecticut’s $20 million planned program would install cameras on wrong-way signs across the state that will trigger flashing lights when a wrong-way driver is detected. There have been 11 fatal wrong-way accidents this year in the state, resulting in 20 deaths, according to statistics from the the Connecticut Transportation Institute at the University of Connecticut. That’s up from three fatal wrong-way crashes in 2020 and four in 2021, according to the Institute. The latest fatal crash occurred Sunday in Bridgeport. A van traveling the wrong way on Route 8 struck a car carrying a mother and her two children, police said. The mother was killed along with a passenger in the van. Officials said about 80% of the accidents involved drivers impaired by alcohol or other substances.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:Former mortgage lender Trident Mortgage Company, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, must provide mortgage subsidies of up to $10,000 to homeowners in minority neighborhoods after claims of redlining, the Delaware Department of Justice said. The company continues to deny any wrongdoing amid the $20 million multistate settlement. Redlining, the practice of denying services to residents in minority neighborhoods, is prohibited by the Delaware Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Delaware Consumer Fraud Act. “Redlining is one of the modern era’s most damaging and insidious forms of racism,” Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings said in a written statement. “Few practices have done more to enforce de facto segregation in our communities.” Jennings worked with officials in New Jersey and Pennsylvania to reach Wednesday’s settlement. Although Trident was based in Devon, Pennsylvania, until its closure in December 2020, its services reached into nearby counties and states, including New Castle County. Its affiliate company Fox & Roach Realtors – which the Delaware DOJ said shared many customers with Trident – still operates in Delaware.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A mother on unemployment benefits said she has been left without weekly payments for four weeks after a breach in her D.C. Department of Employment Services account, WUSA-TV reported. Christina Paul said she first noticed something was wrong when she was unable to access her account June 8. After contacting the agency, she was informed her payment method had been changed from a debit card to a direct deposit, and her email had been changed. Since then, Paul said her account has been changed at least five times with new bank accounts and emails she does recognize. She has reported the incident to DC Police, but for the past month she has not received any payments leaving her out $1,6000. Paul said representatives from the agency told her the agency;s system had been breached. She said she was also told by the agency that her funds could not be distributed until the office recuperated the money. D.C.’s Department of Employment Services denied the security issue is from a potential hacking. The agency said it continues to aggressively work to minimize opportunities for cybercriminals to be successful and to mitigate risks. It is asking anyone who believes their funds have been improperly issued in their name to contact their office at (877)- 372-8360.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: The Miami-Dade School Board rescinded a decision made last week that rejected new sex education textbooks for middle and high school students. The debate over the sex education materials in Miami took place as school districts and boards navigate a new landscape in Florida classrooms over what officials deem appropriate content. Miami-Dade County has the nation’s fourth-largest public school system, with 334,000 students. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed new laws this year that prevent teachers from talking about gender identity and sexual orientation to third graders and younger and limiting how race can be discussed. The board approved the textbooks after Chair Perla Tabares Hantman changed her mind last week, citing the district needs to follow state standards and curriculum requirements. Hantman added the books are online and content that is not age appropriate is not accessible. She clarified parents are also allowed to opt their children out from lessons on sex education, tasking school officials with making a strong effort to let parents know.\n\nGeorgia\n\nMcDonough: Gov. Brian Kemp is using federal COVID-19 relief money to give teachers another $125 to buy school supplies, months after issuing a similar stipend. Kemp, a Republican running for reelection, made the announcement Friday at Ola High School in Henry County before teachers preparing for school to start this week. He said he learned firsthand how much teachers can spend buying supplies, learning aids and decorations for their classroom when his daughter started teaching first grade last year in Oconee County. Although January’s $125 supplement went only to teachers and paraprofessional teacher aides, state education officials said the new supplement will include others who provide instructional support on a daily basis, including counselors, librarians, school nurses and speech language pathologists. The last supplement cost about $15.9 million, said Kemp spokesperson Katie Byrd. She said the total cost for this round of spending has yet to be completed. Teachers and others will get allocations in an online platform that they can use to order supplies. The money comes from federal COVID-19 aid that Kemp can give to schools. Georgia got two rounds of funding for public schools totaling $173 million that has been spent, plus $79 million in money for emergency aid to private schools. Kemp spokesperson Katie Byrd said that because of federal requirements for spending the money, Georgia has $59.7 million left over in the nonpublic school account. She said federal education officials are letting states spend that money on public schools at Kemp’s discretion. The school supply grants are the first spending announced from those funds.\n\nHawaii\n\nMaui: Fire crews and helicopters were fighting a wildfire Saturday night on Maui near Paia Bay. The Maui County Emergency Management Agency said roads have been closed and have advised residents and travelers to avoid the area. It is unknown how many acres have burned. A red-flag warning was in effect Sunday.\n\nIdaho\n\nSalmon: The Moose Fire in the Salmon-Challis National Forest has burned on more than 75 square miles in timbered land near the town of Salmon. It was 21% contained by Sunday morning. Pila Malolo, planning operations section chief on the fire, said in a Facebook video update that hot, dry conditions were expected to persist Sunday. Officials said they expected fire growth in steep, rugged country on the fire’s south side.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Google is moving into the Thompson Center, the iconic state building in downtown Chicago, officials said. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state is selling the building to a developer for $30 million in cash and also getting another downtown building valued at $75 million. Google, which has more than 1,800 employees in Chicago, said it will control the building after a major renovation and occupy it by 2026. The Thompson Center, a hulking all-glass building designed by Helmut Jahn, opened in 1985 as the State of Illinois Center. It was renamed in 1993 for James “Big Jim” Thompson, who served as governor from 1977-91. JRTC Holdings LLC will renovate the Thompson Center to meet Google’s needs. The state, meanwhile, will move nearly 1,800 employees from the Thompson Center and other downtown office space to the newly acquired building on South LaSalle Street.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: State senators narrowly passed a near-total abortion ban Saturday during a rare weekend session, sending the bill to the House after a contentious week of arguments over whether to allow exceptions for rape and incest. The Republican-controlled Senate voted 26-20 after about 3 hours of debate, passing the bill with the minimum 26 votes needed to send it to the House, which Republicans also control. The bill would prohibit abortions from the time a fertilized egg implants in a uterus. Exceptions would be allowed in cases of rape and incest, but a patient seeking an abortion for either reason would have to sign a notarized affidavit attesting to the attack. Indiana is one of the first Republican-controlled states to debate tighter abortion laws since the U.S. Supreme Court last month overturned Roe v. Wade. But the GOP splintered after the rape and incest exceptions remained in the bill Thursday, when an amendment failed that would have stripped out those exceptions. Ten Republican senators voted against the legislation Saturday, including a handful who support abortion rights. House Speaker Todd Huston on Friday declined to discuss specifics of the Senate bill. But he said he supports the rape and incest exceptions.\n\nIowa\n\nDubuque: Dubuque County Conservation has been making steady progress in developing its canoeing and kayaking infrastructure, with the intended destination of a countywide water trail in the coming years. The development of kayaking opportunities was identified as a top priority through public input gathered during the department’s long-term strategic planning process in 2020. In response, Dubuque County funded a recently completed project at Bowstring Wildlife Area to create better water access for paddlers and further the county’s water quality improvement goals. The conservation department recently finished a streambank stabilization project in the wildlife area along Lytle Creek, a project that included seeding the banks with prairie grasses. Workers installed a crossing on the creek so conservation staff can maintain the prairie, but it also will serve as a kayak launch point. Dubuque County will be the second area county to finish a water trail plan. Delaware County officials previously developed one for the Maquoketa River, which helped lead to the development of Manchester Whitewater Park.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A law allowing deadly force against an attacker doesn’t protect people from prosecution if a bystander is injured, the state’s highest court ruled. The Kansas Supreme Court ruled in the case of a Wichita police officer whose shots at a charging dog wounded a 9-year-old girl. The justices ordered a trial in Sedgwick County District Court for former Officer Dexter Betts on a charge of felony reckless aggravated battery. The December 2017 shooting happened after Betts and other officers responded to a call about domestic violence and a suicide threat at a Wichita home. Once inside, the dog charged at Betts, and he fired twice. His shots missed and hit the floor, and bullet fragments hit the girl above an eye and on a toe, according to the court’s decision. Betts argued he acted in self defense. A judge dismissed the case before trial, and the Kansas Court of Appeals upheld that decision. But Supreme Court Justice Dan Biles, writing for a unanimous state Supreme Court, said Kansas law grants immunity from prosecution for force used specifically against an attacker and doesn’t mention bystanders. Jess Hoeme, Betts’ attorney, said he believes Betts will be acquitted at trial, but expressed concern that the ruling could hinder law enforcement and endanger officers. Hoeme said the ruling is “unfortunate” because Betts didn’t intend to hurt any person while shooting and the bullets fragmented. But prosecutors have argued that Betts acted recklessly in shooting at the dog with the girl nearby. A conviction on a reckless aggravated battery charge for a first-time offender carries a presumed sentence of 18 months’ probation.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Jefferson County Public Schools offered to continue providing adult education services until June 30, 2023, a spokesperson for Kentucky’s Education and Workforce Development Cabinet said. “At that time, JCPS will review the success of their adult education services against federal performance indicators and state achievement goals to determine if they will seek renewal for the remaining two years of the original contract,” spokesperson Rosalind Harvey said. Kentucky’s largest school district previously told state officials it would be cutting a three-year contract to provide adult education in Louisville short, ending the program in December and shifting the responsibility of the program to another entity. The move blindsided those working in the adult education program, many of whom began contacting school board members and reporters to protest the change. Although district officials signaled the decision was final, school board chairwoman Diane Porter said the decision to end district control of the program rests with the board.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBelle Chasse: The state has completed one of its largest coastal restoration projects yet, and is at work on even larger ones. The dredge used to suck up sediment from the Gulf of Mexico to add 1,000 acres of habitat to sites in the Terrebonne Basin is now at work in the Mississippi River, doing the same for a 1,600-acre project that’s further east and named for a historic Plaquemines Parish outlet called Spanish Pass, officials said last week. “These are key examples of our front-line defense” against hurricanes, said Bren Haase, executive director of the state Coastal Preservation and Restoration Authority. They had been eaten away by erosion and subsidence – and by sea level rise. On Tuesday, the authority announced completion of another project – the addition of about 256 acres of beach and dune and 143 acres of marsh on West Grand Terre Island. Barrier islands and marshes slow storm surge, so the work protects people and buildings on shore while providing a habitat for plants and animals. The Spanish Pass project starts just outside the Plaquemines Parish town of Venice. The fragility of the wetlands fringing Louisiana’s coast was illustrated less than a minute by seaplane from the project’s west end. In that spot, trees grow in parallel lines on relatively high ground in open water. They mark the banks of canals dredged through marshes that no longer exist.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Vessels off the East Coast must slow more often to help save North Atlantic right whales from extinction, the federal government said. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration made the announcement via new proposed rules designed to prevent ships colliding with the whales. Vessel strikes and entanglement in fishing gear are the largest threats to the giant mammals, which number less than 340 and are falling in population. Efforts to save the whales have long focused on fishing gear, especially that used by East Coast lobster fishermen. The proposed vessel speed rules signal the government wants the shipping industry to take more responsibility. The new rules would expand seasonal slow zones off the East Coast that require mariners to slow to 10 knots. They would also require more vessels to comply with the rules by expanding the size classes that must slow. The rules also stated the NOAA would create a framework to implement mandatory speed restrictions when whales are known to be present outside the seasonal slow zones.\n\nMaryland\n\nEmmitsburg: A 26-foot statue of the Virgin Mary is back in place at a Catholic university in Maryland. The Frederick News-Post reported the statue has been put back in place atop a 78-foot pedestal at the National Shrine Grotto on the campus of Mount St. Mary’s University in Emmitsburg after a year of restoration work. That work continues even as the statue is back in place, surrounded by scaffolding. Workers are now in the process of layering gold leaf to statue’s exterior. The university has raised $400,000 to support the restoration; about $450,000 more is needed. The statue is expected to be completed next month, with a formal ceremony planned for October. The grotto draws about 300,000 visitors a year; it is a replica of the grotto in Lourdes, France, that draws pilgrims to a site where believers said the Virgin Mary appeared in the 19th century.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker sent back to lawmakers on Friday a bill mandating some of the steps the state needs to take to meet a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. In a letter to lawmakers, the Republican governor said he agreed with much in the bill but suggested some changes. Although the bill encourages the development of offshore wind, which Baker supports, he said the state needs to look to other sources of what he described as clean energy to meet its emissions goals. To do that, Baker said he is again asking lawmakers to put $750 million in federal American Rescue Plan Act funds into a clean energy investment fund. Baker also said the legislation needs to do more to ensue improvements to energy transmission systems. The state House approved the bill on a 143-9 vote. The Senate then voted 38-2 in favor of the bill before sending it to Baker last week.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: The Detroit Health Department is offering vaccines to residents who have been exposed to the monkeypox virus or suspect they have been exposed. The department said it is offering the Jynneos vaccine at its office from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and at the Wayne HIV/STI Clinic from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday and on the first and third Saturdays of the month from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. The vaccines will be provided to prevent development of the virus in people who have been exposed to it and to people with risk behaviors in places, events or venues with known transmission of the virus over the previous two weeks, the department said. Ten of Michigan’s known 37 cases of the virus have been seen in Detroit, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Jensen said he supports abortions for victims of rape and incest, altering his stance from previous comments he described as clumsy. Jensen told Minnesota Public Radio in May he didn’t support exceptions for rape and incest unless the life of the mother was in danger. He said in a video released Friday that if he had been unclear previously, he wanted to set the record straight. “I never thought it necessary to try and identify what those exceptions might be in regards to legal abortion or not because I always thought when I uphold the pregnant woman’s life, and if her mental and physical health is in danger or jeopardized, that’s all that needs to be said,” Jensen said. Minnesota Democratic Party Chairman Ken Martin said Jensen is trying to walk back previous comments and believed if elected, the Watertown family physician would attempt to pass an abortion law without rape and incest exceptions, the Star Tribune reported.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge has seized control of a Mississippi jail after citing “severely deficient” conditions at the facility. In a Friday ruling, U.S. Southern District of Mississippi Judge Carlton Reeves placed Hinds County’s Raymond Detention Center into receivership. The judge will soon appoint an expert, known as a “receiver,” to temporarily manage the facility in hopes of improving its conditions. “After ample time and opportunity, regretfully, it is clear that the county is incapable, or unwilling, to handle its affairs,” the judge wrote. “Additional intervention is required. It is time to appoint a receiver.” Reeves said deficiencies in supervision and staffing lead to “a stunning array of assaults, as well as deaths.” Seven individuals died last year while detained at the jail, he said. County officials said they’re still digesting the order and are determining whether they will appeal, WLBT-TV reported. Reeves’ decision came months after he agreed to scale back the county’s jail 2016 consent decree with the federal government to address “unconstitutional conditions” at Raymond and two other facilities that comprise the Hinds County jail system.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield:Families started lining up outside the Springfield Expo Center an hour before the Back To School Bash was scheduled to open Saturday. The event offered free backpacks, hygiene kits, immunizations, and physicals plus fun activities, including bounce houses, esports, games and robotics. At the event, the first of its kind for the district, Convoy of Hope passed out bags of groceries to families to celebrate having served more than 200 million people since it was founded in 1994. To get parents and children out of the rain faster, Springfield Public Schools opened doors 30 minutes early. “This is the first time we have planned a back-to-school event on this scale,” said Springfield Public Schools Superintendent Grenita Lathan. “We want families to come, enjoy themselves and have the opportunity to access resources that will help them be ready for the first day of school.” The new school year starts Aug. 22.\n\nMontana\n\nElmo: A blaze sparked in grasslands in northwest Montana, grew to more than 11 square miles after advancing into forest. A portion of Highway 28 between Hot Springs and Elmo was closed because of the thick smoke, according to the Montana Department of Transportation.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Union Pacific will spend more than $1 billion to upgrade 600 of its old diesel locomotives over the next three years and make them more efficient, but regulators still want it to do more to cut pollution from its engines. The move will accelerate the pace of upgrades the company planned to make and help the Omaha-based railroad cut roughly 210,000 tons of carbon emissions each year – the equivalent of taking 45,000 cars off the road. The railroad will go from modernizing 120 locomotives this year to modernizing 200 a year in each of the next three years. “It’s really taking the older locomotive fleet and applying the latest and greatest to get one of the most fuel efficient locomotives we can have,” said Grace Olsen, who oversees locomotive engineering for Union Pacific. The railroad estimated this program will improve the fuel efficiency of long-haul locomotives by up to 18% and help them produce peak power more reliably. To accomplish that, locomotive manufacturer Wabtec will strip down the locomotives, and spend eight weeks overhauling their engines and installing new software and electronic controls. The improved power will let Union Pacific pull the same amount of freight with fewer locomotives.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Intense thunderstorms drenched parts of the city, causing water to cascade from casino ceilings and pool on the carpet of a stadium-sized sports betting area. Although only three-tenths of an inch of rain was registered at Las Vegas’ airport late Thursday, more than an inch fell just a mile away at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Nearby wind gusts peaked at 71 mph and toppled trees. Pea-sized hail fell from lightning-streaked skies in suburban Henderson, where almost an inch of rain fell in some areas. Police, county and city officials and the National Weather Service said no injuries or widespread damage was reported. Casino patrons posted videos of water pouring from ceilings at Caesars Palace and Planet Hollywood resorts on the Las Vegas Strip and from behind a huge video display at the downtown Circa hotel-casino sports book. One video showed a man continuing to gamble at a casino slot machine while water fell around him.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Members of a rescue group carried the body of a hiker nearly a mile in freezing temperatures and high winds after the man died on the Northeast’s highest mountain, authorities said. A group of hikers found the man unconscious and not breathing on Mount Washington’s Jewell Trail on Saturday afternoon, the New Hampshire Department of Fish and Game said. They called 911 and started performing CPR. Members of one rescue group drove to the summit of the nearly 6,300-foot mountain and hiked down to the man, while another group rode up the mountain’s famous Cog Railway and hiked in. With no sign of life after 40 minutes, resuscitation efforts ceased, and rescue group members carried the body nearly a mile to the train. A dog the man was hiking with was taken to an animal shelter until it can be reunited with the man’s family.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gas prices posted another double-digit drop in New Jersey amid low demand. AAA Mid-Atlantic said the average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey on Friday was $4.41, down 10 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.18 a gallon on average a year ago at this time. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $4.25, down 16 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.16 a gallon on average a year ago at this time.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nShiprock: Samuel Sandoval, one of the last remaining Navajo Code Talkers who transmitted messages in World War II using a code based on their native language, has died. Sandoval died late Friday at a hospital in Shiprock, his wife, Malula, told The Associated Press on Saturday. He was 98. Hundreds of Navajos were recruited from the vast Navajo Nation to serve as Code Talkers with the U.S. Marine Corps. Only three are still alive today: Peter MacDonald, John Kinsel Sr. and Thomas H. Begay. The Code Talkers took part in every assault the Marines conducted in the Pacific, sending thousands of messages without error on Japanese troop movements, battlefield tactics and other communications crucial to the war’s outcome. The code, based on the then-unwritten Navajo language, confounded Japanese military cryptologists and is credited with helping the U.S. win the war. Sandoval was on Okinawa when he got word from another Navajo Code Talker the Japanese had surrendered and relayed the message to higher-ups. The Navajo men are celebrated annually on Aug. 14. Samuel Sandoval was looking forward to that date and seeing a museum built near the Navajo Nation capital of Window Rock, Arizona, to honor the Code Talkers, his wife said.\n\nNew York\n\nBabylon: Shark sightings have become more common along Long Island’s shores this summer – and not just the mostly harmless, abundant dogfish. Since June, there have been at least five verified encounters where sharks bit swimmers and surfers. Although there were no fatalities, sightings prompted officials to temporarily close some beaches to swimming, from New York City’s Rockaway Beach to Long Island’s Smith Point County Park, where a surfer beat a shark on its snout after it bit his calf. George Gorman, regional director for the state park system on Long Island, referred to the recent shark interactions as “extraordinarily unusual.” Sharks aren’t new to New York’s waters. Sand tiger, sandbar and dusky sharks are some of the more common species found near shore. But in the last century or so, New York state had documented only 13 shark attacks. Experts said sharks aren’t setting out to dine on people, but instead are chasing bunker fish near beaches. Recent shark bites are likely mistakes, Gorman said. Swimmers might also be interacting with sharks while they are feeding.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state Supreme Court has agreed to accelerate arguments on further challenges to the boundaries for the state’s legislative seats and congressional districts. By a 4-3 ruling, the justices granted a request by Common Cause to accelerate the redistricting proceedings before them. The group is fighting the state House and Senate maps approved by the General Assembly in February. Oral arguments will be held in early or mid-October, according to Thursday’s order signed by Senior Associate Justice Robin Hudson. The order said specifically the court didn’t address a recent request by Republican legislators to end its appeal of the congressional district boundaries, which a state trial court drew and adopted for use this year only. But the order said expediting all redistricting appeals was based on “the great public interest in the subject matter of this case, the importance of the issues to the constitutional jurisprudence of this state, and the need to reach a final resolution on the merits at the earliest possible opportunity.” It’s too late for any decision after those oral arguments to alter the district lines for this year’s elections, which are happening under the challenged maps. Any ruling could clarify further how partisan bias is avoided in map making and force the Legislature to redraw new General Assembly maps that would be used for the remainder of the decade. A new congressional map for the 2024 elections already will be needed.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: International Music Camp founder Merton Utgaard will receive North Dakota’s highest honor, Gov. Doug Burgum said. Utgaard, who died in 1998 at age 84, is the 47th recipient of the Theodore Roosevelt Rough Rider Award. A ceremony will be scheduled at a later date. Utgaard, a native of Maddock, founded the music camp in 1956 at the International Peace Garden that sits astride the North Dakota and Canadian border, north of Dunseith. He served as director for 28 years. At the time of his death, more than 90,000 students from more than 60 countries had attended the summer camp. Utgaard was a teacher and director of bands at the University of Minnesota, the University of South Dakota, Ball State University, Northern Illinois University and the University of Manitoba-Brandon before he began to work full time on the International Music Camp in the mid-1960s. Utgaard’s portrait will hang in the North Dakota Capitol with those of the other 46 people who have received the award, established by Gov. William Guy in 1961.\n\nOhio\n\nAthens:Ohio University is reinstating its indoor mask mandate starting Monday. The mask mandate is going into effect because Athens County is listed as having a high level of transmission on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s latest COVID-19 data tracker, according to the university’s website. Ohio University is the first public university in the state to reinstate a mask mandate after colleges and universities shed their mandates in the spring. OU’s classes begin Aug. 22. The university’s mask mandate will drop when the level of COVID-19 transmission in Athens County goes down to medium. Masks will be recommended during scheduled class and class-related activities when the level of transmission is medium. Masks will be optional when the level of COVID-19 transmission is low in Athens County. Ohio State University is not requiring masks, university spokesman Ben Johnson said in an email.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Contraband including weapons, cellphones, drones and grappling hooks believed to be headed to state prisons was seized at a warehouse in Oklahoma City, the Oklahoma Department of Corrections said Friday. The department’s Office of Inspector General learned of the contraband and raided the warehouse on July 15, with Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics agents, according to a news release from Corrections Department spokesperson Josh Ward. Justin Brown, another spokesperson for the department, said few other details could be released because it involves an ongoing investigation into contraband being smuggled into prisons. Seized items included 31 cellphones, which have been used to run drug rings from prisons and to coordinate inmate violence, such as fights in 2019 at several state prisons that left one inmate dead and dozens injured. Ammunition, drugs, tobacco and $8,500 in counterfeit $100 bills were also seized. The grappling hooks were intended to retrieve the contraband, the Oklahoma Corrections Department said. Drones have been used to deliver contraband into prisons nationwide, including federal prisons, leading to charges this month in Beaumont, Texas. No arrests were announced, but Inspector General Ted Woodhead said charges are expected against “numerous individuals” at the end of what he said is an ongoing investigation into the contraband.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: New state rules require access to water, shade and breaks on hot days, but workers said they’re still laboring in unsafe conditions. Skyler Fischer, a forklift driver at a Fred Meyer distribution center in the town of Clackamas, has been working there for 12 years and works at least four days a week, 10 to 12 hours each day. Fischer said he gets two 15-minute breaks each shift. In May, the Oregon Occupational Safety and Health Division adopted permanent rules to protect workers laboring in excessive heat or wildfire smoke. They are some of the nation’s strongest protections for employees working outdoors or in workplaces without air conditioning. But last week, with daily highs consistently hitting triple-digits, Oregon OSHA’s recently implemented heat rules were put to the test. Some Oregonians have said they’re still laboring in unsafe conditions despite the new heat rules. The rules went into effect last month and apply when temperatures in a work environment reach 80 degrees Fahrenheit. They require employers to provide access to shaded areas, cool drinking water, and additional rest breaks to cool down and acclimate to the heat. The rule also requires employers to provide heat illness prevention training. Aaron Corvin, Oregon OSHA’s public information officer, said the agency has opened an inspection related to the Fred Meyer facility. A statement from Fred Meyer said the company has installed a mechanical cooling station at its 1-million-square-foot warehouse in Clackamas. On days with high temperatures, the company provides employees with access to water bottles on ice, water fountains, frozen treats and cooling towels. A distribution team also takes daily temperatures throughout the facility and said this week temperatures have not exceeded 80 degrees Fahrenheit, the statement said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A fast-moving fire damaged Jim’s Steaks on South Street, one of Philadelphia’s best-known cheesesteak shops, early Friday, but authorities said no injuries were reported. Dozens of firefighters and other emergency responders went to Jim’s Steaks when the fire was reported about 9:30 a.m. Smoke could be seen pouring from the building, but officials said all the employees were able to safely evacuate the structure. It wasn’t immediately known how many people were in the building when the fire broke out. The cause of the fire remains under investigation. Jim’s Steaks opened its original location in Philadelphia in 1939. The South Street location opened in 1976.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPortsmouth: Law enforcement handed out more than a dozen citations for boating violations Saturday during an annual party on the water that has become known as “Aquapalooza.” Two boats sank. At least two boat operators were cited for “boating under the influence.” Two other revelers were taken away for emergency medical treatment, including one with a leg injury from a moving propeller. Harbormaster Bruce Celico said this year’s event was the largest yet, drawing more than 1,000 boats and Jet Skis.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nClemson: Three horses have tested positive for equine infectious anemia, a blood-borne, potentially deadly illness, the Clemson University Public Service and Agriculture unit reported Friday. The first case was in a quarter horse in Berkeley County. The other two quarter-horse cases are in Barnwell County, state Veterinarian Michael Neault said in a news release. These are the first cases of the illness in South Carolina since 2014, when a donkey tested positive in Aiken County, Neault said. The virus that causes EIA is often transmitted by bloodsucking insects such as biting flies but also can be introduced by infected needles or other medical, dental or tattoo equipment. The illness does not affect humans but is potentially deadly to horses and other equine species, Neault said. The infected horse in Berkeley County has been euthanized. Clemson University’s Livestock Poultry Health regulatory agency, which Neault also directs, is discussing options with the owners of the two affected horses in Barnwell County.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Oglala Sioux Tribe is suing the federal government for failing to provide adequate law enforcement on the Pine Ridge Reservation. The lawsuit filed last week against the Bureau of Indian Affairs and some high-level officials in the Interior Department alleged the inadequacy has created a “public safety crisis” on the reservation. Tribal officials said Pine Ridge, with its 3 million acres of land, has just 33 police officers and eight criminal investigators who handled more than 133,700 emergency calls last year. And, that there were six to eight officers on any given shift. The complaint uses Rapid City as a comparison with its 176 police officers who handled nearly 115,000 emergency calls in 2021, the Argus Leader reported. The tribe said the Bureau of Indian Affairs is out of compliance with its standards of having 2.8 officers per 1,000 people. For Pine Ridge, that would require at least 140 tribal officers. Court documents said officers are working an average of 80 hours of overtime on top of their 160 scheduled hours and do not have adequate backup when needed for emergency calls.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Six people have applied to replace Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery, who won’t be seeking another term. The Tennessee Supreme Court announced Don Cochran, Jerome Cochran, Michael Dunavant, R. Culver Schmid, Jonathan Skrmetti and Bill Young submitted applications for the opening by Friday’s deadline. Tennessee is the only state in which the attorney general is appointed by the Supreme Court. The position runs in eight-year terms. The new term begins Sept. 1. The court’s justices selected Slatery in 2014 after he previously served as former Republican Gov. Bill Haslam’s chief legal counsel. Interviews will be held on Aug. 8 and 9 at the Tennessee Supreme Court building in Nashville. They will also be livestreamed at www.youtube.com/user/TNCourts/featured.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Sunlight magnified by glass bottles in an open garbage can ignited paper trash, starting a 500-acre wildfire in north Texas that destroyed five homes, fire officials said. The July 18 fire on Possum Kingdom Lake’s western shore, about 70 miles west of Fort Worth, took eight days to fully contain. Chief Bonnie Watkins of the Possum Kingdom West Side Volunteer Fire Department found a trash can packed with party trash that included paper goods, food and numerous glass bottles, according to a department statement. Watkins concluded a wind gust opened the can lid, allowing sunlight magnified by the glass bottles to ignite the paper. The fire built rapidly until the fire spilled from the can and spread to nearby cedar trees, the statement said. Rich Johnson, a spokesman for the Insurance Council of Texas, a nonprofit insurance industry association, said he had never heard of such a freakish cause for a wildfire.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Three people, including a juvenile, have been arrested over an alleged vandalism spree at church buildings across the city owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Police found reports of broken windows at 14 churches across Washington County spanning multiple dates, according to arresting documents filed in 5th District Court. The first incident was reported to police on July 18. All of the damage was done at churches owned by the Latter-day Saints, which make up Utah's predominant religious denomination. The estimated cost of the damage done was $5,000. Two of the three individuals, one adult and one juvenile, reportedly admitted to their involvement, according to police. The adult is Nathan Monroy, 18, who was arrested and placed in the Purgatory Correctional Facility on a second-degree felony charge of criminal mischief. The juvenile was also arrested and placed in the Dixie Area Detention. Another adult, Zachary Steele, 18, was arrested later by Washington City officers and faces the same charge.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy on Friday was discharged from a rehabilitation center following his second surgery to help repair a broken hip, his office said. Leahy, 82, fell and broke his hip last month in his Virginia home. He underwent hip-replacement surgery June 30 at a Washington-area hospital. He was then moved to a rehabilitation center. An additional operation was done July 20. He and his wife, Marcelle, returned to the home Friday. Leahy plans to return to the Senate this week. On his way home, he went to the Capitol to sign a newly passed bill that would boost the semiconductor industry and scientific research. As President Pro Tempore of the Senate, his signature is required, along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s, before the bill can be sent to President Joe Biden. Leahy, the longest serving member of the U.S. Senate, is not seeking reelection in November. When Leahy’s current term expires in January 2023, he will have served for 48 years in the Senate.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Richmond Commonwealth’s Attorney Colette McEachin said she won’t file criminal charges against police officers who deployed tear gas on demonstrators gathered at the city’s Robert E. Lee statue in 2020 to protest police violence. McEachin said confused police radio communications led officers to use tear gas on a peaceful group of protestors who gathered at the statue on June 1, 2020, in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. She said her review showed that police commanders authorized tear gas to be used at the nearby J.E.B. Stuart monument, where a smaller group of protesters was trying to topple the statue. She said radio transmissions simply referred to “the monument,” and officers at the Lee monument wrongly believed the use of tear gas had been authorized there. Richmond Police quickly apologized for the use of tear gas at the Lee statue and said it was unwarranted. A few days later, the city’s police chief resigned.\n\nWashington\n\nSedro-Wolley: A woman was arrested after she allegedly left her family’s dog on a balcony without water or shade during dangerous high temperatures, resulting in the dog’s death. A police animal control officer responded to calls from concerned neighbors and found the 5-year-old dog named Enzo in “severe distress.” He displayed symptoms including seizing and foaming at the mouth. The officer took life-saving measures, moving the dog inside and trying to cool him down, but Enzo died, KING5 reported. His body was taken to an emergency medical facility where its internal temperature was at least 107 degrees – the maximum temperature the vet’s thermometer could detect, according to court documents. The dog’s water bowl was empty and there were signs he had pawed at the sliding door. In addition, neighbors and nearby workers reportedly heard a dog in distress. Temperatures in Sedro-Wolley reached nearly 90 degrees on Tuesday and officers measured one surface of the balcony at 131 degrees with an infrared heat camera, according to court documents. The woman told police she had been preparing for her son’s birthday and did not check the water bowl or consider the temperature on the deck, though she told police she was aware of the forecast for the day, court documents said. The woman was charged with first-degree animal cruelty and released on her own recognizance.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Wheeling attorney Elgine McArdle was elected chair of the West Virginia Republican Party. McArdle was chosen during a meeting of the state GOP executive committee in Charleston. McArdle has been a member of the committee since 2005. She succeeds Mark Harris, who chose not to seek a full four-year term after he was picked in March 2021 to serve the remainder of former chair Melody Potter’s term. McArdle also spent five years as an assistant federal prosecutor for the state’s northern district.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Investigators said two Dane County deputies investigating a case of road rage were injured when an alleged drunken driver crashed into their squad cars late Friday. Their injuries are not believed to be life-threatening, the Dane County Sheriff’s Office said. The incident happened in the town of Springfield, where authorities said a person was shot and injured in a dispute near the intersection of two highways. The suspect in that incident fled the scene and was later arrested. The person who was shot is expected to survive. The deputies who responded to the scene were standing outside of their cars when the drunken-driving suspect crashed into their vehicles. They were taken to a local hospital for treatment. The driver was arrested for operating while intoxicated causing injury.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Wyoming Secretary of State Ed Buchanan has been named by Gov. Mark Gordon a judge for the 8th Judicial District, serving Goshen County, his home county, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reported. The newspaper reported Buchanan said he would not seek a second term after Judge Patrick W. Korrell announced his retirement.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/08/01"}]}

Also under consideration: Sheehey, Max Bielfeldt.\n\n1 – Jared Jeffries: Big Ten Freshman of the Year in 2001 and Big Ten Player of the Year in 2002, the Bloomington North product led IU to a share of the Big Ten title in 2002, and was the linchpin to its improbable run to the national title game. Remember the barrage of 3-pointers in that run? That was possible because teams were doubling Jeffries in the post. He averaged 15.0 points, 7.6 rebounds and 1.3 blocks as a sophomore then left for an 11-year NBA career. Also under consideration: Jordan Hulls, James Blackmon Jr.\n\n2 – Christian Watford: His shot to knock off No. 1 Kentucky signaled IU's return to national prominence after Tom Crean's root-to-branch rebuild. Watford finished ninth on the school's all-time rebounds list (776) and 10th in scoring (1,730 points.) He is only the fourth player in IU history to crack the top 10 in both (Kent Benson, Don Schlundt and Alan Henderson). Also under consideration: A.J. Moye\n\n3 – Jay Edwards: A prep star at Marion, Edwards led the Marion Giants to three state titles before arriving in Bloomington. Bob Knight told The Sporting News that Edwards had been \"a monumental pain the ass.\" But in the historically strong 1988-89 year for the Big Ten, Edwards averaged 20.0 points and shot 45 percent from the 3-point line to lead Indiana to a 27-8 record and the Big Ten title. He needed just 55 games to reach 1,000 career points (tied for seventh-fastest in school history). He was named Big Ten Player of the Year, and declared early for the draft, a decision he regrets to this day. Also under consideration: D.J. White, Tom Coverdale, Ken Gunning\n\nWhere are they now?: Edwards admits mistakes derailed his career\n\n4 – Victor Oladipo: A fringe top-150 prospect out of high school, Oladipo combined his supreme athleticism with an exceptional work ethic to transform himself into one of the nation's top college players. He became a full-time starter his sophomore season and in his junior season led IU to a No. 1 national ranking, outright Big Ten title and earned Sporting News National Player of the Year honors. He left a year early and was the No. 2 overall pick in the 2013 draft. After two trades, he's back in Indiana, earning an All-Star nod last season with the Pacers. Also under consideration: Luke Recker, Bracey Wright\n\n5 – Vern Huffman: A three-sport standout, he is the only IU athlete to earn major All-American honors in basketball and football. (He also played baseball.) He was tabbed the top Big Ten football player by the Chicago Tribune in 1936. He was a member of the inaugural IU Hall of Fame class in 1982 (with Walt Bellamy, Everett Dean, Bob Leonard, Branch McCracken and Don Schlundt). Huffman played two seasons in the NFL and eventually worked for the FBI. Also under consideration: Neil Reed, Ernie Andres, Ralph Hamilton\n\n6 – Lou Watson: The two-time team MVP (1949-50) led the team in scoring in 1950, earning All-American honors. He was an assistant under Branch McCracken and took over for McCracken in 1996. He served as IU's head coach for five years, leading the Hoosiers to a share of the 1967 Big Ten title. A player mutiny in 1971-72 led to Watson being reassigned within the athletic department. Also under consideration: James Strickland\n\n7 – Branch McCracken: The Hoosiers play on a court bearing his name, and before he won IU's first two national titles as a coach (1940, 1953), he was a heck of a player. An All-American in 1930, he led IU in scoring for three seasons and led the Big Ten as a senior (12.3 points per game). He was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1960 and the College Basketball Hall of Fame in 2006.\n\n8 – Bill Garrett: Though it hardly made waves at the time — IndyStar noted in December 1947 that “Bill Garrett, Shelbyville’s great Negro center last year, (is) on the frosh squad at IU” with no other details — Garrett broke the color barrier in the Big Ten. Arriving at Indiana the same year Jackie Robinson broke baseball’s color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Garrett made his varsity debut the following year (freshman were not allowed to play varsity at the time). He graduated in 1951 as an All-American with the school’s career scoring record. Garrett did not play with or against another black player during his college career. But the year after he graduated, there were six black players in the Big Ten.\n\nMore:Bill Garrett to be honored for integrating Big Ten basketball 70 years ago\n\n9 – Bob Masters: He led Lafayette Jeff to a state title and won IndyStar Mr. Basketball in 1948, then was a three-year starter for the Hoosiers. Masters earned All-Big Ten honors twice and was named an All-American in 1952. He averaged a career-high 8.7 points and 7.1 rebounds that season. Also under consideration: Bill Tosheff\n\n10 – John Wallace: In 1946, he averaged a team-best 14.4 points in 21 games for the Hoosiers (18-3) and broke Ernie Andres' single-season scoring record (250), finishing with 302. He earned team MVP and All-American honors. The Hoosiers received an invite to the NCAA tournament, but didn't play because center Tom Schwartz was inducted into the Army and wasn't able to play. Also under consideration: Roderick Wilmont\n\n11 – Isiah Thomas: He averaged 14.6 points, 5.5 assists, 4.0 rebounds and 2.1 steals a game as a freshman, helping the Hoosiers to the 1980 Big Ten title and a Sweet 16 run. A year later, he starred for IU, averaging 16.0 points and 5.8 assists. He guided the team to the 1981 national championship, scoring 23 points in the title game, and was named the NCAA tournament's most outstanding player. Also under consideration: Yogi Ferrell\n\n12 – Steve Alford: A no-brainer choice. Alford led the Hoosiers in scoring all four years, averaging 22.5 as a junior and 22.0 his senior year. The New Castle product led IU to the 1987 national title, was a two-time All-American and the 1987 Big Ten MVP.\n\n13 – Charley Kraak: Scored 17 points and grabbed 13 rebounds in IU's 1953 national championship win over Kansas. He led the Hoosiers in rebounding that season (10.7 per game) and was a key piece next to Don Schlundt. Also under consideration: Juwan Morgan\n\n14 – Ward Williams: He also wore No. 20, but wore No. 14 when he returned from serving in the U.S. Army in North Africa. He averaged 8.2 points and 3.6 rebounds in the 1947-48 season and was No. 8 overall pick by the Fort Wayne Pistons in 1948.\n\n15 – Gary Long: Tied with Hallie Bryant at 100th on the school's all-time scoring list (568 points), Long averaged a career-high 11.7 points for the 1960-61 Hoosiers. He was the leading scorer in IU's highest-scoring game ever, a 122-93 win against Ohio State. A team captain, he earned UPI All-American honorable mention in 1961. Also under consideration: Frank O'Bannon (future governor of Indiana)\n\n16 – Ernie Andres: He wore three numbers (25, 5 also) during his IU career, and neither of his two All-Big Ten seasons came wearing No. 16, but pickings were slim. He was an All-American in 1938 after setting the school's single-season scoring record (250 points) and set a Big Ten single-game record scoring 30 points in IU's 45-35 win over Illinois.\n\n17 – Ralph Hamilton: Another to wear multiple numbers (5, 10), he led the Hoosiers in scoring in 1943 and 1947 after returning from a three-year stint in the Army during World War II. As a 25-year-old senior he averaged 13.4 points, earned All-American honors and graduated as the team's all-time leading scorer (632 points).\n\n18 – Ed Denton: The three-year starter led the Hoosiers in scoring in 1942 (8.2 ppg), earning All-American honors. An Army veteran of World War II and Korean War, he was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 1997. Also under consideration: Woody Weir, Tom Schwartz\n\n19 – Charley Meyer: A three-sport standout at Jeffersonville, he was a four-year performer for the Hoosiers and a member of 1950 college all-star team. He coached 14 years at Scottsburg and was inducted into the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame in 1986.\n\n20 – Bobby Wilkerson: A tough choice here, because it's hard to ignore Greg Graham's productivity (14th on school's all-time scoring list with 1,590 points), but Wilkerson was the quintessential glue guy on the dominant Hoosiers teams in 1975 and 1976. He averaged 7.8 points, 5.3 assists and 4.9 rebounds for the undefeated '76 team and was a superb defender. \"Bobby Wilkerson was the most valuable player I ever coached,\" Bob Knight once said. \"He could guard anyone.\" Also under consideration: Greg Graham, Rick Calloway\n\n21 – Quinn Buckner: Another difficult decision, but we'll go with this four-year starter, three-year captain and two-time All-American (1975, 76). He helped the Hoosiers to two Big Ten titles and the 1976 undefeated season. He added a gold medal with the U.S. in the Montreal Olympics that year. He played 10 NBA seasons, won an NBA title with the Celtics and now provides analysis on Pacers' broadcasts for Fox Sports Indiana. Also under consideration: Bobby Leonard, Hallie Bryant\n\n22 – Jimmy Rayl: Agonized over this one. Rayl was a two-time All-American (1962, 63) and owns four of the Hoosiers’ top eight single-game scoring totals, and 10 of the top 50. He holds the IU single-game scoring record (56 points), pulling off the feat twice. Rayl averaged 29.8 points a game in 1962 (second-best in school history) and as a senior a year later, averaged 25.3 ppg. Also under consideration: Damon Bailey, Archie Dees, Joe Cooke, Dean Garrett\n\nDoyel: Jimmy Rayl's life after basketball started young\n\n23 – Eric Gordon: Keith Smart's shot against Syracuse is one of most iconic moments in IU history, but you'd be hard-pressed to find someone to tell you he was a better player than Gordon. Sure the North Central star played only one season at IU, but he was Big Ten Freshman of the Year and an All-American in 2008, scoring an IU and Big Ten record 669 points. He was the first IU freshman to to average more than 20 points a game, and he led the Big Ten in scoring. A promising season came crashing down after a 22-4 start when coach Kelvin Sampson was fired for recruiting violations. Also under consideration: Keith Smart, Vern Payne, Jamal Meeks\n\n24 – Randy Wittman: An All-American and Big Ten Player of the Year in 1983, Wittman averaged 18.9 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.0 assists a game his senior season. Wittman rarely came off the floor.No IU player saw more minutes than Wittman's 4,699. He played the full 40 minutes 45 times as a Hoosier. He played nine seasons in the NBA and has coached the Cavaliers, Timberwolves and Wizards. Also under consideration: Daryl Thomas, Michael Lewis, Matt Nover\n\n25 – Tom Van Arsdale: He finished his career with 1,252 points (12 more than identical twin Dick) and earned All-American honors in 1965. He led IU in scoring and rebounding as a sophomore and senior, finishing his career averaging 17.4 points and 10.0 rebounds a game. A three-time All-Star, he played 12 seasons in the NBA and holds the record for most career NBA games without a playoff appearance (929 games). Also under consideration: A.J. Guyton\n\n26 – Tom Motter: The Fort Wayne product was on IU's 1940 national championship team. He earned a Bronze Star with the Army in World War II. In 2009, a 90-year-old Motter was honored at Assembly Hall as the last surviving member of that 1940 team. On May 5, 2014, he was nominated for the Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame. He passed away three hours later.\n\n27 – Hal Driver: A 6-3 center from Aurora, Ind., Driver (1941-42) and Gene Turner (1945-46) are the only two Hoosiers to wear the number.\n\n28 – Marv Huffman: Earned All-American honors in 1940, leading the Hoosiers to their first NCAA championship (in just the second-ever NCAA tournament). He was named the tournament's most outstanding player and scored a team-high 12 points in the team's 60-42 win over Kansas in the title game.\n\n29 – Robert Menke: He and his older brother Bill were on the 1940 team that won IU's first national championship. Bill earned All-American honors that season, then died in combat during World War II. Bob Menke played three seasons for the Hoosiers and served in the Air Force during WWII. He was inducted into the IU Hall of Fame in 2011.\n\n30 – Dick Van Arsdale: He led the Hoosiers in scoring (22.3) and rebounding (12.4 rpg) his junior season. As a senior in 1965 he earned All-American honors on Branch McCracken's final team. His 719 career rebounds are 15th-most in school history — one spot lower than twin brother Tom (723). He played 12 seasons in the NBA, including three as an All-Star and later became the general manager of the Phoenix Suns. Also under consideration: Ted Kitchel\n\n31 – John Laskowski: The super-sub averaged 10.8 points, 3.8 rebounds and 1.8 assists in 84 career games, most coming off the bench. He helped IU win three straight Big Ten titles and reach the 1973 Final Four. He scored 903 points in his career (59th-most in school history) and is a member of the IU Athletics Hall of Fame and Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame. Also under consideration: Bill DeHeer, Dick Farley\n\n32 – Steve Downing: An All-American in 1973, he led the Hoosiers in rebounding in 1972 and 1973. His 15.1 per game average as a junior is third-best single-season in school history. He won the Chicago Tribune's Silver Basketball award as the Big Ten's top player in 1973 and led the Hoosiers to the Final Four, losing to eventual champion UCLA. He's a member of the IU Athletics Hall of Fame and Indiana Basketball Hall of Fame. He served as an associate athletic director at IU before building Marian University into a NAIA power as its athletic director, a position he currently holds. Also under consideration: Eric Anderson, Landon Turner\n\n33 – Archie Dees: IU's original Archie, Dees led the Big Ten in scoring twice, guiding IU to back-to-back conference titles. He averaged 22.7 points during his career and twice was named Big Ten Player of the Year and an All-American. As a senior, he averaged 25.5 points and 14.4 rebounds a game. His 1,546 career points are 16th-best and he's fourth on the school's rebounding list (914). Full disclosure: His best seasons came wearing No. 22, but he was too good to leave off this list, and No. 22, as you saw, was loaded. Also under consideration: Uwe Blab, Kenny Johnson\n\n34 – Don Schlundt – One of the greatest players in school history, Schlundt led Indiana to the 1953 national championship, requiring four victories in six days. He scored 30 points in IU's 69-68 win over Kansas in the title game. Schlundt led Indiana to its first two undisputed Big Ten championships and only four players have scored more points in Big Ten games. A three-time All-American, he held the school scoring record for 32 years, until Steve Alford broke it. Also under consideration: Brian Evans, Steve Green, Bill Menke\n\nMore:The best IU basketball player you've never heard of\n\n35 – George McGinnis: One of the tougher decisions on this list. No IU player may have had a more productive career than Walt Bellamy. But no one had a better single season than McGinnis. He averaged 29.9 points a game (best in IU history) in 1971 and scored at least 20 points in 14-straight games. He scored 30 or more 12 times during his sophomore year, his lone season playing varsity basketball in Bloomington. He led the team in rebounding (14.9) and was named an All-American. A three-time NBA All-Star and Pacers icon, he was inducted in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame last year. Also under consideration: Walt Bellamy, Kirk Haston\n\n36 – Hubert Scheidler: No real decision here: A 6-1 forward from Muncie, Scheidler is the only player to ever wear the number for IU, doing so in 1941.\n\n37 – Don Ritter: One of just three players to wear the number, Ritter was a three-time letterwinner, led the team in scoring in 1948 and was team captain in 1949. Full disclosure, he wore No. 37 in 1947, but pickings were slim. He was a two-sport standout at IU, earning first-team All-American honors in baseball in 1949.\n\n38 – Bob Dro: The two-sport standout started on IU's 1940 national title team and was an honorary captain in 1941. An Indiana Athletics Hall of Fame inductee, he played pro baseball (Brooklyn Dodgers) and pro basketball (Indianapolis Kautskys) before working more than 30 years in IU's athletic department and University Relations staff.\n\n39 – Neil Funk: Only two players have worn the number for IU (Del Russell in 1945 is other), and there aren't statistics readily available for either. But Funk gets the nod because he's the father of Neil Funk III, who starred at Park Tudor in the 1960s and went on to become the Chicago Bulls radio play-by-play announcer. Neil Funk Jr., wore No. 39 in 1942-43 and was a 6-3 forward from LaPorte and worked at Eli Lilly after graduation.\n\n40 – Calbert Cheaney: The Big Ten's all-time leading scorer, Cheaney was a three-time All-American (1991, 92, 93) and led the Hoosiers in scoring each of his four years, capped with a 22.4 average as a senior. He holds the distinction of being Bob Knight's first left-handed recruit, which makes you wonder why Knight didn't solely recruit left-handers afterward. The Big Ten MVP in 1993, he spent 13 years in the NBA. Also under consideration: Cody Zeller, Glen Grunwald\n\n41 – Andy Zimmer: A member of the 1940 national title team, he earned first team All-Big Ten and All-American honors in 1942. He scored 268 points in his career and IU had a 52-12 record during his three seasons. He also wore No. 7. Also under consideration: Max Walker\n\n42 – Scott May: One of just two Hoosiers to be named Big Ten Player of the Year twice (Archie Dees is the other), May was a two time All-American (1975, 76). He won four Big Ten titles and led the NCAA's last undefeated team in scoring (23.5). Had he not broken his arm in the final regular-season game in 1975, IU might have won back-to-back. Also under consideration: Mike Woodson\n\n43 – Pete Obremskey: He averaged 8.5 points and 6.1 rebounds in 64 career games over three seasons. He was the second-leading scorer (12.6) and rebounder (7.7) on 1958 Big Ten championship team. Also under consideration: Jarrad Odle, Gary Grieger\n\n44 – Alan Henderson: IU's career leader in rebounds (1,091). Many still believe had Henderson not gotten hurt late in his sophomore season, the Hoosiers may have hung another banner in Assembly Hall. He posted 49 career double-doubles for IU and scored 20 or more points 24 times during his senior season, earning All-American honors in 1995. He's seventh on IU's all-time scoring list (1,979) and second in blocks (213). Also under consideration: Joby Wright, Joe Hillman\n\n45 – Ray Tolbert: A member of the 1981 national title team, Tolbert pulled down a game-high 11 rebounds in Indiana's 63-50 win over North Carolina in the championship. He was Big Ten MVP that season, averaging 12.2 points and 6.4 rebounds a game. He led the Hoosiers in rebounding in each of his four seasons and is sixth on the school's all-time list with 874. He finished 20th on the IU's all-time scoring list with 1,427 points. Also under consideration: Tom Bolyard, Andrae Patterson\n\n50 – Jeff Newton: The 2002 national runner-up team, IU likely wouldn't have gotten past Oklahoma in the Final Four without Newton's 19 points off the bench. The next season, he started all 34 games, averaging 14.9 points and 8.2 rebounds. He finished his career with 1,203 points — 36th on IU's all-time list. His 737 career rebounds are 13th-most and his 227 career blocks are tops in the Hoosiers' record book.\n\n51 – Earl Calloway: He played at New Mexico State then junior college before arriving in Bloomington in 2005. He started 14 games as a junior before making the point guard position his own as a senior. He averaged 9.6 points a game and led the team in assists (4.3) in 2007, helping IU to the NCAA tournament in Kelvin Sampson's first season.\n\n52 – Courtney Witte: The only player to wear the number for IU, Witte was Bob Knight's first junior college recruit. He worked 11 seasons for the Pacers before joining the Philadelphia 76ers as a video coordinator and scout, before ascending to director of player personnel in 2003.\n\n53 – Tom Geyer: One of only two players to wear the number, Geyer, a walk-on from Lawrence North, left the program after Bob Knight's firing in 2000. “He is the type of player that did not always show up in the box score, but was a big contributor to this program with his leadership and work ethic,\" then-interim coach Mike Davis said. \"Not many people work as hard as Tom does,”\n\n54 – Kent Benson: The three-time All-American (1975, 76, 77) provided the interior presence on IU's dominant teams during that stretch. In the '76 undefeated season, he averaged 17.3 points and 8.8 rebounds a game. He scored 25 points in the national title game against Michigan, earning tournament Most Outstanding Player honors. As a senior in 1977, he won Big Ten Player of the Year, averaging 19.8 points and 10.5 rebounds a game. He ranks ninth on the school's all-time scoring list (1,740) and third in rebounding (1,031). Led IU in rebounding each of his four seasons. He was the No.1 overall pick by the Milwaukee Bucks and spent 11 seasons in the NBA. Also under consideration: Jon McGlocklin\n\n55 – Haris Mujezinovic: Only three players have worn the number (Tom Abernethy wore No. 55 as a freshman). The 6-9 Mujezinovic averaged 4.9 points and 3.2 rebounds in his two seasons with the Hoosiers. He had a lengthy pro career overseas and played on the Bosnian national team.\n\nIndyStar reporters Kyle Neddenriep and David Woods contributed to this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/21"}]}

John Carney pitches $60M in weighted funding for Delaware ...", "text": "Delaware public schools would get more money to educate English language learners and low-income students under an initiative proposed by Gov. John Carney.\n\n“This is an issue we can’t afford to ignore any longer,” he said. “We can’t afford to leave one child behind.”\n\nHis plan to revamp the state’s Opportunity Grants program would direct $60 million over the next three years to districts and charter schools based on the number of students they enroll in each of those categories.\n\nPending approval from the Delaware General Assembly, the program would direct $500 to each district and charter school for every English language learner and $300 for each low-income student. Low-income would be determined by whether the student receives federal poverty benefits, starting with the 2019/2020 school year.\n\nThose grants would come in addition to the annual per pupil allocation provided to the state’s 19 districts and 21 state-authorized charter schools. Delaware is one of the few states that does not account for poverty or English proficiency in its school funding formula.\n\nThe proposal would provide significant new funding to the Capital School District in Dover, where more than half of the 6,500 students are considered low-income; and the Indian River School District, where one in five students are English language learners.\n\nOther districts like Seaford and Christina have high proportions of students from both categories.\n\n“Gov. Carney is the first governor to address additional funding for disadvantaged students,” said Stephanie Ingram, president of the powerful state educators’ union. “We are thankful that he has brought this issue to the forefront and is working to find a funding solution.”\n\nChanging the state’s decades-old, per-pupil funding system was a central goal of the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission, a panel formed under former Gov. Jack Markell to recommend improvements for the same at-risk children Carney’s plan is intended to help.\n\n“This is a watershed moment,” said WEIC chair Tony Allen, now provost at Delaware State University. “We’re delighted this opportunity has come to fruition in a big way.”\n\nState officials say the additional funding is intended to help schools provide a better education to students who tend to score significantly lower on standardized testing than their peers.\n\nThe program will focus specifically on improving third-grade reading and school attendance, among other markers.\n\nExactly how schools use that extra money would be determined by each district and charter school and approved by the state Department of Education.\n\nCarney said the idea is to give local schools flexibility to develop innovative solutions that best fit their individual needs. After three years, he said, the state could require that districts adopt the plans that produced the best results.\n\nThe governor’s plan would mark the third evolution of the Opportunity Grant program in as many years. The initiative first provided $1 million for programs that benefit low-income and English language learners through a competitive grant program before being shifted to an automatic statewide allocation that cost $6 million this year.\n\nUnder the governor’s latest proposal, the Legislature would need to approve funding for the grant program each of the next three years, a wrinkle some fear could put it on the chopping block if an economic downturn strikes.\n\n“I think the governor’s proposal has great merit,” said House Minority Leader Danny Short, R-Seaford. “The question is how much money will be available and how long will it continue.”\n\nThe proposal also comes as Carney and other state officials seek to defend themselves from a lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Delaware alleging Delaware is failing to provide adequate educational opportunities for disadvantaged students, including children from low-income families and children whose first language is not English.\n\nA judge in November refused to dismiss that lawsuit, opening the possibility that the courts could ultimately force Delaware’s three counties to reassess properties for the first time in decades, a factor the ACLU claims is partially to blame for the lack of adequate funding.\n\nKathleen MacRae of the ACLU called Carney’s proposal a positive step but one that falls well short of addressing the underlying problem.\n\n“The fact is it’s only 1 percent of the state’s overall education budget and only extends for three years,” she said. “Our hope is that the state finds a more permanent and substantial solution to this issue.”\n\nContact reporter Scott Goss at (302) 324-2281, sgoss@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @ScottGossDel.\n\nEDUCATION STORIES THAT HIT HOME\n\nOdyssey Charter School union lambasts school board with a vote of no confidence\n\nHead of school at Tatnall departs in middle of the academic year\n\nStop bringing fast food for students, Milford High School tells parents", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/01/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/10/14/delaware-lawmakers-finally-change-states-school-funding-system/3645490001/", "title": "Will Delaware lawmakers finally change state's school funding ...", "text": "In 2016, before the General Assembly failed to pass a measure that included spending additional money on some Wilmington schools to address the needs of low-income students, Jea Street said he would sue the state to get schools funded equitably.\n\nIn 2018, the longtime education advocate and New Castle County councilman made good on that promise.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/10/12/delaware-settles-education-funding-lawsuit/5973782002/", "title": "Settlement of Delaware education suit promises historic changes", "text": "Historic change to Delaware's education system is one step closer.\n\nGov. John Carney and civil rights groups settled a lawsuit that accused Delaware education officials of sending more money to schools with affluent children than it does to schools with high concentrations of children living in poverty.\n\nThe settlement kicks the issue to the General Assembly, which for two decades has not implemented state commissions’ suggestions to formally allocate more funding for low-income students, English language learners and students with disabilities.\n\nThe plaintiffs wrote in their complaint that schools with high concentrations of those students struggle to afford enough staff to meet the children's needs.\n\nThe potentially landmark case in Delaware Chancery Court sought to have the state’s school funding system ruled unconstitutional, with civil rights groups arguing state officials knowingly fail to give all children an adequate education.\n\nINITIAL FILING: Civil rights groups sue Delaware over education funding for low-income, disadvantaged students\n\nThey cited figures showing disadvantaged students are scoring far below state standards on state assessments\n\nThe settlement\n\nIn the settlement, reached close to three years after the lawsuit was first filed by Delawareans for Educational Opportunity and the Delaware NAACP, Carney agreed to make a number of budgetary proposals to the General Assembly — mainly, changing Delaware law to make weighted school funding permanent.\n\nThe case had been scheduled to go to trial next month.\n\n“While we were not able to get everything we wanted in this settlement, it does provide support for children that is desperately needed in Delaware’s education system,” said Jea Street of Delawareans for Educational Opportunity, who is also a New Castle County councilman, in a news release.\n\nWeighted funding takes into account additional needs and disadvantages of low-income and other students. Under the state’s current “unit count” system, school districts receive state funds based on enrollment numbers. Schools with high concentrations of low-income students tend to need more supports like reading specialists and counseling staff, but they do not receive the additional funding to cover those supports.\n\nAt the time the lawsuit was filed, Delaware was one of just four states that did not give additional funds for English language learners and one of 15 that did not provide additional funds for educating low-income children, plaintiffs said.\n\nLAWSUIT: Delaware schools are leaving children in poverty behind\n\nCarney first proposed Opportunity Grants in 2018, as a means of offering schools additional funding for high-poverty and English learners. The most recent round of Opportunity Funding, announced as the lawsuit was winding its way toward trial, would be doled out to schools over the course of three years, but was not formally written into law.\n\nEXTRA FUNDING:Gov. John Carney proposes expanding Opportunity Funding to $75 million\n\nUnder the settlement, Carney must propose that the General Assembly make Opportunity Funding permanent by 2023. By 2025, the state should grow the pot of money from $35 million to $60 million. Schools must report how that money is being spent annually.\n\nThe General Assembly will also be asked to enact legislation starting in 2023 to expand funding for special education students in kindergarten through third grade. Currently, state funding covers only students fourth grade and up.\n\nIn a news release, Carney called the settlement \"an opportunity to make real progress for Delaware’s children.\"\n\nA political challenge\n\nSuccess of the settlement depends on the state Legislature. Some advocates for low-income students have accused that body of lacking the political will to funnel more money to students in need — and formalize it into law.\n\nFor decades, state-formed commissions have issued report after report outlining the changes needed to improve Delaware schools. Most recently in 2016, the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission made the case for redistricting in New Castle County, where city of Wilmington students are split across five school districts. The commission suggested establishing weighted funding and property tax reassessment.\n\nThe General Assembly failed to implement the commission’s key recommendations. The push to restructure Wilmington schools is again being discussed in the Redding Consortium, a similar state-formed working group.\n\nWith state revenues having plummeted during the coronavirus pandemic, it may be even harder to pass additional spending.\n\nBut Carney’s agreement to back the proposals — and a Statehouse likely to be made up increasingly of more left-wing Democrats — gives advocates some hope.\n\nCarney, in a news release, stated he believes \"legislators of both parties will see the merit in this proposal.\"\n\nThe weight of a court settlement and the costly threat of further litigation may also help push the proposals through.\n\nIn Washington, one of numerous states targeted in a similar school funding lawsuit, the state Supreme Court fined the state $100,000 each day it failed to enact a funding system that would satisfy justices’ ruling that the government fully fund its schools in line with the state constitution.\n\nDelaware officials initially responded to the lawsuit by arguing school funding was a political issue up to lawmakers and said they had fulfilled the state constitution’s requirement of providing only a “general and efficient” system of public schools.\n\nCHANCERY JUDGE: Politics won't keep me from lawsuit on education funding\n\nVice Chancellor J. Travis Laster, in setting the state for a trial, rejected those arguments two years ago, ruling that the constitution does require schools to provide an adequate education.\n\nHe also separated the second half of the lawsuit, filed against the state’s three counties over their lack of a comprehensive revaluing of all the properties in their jurisdictions since three to four decades ago.\n\nFULL STORY: Delaware's unequal property tax system on trial\n\nThe plaintiffs argued the lack of a reassessment forced school districts to use old property values to raise local taxes for their portion of school funding, locking them into a cycle of regularly and often unsuccessfully asking residents for tax increases to keep up with costs.\n\nThat portion went to trial last year, and in May, Laster ruled the counties had violated the state constitution. A debate over how the counties should fix it remains pending before the judge.\n\nNOW WHAT:Delaware's property tax system ruled unconstitutional.\n\nThe settlement also requires:\n\nThe creation of an educational ombudsperson. Each county will have a program to assist students and families. The family advocates will focus on resolving disputes concerning discipline disparities, inequities in school access and unfair treatment of students.\n\nForming an Early Childhood Assistance Program. By fiscal year 2024, the governor’s budget will include at least $12.2 million to make early childhood education more accessible.\n\nAllocations for teachers in high needs schools. The governor’s 2023 budget must include at least $4 million to support teacher recruitment and retention in high-needs schools. Currently, high-needs schools tend to be staffed by teachers with less than five years of experience.\n\nAn independent funding assessment. By January 2024, the state should assess total funding levels and how education revenue is raised and distributed. The assessment should also make recommendations for improvements to equity and efficiency. However, the assessment will not obligate any action from the state.\n\nChanging how the Department of Education funds school construction. School districts seeking funding for construction must offer an “equity statement,” outlining the demographic information of the students who will attend the new facility. The statement should include how a construction project would affect the equitable distribution of new buildings throughout a district.\n\nContact Jeanne Kuang at jkuang@delawareonline.com.

The suit, filed in Chancery Court, is brought on behalf of Delawareans for Educational Opportunity and the Delaware NAACP.\n\n\"For too long children from low-income families, students whose first language is not English, and children with disabilities have been left behind,\" said Kathleen MacRae, the executive director of the ACLU of Delaware.\n\n“Every child deserves a chance to succeed. All students have a right to an education that prepares them adequately for college and the world of work.\"\n\nJea Street, president of the Delawareans for Educational Opportunity and a New Castle County councilman, said only by investing in education can Delaware lower its incarceration and crime rates, creating a brighter future for its children.\n\n\"I believe in my heart that so long as we continue to miseducate our children, our crime rate, our violent crime rate, will continue to rise,\" he said.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Education issued the following statement about the suit: \"The Delaware Department of Education has not seen any complaint from these groups and will respond to any litigation against it in court. It is the goal of the Department to assist Delaware's schools in preparing every student to succeed in college or career and life.\"\n\nJonathan Starkey, spokesman for Gov. John Carney, said his office was reviewing the complaint.\n\n\"As Governor Carney has said since the day he took office, he believes that all Delaware children deserve a quality education,\" Starkey said. \"He is committed to investing in Delaware's schools and providing additional support and resources for schools serving low-income children, English language learners and students with special needs. He will talk more about his commitment to public education in his State of the State Address this week and in his budget presentation later this month.\"\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the state is failing students from low-income families, students with disabilities and students who are learning English. Test scores for disadvantaged students are far below state standards set by the Delaware Department of Education in its new plan, the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA.\n\nSTORY:Local chefs share secrets at monthly hands-on cooking classes\n\nSTORY:Delaware bail reform bill slated for final vote Tuesday\n\nOne of the most glaring examples is Bayard Middle School in Wilmington, where only 3 percent of students are proficient in math and a mere 8 percent are proficient in English. More than 75 percent of the school's students are considered low-income and almost 9 percent are English language learners. About a quarter of the school's students are in special education.\n\nStudents at Bayard are almost entirely African-American and Hispanic/Latino.\n\nState testing data shows 64 percent of low-income students, 85 percent of English language learners and 86 percent of students with disabilities did not meet the state standards in grades three through eight for English language arts, the lawsuit said.\n\nSeventy-four percent of low-income students, 81 percent of English learners and 89 percent of students with disabilities were below the state’s math standards in those grades, the lawsuit added.\n\nAbout half of Delaware's third-graders struggle to read.\n\nStory continues below PDF.\n\nThe suit claims the state has long recognized that disadvantaged students are performing poorly in comparison to their peers, and the problem has been detailed in state-commissioned task force reports issued in 2001, 2008 and 2015.\n\nThose reports lay out educational standards and interventions necessary to support achievement, including smaller class sizes; expanded school time; highly qualified, specially trained teachers; a focus on early literacy; current technology; effective family engagement; and partnerships with health, family welfare and specialized education service providers.\n\nYet, the lawsuit says many schools in Delaware are not provided with enough resources to follow these recommendations and recent spending cuts have made them even further out of reach.\n\n“Despite the best efforts of teachers, families and school staff, the current education system fails too many Delaware children,\" said ACLU-DE legal director Ryan Tack-Hooper in a statement. \"The state often provides more support to children who are well off than it provides to children living in poverty. The state must meet its constitutional obligation to adequately educate all students.\"\n\nThere are also fewer resources available to schools because property values have not been reassessed for more than 30 years, the lawsuit said. The result is that the underlying school tax base has remained flat for decades while the cost of running schools has risen substantially due to inflation and increased enrollment, the lawsuit said.\n\nOne proposed solution has been to institute a needs-based funding formula, which gives a bigger piece of the pie to disadvantaged students by weighting them more highly. It's something that has been argued for by the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission, a state advisory committee established by former Gov. Jack Markell in 2015 to come up with ideas to improve education in the city.\n\nBut Gov. John Carney, listed as a defendant in the lawsuit, has said he is not in favor of needs-based funding, in part because it gives extra money to school districts serving at-risk kids without holding them accountable for how they use it. He has also said there is neither the financial nor political support for such a measure.\n\nCarney is working with the Christina School District to improve educational outcomes in Wilmington, where Bayard is located, and has proposed giving the Christina School District $1.5 million (to increase by 2 percent every year) for new initiatives there, plus additional money for a dual-generation center.\n\nElizabeth Lockman, a Wilmington parent, vice chair of WEIC, and a member of Delawareans for Educational Opportunity, said the lawsuit was not an indictment of Carney's plan and that those dollars could be beneficial.\n\n\"But how much more meaningful and exciting would it be to fix the funding system and the way those resources flow?\" she said, adding that it's almost unfair to use Bayard Middle School as an example because there are low-performing, low-income schools throughout the state and changing the funding formula could help all of them.\n\n\"This is not a brand new idea,\" she said. \"The inequities have been very clear.\"\n\nThe lawsuit said 46 other states provide additional financial support for English language learners. There are 35 states that provide additional financial support for low-income children.\n\n\"From 1990 to 2011, 26 states substantially increased funding for low-income students and high poverty schools to ensure meaningful educational opportunity for all — the majority as a result of court orders,\" MacCrae said, quoting the lawsuit. \"As a result, we now have two decades of robust empirical evidence about whether and how school funding affects student achievement. It demonstrates that adequate funding leads to increased achievement, even among students who face significant barriers to achievement because of their socioeconomic circumstances.\"\n\nPaul Herdman, president and CEO of the Rodel Foundation, said his organization has been studying the needs-based funding issue and has found that lawsuits often serve as an important catalyst for fundamental shifts in education funding.\n\n\"We've written for over a decade that this current funding system has to change,\" he said. \"And candidly, I don't know of any state that has come to a different funding system on their own, without legal action.\n\n\"My hope is that we can use this as an opportunity to step back and say we've had this funding system for 70-plus years, let's not just band-aid what we've got,\" he said. \"There are very few things that were built 80 years ago that don't need to be redesigned a bit. It's not that it's a flawed system inherently. It's just, in my view, served its purpose and needs to be rethought.\"\n\nTack-Hooper, with the ACLU, said the lawsuit does not ask the court to impose a specific funding formula or needs-based funding but does ask that it finds the current funding system unconstitutional and in need of change.\n\nWhile the state does not determine the amount of money spent at each school on a per-student basis, the lawsuit says \"an analysis of teacher salary data at every school shows that, in at least seven school districts, the per-student expenditure at a school decreases as the percentage of low-income students in the student body of a school increases.\"\n\nThe seven districts are Appoquinimink, Capital, Caesar Rodney, Christina, Indian River, Milford and Red Clay.\n\nThere are also disparities from district to district. For example, in 2013-2014, Delaware allocated $1,694 per pupil less to Woodbridge School District than to Brandywine School District, even though Brandywine’s per-student wealth (property value divided by the number of school children) is more than one and one-half times that of Woodbridge.\n\nSimilarly, the state spent $450 per pupil less in Caesar Rodney School District than it did in Appoquinimink School District, although Appoquinimink’s per-student wealth exceeds Caesar Rodney’s by approximately $100,000.\n\nThe lawsuit also mentions racial discrimination and outlines the history of desegregation in Delaware. It contends that the Neighborhood Schools Act passed in 2000 and the Charter School Act has led to re-segregation in some places.\n\nFor example, in the 2016-2017 school year, Red Clay's Warner and Shortlidge Elementary schools were 2.6 percent and 3.3 percent white, respectively, while the district in which they are located is 43.6 percent white.\n\nBy contrast, Heritage Elementary School, in the same district but outside the city of Wilmington, was 70 percent white. The highest-performing charter school in the area, the Charter School of Wilmington, was 6.3 percent black.\n\nThe percentage of black students enrolled in predominantly non-white schools in 2010 was ten times higher than 1989.\n\nLinwood Jackson, president of the Delaware NAACP, said the fight for educational opportunity is not new to his organization. He said Louis Redding, Delaware's first black lawyer, did not join the legal team in Brown v. Board of Education to create a system where African-American and low-income kids were relegated to rundown school buildings with inadequate resources, however.\n\n\"It would have been unthinkable to him,\" Jackson said.\n\nDelaware NAACP is dedicated to ensuring that all students have an equal opportunity to obtain a high-quality public school education. Delawareans for Educational Opportunity is an association of concerned parents and community leaders that includes parents of low-income students, students with disabilities and English language learners.\n\nThe complaint and other information is available at www.ACLU-DE.org and www.DECLASI.org.\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

He is the chief financial officer at the Delaware Nature Society and has an additional 25-plus years in the accounting and finance sectors.\n\nWilliams has stated that his focus for this election is constituent services, strengthening public schools, supporting working families, protecting the environment and protecting reproductive and voting rights.\n\nState House District 15\n\nThis district is made up of parts of Porter, St. Georges, Bear and Red Lion and has been represented by Valerie Longhurst, a Democrat, since 2004. Longhurst is vying against newcomer Kamela T. Smith, also a Democrat.\n\nValerie Longhurst\n\nLonghurst, who lives in Bear, is currently the speaker of the House in Dover, and she is the first woman to hold that position in Delaware's history and has been a representative from this district for nearly 20 years.\n\nAccording to a statement to the League of Women Voters Education Fund, her main priorities include increased access to mental health care for children.\n\nShe also advocates for \"common-sense gun safety\" on her website and states she is a leader in the state government for \"women's equality in workplace, justice system and healthcare system.\"\n\nKamela T. Smith\n\nThis is Kamela T. Smith's first campaign for public office. She lives in Red Lion and was a mental health professional for 20 years. She said in her field she encountered issues that she was tired of complaining about so she decided to run.\n\nOne of her biggest priorities is closing gaps in mental healthcare for adults in the state, including improvements in employment and residential programs for people with \"serious and persistent\" mental illnesses. She also wants to increase access to breakfast and lunches in schools, and increase transparency in government by supporting the creation of an inspector general.\n\n\"I would try to push that needle a little bit more, working with that and addressing the corruption and the accountability measures in our state for our taxpayers, and making sure that government services are operating the way that they should,\" Smith said.\n\nState House District 21\n\nState House District 21, around the Pike Creek area, could flip to Democrats this year. Republican Mike Ramone held the seat for years, but stepped away from the position to run for governor. Republican Brenda Manella is already in line for the ballot in November, but two Democrats are running to face her for the seat. The race is between a candidate who lost to Ramone by 41 votes in 2022 and his former staffer on that campaign.\n\nFrank Burns\n\nFrank Burns, living in Milford Crossroads, entered state politics in 2022 after a career in public health, remediation and other scientific fields. He runs two years after a razor-thin loss to Ramone. He said his scientific background gives him a unique perspective in government.\n\nBurns said improving the education system is one of his top priorities should he make it to Dover. He said the state should do all of the funding replacing the referendum-based funding system of individual districts.\n\nHe also supports the formation of an inspector general to improve government transparency and accountability.\n\nMichael A. Smith\n\nSmith, living in Milltown, would be one of the youngest legislators in Dover, turning 28 a few days after the primary. He has been involved with local Democratic politics and runs a non profit that brings clean electrification, including electric vehicle charging stations and LED lightbulbs, to businesses and residences around Delaware. He does come with some experience despite his youth, serving as a legislative aide in Dover for a time.\n\n\"There's very few people under the age of 35 and I think adding a younger voice that can represent a district that has a large diversity of ages and families and races is an incredible achievement because we have had nationwide a taste for older politicians that seems to have worn off in the eyes of voters,\" Smith said. \"I believe that having a newer generation leadership can provide a sense of understanding, a sense of perspective, a sense of representation that is currently missing, not only in Dover, but especially in Washington, D.C.\"\n\nHe said his focus includes energy alternatives and road safety. His experience as a legislative aide sets him apart from his opponent, he said.\n\n\"I think I'm the only candidate who has this sense of prioritization that matches those who live in the 21st district,\" Smith said.\n\nState House District 27\n\nThis district includes the Glasgow area of New Castle County, south of Newark and north of Middletown.\n\nThis district has been represented by Democrat Eric Morrison since 2020. The winner of this Democratic primary will face off against Republican Kristina Griffing in November.\n\nEric Morrison\n\nEric Morrison has been in the Delaware House since 2020 and is a progressive Democrat living in Glasgow. He said despite being the incumbent, he still runs a grassroots campaign and hosts town halls.\n\nMorrison said he has been working in the last session to guarantee one hour of paid sick and safety leave for every 30 hours of work for every Delaware worker. Seventeen other states, Washington, D.C., and over 180 countries have some required paid sick time on their books. His bill that would have required paid sick and safety leave in Delaware but didn't get through the House Appropriations Committee. Next year, he hopes to get it \"across the finish line.\"\n\n\"The states are starting to really pick up on that, because we're not doing anything at a federal level,\" Morrison said.\n\nThis past session, he focused more on \"good government.\" This includes laws increasing government transparency through reforming campaign finance laws and restricting nepotism, he said.\n\nMargie Lopez Waite\n\nMargie Lopez Waite is a member of the Delaware Hispanic Commission and is in her first campaign for public office. She lives in Glasgow.\n\nShe worked at Bank of America in multiple different management positions before pursuing education. Waite founded the state's first dual language charter school and has education reform as one of her priorities if elected. She said her experience operating a school gives her a good perspective on what she said was a \"hot topic.\"\n\nHow public and charter schools are funded is one of the most important issues she hopes to tackle if elected. She said it is a \"broken model\" that was built without thinking about equity in the state. Properly applying funding that schools receive is also important, instead of \"throwing money at the problem.\"\n\nWaite said there is a correlation between the strength of the economy and the education system. Being able to attract and keep businesses in Delaware is a way to increase jobs in the future. She also said the environment in her district is important to her, and balancing growth while maintaining green spaces is critical to people in her district.\n\n\"We need to be mindful that we don't just continue to grow without thinking through how we want to protect our resources and our green spaces and protect our environment,\" Waite said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/08/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/watchdog/2018/11/27/njs-campaign-finance-laws-behind-times-so-dark-money-can-pour/1810882002/", "title": "NJ's campaign finance laws behind the times, so dark money can ...", "text": "With the midterms over, New Jersey lawmakers will soon turn their attention to the 2019 legislative races. If recent history is an indicator, outside money will flood into the state as Democrats try to bolster their majority in the Statehouse.\n\nAnd none of it has to be accounted for.\n\nThis so-called \"dark money\" is hidden from the public because New Jersey's rules governing campaign finance have not been updated in years.\n\nThat's despite a push from the Election Law Enforcement Commission to strengthen the state’s financial disclosure laws — a push that has been met with inaction by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. The result is a confusing patchwork of regulations that leave the state susceptible to massive amounts of dark money.\n\nGov. Phil Murphy made a long list of promises during his campaign, many focusing on technology and innovation. But campaign finance received little if any attention from him or any other candidates.\n\nNow that a legislative panel is looking at Murphy’s hiring and Democrats' policy focus is largely consumed by marijuana legalization and raising the minimum wage, the prospects of tightening rules in the near future are not promising.\n\n“We don’t have level playing fields, and I think, generally, the playing field favors Democrats,” said Assembly Republican leader Jon Bramnick, who has been a primary sponsor since 2016 of measures to update the finance requirements. “If the Democrats this year can raise $2 million against Jon Bramnick” from an outside group, he added, “why would they want to change the rules?”\n\nSome Democrats do want to change the rules but have yet to get enough support in the Statehouse.\n\nThe 2002 McCain-Feingold law banning unlimited “soft money” donations opened the door to large increases in outside spending in New Jersey, but even by then the state was in some respects well behind the times on campaign finance.\n\nNext steps for legal weed:What still needs to happen before marijuana is legal in NJ\n\nMeet Phil Murphy's inside man:The guy with access to the governor\n\nAs an example, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1976 — while Murphy, 61, was an undergraduate at Harvard — that independent committees that use “express advocacy” to directly try to elect or defeat candidates can be made to disclose their contributions.\n\nAt least 23 other states, including neighboring Delaware, New York and Pennsylvania, require such disclosures, according to the Election Law Enforcement Commission. But New Jersey has yet to do so, allowing independent groups with unknown financial sources to have their say without any of the requirements of candidates and party committees.\n\nMurphy's office did not respond to a message seeking comment on whether the governor supports greater transparency.\n\nOutside spending in New Jersey really started ramping up around 2006, said Jeff Brindle, executive director of the Election Law Enforcement Commission. But, again, New Jersey’s laws have not caught up with the times.\n\nAs a result, independent spending from outside the state has become the preferred weapon of influence in New Jersey.\n\nIn September, the commission found that the top 25 special interest groups spent more than $74 million trying to influence elections and policies last year, through super PACs, political action committees or lobbying. Of that, $41 million was dark money from independent groups, the commission said.\n\nIn the meantime, fundraising by local, county and the state’s so-called Big Six party committees has dropped to about $29 million, Brindle said.\n\n“The differential is going to continue to grow if the Legislature doesn’t do anything to reform the system,” Brindle said.\n\nExamples of special interests asserting their influence abound in New Jersey.\n\nA pro-Murphy non-profit run by adviser and former campaign chairman Brendan Gill, New Direction New Jersey, launched last November and ran advertisements promoting Murphy's budget, but it has not disclosed its donors. Gill said it would voluntarily disclose that information at the end of the year.\n\nIf it does disclose, New Direction New Jersey would stand out from the Committee for Our Children’s Future, which was formed by a group of former Gov. Chris Christie's college friends during his first term. The group spent nearly $8 million on ads promoting Christie and his budget and education agenda without ever disclosing its donors.\n\nLast year a collection of independent groups spent $14.4 million — about the same amount Murphy spent in the general election for governor — in what was supposed to be a sleepy race for Senate President Stephen Sweeney in South Jersey’s 3rd Legislative District.\n\nBut the New Jersey Education Association, angered by Sweeney’s decisions on public employee pensions, sought to unseat Sweeney, and that race became the most expensive of its kind in the country. The NJEA-backed super PAC Garden State Forward spent at least $4.8 million, while the Sweeney-aligned super PACs New Jerseyans for a Better Tomorrow and General Majority PAC spent $7.6 million, the commission said.\n\nNone of those super PACs has to file disclosures with the state, but the Sweeney-aligned groups, as well as the Murphy-backing super PAC Committee to Build the Economy, do.\n\nMany others don’t.\n\nIn 2013, a group called Better Education for New Jersey Kids pumped $251,629 into the Jersey City mayor’s race without filing a single document with the state. Neither did the Committee for Economic Growth and Justice, a super PAC that spent $176,116 on a school board race that year in Elizabeth.\n\nAnd in 2015, a Washington, D.C.-based super PAC, New Jersey’s Future Fund, got involved in Parsippany’s Republican mayoral primary but was said to be tied to the Democratic Party, according to the commission. But no one knows, because it didn’t file any disclosure reports with the state or the Federal Election Commission.\n\nIt isn’t just the lack of disclosure requirements that concerns the state enforcement commission. New Jersey’s pay-to-play law restricting campaign contributions from contractors should also be updated, Brindle said. The law has become a “bewildering maze,” according to the commission, that allows county and local governments to set their own standards, which may or may not be in line with the state’s requirement that vendors file disclosures if they have at least $50,000 in contracts.\n\nThe commission recommends lowering that threshold to $17,500 and requiring contractors to disclose all contributions to super PACs and other independent groups.\n\n“There’s an incentive to legally go around the law,” Brindle said.\n\nPerhaps nowhere was that more clear than in Newark in 2014. That year’s mayoral race saw $5.5 million in independent spending — the most on a local race in state history. And $4.5 million of it came from a group called Newark First to losing candidate Shavar Jeffries.\n\nNewark First did file disclosure reports with the state, which showed that contractor Bloomberg LP contributed $400,000, the second-most given to the group. Newark First’s biggest donor was Education Reform Now, a New York City-based group supportive of charter schools. That group donated more than $3 million, according to commission records.\n\nBut it’s a mystery who donated to Education Reform Now because it did not file any disclosure reports that year, and the law didn’t require it to.\n\nSen. Troy Singleton, who has sponsored bills to address the enforcement commission’s concerns, said he remains “hopeful” that the Legislature will advance the proposals.\n\n“Right now there’s a cynicism in our government at every level, where people feel money and influence are dictating public policy,” said Singleton, D-Burlington. Something as simple as requiring disclosure for all political donations could help restore that confidence, he said.\n\n“Everyone likes the transparent system,” Singleton said. “I think folks would be hard-pressed not to be supportive of that.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/06/20/renewed-push-improve-wilmington-schools-educational-equity-passes-senate/1497610001/", "title": "Renewed push to improve Wilmington schools, educational equity ...", "text": "State Sen. Elizabeth \"Tizzy\" Lockman wants to reinvigorate the conversation around Wilmington schools.\n\nThree years ago, the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission presented the General Assembly with education policy recommendations to improve schools in the city.\n\nThe issue at hand: How should the state go about supporting high-risk students in the city, and improving access to high-quality public education?\n\nTo meet the needs of students living in poverty, English learners and other high-risk students, the commission recommended that the state adopt a weighted funding model.\n\nThe commission also proposed redistricting New Castle County schools, having Red Clay Consolidated School District absorb Christina School District's city schools. In 2016, the state Senate rejected the plan to redistrict schools. The plan would have also shifted money toward high-poverty schools.\n\nLockman, who served as vice-chair of the commission, is now spearheading a new look at Wilmington schools, through the proposed Redding Consortium for Educational Equity.\n\nSenate Bill 148, which passed through the Senate on Tuesday, would retire the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission and replace it with the consortium. The bill now awaits approval from the House. A companion bill sponsored by Rep. Nnamdi Chukwuocha outlines the consortium's responsibilities in greater detail.\n\nThe consortium would be tasked with recommending policies that improve educational outcomes for Wilmington and northern New Castle County students, with an emphasis on improving equity in education.\n\n“It’s a body that continues with the same struggle we’ve been in for a really long time,” Lockman said. “How do we make our public schools as successful as they possibly can be? It’s time for us to actually follow through on the many things that people who are very close to our schools would like to see happen to move [schools] forward.”\n\nIn 2015, the state-sanctioned Wilmington Education Improvement Commission began exploring ways to make public schools in the city better.\n\nBut while the commission received support from the General Assembly, funding was never allocated to make the suggestions a reality. Gov. John Carney has allocated additional funds to help schools with low-income students and English learners, but Delaware’s funding formula doesn’t consistently give districts more money for high-needs students.\n\nCreating a new funding mechanism for high-needs students was one of the commission’s recommendations, and the state’s existing system is being challenged in an ongoing lawsuit against the state.\n\nOPPORTUNITY FUNDING: Gov. John Carney proposes expanding Opportunity Funding to $75 million\n\nThree years after the commission ended its legislative efforts, Wilmington schools are still underperforming compared to other schools in the state. The work of the commission feels like “unfinished business,” Lockman said.\n\n\"The proposed consortium is a response to many years of political inertia, and what I am now beginning to see as increased attention to providing real supports for underserved children and under-resourced schools,\" said Tony Allen, provost and executive vice president at Delaware State University. Allen served as the commission's chair before stepping down in December.\n\n\"The commission spent many years building the fact pattern for much of the current discussion in public education reform,\" he said.\n\nResponsibilities of the consortium include: evaluating the need for additional or alternative schools in the city (including high schools), a redistricting proposal and addressing the viability of New Castle County’s tax pool.\n\nMembers would include stakeholders in education and the city, including superintendents, the mayor, charter school representatives, teachers and parents.\n\n\"We believe that the voices of the educators who spend each day in these classrooms need to be heard when discussing solutions for our Wilmington schools,\" said Stephanie Ingram, president of the Delaware State Education Association, the statewide teachers union. The union would have a voting member on the consortium.\n\nShould the consortium be formed, Lockman said she hopes it sets an example for education throughout the state. While some lawmakers were wary of continued focus on Wilmington, solving problems in the city targets “the systemic issues that we know have resonance across the entire state,” she said.\n\n“Wilmington’s challenges aren’t necessarily unique,” Lockman said. “It’s just that in the city, you see a very acute expression of some of the dysfunctional tendencies of our public school systems.”\n\nWhatever policies the consortium implements could benefit high-needs students across the state, said Mervin Daugherty, former superintendent of Red Clay Consolidated School District. Daugherty was a member of the prior commission.\n\n“Poverty is throughout the state. If you can address an issue in one part of the state and notice the positive effects of it, then you can replicate it through other parts of the state with success,” he said. “Wilmington has unlimited potential to create a very positive learning environment for the children. It can be a lighthouse for other people to follow, if they do it right.”\n\nHowever, Daugherty said, a renewed look at Wilmington schools will only be effective if there is funding available to match the consortium’s policy recommendations.\n\nOtherwise, he said, all you’re left with is a “powerful report.”\n\nOPINION: For Wilmington schools, the struggle continues. But there is reason for optimism\n\n“People in the last commission had a great heart for the kids, but without the funding mechanism to improve the system, it’s extremely difficult,” he said.\n\nLockman said she hopes the consortium is able to propose ideas that are still mindful of funding realities.\n\n“It’s not going to serve us to propose something that is impossible to afford,” she said. \"I'm pretty tired of admiring the problem and talking around it. There are a number of solutions we could choose from to move forward.\"\n\nThe consortium, named for Louis L. Redding, the first African American to be admitted to the Delaware bar, would cost an estimated $240,000 per year, and would be staffed by University of Delaware’s Institute for Public Administration and Delaware State University’s School of Graduate Studies.\n\nThe bill must be signed by the end of the legislative session, on June 30. Should it pass, the consortium would be required to meet by Sept. 1.\n\nNatalia Alamdari covers education for The News Journal.

If anything, it epitomizes a statewide trend. Low-income students suffering from stress and trauma and other societal issues can be found all over Delaware. They are more concentrated in the city, making the issue seem more salient there.\n\n\"It's a small state,\" said Atnre Alleyne, executive director of the Delaware Campaign for Achievement Now. \"You're talking about a system composed of 19 school districts, and a large share of those are in Christina and Red Clay.\"\n\nStudents all over Delaware aren't getting the proper support or education, many say, as the result of inadequate funding mechanisms.\n\nTEST SCORES:See scores for your district, school\n\nOthers say it's a lack of accountability and the failure of local school boards and staff to take responsibility for downward trends.\n\nWhat's clear after speaking to local advocates and school board members is that a solution is still a long way off. In the meantime, close to half of all kids in the state can't read, write or do math well enough to go to college or get a well-paying job.\n\n\"We have far too many students that aren't receiving the quality they deserve,\" Alleyne said. \"We have really large districts where you're not seeing changes that will change the status quo for those students.\"\n\nErica Dorsett, a Wilmington parent, said low test scores released Thursday are frightening.\n\nShe lives in the Christina district, next door to Bayard and in the feeder pattern for Newark High School. She's opted to send her kids to Thomas Edison Charter School and Tatnall because of Christina's poor academic record.\n\n\"It's not only scary,\" she said of the district's test scores. \"As a parent, I think it's unacceptable. They need to make success more quickly.\"\n\nThe priority schools\n\nThe Department of Education says assessment results released Thursday are proof that even Delaware's neediest schools can be turned around. Laurel Middle School, for instance, has made significant gains since 2014, when it was designated a \"priority school\" for having some of the state's lowest test scores.\n\nBut priority schools in Wilmington have made little to no progress. In some areas, they've regressed, state test scores show, dropping further below the statewide average than they were three years ago, when the new Smarter Balance test was introduced.\n\nMost notably, Bayard Middle School has seen no gains in math, remaining at a 3 percent proficiency level. There was a 1-point loss in English, bringing the proficiency level down to 8 percent.\n\n\"I think anybody who says they're shocked would be being disingenuous,\" Lockman said.\n\nShe certainly isn't surprised. Her daughter spent kindergarten through sixth grade at what would later become another priority school, Highlands Elementary.\n\nPart of the Red Clay district, it saw a 2-point gain in math this year, but a 3-point loss in English.\n\n\"The period of time (my daughter) attended, the poverty was climbing every year,\" Lockman said. \"And the challenge that presented and the way it exponentially increased was palpable.\"\n\n\"The fact we're seeing decline [in Wilmington's priority schools] is just depressing.\"\n\nPati Nash, spokeswoman for Red Clay, says the Smarter Balance scores don't tell the whole story.\n\nRed Clay performs its own assessments, including tests called the Scholastic Reading Inventory and the Scholastic Math Inventory.\n\nAt Warner Elementary, another priority school, kids moved 20 percent from \"below basic\" in reading and increased 16 percent to proficient and 6 percent to advanced.\n\n\"Students at our priority schools are meeting growth goals and our next step would be to grow proficiency levels,\" Nash said.\n\nRed Clay has its own School Turnaround Office and a School Turnaround Council, which consists of district leaders that meet monthly.\n\n\"A school turnaround is not something that happens overnight,\" Nash said.\n\nShe said high poverty rates have made things more difficult — research shows that low-income students don't perform as well in school.\n\nAt Highlands, the poverty rate is 73.5 percent; at Warner, it's 83.2 percent. Shortlidge Academy, which houses kindergarten through second grade and is part of the same \"campus\" as Warner, has a poverty level of 86.9 percent.\n\nPoverty statistics at Christina School District's priority schools are similar.\n\nElizabeth Paige, a member of Christina's Board of Education, said, \"The students at our schools struggle with so much more than test scores.\"\n\nBeyond poverty, there's also trauma in Wilmington, which is wracked by drug- and gang-related violence and shootings. But \"all the right people are too busy focusing on test scores to help,\" Paige said.\n\nThough Christina's new superintendent, Richard Gregg, has said he's putting together a plan to address the priority schools, without more funding from the state and other kinds of intervention, Paige said she's not sure how much progress the district can make.\n\n'Too few bright spots'\n\nWilmington is just a part of the overall picture.\n\n\"You can see a good deal of struggle outside of Wilmington ... which I think reinforces the point that while it is easy to pigeonhole Wilmington as an epicenter of concentrated failure, there are systemic barriers to success everywhere and the averages aren't telling a full story of where/how the odds are being beaten and where they're not,\" Lockman said.\n\nStatewide, math proficiency for students in grades 3 to 8 is only 45 percent, though the state is quick to point out that's a 4-point gain since 2015.\n\nIn English, 54 percent were proficient, compared with 55 percent in 2016. Though that percentage went down, the actual number of proficient students went up by 285, according to Department of Education data.\n\nSo where are the odds being beaten?\n\nEven at Cape Henlopen, the public school district that performed best in math this year, only 61 percent of students were proficient in the subject. Caesar Rodney performed the best in English among public districts, with 67 percent of students meeting proficiency.\n\nA majority of districts were below 50 percent proficiency in at least one subject: Laurel, Seaford, Woodbridge, Delmar, Milford, Capital, Christina, Smyrna, Brandywine, Red Clay and Colonial.\n\nThat leaves Cape Henlopen, Lake Forest, Caesar Rodney, Indian River, Appoquinimink and Lake Forest on the other side.\n\nIf it weren't for certain high-performing charter schools — Academy of Dover, Sussex Academy, Newark Charter, MOT and Odyssey Charter, to name a few — the state figures might be even lower.\n\nThat's a pessimistic view, and Alleyne, who used to work for the Department of Education and studied assessment data, said the state should really be most concerned with districts that aren't moving the bar at all.\n\nSchools that are improving, even if their proficiency rates are still fairly low, should be celebrated.\n\nFor instance, Delmar reached 49 percent proficiency in math this year, exceeding the state average for the first time.\n\nIn Seaford, the math proficiency went up 13 percent in 2017 while the English went up 12 percent.\n\nThere are also schools — Sussex Academy and Newark Charter — that have proficiency rates in the 80 and 90 percent range.\n\n\"The danger is sometimes we don't always have so many bright spots in Delaware,\" Alleyne said.\n\nMoving the bar\n\nDorsett, the Wilmington parent, said after seeing this year's test scores, she wants to know what action will be taken to improve them.\n\n\"As a parent, I really want to know what the districts are going to do to make it better,\" she said. \"There has to be some level of accountability.\"\n\nJohn Young, another Christina school board member, said things would be even worse if the school had gone along with a state takeover of priority schools proposed by the Department of Education in 2014. He believes it would have been more disruptive than anything else.\n\nIn the years since, Christina has worked with Education Department to implement new instructional plans, he said, but it hasn't had a large impact.\n\nWhat could work is needs-based funding, Young said. It has been proposed in Delaware but never made it through the General Assembly. That model would give extra funding to schools based on how many low-income students, special education students or English Language Learners they have.\n\n“Not all children learn the same, are the same and, therefore, the level of support needed to get them to the same place may be variable and differential,\" Young said.\n\nInstead of approving a new funding model this year, the General Assembly approved a new Opportunity Grant program, which Young is not a fan of.\n\nThe program would award $1 million in funding to offer additional support to low-income students, students chronically exposed to stress and trauma, and English Language Learners to 10 schools.\n\nMORE:Carney launches grant program to support disadvantaged students\n\n\"I was disappointed to see (Gov. John Carney) continue the tradition of hunger games by creating competitive grants,\" he said.\n\nCarney also established a new Wilmington-based Department of Education office, called the Office of Improvement & Innovation. It will be led by Dorrell Green, currently assistant superintendent of the Brandywine School District, and will support educators on the ground, particularly in struggling schools in Wilmington.\n\nAlleyne said none of that will work without increased accountability.\n\nCurrently, state test scores only factor a very small part into teacher evaluations, and public school districts are not at risk of losing funding if they perform badly (though charter schools may be shut down).\n\n\"The theory right now is, let's support our way to progress,\" Alleyne said. \"And I think we need a mix.\"\n\n\"What happens if we don't see any change?\"\n\nContact Jessica Bies at (302) 324-2881 or jbies@delawareonline.com.

John Carney's veto of a controversial charter school bill could be a sign he is ready to fight for change in Wilmington schools.\n\nBut this is a city that has been given empty promises and half-measures for decades. To be a true champion for its children, the governor will need to do far more.\n\nI hope Carney has it in him.\n\nCarney has given other signals: he managed to slip $1 million in grants for high-poverty education into an otherwise threadbare budget. And he has formed a new office within the Department of Education committed to Wilmington education.\n\nThis is undoubtedly a good cause. The city's educational plight is one of the greatest moral failures in Delaware — by any objective standard, the average Wilmington student is whole grade levels behind the curve. Failed school careers are one big reason why the city has among the highest rates of youth violence in America.\n\nCarney is sending good signals, but Wilmington's youth need far more than signals.\n\nA veto only means the status quo. Hopefully, this is just the starting point.\n\nReal reform means Carney must take up the heavy burden of those who have tried to reform the system before. It was only two years ago when the Wilmington Education Improvement Commission seized Delaware’s educational spotlight with its call for weighted student funding and school redistricting.\n\nDespite uniting almost all of Wilmington behind its cause, and despite making it further than any of the many previous commissions that came before it, WEIC could not convince the state Senate to move forward.\n\nCarney’s moves to help Wilmington are nowhere near the scope of WEIC — so far.\n\nThe bill Carney rejected would eliminate charters' ability to give enrollment preferences to kids who live within five miles of campus. He supports the basic premise of the bill, but he rejected a provision that would continue to prevent Wilmington kids from getting enrollment preferences at the elite Newark Charter School.\n\nThat, he said, \"unfairly excludes some of our most vulnerable students.\"\n\nWilmington leaders and educational activists can cheer the veto, but they sure better keep an eye on Carney’s follow-through.\n\nRep. Kim Williams, D-Newport, is the sponsor of the bill Carney rejected, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a stronger supporter of traditional public schools. She doesn't like the Newark Charter exemption any more than Carney does, but she included it for a reason — she feared the bill wouldn't pass without it.\n\nNewark Charter supporters say it was created to serve as a sort of neighborhood school for the greater Newark area, a mission that would be undermined by kids coming down I-95 from Wilmington. The school and its advocates would likely fight a bill that didn't include the exemption.\n\nWilliams says she intends to run the bill again next year, this time without the charter exclusion. And she's hoping Carney will help her fight to pass it.\n\nIf he doesn't, and if the new bill fails, this veto is naught but a symbolic gesture. Literally nothing will have changed — remember, Wilmington kids don't get enrollment preferences at Newark Charter now, and never have.\n\nA cynic could see Carney's veto as a quick political ploy.\n\nPublic school supporters have decried the education budget cuts Carney proposed and criticized him for saying the state can't afford weighted funding for students in poverty. This could be a quick, easy way to score some points with that very vocal crowd.\n\nThe veto itself costs Carney little politically. Charter school supporters won't be mad that changes to their enrollment preference rules were halted.\n\nThe only people irked are those like Williams, who think the bill is important but can't pass without the compromise she worked out.\n\nAlso, we need to put some perspective on this: even if the bill passes, it is just a modest tweak to the charter school law. It is nowhere near the scale of reform necessary to end generational school inequality.\n\nIt won't ease the trauma that haunts children in violence-stricken neighborhoods; it won't halt the rampant teacher turnover in at-risk schools; and it won't do anything to put the best teachers and leaders in front of the kids who need them most.\n\nI, for one, am hopeful that Carney could swing for the fences on education for at-risk kids. But I am also clear-eyed that the task would be monumental.\n\nIt will certainly be a lot harder than breaking out the veto pen.\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delwareonline.com, (302) 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/02/01/delaware-eying-27-percent-hike-state-employees-health-insurance/72395010007/", "title": "Why Delaware is eying a 27% hike on state employees' health ...", "text": "Editor's note: This story has been updated to correct for the fact that the state appealed the Medicare Advantage lawsuit on an order issued in May by Superior Court Judge Calvin Scott Jr.\n\nDelaware is eying a 27% increase in state employees’ health insurance premiums to help bridge regular gaps in funding that often leave the state’s health benefits fund in the red.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/01"}]}

The nonprofit also worked with Delaware Concerned Residents for Environmental Justice, the Delaware Sierra Club and the Environmental Justice Health Alliance.\n\nFrom the data, the researchers found that:\n\nMarshallton faces the highest risk of health issues. The chances of the neighborhood's residents being diagnosed with cancer or a respiratory illness is 33 and 71 percent higher than in Greenville.\n\nDunleith, Oakmont and Southbridge have cancer risks that are 19 to 23 percent higher than Greenville. The respiratory risks are 32 to 43 percent higher.\n\nNewport, Belvedere and Cedar Heights have cancer risks 21, 15 and 12 percent higher than Greenville, and respiratory risks 44, 30 and 24 percent higher than the affluent area.\n\nIn 2008, state public health officials said residents of eight areas in Delaware get cancer at a rate of 10 percent to 45 percent higher than the rest of state, but they did not look at small communities. They cited large swaths upstate from Wilmington to New Castle and from Bear to Glasgow and Middletown, as well as Kenton and Millsboro downstate. Roughly four in 10 Delawareans lived in areas with cancer clusters, the state said then.\n\nThe authors of the study released Thursday decided to compare the seven communities to Greenville, one of the whitest and wealthiest communities in the area, to contextualize how large the health disparities can be in the county.\n\nEven though many of the communities are only a few miles from the affluent area, residents have a dramatically different life experience, the report said.\n\nThe communities along the Del. 9 Corridor are all within one mile of the Delaware Memorial Bridge, which faces a large amount of traffic every year and runs over a Dupont chemical plant, the report said. The areas are also near the Cherry Island landfill.\n\nRon White, a senior fellow with UCS's Center for Science and Democracy, said the authors wanted to look at communities in the county that are within a one-mile radius of EPA designated brownfields and superfund sites, polluting facilities listed in EPA’s Toxic Release Inventory and high-risk facilities a part of the agency's Risk Management Plan program.\n\nThat's why areas such as those near the Delaware City refinery aren't included, he said\n\nMore:Delaware's cancer death rate still higher than U.S.\n\nThe report says the seven areas' health woes date back to segregated housing that located communities, several of which are predominately black, in areas exposed to large amounts of pollution.\n\nDuring the 1940s and 1950s, black Wilmington residents could only find housing in these neighborhoods. Even years after the Civil Rights movement, there were lines \"of demarcation black people knew you didn't cross\" in the city, Roberts said.\n\nThe buildings, including a public housing community, were on top of a filled marsh, where chronic flooding and mold still remain issues to this day, the report said. The houses were built with substandard and cheap materials, and lead paint was used on interior surfaces.\n\nA \"thriving\" black middle class once lived where the chemical company Chemours, formerly DuPont, is headquartered in Wilmington. But many relocated to Belvedere and Cedar Heights.\n\nThe report identified 10 chemicals in all seven communities that contributed to the increased health risks.\n\nMore:Chemo, work, sleep, repeat: Working while undergoing cancer treatment is the new normal\n\nFormaldehyde — commonly emitted by cars, trucks and incinerators — contributed most to the cancer risk, accounting for about half, the report said. Other toxic chemicals included benzene, acetaldehyde, carbon tetrachloride, and 1.3-butadiene.\n\nThe five chemicals associated with respiratory hazard are acrolein, acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, diesel particulate matter and chlorine.\n\nAt the end of the report, the authors included seven recommendations that they believe could improve the safety and health of residents living along the Del. 9 Corridor. It included:\n\nRequire chemical facilities to use safer chemicals and technologies.\n\nMake these facilities share their emergency response plans with the nearby communities.\n\nEnsure that large chemical facilities constantly monitor and publicly report their emissions and health hazards.\n\nPrevent the construction of new or expanded facilities near homes and schools. And conversely, avoid building new homes and schools near chemical facilities.\n\nRequire the reporting of health-impact assessments that look into the effect hazardous chemical exposures have on the communities.\n\nStrengthen the enforcement of current environmental and workplace safety regulations.\n\nCreate and enforce stricter car emission standards and limit heavy-duty traffic and idling in residential areas.\n\nDelaware Division of Public Health officials said Thursday that the report contradicts the department's analysis of cancer rates in Delaware.\n\nSpokeswoman Andrea Wojcik said in a statement that the department is \"concerned that people in those communities may well get the impression that their cancers are a result of environmental factors and not other factors.\"\n\nCancer is caused by a variety of reasons, particularly lifestyle choices and genetics. Environmental exposures presents little threat to residents, she said.\n\nThe state has found that none of the communities listed in the report had \"a consistently elevated cancer incidence rate\" and of the cancers that were elevated none of them are related to the environment.\n\nDepartment Director Dr. Karyl Rattay said in a statement that there is \"no question that disparities in cancer rates exist.\" Yet she believes promoting healthy lifestyle choices – such as no tobacco use, regular exercise and a healthy diet – will help create equal health outcomes for Delawareans.\n\n\"The report suggests that direct exposure to environmental toxins is the cause of cancer in these communities,\" she said. \"This is not consistent with our analysis and does a disservice to individuals in these communities.\"\n\nOther officials believe the report shows more environmental legislation is needed in the county.\n\nNew Castle County Executive Matt Meyer commended the environmental groups for putting the report together and said it will be \"very helpful\" for policymakers.\n\nMeyer said the county is aggressively increasing efforts to produce renewable energy. Officials also need to continue to look at zoning in order protect all residents from environmental pollution, he said.\n\n\"There's more that needs to be done,\" Meyer said.\n\nWilmington City Councilman Sam Guy, who attended the environmental groups' press conference on Thursday, said the city was, at one time, actively trying to address the environmental concerns in many of these neighborhoods.\n\nWhen Guy was a councilman in the late 1990s and early 2000s, he said City Council passed legislation and created committees, such as the Children's Environmental Hazards Education Committee, that looked into environmental issues in the city. Those laws are still on the books, but are not being enforced, he said.\n\n\"The folks here say they want somebody to work with,\" he said of the environmental groups. \"I'm saying now they got somebody to work with,\" he said. \"But it's a fight.\"\n\nShawn Garvin, secretary of Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control, said in a statement that the department looks \"forward to analyzing and possibly making use of the report's findings in the hopes that it can help\" Delawareans.\n\nOctavia \"Penny\" Dryden, a Wilmington native and member of Delaware Concerned Residents for Environmental Justice, said the authors plan to meet with elected officials about turning these recommendations into legislation in the 2018 session of the General Assembly.\n\nThe most important step, she said, is to inform residents of these health risks.\n\n\"They have the right to know,\" Dryden said. \"They need to get involved and get engaged and have the obligation to take action and understand the real impacts of all of this.\"\n\nThe Delaware Sierra Club will host a forum from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday that addresses the issues raised in the report. It will be held at the Episcopal Church of Saints Andrew & Matthew, 19 N Shipley St. in Wilmington.\n\nFor more information and registration, go to delaware.sierraclub.org/EJsolutions.\n\nContact Meredith Newman at (302) 324-2386 or at mnewman@delawareonline.com.

Moreover, there were no reported assaults in 21 of those towns.\n\nThe state data, called the Uniform Crime Reports, focus on those four major crimes as well as the property crimes of burglary, larceny and auto theft. Illegal drug offenses, vandalism and other offenses are not included in the major crime reports.\n\nOne statistical problem concerns the different types of crimes that make up the major crime rate, said Christopher Herrmann, assistant professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.\n\nViolent crimes cause much greater harm to people than property crimes, but they are all lumped together as major crimes.\n\n“I’d rather live in a city that had 1,000 car thefts and no murders than a city that had 10 murders and no car thefts,” Herrmann said.\n\nCrime is generally driven by demographics, Herrmann said. During hard economic times, low-income places fare much worse than wealthy areas. During the pandemic, small and medium-size cities and depressed parts of large cities took a hit, he said. Because of pockets of poverty within those cities, they have more untreated mental health problems, drug use and gang activity — and fewer resources to address the problems.\n\nIt’s no surprise that some of the least violent towns are among the wealthiest in the state.\n\nThe pandemic had at least one positive effect, Herrmann added. Residential burglaries plummeted because everyone was stuck at home.\n\nAcross the 555 reporting municipalities, New Jersey saw its overall crime rate drop from 16.4 per 1,000 residents in 2018 to 13.5 in 2020, according to a summary of the crime reports. The state's three-year crime average was 15.1 per 1,000.\n\nSome communities are patrolled by State Police and are not broken out separately in the data.\n\nMurders rose in New Jersey from 286 to 329 during the three years, along with assaults (10,448 to 11,378). Reports of the following major crimes decreased from 2018 through 2020: rape (1,420 to 1,281); robbery (6,351 to 4,388); burglary (19,094 to 12,989), larceny (94,498 to 79,742); and auto theft (11,008 to 10,287).\n\nBurlington, Camden, Cumberland and Gloucester counties\n\nIn one South Jersey town, your biggest worry might be an assault by an errant golf ball.\n\nNew Jersey State Police records show not a single crime was reported over the past three years in Pine Valley, a Camden County borough comprised of a world-renowned golf course and a sprinkling of upscale homes. About a dozen residents live on a peaceful landscape of forested hills and verdant greens spread over one square mile.\n\nPine Valley’s blemish-free scorecard gives it an edge over Tavistock, another well-behaved golf-club community in Camden County.\n\nA State Police Uniform Crime Report shows a single crime in Tavistock in 2018, when someone reported a theft. Similar reports for 2019 and 2020 omit any mention of the borough, which has five residents, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nBoth country-club towns are wedged between larger municipalities with significantly more crime.\n\nTavistock is nestled against Barrington, Haddonfield and Lawnside, which in 2018 reported a combined 359 offenses, with non-violent thefts making up the largest category in each municipality. Over the three-year period, the crime rate per 100,000 residents averaged 1,256 in Barrington, 1,147.3 in Haddonfield, and 3,964.9 in Lawnside, according to the UCRs.\n\nPine Valley is next to Pine Hill, with which it’s pursuing a municipal merger. Pine Hill has almost 10,5000 residents on about four acres — and a crime rate, also inflated by thefts, that averaged 1,786.3 over the three-year period.\n\nSeveral of Camden County’s smaller towns fell just short of avoiding murders, sex assaults and robberies from 2018 to 2020.\n\nTwo towns each reported a single robbery during that period: Audubon Park in 2020 and Gibbsboro in 2018.\n\nSimilarly, Chesilhurst and Hi-Nella reported lone sex assaults in 2020 and 2018, respectively.\n\nTwo towns in Burlington County almost 30 miles apart on the Delaware River waterfront – Riverton and Fieldsboro — also recorded low violent crimes.\n\nJust two assaults were reported – both in 2018 – in Riverton, a town of 2,700 residents that started as a summer resort for wealthy Philadelphians in the mid-19th Century. The 1.6-square-mile borough that year also had 35 burglaries, larcenies and auto thefts for an overall crime rate of 1,371.4.\n\nFieldsboro, with roots in the colonial era, had a single assault during the three-year period, also in 2018. The borough, with about 550 residents in less than half of a square mile, had an overall tally that year of 12 offenses for a crime rate of 2,268.4.\n\nUCR reports also showed no murders, rapes or robberies in the sprawling townships of Chesterfield, New Hanover and North Hanover. But the reports also showed 13 assaults during that period in North Hanover.\n\nIn Gloucester County, four towns — South Harrison, Wenonah, Woodbury Heights and Woolwich — had no murders, rapes or robberies in the three-year period, according to the State Police.\n\nThe most common crimes in those municipalities was larceny, or theft.\n\nThefts represented 62 of the 72 offenses reported last year in Woodbury Heights, 43 of 48 total crimes in Woolwich, and 15 of 21 in Wenonah.\n\nThefts made up all 10 crimes reported in rural South Harrison in 2020.\n\nTwo Gloucester County towns that almost avoided all of the serious crimes were Greenwich and Swedesboro. Each reported a single robbery in 2018.\n\nAnd some South Jersey communities measured progress toward avoiding violent crimes during the three-year period.\n\nThe most notable example is Camden City, which last year reported 2,751 crimes — the first time that number fell below 3,000 in more than 50 years. That compared to 3,260 crimes in 2019 and 3,417 one year earlier.\n\nIt also compared to 2020 crime totals of 1,629 in Cherry Hill; 1,466 in Vineland; 1101 in Millville; 1,055 in Deptford; 825 in Gloucester Township; 571 in Mount Laurel; 463 in Washington Township; and 387 in Evesham.\n\nCamden City’s crime rate still ended 2020 at a steep 3,761.3 – although that was down substantially from 4,671.9 in 2018.\n\n“We continue to make progress on a daily basis in the city,” Camden County Police Department Chief Gabe Rodriguez said after FBI statistics in September showed homicides rising nationwide but down in the city.\n\n“That said, we still have miles to go to reach our overall objectives,” Rodriguez said.\n\nHelp support local journalism; log in or subscribe to a digital account.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/11/21/alcohol-abuse-drunkest-city-every-state/885747001/", "title": "Alcohol abuse: The drunkest city in every state", "text": "Excessive drinking claims the lives of tens of thousands of Americans each year and is responsible for about 1 in every 10 deaths among working-age adults. Alcohol abuse also takes a heavy economic toll.\n\nA recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that excessive alcohol consumption cost the U.S. economy an estimated $250 billion in 2010 — primarily in lost productivity, medical bills, and motor vehicle accidents.\n\nExcessive alcohol consumption, according to the CDC, includes binge drinking — defined as four or more drinks in a single occasion for women and five or more for men — and heavy drinking, which is defined as at least eight drinks per week for women and 15 for men.\n\nAn estimated 18% of American adults drink excessively. However, binge and heavy drinking rates are not uniform across the country and can vary greatly from state to state and city to city. Across U.S. metro areas, excessive drinking rates range from fewer than 1 in every 10 adults to more than 1 in every 4 adults.\n\n24/7 Wall St. reviewed data from the CDC to identify the metropolitan areas reporting the highest levels of binge and heavy drinking in each state.\n\nAlabama\n\nDrunkest city: Auburn-Opelika\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.9%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 13.0% (4th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 32.5%\n\nExcessive drinking is more common in the Auburn-Opelika area than in any other metro area in Alabama. An estimated 15.9% of area adults are either heavy or binge drinkers, a larger share than the 13.0% of adults across the state.\n\nDespite ranking as the heaviest drinking metro area in the state, adults in Auburn-Opelika are less likely to drink excessively than the typical American adult. Nationwide, an estimated 18.0% of adults drink excessively.\n\nAlaska\n\nDrunkest city: Fairbanks\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 22.7% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 22.1% (3rd highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 37.8% (top 25%)\n\nOf the two metropolitan areas in Alaska — Fairbanks and Anchorage — Fairbanks has the largest share of adults who report excessive drinking. Some 22.7% of Fairbanks adults binge or drink heavily, the largest share in Alaska and one of the largest shares of any U.S. metro area.\n\nWhile a smaller share of Anchorage adults drink to excess, the metro area’s drinking rate is still relatively high. Some 22.2% of Anchorage adults drink heavily or binge drink, a larger share than the drunkest city in 39 states. Across the state, 22.1% of Alaskans drink heavily or binge drink, the third largest excessive drinking rate among states.\n\nArizona\n\nDrunkest city: Flagstaff\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.4%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.0% (13th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 24.1% (bottom 25%)\n\nOf the seven metro areas in Arizona, Flagstaff is home to the largest share of adults who drink to excess. Some 19.4% of adults in the Flagstaff metro area are either heavy or binge drinkers. In comparison, only 16.0% of adults statewide and 18.0% of American adults over-consume alcohol.\n\nHeavier drinking areas tend to be better educated, and Flagstaff is no exception. Some 35.4% of adults in the metro area have earned a bachelor’s degree. Across Arizona, only 28.9% of adults have a four-year college education.\n\nArkansas\n\nDrunkest city: Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.6% (bottom 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.3% (9th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 31.6%\n\nExcessive drinking includes binge and heavy drinking. In Arkansas, 15.3% of adults report excessive drinking, less than the 18.0% share of adults nationwide and the ninth smallest share of any state. In the Fayetteville-Springdale-Rogers metro area, located in the northwest part of the state, some 15.6% of adults report excessive drinking, the highest share in Arkansas yet less than in most U.S. metro areas.\n\nWealthier individuals are more likely to drink excessively, and the typical household in Fayetteville earns $51,848 a year, the highest median household income of any Arkansas metro area.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDrunkest city: Chico\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.9% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.0% (22nd highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 34.7%\n\nNearly 21% of adults in Chico regularly drink alcohol to excess, a larger share than in any of California’s 25 other metro areas and far more than the statewide excessive drinking rate of 18.0%.\n\nDrinking too much can have serious health consequences, and by some measures, Chico’s population is less healthy than the state as a whole. Across California, adults report an average of 3.6 mentally unhealthy days and 3.6 physically unhealthy days per month. In Chico, adults report an average of 4.1 mentally unhealthy days and 4.3 physically unhealthy days each month.\n\nColorado\n\nDrunkest city: Fort Collins\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.0% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.1% (15th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 30.6%\n\nHome to Colorado State University, Fort Collins is a midsize college city located along the Cache La Poudre River in Colorado’s Front Range. College students drink more than nearly any other group. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, nearly 3 in 5 U.S. college students aged 18 to 22 drink alcohol. In the Fort Collins metro area, some 11.6% of the population are enrolled in college or graduate school — nearly the largest share in Colorado — and 21.0% of adults drink to excess or binge drink, the largest share in the state.\n\nConnecticut\n\nDrunkest city: Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.6% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.6% (18th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 34.6%\n\nBridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk is the only metro area in Connecticut in which more than 1 in every 5 adults drinks excessively. Excessive drinking in a community does not necessarily increase the likelihood of drunk driving, but high alcohol consumption may partially explain such risky behavior in the Bridgeport area. Some 34.6% of roadway fatalities in the metro area involve alcohol, higher than both the state and national rates.\n\nDelaware\n\nDrunkest city: Dover\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.4% (bottom 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.6% (16th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 38.6% (top 25%)\n\nWhile Dover is the only metro area in Delaware and by default has the largest share of adults who drink excessively, the city actually has one of the lowest excessive drinking rates in the country. Just 15.4% of adults in Dover binge or drink heavily, lower than both the national rate of 18.0% and even the state rate of 16.6%.\n\nBetter educated populations also often also have higher excessive drinking rates. In Dover, just 22.6% of adults have a bachelor’s degree, less than the 31.0% state and 31.3% national rates.\n\nFlorida\n\nDrunkest city: Crestview-Fort Walton Beach-Destin\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.8% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.4% (22nd lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 39.4% (top 10%)\n\nAcross Florida, only 17.4% of adults drink excessively, a smaller share than the 18.0% of adults nationwide. However, not all parts of the state report lower than typical excessive drinking rates. In Crestview-Fort Walton Beach-Destin, some 20.8% of adult residents drink excessively, the largest such share of any metro area in the Sunshine State.\n\nIn addition to having the state’s highest excessive drinking rate, the Crestview-Fort Walton Beach-Destin metro area also has the state’s highest alcohol-related roadway fatalities rate. Some 39.4% of driving deaths in the metro area involve alcohol. To compare, 28.2% of roadway fatalities statewide and 30.0% nationwide are alcohol-related.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDrunkest city: Athens-Clarke County\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.5%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.8% (18th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 22.4% (bottom 25%)\n\nThe Athens-Clarke County metro area is home to the University of Georgia, the largest college or university in the state. College students are much more likely to participate in activities involving alcohol. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, close to 3 in 5 college students between the ages of 18 and 22 drink alcohol on at least one occasion per month. In the Athens metro area, 16.3% of residents are enrolled in college or graduate school — the largest share in the state — and 17.5% of adults binge or drink heavily, also the largest share in the state.\n\nHawaii\n\nDrunkest city: Kahului-Wailuku-Lahaina\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.8% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.5% (8th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 50.5% (top 10%)\n\nNearly 22% of adults in Kahului-Wailuku-Lahaina either binge or heavily drink, a larger share than both the statewide and nationwide excessive drinking rates. Driving deaths that involve alcohol are often more common in areas with heavy drinking populations, and the Kahului-Wailuku-Lahaina is no exception. The metro area is one of only five nationwide in which over half of all roadway fatalities involve alcohol.\n\nIdaho\n\nDrunkest city: Coeur d’Alene\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.9%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.4% (10th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 38.3% (top 25%)\n\nAn estimated, 15.4% of Idahoans drink excessively, the 10th smallest share of any state. While in the wettest metro area in the state — Coeur d’Alene — the excessive drinking rate is 17.9%, it is still lower than the national rate of 18.0% and less than close to half that of all U.S. cities.\n\nWhile the typical Coeur d’Alene adult is less likely to binge or heavily drink than the typical American adult, motorists in the metro area may be more likely to be involved in a fatal alcohol-related accident. Alcohol is involved in an estimated 38.3% of all fatal car crashes in Coeur d’Alene, far more than the 30.0% national figure.\n\nIllinois\n\nDrunkest city: Bloomington\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.5% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.2% (5th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 35.1%\n\nWith a 21.5% excessive drinking rate, Bloomington is the heaviest drinking metro area in Illinois. Unhealthy alcohol consumption is more common among better-educated populations, and Bloomington is home to a relatively large share of adults with a bachelor’s degree. Some 42.4% of adults in Bloomington have a four-year college degree, compared to the statewide college attainment rate of 34.0% and the nationwide rate of 31.3%.\n\nIndiana\n\nDrunkest city: Bloomington\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.7% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.8% (17th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 26.2% (bottom 25%)\n\nColleges students are more likely to drink heavily than nearly any other group. The Bloomington metro area is the home of Indiana University, one of the largest universities in the United States. Nearly 1-in-4 metro area residents are enrolled in college or graduate school, the third-highest share in the country, and 19.7% of residents over the age of 18 drink excessively, the largest share of any Indiana metro.\n\nCollege graduates are also more likely to drink than the average American. Some 38.9% of Bloomington adults have a bachelor’s degree, also the largest share in the state.\n\nIowa\n\nDrunkest city: Iowa City\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 23.1% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.0% (7th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 17.7% (bottom 10%)\n\nIowa City is the heaviest drinking metro area in a relatively heavy drinking state. Across Iowa, 21.0% of adults drink excessively, a larger share than in all but six other states and well above the U.S. excessive drinking rate of 18.0%. Meanwhile, Iowa City is one of only 13 metro areas nationwide in which more than 23% of adults either binge drink or drink excessively. Like many of the heaviest drinking metro areas, Iowa City is in the Midwest.\n\nKansas\n\nDrunkest city: Lawrence\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 22.2% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.9% (19th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 24.4% (bottom 25%)\n\nCollege students are more likely to drink, and to drink heavily, than the average American. According to the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, Inc., about half of all college students who consume alcohol do so through binge drinking. In Lawrence, home to the University of Kansas — the largest university in the state — an estimated 21.7% of the population is enrolled in college or graduate school, the largest such share in Kansas. Meanwhile, 22.2% of adults drink excessively, also the largest share in the state. College graduates are also more likely to drink heavily than most Americans. An estimated 52.0% of adults in Lawrence have a bachelor’s degree, the largest share in Kansas and the fifth largest share nationwide.\n\nKentucky\n\nDrunkest city: Louisville/Jefferson County\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.6%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.3% (14th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 27.0%\n\nOnly about 16.3% of adults in Kentucky drink excessively, a smaller share than the 18.0% of American adults. Even in Louisville, the heaviest drinking metro area in the state, adults are less likely than the typical American adult to consume unhealthy amounts of alcohol.\n\nAlcohol consumption is only one behavioral factor that can affect health, and Louisville residents are more likely to smoke and less likely to be physically active than the typical American. Partially as a result, and despite a lower excessive drinking rate, adults in Louisville are less likely to report being in good or excellent health than the typical American adult.\n\nLouisiana\n\nDrunkest city: Houma-Thibodaux\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.7% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.8% (17th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 40.4% (top 10%)\n\nSome 20.7% of adults in the Houma-Thibodaux metro area drinks excessively, the largest share in Louisiana and one of the largest shares of any U.S. metro. While college graduates are more likely to drink heavily than those without a degree, just 16.1% of Houma-Thibodaux adults have a bachelor’s degree, close to half the 31.3% national rate and nearly the smallest share of any city.\n\nMaine\n\nDrunkest city: Portland-South Portland\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.6% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.6% (11th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 43.1% (top 10%)\n\nOf the three metropolitan areas in Maine, Portland-South Portland has the highest excessive drinking rate at 20.6%. Excessive drinking tends to be more common in more affluent areas, and Portland is also the highest earning metro area in the state. The typical Portland household earns $63,422 a year, over $14,000 more than the next highest earning metro area in the state.\n\nAs is often the case in heavy drinking areas, a large share of roadway fatalities involves alcohol in Portland. Alcohol is involved in 43.1% of driving deaths in the metro area compared to 39.8% of driving deaths statewide and 30.0% nationwide.\n\nMaryland\n\nDrunkest city: California-Lexington Park\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.8%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.5% (11th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 35.7% (top 25%)\n\nAlcohol is expensive and wealthy individuals are more likely to be able to afford alcohol on a regular basis and are also more likely to participate in activities where alcohol is present. The California-Lexington Park metro area, where the typical household earns approximately $21,000 more than the U.S. median household income, is the wealthiest in Maryland and one of the wealthiest in the country. Some 18.8% of adults in the city drink heavily or binge drink, more than in any other metro area in Maryland.\n\nExcessive drinking habits may have adverse health outcomes for residents of California-Lexington Park. An estimated 10 out of every 100,000 metro area residents die from alcohol-induced causes annually, double the state alcohol-related mortality rate.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nDrunkest city: Barnstable Town\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.0% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.5% (13th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 23.1% (bottom 25%)\n\nBinge and heavy drinking are never healthy behaviors. Still, 21.0% of adults in the Barnstable Town metro area drink excessively, a larger share than in any other metro area in Massachusetts.\n\nIn other key measures, however, adults in Barnstable Town are relatively healthy. Of the five metro areas in Massachusetts, Barnstable Town has the lowest smoking rate, the lowest obesity rate, and the largest share of adults who are regularly physically active.\n\nMichigan\n\nDrunkest city: Lansing-East Lansing\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.9% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.0% (10th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 27.8%\n\nAccording to a nationwide survey by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse, nearly 3-in-5 college students aged 18 to 22 drink alcohol on a monthly basis. In the Lansing-East Lansing metro area — home to Michigan State University, the largest school in Michigan and the ninth largest in the country — some 14.2% of residents are enrolled in college, more than double the 7.0% share nationwide. An estimated 21.9% of adults in the Lansing-East Lansing metro area drink excessively, more than the comparable 20.0% statewide share and more than any other metro in Michigan.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDrunkest city: Mankato-North Mankato\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 23.6% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.1% (6th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 18.0% (bottom 10%)\n\nNearly 24% of adults in the Mankato-North Mankato drink excessively, the largest share of any of any of Minnesota’s five metro areas. Despite ranking as the state’s heaviest drinking metro area, driving deaths attributable to alcohol are relatively uncommon. Only 18% of all roadway fatalities in the metro area involve alcohol, the smallest share of any metro area in Minnesota and well below the comparable 30.9% statewide share.\n\nMississippi\n\nDrunkest city: Gulfport-Biloxi-Pascagoula\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 14.0% (bottom 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 13.3% (5th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 26.4%\n\nSome 13.3% of Mississippi adults drink excessively, the fifth smallest share of any state. While the 14.0% excessive drinking rate in the Gulfport-Biloxi-Pascagoula metro area is the highest of any metro in the state, it is far below the 18.0% national excessive drinking rate and among the lowest of any city nationwide.\n\nAlcohol is expensive — prohibitively so for many lower-income individuals. In Gulfport, the typical household earns just $46,434 a year, far below the national median household income of $57,617.\n\nMissouri\n\nDrunkest city: Columbia\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.9% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.7% (25th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 44.4% (top 10%)\n\nColumbia is the only metro area in Missouri in which more than 1 in every 5 adults drink excessively. Alcohol consumption is only one lifestyle factor that can impact health, however, and by other measures, Columbia residents are relatively healthy. For example, adults in Columbia are more likely to lead physically active lives than those in any other metro area in the state. Additionally, only 28.4% of metro area adults are obese, the smallest share in Missouri and well below the 30.8% statewide obesity rate.\n\nMontana\n\nDrunkest city: Missoula\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 24.3% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.8% (4th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 44.4% (top 10%)\n\nSome 21.8% of adults in Montana drink excessively, the fourth largest share of any state. Even more adults drink heavily or binge drink in Missoula, where the excessive drinking rate is 24.3%.\n\nExcessive drinking is never healthy, and Missoula residents are more likely to die from alcohol-related causes than the average American. Approximately 14 in every 100,000 residents in Missoula die from alcohol-induced causes annually, compared to 10 in every 100,000 Americans nationwide.\n\nNebraska\n\nDrunkest city: Lincoln\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 22.7% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.4% (9th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 25.5% (bottom 25%)\n\nLincoln’s excessive drinking rate of 22.7% is the highest among Nebraska’s three metro areas and higher than the vast majority of metro areas nationwide. Binge drinking is relatively commonplace on college campuses, and a large college population may partially explain Lincoln’s high excessive drinking rate, which includes binge drinking. Home to the University of Nebraska, Lincoln’s population is 12.0% college and graduate students, by far the largest such share of any metro area in the state.\n\nNevada\n\nDrunkest city: Reno\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.3% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.8% (12th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 33.3%\n\nWhile as a state Nevada is fairly dry — just 15.8% of adults drink excessively, compared to 18.0% of adults nationwide — Reno is one of the heaviest drinking cities in the country. Some 21.3% of adults in Reno binge or drink heavily, a larger share than in nearly 90% of all U.S. metropolitan areas.\n\nIncreased alcohol consumption may have adverse health outcomes for many Reno residents. In 2015, approximately 18 in every 100,000 Reno residents died from causes related to alcohol, far more than the national rate of 10 alcohol-related deaths per 100,000 Americans.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDrunkest city: Manchester-Nashua\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.7% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.4% (19th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 30.3%\n\nThe only metro area in New Hampshire, Manchester-Nashua, is the heaviest drinking area by default. Still, the metro area’s excessive drinking rate of 19.7% tops both the statewide excessive drinking rate of 18.4% and the U.S. rate of 18.0%.\n\nExcessive drinking is more common among well-educated, affluent populations. In Manchester-Nashua, the typical household earns $76,254 a year, nearly $19,000 more than the typical American household. Additionally, 37.3% of area adults have a bachelor’s degree or higher, well above the comparable share of American adults of 31.3%.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nDrunkest city: Ocean City\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.3%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.6% (24th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 32.7%\n\nIn the Ocean City metro area, some 18.3% of adults drink heavily, a larger share than the 17.6% of adults across New Jersey as a whole and a slightly larger than the 18.0% national rate. While the populations in cities that report the largest shares of adults who drink to excess tend to be wealthy and well educated, the typical household in Ocean City earns $62,548 a year and 31.5% of adults have a bachelor’s degree, each lower than the corresponding state figures.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nDrunkest city: Santa Fe\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 14.9% (bottom 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 13.8% (6th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol related driving deaths: 22.5% (bottom 25%)\n\nDespite ranking as the heaviest drinking metro area in New Mexico, unhealthy drinking habits are relatively uncommon in Santa Fe. Only 14.9% of adults New Mexico’s capital city drink excessively compared to 18.0% of adults nationwide. In addition to a relatively low excessive drinking rate, adults in Santa Fe are less likely to be obese, less likely to smoke, and more likely to be physically active than the typical American adult. Due in part to their healthy lifestyles, adults in Santa Fe are less likely to die prematurely of preventable causes than the typical American.\n\nNew York\n\nDrunkest city: Watertown-Fort Drum\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 22.9% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.2% (20th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 32.8%\n\nSome 22.9% of adults in the Watertown-Fort Drum metro area drink binge drink or drink heavily, the largest share of any metro area in New York state. While wealthy individuals are more likely to drink excessively than the average American overall, the typical household in the Watertown-Fort Drum metro area earns just $45,624 a year, the least of any city in New York.\n\nOne factor likely contributing to the metro’s high excessive drinking rate may be the presence of Fort Drum, a U.S. Army military base comprising approximately 10% of the metro area’s population. According to a study by the Military Suicide Research Consortium, more than 50% of Army personnel binge drink — four drinks in a single sitting for women and five for men — on a monthly basis.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nDrunkest city: Jacksonville\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.7% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 14.9% (8th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 35.1% (top 25%)\n\nOf the 15 metro areas in North Carolina, Jacksonville is the only one where more than 1 in every 5 adults drink excessively. While a high binge and heavy drinking rate does not necessarily mean residents are more likely to drive under the influence, alcohol is a relatively common factor in roadway fatalities in Jacksonville. Some 35.1% of driving deaths in the metro area involve alcohol, more than both the comparable 32.3% statewide and the 30.0% U.S. shares.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nDrunkest city: Fargo\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 25.2% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 24.7% (the highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 38.0% (top 25%)\n\nNorth Dakota has the highest excessive drinking rate of any state. Some 24.7% of adults in the state drink excessively, far more than the 18.0% national rate. In the Fargo metro area, an even higher 25.2% of adults drink excessively, the most of any metro area in North Dakota and the fifth most of any city nationwide.\n\nOne factor contributing to the city’s high excessive drinking rate may be the presence of several colleges and universities, where, according to a national survey by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, nearly 3 in 5 students drink alcohol. Fargo is home to North Dakota State University, the second largest university in North Dakota, as well as a number of private colleges. An estimated 12.0% of Fargo residents are enrolled in college, compared to only 7.4% of the state population.\n\nOhio\n\nDrunkest city: Columbus\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.6% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.2% (14th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 30.5%\n\nAn estimated 19.6% of adults in the Columbus metro area drink excessively, the largest share of any of the state’s 11 metro areas. Excessive drinking rates tend to be higher among better-educated, wealthier populations, and Columbus has both the highest median income and bachelor’s degree attainment rate of any metro area in Ohio.\n\nDespite being home to the largest share of adults who either binge drink or drink heavily in the state, Columbus residents appear to be relatively healthy. Only 14.5% of area adults are in fair or poor health, below the corresponding 15.0% of adults nationwide and the smallest such share in the state.\n\nOklahoma\n\nDrunkest city: Lawton\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 14.5% (bottom 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 13.9% (7th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 41.5% (top 10%)\n\nJust 13.9% of adults in Oklahoma drink excessively, the seventh smallest share of any state. While Lawton’s excessive drinking rate of 14.5% is the highest in Oklahoma, it is still far below the 18.0% national rate and below that of nearly 90% of all U.S. metropolitan areas.\n\nThe relatively uncommon heavy drinking habits among Lawton residents may contribute to some positive health outcomes. While nationwide 10.3 in every 100,000 Americans die from alcohol-induced causes annually, in Lawton the alcohol-related mortality rate is 8.9 deaths per 100,000 residents.\n\nOregon\n\nDrunkest city: Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.1% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.8% (16th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 34.7%\n\nAt 21.1%, the excessive drinking rate in the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro metro area is the highest of any of Oregon’s eight metro areas. Binge and heavy drinking tend to be more common in wealthier populations, and relatively many Portland-area residents are high earners. Some 7.4% of area households earn more than $200,000 a year, the largest share of any metro area in the state and well above the corresponding share of households statewide of 5.3%.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDrunkest city: State College\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 22.3% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.1% (21st highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 29.6%\n\nFew groups are more likely to drink excessively than college students. In the State College metro area — home to Pennsylvania State University, the largest school in the state — 24.1% of residents are enrolled in college or graduate school, the fourth largest share of any city nationwide. Some 22.3% of State College adults report drinking excessively, much larger than both the state share of 18.1% and 18.0% national share. College graduates are also more likely to drink than the average American. Nearly 50% of State College adults have graduated from a four-year college, one of the largest shares of any U.S. metro.\n\nRhode Island\n\nDrunkest city: Providence-Warwick\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.9%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.9% (23rd highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 35.1% (top 25%)\n\nAs the only metro area in Rhode Island, Providence-Warwick is the heaviest drinking by default. The 17.9% of area adults who either binge drink or drink heavily is roughly in line with both state and nationwide rates.\n\nWhile unhealthy drinking habits are not more common than usual in Rhode Island or Providence, driving deaths attributable to drinking are. Some 35.1% of roadway fatalities in Providence and 40.4% of driving deaths in Rhode Island involve alcohol. In comparison, alcohol is involved in only 30.0% of driving deaths nationwide.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nDrunkest city: Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Beaufort\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.3%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.6% (15th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 28.7%\n\nSome 19.3% of adults in the Hilton Head Island-Bluffton-Beaufort metro area report drinking excessively, more than the 16.6% excessive drinking rate for South Carolina as a whole and the largest share of any metro area in the state. Wealthy individuals are more likely to participate in activities related to drinking, such as going out to eat, going on vacation, and socializing with coworkers, and are more likely to drink heavily than the average American. In the HIlton Head metro area, the typical household earns $63,756 a year, far more than the state median household income of $49,501.\n\nUS Soldiers in Japan have been banned from drinking, with their movements restricted after a Marine was arrested over a car crash which killed a local. Buzz60\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nDrunkest city: Sioux Falls\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.2%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.7% (25th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 26.7%\n\nIn Sioux Falls, 18.2% of adults drink excessively, a larger share than the 16.7% of adults who drink excessively in Rapid City, the only other metro area in South Dakota, and larger than the 17.7% statewide excessive drinking rate.\n\nBinge and heavy drinking rates tend to be higher in wealthier, better-educated populations. In Sioux Falls, 34.1% of adults have a bachelor’s degree or higher, and the typical household earns $63,931 a year. Statewide, only 28.9% of adults have a bachelor’s degree, and the typical household earns only $54,467 annually.\n\nTennessee\n\nDrunkest city: Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 13.7% (bottom 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 11.2% (the lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 26.6%\n\nJust 11.2% of adults in Tennessee report excessive drinking, the smallest share of any state. While the Nashville metropolitan area’s excessive drinking rate of 13.7% is the highest of any city in Tennessee, it is still far below the national rate of 18.0% and one of the smallest shares of any U.S. city.\n\nThe relatively uncommon excessive drinking habits in the Nashville metro area may partially contribute to positive health outcomes. While nationwide 10.3 in every 100,000 Americans die from causes related to alcohol, the alcohol-induced mortality rate in Nashville is just 7.4 deaths per 100,000 residents.\n\nTexas\n\nDrunkest city: Austin-Round Rock\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 22.3% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.3% (20th lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 32.1%\n\nWith a 22.3% excessive drinking rate, Austin-Round Rock is the heaviest drinking metro area in Texas and among the heaviest drinking nationwide. As is often the case in areas with high excessive drinking rates, the Austin population is also a relatively high earning and well educated. Some 42.8% of area adults have a bachelor’s degree, the largest share of any of the state’s 25 metro areas. Similarly, Austin’s $71,000 median annual household income is the highest of any metro area in Texas and about $14,400 more than what the typical household in the state earns.\n\nUtah\n\nDrunkest city: Salt Lake City\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 15.2% (bottom 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 12.4% (3rd lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 20.6% (bottom 10%)\n\nAccording to a study by Utah state government and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, some 62.8% of Utah residents are Mormons, by far the largest share of any state. Alcohol is largely forbidden in the Mormon faith, which may be one reason why just 12.4% of adults in Utah binge drink or drink heavily, the third smallest share of any state. In the Salt Lake City metro area, some 15.2% of adults report excessive drinking, the largest share in Utah yet below the 18.0% national excessive drinking rate.\n\nThe relatively low of binge and heavy drinking in the state helps reduce the rate of alcohol-related fatalities. While nationwide 10.3 in every 100,000 Americans die from causes related to alcohol annually, in Utah the alcohol-induced mortality rate is 6.2 deaths per 100,000 residents.\n\nVermont\n\nDrunkest city: Burlington-South Burlington\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 21.9% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 19.6% (12th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 31.0%\n\nBurlington-South Burlington is the only metro area in Vermont and therefore the heaviest drinking by default. Still, 21.9% share of area adults drink excessively, a higher share than both the statewide and national excessive drinking rates of 19.6% and 18.0%, respectively.\n\nWhile excessive drinking is relatively common in the Burlington metro area, other unhealthy habits are not. Adults in Burlington are less likely to smoke, less likely to be obese, and more likely to exercise regularly than the typical American. The healthier lifestyles contribute to favorable health outcomes. Only 9.1% of Burlington adults are in fair or poor health, well below the 15.0% share of adults nationwide.\n\nVirginia\n\nDrunkest city: Blacksburg-Christiansburg-Radford\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.0%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.4% (21st lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 25.8% (bottom 25%)\n\nAccording to a nationwide survey by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse, close to 3 in 5 college students aged 18 to 22 drink alcohol on a monthly basis. The Blacksburg metro area is the home of Virginia Tech, one of the largest universities in Virginia. Some 20.5% of residents in Blacksburg are enrolled in college or graduate school, the largest share in the state and the 10th largest share of any U.S. metro. Many college students are likely among the 18.0% of adults in Blacksburg who report drinking excessively, a larger share than the 17.4% rate for Virginia as a whole.\n\nWashington\n\nDrunkest city: Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 20.5% (top 25%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.8% (24th highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 34.0%\n\nOf the 11 metro areas in Washington, Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue is the only one in which more than 1 in every 5 adults drink excessively. Wealthier, better-educated Americans are more likely to drink excessively — and Seattle has the highest median income and bachelor’s degree attainment rate of any metro area in the state. The typical Seattle household earns $78,612 a year, about $11,500 more than median income statewide. Similarly, 42.0% of metro area adults have a four-year college degree compared to 35.1% of adults across Washington.\n\nWhile excessive drinking is never healthy, higher educational attainment and incomes appear to affect health outcomes across broad populations more than excessive drinking rates. Despite ranking as the heaviest drinking metro area in Washington, Seattle is also the healthiest. Only 11.4% of adults in Seattle report being in fair or poor health, well below the 14.3% share of adults statewide.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nDrunkest city: Morgantown\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 16.1%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 11.4% (2nd lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 28.0%\n\nAlcohol is expensive — prohibitively so for many lower-income Americans. In West Virginia, the typical household earns just $43,385 a year, far less than the national median household income of $57,617. The state’s low incomes may be one reason why just 11.4% of adults in West Virginia report excessive drinking, the second smallest share of any state.\n\nIn the Morgantown metro area, the typical household earns $50,120 a year, the most of any metro area in West Virginia. Additionally, a greater than typical 16.5% share of residents are enrolled in college or graduate school, where heavy alcohol use is far more common. An estimated 16.1% of Morgantown adults drink heavily or binge drink, the largest share of any metro area in the state.\n\nWisconsin\n\nDrunkest city: Green Bay\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 26.5% (top 10%)\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 24.5% (2nd highest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 50.5% (top 10%)\n\nGreen Bay is the heaviest drinking metro area in both Wisconsin and the United States. Some 26.5% of area adults drink excessively compared to 24.5% of adults in Wisconsin and 18.0% of adults nationwide. Despite widespread alcohol abuse in the metro area, adults in Green Bay report fewer mentally or physically unhealthy days per month on average than is typical nationwide\n\nAs is often the case in heavy drinking areas, alcohol-impaired driving appears to be a considerable problem in Green Bay. The metro area is one of only five nationwide where more than half of all driving deaths involve alcohol.\n\nWyoming\n\nDrunkest city: Casper\n\n> MSA adults binge or heavy drinking: 18.2%\n\n> State adults binge or heavy drinking: 17.5% (23rd lowest)\n\n> Alcohol-related driving deaths: 40.0% (top 10%)\n\nIn the Casper metro area, 18.2% of adults drink excessively, the largest share of any city in Wyoming and slightly above the 18.0% national rate.\n\nThe high prevalence of heavy and binge drinking habits in Casper may contribute to adverse health outcomes. Alcohol is involved, for example, in 40% of all driving deaths in Casper, far more than the 30% national rate. Overall, 21 in every 100,000 Casper residents die from causes related to alcohol annually, more than double the national rate of 10 deaths per 100,000 Americans.\n\nDrinking heavily and smoking for years are well-known features of an unhealthy lifestyle.

Public colleges and universities are increasingly awarding those groups less financial aid funneling it to high-achieving, wealthy, out-of-state students instead, according to a new report by the New America Foundation.\n\n“Over the last 20 years, state disinvestment and institutional status-seeking have worked together, hand in hand, to encourage public colleges and universities to adopt the enrollment tactics of their private-college counterparts,” says Stephen Burd, a senior policy analyst at New America and author of the report which analyzed the ongoing practice at 424 public colleges and universities across the country. “For many of these schools, that has meant using their institutional aid dollars strategically in order to lure affluent out-of-state students to their campuses in order to climb up the rankings and increase their revenue. As a result, fewer institutional aid dollars are available to in-state students who come from less privileged backgrounds.”\n\n\n\nGRAPH: Top 50 schools by share of freshmen without financial need who receive merit aid\n\nFlagships and major research universities are not the only ones playing the merit aid game. The report found the strategy has become an entrenched practice among regional colleges and universities too with, 68% of public post-secondary schools providing scholarships to students who do not need financial aid.\n\nHistorically, public colleges and universities produced the majority of the country’s college-educated population by providing affordable public education, according to Dissent, an independent, quarterly magazine focused on politics and culture.\n\nYet, in their efforts to offset widespread decreases in state investments and increase their prestige, public colleges and universities across the country may have abandoned any sense of responsibility they once had to the in-state students they were founded to serve.\n\n\n\nRELATED: How to crowdfund your college tuition or student debt\n\nLauren Shatz, a human services major at University of Delaware, recognizes the reduction in institutional aid for in-state students is problematic, as in-state tuition and fees tend to be the most affordable option for many students.\n\n“I do think that [public colleges] should try to make tuition affordable for in-state students. Some families may not be able to afford out-of-state tuition, private school tuition…paying in-state tuition may be the only option to be able to afford a college education,” says Shatz. “Although merit scholarships can be a great way to convince students to come to a school, larger scholarships should be given to low-income students instead of to those who can afford college tuition.”\n\nEase of social mobility is another factor affected by the growing trend of public institutions doling out more merit aid to wealthy, out-of-state students.\n\nAs of 2014, persons with a high school degree earn, on average, $668 weekly; in comparison, persons with a bachelor’s degree make $1,101, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This stark difference in earned income represents a sharp difference in standard of living.\n\nAs low-income groups increasingly receive less financial aid from public institutions as a result of schools' efforts to use aid dollars to recruit affluent out-of-state students, many have few alternative options for obtaining an affordable education and could potentially be without the opportunity to attain a bachelor's degree.\n\nJenna Stitik, a Seton Hall University student studying psychology, explained that the new enrollment tactics could potentially lead to a more static class system.\n\n“The issue with this type of set up is that in the future, eventually only the wealthy will be educated and have higher-paying jobs, while less affluent populations will not have the same opportunities and become stuck in the same financial class they were born into,” says Stitik.\n\n\n\nRELATED: Bernie Sanders issues bill to make 4-year colleges tuition-free\n\nOthers, such as Luke Svasti, a Rutgers University student studying political science, recognized the negative effect the recent trend has on low-income and in-state students. But Svasti also acknowledged that out-of-state students face higher tuition rates and fees overall and offered merit aid may not necessarily make an institution affordable, depending on how wealthy he or she is. Like low-income students, some wealthy, out-of-state pupils may still face high costs.\n\n\"An out-of-state student might be marginally richer, but face far higher costs overall,\" says Svasti.\n\nHowever, in terms of income brackets, the report suggests low-income, local students are ultimately still affected by the change in enrollment tactics more harshly.\n\nIn 1996, a third of institutional aid went to students in the lowest income bracket, and 16% went to students in the highest income bracket. By 2012, a quarter of aid went to the poorest students, and nearly as much was going to the wealthiest.\n\nThe study further suggests public colleges that provide sizeable amounts of merit aid have experienced more of a decline in the enrollment of in-state freshmen since 2000. They also tend to enroll fewer students with Pell Grants and charge low-income students a higher average net price than those that provide less merit aid.\n\nThis year, the University of Tennessee's board of trustees endorsed a plan that will allow certain campuses to increase the number of out-of-state students they enroll to as much as 25% of their undergraduate population, as part of its plan to fill a projected 10-year, $377 million funding gap, according to U.S. News and World Report.\n\n“The only way to preclude tuition increases is to fix it ourselves. It is about maintaining quality and moving ahead. We will be a different organization in the next four to five years,” said Joe DiPietro, the university system's president, in a statement on its official website.\n\nYet DiPietro's statement, like New America's report, raises a question: Should the country's public colleges and universities strive to maintain quality, move ahead and be different at the expense of an entire student population?\n\n\n\nKelby K.

They thought the situation was under control because government officials were taking water samples and monitoring operations at the plant.\n\nThen they learned that Mountaire had been spraying highly contaminated wastewater containing up to 41 times the legally permitted level of nitrates as recently as the summer of 2017, while state and federal officials seemed to be doing little more than filing paperwork since the government first found nitrate pollution in 2003.\n\nThe plight of those Delawareans and problems at the plant have caught the attention of Washington, D.C.-based nonprofits Food & Water Watch and Public Justice, which say there is a radical legal solution to years of water contamination.\n\nA team of local and national lawyers and experts are fighting for Mountaire's neighbors' right to safe, clean drinking water by turning to a decades-old federal law governing waste that includes provisions for citizens to step up when governments fail to enforce their own laws.\n\n“Nobody comes to me with one of these cases until they’ve been fighting for 20 years and everyone has failed them,” said Public Justice Food Project attorney Jessica Culpepper. “Every scenario breaks my heart. By the time I’m here, they are completely dragged down. They don’t believe anybody is going to help them. They don’t believe anybody cares about their situation.”\n\nCulpepper is one of a handful of lawyers across the country pursuing highly complex citizen lawsuits under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, also known as RCRA. That law gives everyday people the power to file federal lawsuits when companies dispose of waste in a way that \"may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to health or the environment.\"\n\nCulpepper and others won a landmark case under that law in 2015. That was the first time a federal court ruled that manure from dairy farms was not just a fertilizer or agricultural byproduct, but a solid waste responsible for contaminating drinking water supplies. Until then, the industry thought waste related to farming could not be subject to RCRA claims.\n\n“It is the tool that communities use when their governments have failed them,” Culpepper said. “It allows regular citizens access to courts to use these safeguards for their own behalf when the government isn’t doing its job. This is that scenario.”\n\nOn a dirt lane between two large spray fields near the plant in southern Delaware, a grandmother lost her legs due to circulation problems. A young woman developed epilepsy for the first time during her second pregnancy.\n\nAnother woman who grew up on the lane has suffered from years of asthma and stomach problems and is still mourning her grown son's death from an acute asthma attack.\n\nOn another nearby road, a baby was born with no ear canal.\n\nNow they and other neighbors continue to wonder if those tragedies and health problems could be related to the waste produced by a plant that slaughters and processes millions of chickens each month.\n\n\"If the nitrate levels are known to be high, why are we allowing someone to continue to put millions of gallons of nitrates on top of a problem that we know we already identified?\" said the case's lead lawyer Chris Nidel of Washington D.C.-based Nidel & Nace PLLC. \"To me it looks like a perfect reason as to why things need to change, and they need to change now.\"\n\nNeither Mountaire nor the EPA returned calls and emails for comment.\n\nDelaware Environmental Secretary Shawn Garvin spoke with The News Journal in between hearings at Legislative Hall in Dover on Wednesday. He said his goal is compliance, but fines and other penalties are a tool at his disposal.\n\n“When you have these types of incidents, you have to investigate them thoroughly,” he said.\n\nHe said investigations into violations, like those at Mountaire, often take time. An investigation into similar wastewater violations at Allen Harim Foods LLC's chicken plant in Harbeson resulted in a proposed fine, he said, which the company has appealed. He did not say what that fine amount was, and the agency has not yet provided any documentation of the penalty or the appeal.\n\nDocuments show it has been at least two years since state officials have known that the contamination was getting worse, not better.\n\nMountaire, as well as federal and state officials, now have 90 days to do something about the pollution or lawyers will move forward with a lengthy federal lawsuit that could force them to stop what lawyers are calling \"open dumping\" of waste; fix any remaining sources of contamination, such as slowly leaking waste storage lagoons; cover the cost of the litigation; and more.\n\n“I hope it is now crystal clear to Mountaire and everyone in the community that our clients are not simply seeking compensation for their own injuries, but they are also going to do everything in their power to make sure no one in the community ever has to suffer in the same way as they have,” said Thomas Crumplar, an attorney with Wilmington-based Jacobs & Crumplar PA.\n\nA 90-day notice before the lawsuit is actually filed is legally required. It offers state and federal officials one last chance to enforce environmental laws and permits, or the option to file their own legal claims against the company instead.\n\nThe notice also gives Mountaire the opportunity to clean up its act and fix the pollution problem immediately to avoid a federal lawsuit.\n\nThe company’s planned $35 million in upgrades — announced about two months after the state issued a violation notice accusing the company of bypassing crucial steps in its wastewater treatment process, spraying highly contaminated effluent on hundreds of acres of farm fields and failing to report crucial data about its activities is not going to be enough, Culpepper said.\n\n“I don’t care how much they’re reducing [nutrients] because if they are putting more on the field than the crop can take up, it’s going to continue to be a problem,” she said. “RCRA says you can’t continue to contaminate.”\n\nIf Mountaire, the state or the EPA can settle the RCRA claim within the next three months, that does not mean they will avoid going to court. Crumplar and Nidel will likely still file a lawsuit seeking damages under state law for about 80 clients, including compensation for physical harm caused by health effects of drinking contaminated water and the anticipated negative impact the contamination has had on property values.\n\n“From the Eastern Shore of Maryland to Delaware to North Carolina and Iowa and beyond, households across the country lack access to clean, accessible water,\" said Michele Merkel, co-director of the national nonprofit Food & Water Justice, the legal arm of Food & Water Watch. \"Agriculture is the No. 1 source of water pollution in the country, impacting surface and groundwater. Companies like Mountaire contribute significantly to ongoing water contamination.\"\n\nPlus, there’s another Delaware firm, Baird Mandalas Brockstedt LLC, that is working with Baltimore-based Schochor, Federico and Staton P.A. on a separate lawsuit against Mountaire, possibly a class-action case with hundreds of clients that could be filed as early as the beginning of April.\n\n“This notice is just the first step in what may be a long legal battle,” Crumplar said. “We expect our lawsuit to establish that Mountaire’s persistent and flagrant violations of the law have resulted in a wide variety of personal injuries and a significant decrease in property values. Especially troubling is the cluster of birth defects in the area surrounding the plant.”\n\nNeighbors question health problems\n\nA $35 million investment cannot bring back Gina Burton’s son.\n\nKiwanis Burton was 24 when he died of an acute asthma attack in 2014. Since he was a baby, he battled the condition with heavy medications, spent each night with a nebulizer and spent his childhood avoiding playing in family yards near the fields where the company sprays its waste.\n\n“For years I’ve been trying to figure out what was the cause of my son dying of an asthma attack,” she said. “Who dies of an asthma attack these days with the medications and the treatments that he had? They’re saying it’s going to cost millions and millions and millions of dollars to fix the problem. It’s not going to bring my son back. It’s not going to change a lot. They let it go for too long.”\n\nBurton said she also wonders whether her own persistent health problems – stomach issues and vomiting – could be related to the water. Or if the fact that her daughter was born with an extra ear could have something to do with growing up near water and air pollution from the plant.\n\n“I don’t know where this all came from,” she said.\n\nDecades ago, Burton’s grandparents sold some of the family land along the Indian River to Townsend Inc., which owned and operated the site for decades before selling it to Mountaire in 2000.\n\n“These fields belonged to the Burton family,” she said. “If my grandfather knew that Townsend was going to sell it to Mountaire and that Mountaire would pollute his family, this would have never taken place. They should be grateful that my grandfather sold them these fields.”\n\nBurton's niece, Tiffany Reid, refuses to drink the tap water at her father’s rural home along an unpaved road near the plant.\n\nShe would never consider preparing her 3-month-old baby girl’s bottles with anything that comes out of the faucet.\n\n“I’m glad she’s healthy, and I just hope and pray that later on I don’t hear of any stuff with her health,” said the 29-year-old mother of two. “I’m steering clear of the water.”\n\nOther neighbors living near the plant have for months been questioning whether miscarriages, birth defects, gastrointestinal problems, pet deaths and other health impacts over the years could be related to high levels of nitrates found in private wells that draw from the same groundwater system that the EPA said Mountaire Farms was polluting in 2003.\n\nThe pending RCRA lawsuit, if the violations of the federal law are not settled in 90 days, will ultimately be combined with claims for damages like those experienced by Reid and Burton's families and their neighbors.\n\nDirty wells across the country\n\nThe nitrate-polluted groundwater near Millsboro is strikingly similar to a case litigated a few years ago in the Yakima Valley of Washington state.\n\nIn that case, lawyers pointed to cow manure generated at several dairy farms as the main source of nitrate pollution that ultimately contaminated nearby private wells. The farms had lagoons that data showed were leaking, and the farms were applying more nutrient-laden manure on nearby fields than the crops could use.\n\nIn Yakima Valley, the EPA also had instructed companies to provide bottled water to residents through a consent order under the Safe Drinking Water Act. And the over-application of waste on farm fields also led to nitrate contamination in private wells.\n\nDefendants there also pointed to other historical, agricultural operations as the more likely culprits of contamination.\n\nIt also took more than a decade before anything substantial was done to address the source of the water pollution.\n\n“I think it’s indicative, for both of them, that this is a symptom of industrial animal agriculture that is mismanaging its waste,” said Culpepper, who worked the case against Cow Palace in Washington. “What I’m scared of is that for every one of these facilities that is just flagrantly violating their own permits, where the state is just not taking enough action and the feds are not taking enough action, you end up with this collateral damage with a rural community that can’t access their own water.”\n\nIn 2015, a federal judge ruled that the dairy farms' management of manure — which the defendants argued was being used as fertilizer — was in fact considered a solid waste posing a threat to public health and the environment.\n\nThat judge found that the dairy farms were liable under RCRA. A court order issued a few months later achieved what residents and lawyers wanted by requiring the dairy farms to limit their manure application, add extra lining to their lagoons to prevent leakage, increase water monitoring, provide more water and treatment systems to a broader scope of residents and pay more than $1 million in attorneys' fees and the costs of experts, Culpepper said.\n\nWhile RCRA imposes no regulations on operations like Mountaire's processing plant or the dairy farms in Yakima Valley, the decades-old law states that disposing of solid and hazardous waste should not impact people’s health or the environment. And if it does, and the government is not doing anything about it, it allows for citizens to step in and take that enforcement role through the court system.\n\nThe outcome of Yakima Valley’s water contamination saga is now considered a landmark legal case, and the first time a judge ruled favorably on a citizen lawsuit claiming that an agricultural operation violated RCRA.\n\nSimilar problems with nitrate pollution in ground and surface water blamed on industrial-level agricultural activities can be found across the country, in places like the Central Valley in California, Iowa, Ohio, central Indiana, Illinois, Maryland and North Carolina, said Bob Martin, director of the Food System Policy Program at Johns Hopkins University's Center for a Livable Future.\n\n“The regulatory oversight has just totally failed,” he said.\n\nEastern District of Washington Chief Judge Thomas Rice’s 2015 ruling in the Cow Palace case spurred a flurry of worry among the agricultural community, with industry publications warning farmers that their livelihoods could now be under threat from similar suits.\n\nAnd when a local state representative learned a court deemed those dairy farms responsible for polluting his constituents’ drinking water, he did not suggest stricter regulations for manure disposal.\n\nInstead, Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Washington, introduced a bill that could strip the power of citizens to sue farming operations through RCRA.\n\nDelaware’s two Democratic senators, Chris Coons and Tom Carper, also strongly supported agriculture-related legislation aimed at exempting farms from hazardous substance reporting called the Fair Agricultural Reporting Method Act. That bill, along with its House counterpart, the Agricultural Certainty for Reporting Emissions Act, was recently rolled into the Omnibus Spending Bill that was signed by President Donald Trump on March 23.\n\nThose laws exclude farms from mandatory air emissions reporting under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, potentially leaving neighbors in the dark about what kind of hazardous substances – and how much – emanate from ammonia and manure found on farms, including concentrated animal feeding operations, or CAFOs, like the poultry houses found throughout Delmarva.\n\nCarper's office said in an email on Wednesday that CAFOs are required to report those emissions under another law, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.\n\n“Serious issues are being raised on behalf of Millsboro residents, and I will be closely monitoring the legal process as it unfolds in the courts,\" Carper said in an emailed statement. \"All Delawareans deserve access to clean and safe drinking water — no matter where they live. In the wealthiest country in the world, it is unacceptable that families have to wonder whether the water coming out of their faucets is safe to give to their children.”\n\nTarah Heinzen, a staff attorney at Food & Water Watch, said in an earlier interview that exemptions under the FARM Act also could impact reporting requirements under the EPCRA because of interconnected language in the laws.\n\nCoons' office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n“There is one entity to protect the people from the power of corporations, and that is the government,” Martin, of Johns Hopkins, said. “These industries have a lot of political power.”\n\nCulpepper and others worry that Newhouse’s bill, the current version of which would only apply to farms and not processing plants like the one in Millsboro, could be similarly approved if it is rolled into the Farm Bill. Or it could be modified and expanded to also exclude processing plants, which they see as industrial operations, not family-focused agricultural businesses.\n\n“I want people to know legislators are getting in the way of citizens protecting themselves, so maybe Carper and Coons won’t jump on the RCRA [amendment],” said Merkel, of Food & Water Justice. “The Delaware representatives should be fighting that more than anybody else.”\n\nThe politics of poultry\n\nOne of the reasons politicians and others may be less likely to penalize big companies like Mountaire is because the industry holds a vast amount of political power, Martin, Merkel and Culpepper said.\n\n“These companies give big political contributions to both parties, and I think that’s what is driving a lot of the decision making,” Merkel said. “Every level of government, local, state and federal, are politically captured.”\n\nIn Delaware, Mountaire and some of its top employees have contributed to the campaigns of Gov. John Carney; Senate Minority Leader Gary Simpson, R-Milford; state Sen. Gerald Hocker, R-Ocean View; state Rep. Rich Collins, R-Millsboro; state Sen. Brian Pettyjohn, R-Georgetown; and former Democratic Gov. Ruth Ann Minner.\n\nLast year, the company contributed $5,000 to First State First PAC, a Republican political action committee whose treasurer is listed as state Senate Minority Whip Gregory Lavelle, R-Sharpley.\n\nIn previous interviews with The News Journal and in public appearances, Hocker and Collins pointed to the thousands of jobs that Mountaire provides, not only at its processing plants near Millsboro and Selbyville but also for the farmers growing the chickens and grains.\n\n“The idea that this company and this industry provide jobs and contribute to the tax base emanates a thought that there is some kind of trade-off that has to happen,” Culpepper said. “I don’t think that in order to operate you have to pollute the groundwater. I don’t see why you cannot operate in a way that does not pollute. Just don’t do it.”\n\nA preliminary report from the Center for a Livable Future provided by Martin found the co-sponsors of the bill that would amend RCRA received, on average, three times more money in political contributions from the agribusiness sector than politicians who have not signed on to the bill, according to campaign finance data collected from OpenSecrets.org.\n\n“The results of this analysis demonstrate that the agribusiness sector is a significant and disproportionately large contributor to the political campaigns of the HR 848 cosponsors, having contributed close to $10 million,” the report states. “These results suggest that agribusinesses may be seeking to use financial leverage to influence members of Congress to legislate in a manner that benefits their bottom line.”\n\nWhile that study looks at a broader national collection of agricultural operations, including livestock like cows and pigs, poultry is the leading business on Delmarva.\n\nSussex County is often noted as the top broiler-producing county in the nation, an industry linked to everything from the final processing steps to farmers growing grains for feed. Nearly half of the First State's land was devoted to farming in 2017.\n\nAccording to the Delmarva Poultry Industry, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia produced 4.2 billion pounds of chickens worth $3.4 billion in 2017. Chicken companies also purchased 87 million bushels of corn, 36 million bushels of soybeans and 1.6 million bushels of wheat for feed that year, some of the most frequently grown crops in the First State.\n\nA 2017 report by the Rachel Carson Council said that nationwide, only five companies – Tyson Foods, Perdue, Sanderson Farms, Koch Foods and Pilgrim’s Pride – produce about 97 percent of the chicken consumed by Americans throughout about 30,000 farms. That $32.7 billion industry also generated about 300 million tons of waste annually, the report stated.\n\n\"They have kind of co-opted the image and language of small, family farmers,\" Martin said. \"And a lot of these local guys really succumb to, 'we can't oppose them because of jobs.' I think it's just the political power of the industry, again. People are afraid to take them on.\"\n\nHow lawyers got involved in southern Delaware\n\nIn November, Delaware environmental regulators issued a violation notice to Mountaire Farms for spraying highly contaminated, and largely untreated, effluent on hundreds of acres of nearby farm fields since at least 2015, with the worst violations tracked in the summer of 2017.\n\nOfficials also said the company failed to report critical data about its wastewater disposal, and spread sludge on fields without proper notification and in some cases, with no crops planted to fertilize.\n\nDespite data showing the company violated its permit by spraying waste with more than 41 times the legal limit for nitrogen and 5,500 times the permitted level of fecal coliform, regulators have imposed no fines or penalties.\n\nThe violation notice stated that if the company continues to spray waste that does not meet permit requirements – standards set to ensure whatever pollutants are in the wastewater can be absorbed by crops so they do not negatively impact drinking water sources and the environment – it can continue operations, with a few stipulations.\n\n“What made me want to take this case was reading that notice of violation and seeing it was happening again,” Culpepper said. \"With nitrates, you can't see it. You can't smell it. You can't taste it. ... You're going to end up with this tiny Flint, Michigan.\"\n\nFreedom of Information Act requests previously filed by The News Journal seeking the state's historical monitoring data and other reports have been denied, with officials citing an “open investigation” as the reason for withholding that data.\n\nCompany officials blamed those violations on what they have repeatedly called a wastewater \"upset,\" meaning their wastewater treatment plant was not properly functioning.\n\nThat is because sludge – the solid matter including animal fat that is included in the waste treatment process – had been building up in one of their lagoons for an unknown amount of time.\n\nCompany CEO Michael Tirrell said in an earlier interview that it was unclear how long the sludge had been building up. Former employees who asked not to be identified said it took more than five years of problems at the plant before the treatment processes collapsed.\n\nBecause the lagoons were overloaded, wastewater that goes through a multi-step process to remove solids, nutrients and other contaminants was diverted from a middle step in the process and directly fed into the spray irrigation equipment that dispose of the wastewater on more than 900 acres of fields.\n\nThat’s when people living on Herbert Lane – where Tiffany Reid lives with her father, James Reid, her 5-year-old daughter and her newborn baby – noticed thick, green-gray muck shooting from the rigs.\n\nLast summer, when video was taken of that contaminated waste shooting within a stone’s throw of residents’ front doors, also produced some of the worst smells longtime residents of the area have ever experienced.\n\n“It is clear that this facility should be shut down,” Martin said. “The evidence is there.”\n\nThe risks of water pollution\n\nAfter Mountaire was put on notice for its violations, cases of bottled water appeared on dozens of residents’ front steps and porches with no explanation.\n\nState health officials repeatedly said that water was being provided “out of an abundance of caution” and noted the main health concerns are with pregnant women and infants.\n\n“Most healthy adults will not experience any adverse health impacts from levels of nitrates seen in recent sampling,” a public health spokesperson wrote in a December 2017 email.\n\nMartin said scientific studies are increasingly linking excess nitrate levels in drinking water to a slew of health problems beyond methemoglobinemia, commonly known as the potentially fatal blue baby syndrome.\n\nStudies have shown nitrates can also cause birth defects, thyroid cancer, circulatory problems and lymphatic cancers, Martin said.\n\n“We talk about the lack of enforcement and compliance, but the public health departments are just as bad and no one’s talking about that,” Merkel said. \"It has become a sort of national crisis and unfortunately we're going to see more and more of these types of situations.\"\n\nWhen the EPA stepped in with a consent order in 2003, Delaware’s public health officials told the federal agency that they lacked the jurisdiction to do anything about the contaminated private wells. Private wells are not regulated like public water systems, and water quality tests to see what contaminants might be hiding in them is solely the responsibility of the well owner.\n\nBut to say water is being provided “out of an abundance of caution” when a private wells are found to have a contaminant known to cause health problems above a certain concentration seems contrary to public health agencies’ responsibility to reduce potential harms to public health, Martin said.\n\n“The concern of having dozens of tiny, unknown Flint, Michigans, needs to be a national story,” Culpepper said. “Regulators are not acting against this industry, and there needs to be a public outcry about it. What needs to be said to this industry as a whole is you can operate in a way that is not on the backs of rural Americans’ drinking water, and you have to do it.”\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.\n\nWATER WOES IN SOUTHERN DELAWARE\n\nResponse to toxic water vastly different in two Sussex communities\n\nMillsboro neighbors: How long have we been drinking tainted water?\n\nMountaire Farms: Tainted neighborhood wells not our fault", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/03/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/01/19/patriarch-ir-n-e-du-pont-of-delawares-du-pont-family-died-at-103/69819199007/", "title": "The patriarch of Delaware's influential du Pont family has died at 103", "text": "Irénée du Pont Jr., the patriarch of Delaware's prominent, wealthy and influential du Pont family, died Monday. He was 103.\n\nDu Pont was the great-great-grandson of DuPont Co. founder Éleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours who fled France for Delaware during the French Revolution and began building a vast family fortune by producing gunpowder along the banks of the Brandywine.\n\nHis father Irénée du Pont Sr., along with his father's two brothers Pierre S. du Pont, founder of Longwood Gardens in Kennett Square, and Lammot du Pont had each served as the Wilmington-based DuPont Co.'s president. They helped expand its interests from an explosives manufacturer to one of the world's largest chemical companies.\n\nIrénée du Pont Jr., who had eight sisters, was the youngest and only son of Irénée and Irene Sophie du Pont, who were second cousins.\n\nA graduate of Wilmington's Tower Hill School, he attended Dartmouth College and graduated in 1943 with a degree in mechanical engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, his father's and uncles' alma mater.\n\nHe was hired by \"the family business,\" as some du Ponts liked to call the DuPont Co., in 1946, by the late DuPont scientist Nathaniel C. Wyeth. Wyeth was the inventor of the plastic soda bottle and the older brother of famed Chadds Ford artist Andrew Wyeth.\n\nAs was the family tradition, Irénée Jr., known by his nickname \"Brip,\" worked his way up the company ladder. He learned the ropes and held various engineering and supervisory positions at plants in Arlington, New Jersey; Parkersburg, West Virginia, and Charleston, West Virginia.\n\nHe returned to Wilmington in 1953 and later served as the company's senior vice president before retiring in 1978.\n\nDu Pont told The News Journal in a 2000 interview that he declined all suggestions that he run the company.\n\n\"I as a stockholder would have objected to me as president,\" he said.\n\nDu Pont told The News Journal he had dyslexia and it would have kept him from doing the huge volume of reading needed to do the job well. \"I would have been a disaster. You've got to be a very astute and quick-witted person to take an executive level of leadership. It would have been in my financial interest not to go there.\"\n\nStill, du Pont was one of the last family members to reach one of the highest levels of management in the DuPont Co. The family who had led the DuPont Co. for most of the 20th century eventually ended its control in the late 1970s.\n\nLife at Granogue\n\nDu Pont was once considered one of the richest men in the world, according to various Forbes magazine rankings over the years. He brushed aside the reports and told The News Journal the $525 million net worth which Forbes attributed to him and his family in Montchanin in 1998 was based on money \"generated generations ago.\"\n\nWhen a News Journal reporter interviewed him in 2000, du Pont was more than delighted to show off the tag inside the blazer he was wearing. It wasn't from Brooks Brothers. He bought the jacket at Value City, which, at that time, was a well-known discount store.\n\nHe lived at Granogue, the hilltop estate and mansion with a mile-long driveway and 30 rooms in northern New Castle County, which can be seen along points of Smith Bridge Road. It is sometimes referred to as the symbol of Chateau Country, the name for Delaware's most exclusive region and for generations the home of extended members of the du Pont family.\n\nThe century-old house was built in 1923 by du Pont's father. The mansion has 11 bedrooms for family members and six for live-in employees. Walls are lined with paintings by family friends, like Maxfield Parrish, and Rembrandt Peale's original painting of DuPont founder Éleuthère Irénée du Pont de Nemours hangs over a hearth.\n\nDu Pont was proud of an oak-paneled music room, home to an Aeolian pipe organ housed in a chamber below the floor. The music is controlled by a computer, much like a player piano, but sometimes du Pont brought in musicians to play the organ. He enjoyed sharing the organ's music with others.\n\nHe and his wife Barbara also were known for opening the grounds of their estate to local organizations and groups for fundraisers.\n\nA 5K run and walk called Granogue & Bach were held in the 1990s to raise money for Brandywine Baroque. Musicians played Bach compositions for participants at the finish line. In recent years, the Beau Biden Foundation has hosted trail runs on the estate with more than 800 participants.\n\nPresident Joe Biden, who attended the run when he was vice president, had raced motorbikes on the estate with Irénée when Biden was serving in the Senate. Biden's sister Valerie once lived on the Granogue property\n\nA passion for car collecting\n\nDu Pont told The News Journal he was a \"motorhead\" and enjoyed collecting motorcycles and automobiles which he stored in his 12-car garage.\n\nOver the years, his collection included everything from a 1980 two-door Chevette hatchback to a 1936 Oldsmobile coupe his father gave him on his 16th birthday.\n\nHe frequently brought his 1918 Cadillac to various events, including Winterthur Museum's annual Point to Point steeplechase races and to the Marshall Steam Museum at Auburn Valley State Park in Yorklyn.\n\nDu Pont found the car at a salvage yard in 1939 when he was a student at Dartmouth College. He said he paid $40 for it and joked he spent as much on immediate repairs. He said the car once was owned by actors Frank Fay and Barbara Stanwyck.\n\nDu Pont was known for upholding his family's legacy and served on DuPont's board of directors until 1990 and worked on various projects as a trustee for Wilmington University and Longwood Gardens, the former home of his Uncle Pierre.\n\nDespite the clannish nature of the family, another tradition du Pont had long upheld was never stepping foot on the Nemours estate of Alfred I. du Pont in Rockwood. It was due to a historic rift that happened a few years after cousins Pierre, Alfred and T. Coleman du Pont banded together to buy the DuPont Co. in 1902. Pierre and Alfred had a falling out about control and Alfred lost his role in the company.\n\nWhen Alfred built his Nemours estate, he installed a 10-foot stone wall topped with shards of broken glass to surround the majestic mansion inside. Supposedly, he said he built the wall with the glass shards around his estate “to keep out intruders, mainly of the name of du Pont,” according to Marquis James’s 1941 book \"Alfred I. duPont: The Family Rebel.\"\n\nIrénée Jr. told The News Journal in 2000 that his father was on his brother Pierre's side and gave his children strict instructions to never step foot inside the Nemours gates.\n\nDu Pont obeyed for years, but apparently changed his mind, and in 2008 he told The News Journal \"it's a great place — if you like that kind of thing.\"\n\nHe was predeceased by his eight older sisters; his daughter, Susanne; his son, Irénée du Pont, III; and Barbara, his wife of 77 years.\n\nDu Pont is survived by his daughter-in-law, Eugenie Collison du Pont, and his daughters Irene Light (Tom) of Lime Rock, Connecticut; Cynthia Tobias (Terry) of Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania; Sally Quinn (Rob) of Winchester, Massachusetts; Grace Engbring (Paul) of Telluride, Colorado; 13 grandchildren, and 13 great-grandchildren.\n\nA memorial service will be held at a later date.

Between 1851 and 2010, a map of the paths of major hurricanes from the National Hurricane Center shows that not a single one made direct landfall on the region, which is comprised of the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia, and part of Delaware.\n\nArthur Trembanis, an associate professor in the University of Delaware's College of Earth, Ocean and Environment, explained that this phenomenon has a lot to do with the location of warmer water in the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Gulf Stream, a current of warm water that originates in the Gulf of Mexico, hugs tightly to the coasts of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. Because warmer water fuels hurricanes, he said these states are more likely to see direct impact.\n\nBut where the Gulf Stream approaches Cape Hatteras, located along the coast of North Carolina near Virginia, Trembanis said it begins to veer off because of the shape of the continental shelf.\n\n\"As you get beyond Cape Hatteras, that Gulf Stream water, that warmer water, is further offshore and so that means that the warm water, that’s where the storm’s are tracking,\" Trembanis said.\n\nIn fact, he explained that the Carolinas serve as a sort of dividing line for the mid-Atlantic. To the south, the \"storms of merit\" are hurricanes, but to the north, it's nor'easters the area faces, which occur every year, sometimes as few as five and other times as many as 12.\n\n\"What we tend to get more of are these body blow punches from nor’easters and those can have a combined or cumulative effect that can be every bit as damaging or more so than a hurricane,\" Trembanis said.\n\nAn important factor to keep in mind when it comes to hurricanes, he said, is that people often get fixated on the eye, but being within 50 to 100 or even 200 miles of the eye of a hurricane can have a \"tremendous\" impact.\n\n\"We’re talking about storms that are hundreds of miles across,\" Trembanis said. \"Hurricanes are a little bit like horseshoes and hand grenades. Close can be every bit as damaging.\"\n\nMore:Which hurricanes damaged Ocean City the most?\n\nMore:The next 100-year storm won't wait a century to bring major destruction\n\nIn September 2003, Hurricane Isabel made landfall near Drum Inlet on the Outer Banks of North Carolina as a Category 2 hurricane, according to the NHC. Trembanis said he remembers it funneled winds and waves up the Chesapeake Bay, prompting him to evacuate.\n\nHurricane Floyd, which made landfall near Cape Fear, North Carolina, in September 1999 as a Category 2 hurricane weakened to a tropical storm as it moved along the coasts of Delmarva and New Jersey, according to the NHC.\n\nEven though the winds weren't as strong in the area, Trembanis said trees and other debris came down in the part of Virginia where he was living because of the amount of water that fell, weakening the soil.\n\nThe effect a hurricane has on areas beyond landfall is very dependent on the location of the eye as it approaches relative to the coastline, he explained. In the northern hemisphere, it's a storm's right quadrant that carries the most punishing winds, largest waves and greatest storm surge.\n\nWith Hurricane Sandy, Trembanis explained that's why the Delaware bay and beach shorelines fared better than New Jersey, which was \"pummeled\" by the northeast portion of the storm.\n\nHurricanes also carry a lot of moisture that can cause devastation even in areas where they don't make landfall, he said.\n\nFor example, in 1969, the NHC shows Hurricane Camille made landfall along the Mississippi coast and killed a total 256 people, but 113 of those deaths occurred as a result of flooding in Virginia.\n\nAmid the heaviest rains along the Gulf Coast, the storm dropped 10 inches, but after weakening to a tropical depression, it eventually reached the Virginias, producing a burst of 12 to 20 inch rains with local totals of up to 31 inches.\n\nThough Hurricane Sandy made landfall in the United States near Brigantine, News Jersey, in 2012, the storm also swamped 911 operators in Crisfield and other waterfront areas throughout Somerset County for rescues from houses and stranded vehicles as waters began rising.\n\nWith Hurricane Florence predicted to loop back around to the north as a tropical depression and a month and a half left of an Atlantic hurricane season that's now reaching its peak, Trembanis said Delmarva isn't out of the woods just yet.\n\n\"We hopefully can keep our streak alive of not having any direct landfalls, but even close can be quite impactful,\" he said.\n\nMore:What Chincoteague, Assateague do to keep ponies safe during hurricanes\n\nThis report was originally published in Sept. 14, 2018.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/09/15/why-delaware-more-vulnerable-storm-like-hurricane-florence/1317764002/", "title": "Why Delaware is more vulnerable to a storm like Hurricane Florence", "text": "Delawareans should pay close attention to the destruction Hurricane Florence has brought to the Carolinas.\n\nNo hurricane has made landfall in the First State in the last 150 years, a streak of luck that will not last forever.\n\nEven a nor’easter storm, like the one that destroyed the Rehoboth Beach boardwalk in 1962 or a glancing blow from a storm like Superstorm Sandy in 2012, could cause the kind of devastation here similar to what North Carolina is enduring now.\n\n“From a probability point of view, it’s only a matter of time before a significant hurricane or coastal storm results in the type of damage that we’ve seen with the ’62 storm or Sandy, or even something like Florence,” said Christopher Bason, executive director of the Delaware Center for the Inland Bays.\n\nStorm surge pushed floodwaters inland, washing over dunes and beaches and river banks in North Carolina this weekend. The deaths of at least seven people were linked to Hurricane Florence.\n\nFlorence, now downgraded to a tropical storm, is expected to drop 40 inches of rain on North Carolina and bring wind gusts of up to 100 mph, causing widespread flooding and destruction.\n\nThere was a time that forecasters thought that fate could be meant for the Delmarva Peninsula, where it might have caused even more havoc.\n\nSlightly more than a third of the Tar Heel state's counties have at least 15 percent of their total land area within the coastal watershed, a strip of land that holds about a million people, or roughly 10 percent of the state's population.\n\nBy comparison, except for the Piedmont region, just about all of Delaware — the lowest lying state in the nation — is within a coastal watershed.\n\nWEATHER:Why don't hurricanes make landfall in Delaware and Maryland?\n\nHELP:In wake of Hurricane Florence, Delaware firefighters volunteer for duty in North Carolina\n\nEven localized coastal flooding from a major storm could have a relatively greater impact in Delaware than North Carolina. That's because the population density in Delaware is four times higher than in North Carolina's coastal counties.\n\nBy Saturday morning, for instance, a reported 770,000 people were without power in North Carolina, or about 8 percent of the state's population. Here in Delaware, that same number would equate to 80 percent of the state's residents.\n\n“I think Delawareans should pay close attention to what’s happening in the Carolinas because we share a lot of common threads,” said Danielle Swallow, a coastal hazards specialist with the federally funded research organization Delaware Sea Grant.\n\n“The Carolinas have a lot of coastal communities under tremendous pressure from development, like our communities,” she said.\n\nA growing danger\n\nThe greatest danger from a hurricane or other major storm is often faced by those communities closest to a state’s shoreline — the same areas seeing high demand for new development.\n\nThose homes, roads and parking lots, experts say, are encroaching on the marshes that provide a first line of defense against flooding during coastal storms, which scientists warn are becoming more intense as climate change drives up ocean temperatures.\n\nTowns along North Carolina’s coast and several miles inland were flooded on Friday by a storm surge of up to 11 feet, for example.\n\nIn New Castle County, the contentious redevelopment slated for Fort DuPont outside Delaware City would be completely underwater if the same flooding now plaguing parts of North Carolina were to hit the area, as shown by the Delaware Geological Survey’s storm surge inundation mapping tool.\n\nIn Sussex County, it would take a storm surge of only about 3 feet to inundate a spit of marshy land on the Little Assawoman Bay near Fenwick Island where a developer wants to build 70 high-end luxury homes.\n\nINTERACTIVE MAP:See how the storm surge from a hurricane would affect Delaware\n\nIn the lowest-lying areas of the lowest-lying state in the nation, development is ramping up, not slowing down, Bason said.\n\n“Sussex County is a prime example of how density is being concentrated into the most vulnerable and sensitive areas,” he said. “And state- and county-level policies have encouraged that for years.”\n\nDelaware’s southern-most county, for instance, allows for higher densities of development on some land that includes unbuildable areas, like wetlands. That policy is currently under review by the Sussex County Council.\n\n“You couple that with a very weak buffer ordinance, and it’s just putting a lot of people right in very dangerous areas,” Bason said. “Throw sea level rise on top of that, and what’s projected for that is a collision course with disaster.”\n\nSEA LEVEL RISE:New report shows thousands of Delaware homes, millions in property value, at risk\n\nThe county is now considering new rules that would require more space between waterways and construction. Sussex County requires only a 50-foot buffer on some waterways. That’s half the distance required in Kent and New Castle counties, a quarter of what is required in Maryland and one-sixth of New Jersey’s minimum distance.\n\nHistorically, those practices have meant marshes, which act as sponges during coastal storms and heavy rain events, are trapped between rising seas and impervious surfaces.\n\nJust as the sands along the ocean and bay beaches tend to move with currents, tides and storms, marshes migrate over time when water levels change. But they cannot move further inland if there are houses, roads or parking lots in the way.\n\n“With the presence of a lot of infrastructure, we block those places for migration,” said Josh Moody, an environmental restoration expert at the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary. “As it’s pushed back, it gets narrower and narrower.”\n\nThe smaller the marsh, the less floodwater it can absorb.\n\nExperts estimate that 1 acre of marshland can absorb 350,000 to 1 million gallons of water in a storm event.\n\nBut Delaware is losing coastal marshes at an average of 1 acre per day, according to Moody’s organization. The state estimates we have lost more than 50 percent of our wetlands since the 1780s.\n\nSome of that marsh loss has to do with the squeeze from nearby development. But a lot also has to do with rising sea levels, which can lead to erosion and marsh drowning.\n\n“If we allow space for that to happen, then we’re going to have much better protection in the future as sea level rises and storm energy increases,” said Marianne Walch, the Delaware Center for the Inland Bays’ estuary science and restoration coordinator. “We have an opportunity to bring the level of buffer protection that’s provided by regulations in Sussex County up to meet those of all the surrounding counties and neighboring states.”\n\nLessons learned?\n\nAlthough not a direct strike, Superstorm Sandy offers a glimpse at what could go wrong in a major storm.\n\nAnd even though the storm made landfall near Atlantic City and spared Delaware far worse damage, lower Delaware had heavy rainfall and more than 45,000 customers were without power.\n\nThe Delaware River rose to 99.5 feet, more than 10 feet above normal.\n\nA 2,000-foot-long dike along the Delaware River was in danger of breaching, with the potential breakthrough of waves from the river threatening to wash across some of the state's most toxic federal Superfund cleanup sites, spreading dangerous pollution.\n\nAt one point, state workers piled up huge sandbags as storms broke across the area to prevent a disaster.\n\nState lawmakers quickly approved $7.5 million for repairs and improvements to the Red Lion barrier, as well as to other aging dikes, some dating back hundreds of years, in and near New Castle.\n\nAlong the ocean coast, the bay sides of Fenwick Island, South Bethany Beach, Bethany Beach and Dewey Beach suffered among the worst flood damage from Superstorm Sandy. Days after the storm, residents were still shoveling mud, ripping out soggy drywall and discarding furniture and appliances that were ruined.\n\nToday, some wonder whether stark warnings and weak points exposed by Superstorm Sandy have been forgotten.\n\n“There was a lot of attention on coastal resiliency and resilience to storms after Sandy,” said Jennifer Adkins, executive director of the Partnership for the Delaware Estuary. “The initial question to ask is if this storm was coming our way, are we in better shape now? What did we learn from Sandy?”\n\nTwo years after Sandy, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a report that warned that unless coastal residents and state and local leaders rethink their approach to shoreline development, the next big storm will be equal to or worse than Superstorm Sandy. It caused $65 billion in losses, 159 U.S. deaths and damaged or destroyed 650,000 homes, as reported by The News Journal in 2015.\n\nAside from learning about the need to further study coastal storm risks and flooding potential even further inland, Sandy brought a slew of emergency funding to restore damaged beaches and dunes.\n\nBut when it comes to development, it’s a mixed bag of how closely warnings from federal agencies like the Army Corps have been heeded as the demand for a life along the water continues to grow.\n\nREAL ESTATE:Few beach homes for sale in Delaware beaches drive up prices\n\n“I think resiliency will involve making tough decisions and making tradeoffs between things like building a home right on the water and not,” Swallow said. “Mother Nature is our best defense against storms and floods, but by building over the land, we’re taking away that defense.”\n\nA lack of protections for inland freshwater wetlands, as well as limited buffers on waterways in southern Delaware, means developers can build those coveted waterfront properties in places where floodwaters could easily reach.\n\n“The absorptive capacity of our land is so integral to our resilience to storms, our ability to weather these events and bounce back more quickly,” Swallow said. “Unfortunately, the pace of development is happening in the areas that are most vulnerable, and it’s actually increasing our vulnerability.”\n\nDelaware has made a strong effort to protect some of its most valuable natural coastal storm defenses. Much of the marshland east of Del. 1 and Del. 9 has been preserved, providing thousands of acres of undeveloped land that acts as a sponge when Mother Nature unleashes her wrath.\n\nDelaware’s Open Space Council has leveraged millions of dollars in public funding to permanently preserve more than 57,000 acres of land from development.\n\nAt Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge, federal officials spent nearly $40 million to plug large areas where Delaware Bay surged into the adjacent marsh and cut new inlets during Sandy. The changes were meant to alter the marsh hydrology to make the area more resilient.\n\nOfficials with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control did not respond to requests to comment for this story.\n\nBut former DNREC Secretary Collin O’Mara, now the CEO of the National Wildlife Federation, said Delaware is leading the nation when it comes to coastal resiliency, thanks to efforts undertaken before and after Sandy.\n\n“I think we’re near the top of the pack, but everyone needs to step up their game,” he said. “It’s not necessarily about having a pristine waterway. It’s about not having people die.”\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.

While Delaware may hit water temperatures of 80 degrees, it's not conducive to storm development.\n\nDespite that good news, Delaware residents should be ready for hurricane season.\n\n\"Everyone should be prepared,\" Hoeflinch said. \"Have an evacuation plan and the resources you need like water and a first aid kit.\"\n\nWhat's the hurricane forecast for 2024?\n\nWhile each forecast was different, they all call for a very active and potentially dangerous hurricane season impacted by warm waters and La Nina.\n\nSeventeen to 25 total named storms — winds of 39 mph or higher\n\nEight to 13 are forecast to become hurricanes — winds of 74 mph or higher\n\nFour to seven are expected to be major hurricanes — a category 3 storm with winds at 111 mph or greater.\n\n23 named storms this year\n\n11 will become hurricanes\n\nFive will become major hurricanes\n\n20 to 25 named storms\n\nEight to 12 hurricanes\n\nFour to seven major hurricanes\n\nWill La Nina impact the hurricane season?\n\nAccording to NOAA, scientists are predicting a quick transition to La Nina conditions, which are conducive to Atlantic hurricane activity because La Nina tends to lessen wind shear in the tropics. At the same time, abundant oceanic heat content in the tropical Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea creates more energy to fuel storm development.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/06/04"}, {"url": "http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2016/10/05/hurricane-matthew-prep-10-tips-help-you-shelter-place/91607890/", "title": "Being prepared in Delaware doesn't mean being panicked", "text": "Betsy Price\n\nThe (Wilmington, Del.) News Journal\n\nMy most enduring memory of a hurricane was watching water flood out from under the baseboards of our Louisiana house, with all the lights still blazing away.\n\nThe water was being driven between the foundation and the walls of the house by the tremendous winds of Hurricane Betsy when it plowed into New Orleans in September 1965.\n\nEven at the age of 8, I wondered if we were all going to be electrocuted.\n\nHurricane Matthew marches closer to U.S.; forces mass evacuations\n\nThat was my first hurricane. I can’t count the number of the others I’ve sat through in virtually every city I’ve ever lived in. More than a dozen. Most of them were glancing blows or the storms were already being tamed by land and lack of water as they reached us inland, but the winds and rain still wreaked havoc for a lot of people.\n\nAs an adult, it didn’t take me long to adopt my mom’s constant state of low-key preparation. I always have candles, matches, batteries, flashlights, lamps, nonperishable food, water and extra toilet paper. Over the years I’ve added things like keeping a pack of bottled water in the garage (before bottled water was easily available, people used to clean their bathtubs and fill them before hurricanes), radios that work by winding them up, several extra chargers for my phone and electronic gear, and a camping stove I could cook on if I had to.\n\nSo getting ready to shelter in place isn’t that big a deal when something happens, but I also don’t have kids, pets or any relatives with age or health issues to worry about.\n\nWhat NOT to do if a hurricane hits\n\nIt’s pretty much the same philosophy behind the government’s push for emergency preparedness in the wake of natural or manmade disasters: Be prepared to take care of yourself and your family for at several days.\n\nI always cringe when someone in Delaware says, “We're not ever going to take a direct hit.”\n\nMaybe not. But being prepared isn’t the same as panicking.\n\n“These storms have a mind of their own,” says Gary L. Laing, community relations officer for the Delaware Emergency Management Agency. “The fact that we’ve never been hit by one before is no guarantee that it can’t happen, and it only takes one. Here’s a comparison: There’s probably a lot of people out there whose homes have never been burglarized, but they have security systems.\n\n“Consider preparedness to be the equivalent of a burglary system. It’s something to keep your home and family safe.”\n\nIf Matthew does head toward Delaware and other points north of Virginia, the best thing people can do is get their home and family ready now, Laing says.\n\nHere are 10 things you should do before and after a big storm:\n\n— Make sure you keep the essentials on hand: candles, matches or lighters, batteries, flashlights, lamps, nonperishable food, bottled water, enough of the medicines anyone needs. Check your batteries now to make sure they're good. And if the storm does head this way, keep all electronics charged as long as you can.\n\n— Keep your car gassed up. Do it ahead of the rush, if you can. Once the storm hits, or after it’s over, you might need to drive somewhere. If the worst happens you might be in long lines in an evacuation. Cars can idle a long time on a little gas, but you don’t want to end up one of the people who either has to fill up in a storm or is left by the side of the road. (And if you really think you might be evacuated, be smart and put things in the car that people can urinate into. Easier for men, but not impossible for women. I have a wide-mouthed collection container left over from a hospital visit. I was once evacuated from a Gulf Coast vacation and stuck in traffic for hours with three small boys who were hungry, hot and needed to go to the bathroom. Not fun.)\n\n— Check your prescriptions. Do any need refills in the next few days? Get them as soon as possible, not the day of or the day before the storm hits.\n\n— Check your emergency kit and make sure it’s up to date. A list for what should be in there (including an AM/FM radio that has National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration alerts on it) can be found at www.preparedde.org.\n\n— Clear your yard now. Lay freestanding basketball goals on the ground. Flip over outdoor tables and put them surface down on the ground for better wind resistance. Bring in umbrellas. Lay outdoor chairs on their sides. If you can’t move a grill into a garage, either push it against your house so the wind won’t blow it against the house, or use bungee cords to secure it to the deck or house. “You want to do that under blue skies instead of waiting until the wind hits and stuff is flying around,” Laing says.\n\n— Make sure neighbors have your phone number and you have theirs. If something happens, they are your first and best choice of help, especially if emergency personnel are battling the storm, winds and flooded streets. Keep a list of emergency numbers in your phone. A lot of emergency sites recommend keeping the same lists on a card in your wallet in case your cell phone dies.\n\n— Keep everyone in your home in a safe place during a storm. In a high-wind situation, make sure you can keep the family and the pets in a room away from windows on the side of the house the wind will hit. You usually know in a hurricane which ones those are. Even if you’re not near trees, high winds can pick up limbs, debris, pieces of roof, play equipment and more and throw it against your house. Make sure you have medicines and other valuables in that room with you.\n\n— Talk to your kids about what’s going on. There are lots of sites online that show kids how a hurricane works, and they might be interested in tracking it on NOAA or other weather sites. Talking to kids about the storm and what you’re doing as a family will not only help them be calm, but also start to train them for handling emergencies of their own later in life.\n\n— Monitor several websites, including fema.delaware.gov as well as your favorite weather and news sites. They’ll have the latest as fast they can. All state press releases about the storm will publish automatically to the FEMA site.\n\n— If you live in an area that floods, pack bags now. At a minimum, make yourself a checklist for what you want in there. The state won’t announce where the shelters will be until right before the storm or as it's just happening, partly because they don’t want to open a shelter that sends people into harm’s way. When the announcement is made, the state will specify which shelters will allow people to bring pets and which will not.\n\n“Shelters are something people should consider as the last resort,” Laing says. “Think about if you have a friend or relative who lives inland and if they’ll let you come to their house and spend a day or two. It’s preferable but should shelter be needed, we will put them up.”\n\nIf you do go to a friend’s house or a shelter, let other friends and family know where you are.\n\nDelaware information\n\nIn Delaware, the place to go for information about handling a serious emergency is the recently revamped www.preparede.org.

For the latest updates on Hurricane Milton's aftermath across Florida, read USA TODAY's live hurricane coverage for Thursday, Oct. 10.\n\nTAMPA, Fla. - Milton slammed into Florida's already storm-blasted west coast Wednesday evening as a Category 3 hurricane threatening huge swaths of Tampa Bay, Sarasota and regions still reeling from the destruction of Helene.'\n\nPresident Joe Biden referred to Hurricane Milton as “the storm of the century” and warned residents to heed evacuation orders. Tropical-storm-force winds, flooding rains, and tornadoes were spreading inland as the fierce hurricane made landfall near Siesta Key in Sarasota County.\n\nNumerous news outlets and Tampa residents also posted video of the roof of Tropicana Field being ripped to shreds by Milton's winds. The domed stadium is home to Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays and has recently been used as a base camp to support the Florida Department of Emergency Management ahead of the hurricane.\n\nMilton is forecast to maintain hurricane intensity as it crosses Florida overnight, the hurricane center said. By 5 a.m. ET Thursday, Milton’s winds weakened to 85 mph — making it a Category 1 storm — as it was 10 miles northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.\n\nAbout 125 homes had already been destroyed by Hurricane Milton by Wednesday evening, according to Florida officials. More than 3 million homes and businesses were in the dark by early Thursday, according to USA TODAY power outage data.\n\nKevin Guthrie, director of Florida's Division of Emergency Management, said most of the lost residences were mobile homes in senior communities.\n\n\"We're trying to get to Florida's most vulnerable to make sure they're taken care of,\" he said. But Guthrie assured Florida residents, \"We are with you.\"\n\nThe latest hurricane strike comes on the heels of Helene, which left a trail of devastated communities across six states. Helene, which first hit Florida as a category 4 hurricane on Sept. 26, killed over 200 people and is estimated to have caused between $10.5 and $17.5 billion of insured losses alone.\n\nMilton brings fear of more widespread damage, with tropical storm-force winds extending out to 255 miles, according to the hurricane center. Millions of storm-weary Floridians had been ordered or urged to flee earlier in the day, particularly in the Tampa area, which was initially projected to be in the bulls-eye of the storm.\n\nTampa, with a metropolitan area that is home to over 3 million people, has not had a direct hit by a major hurricane in more than 100 years. Storm surge from Milton could drive water levels up to 12 feet above ground, the hurricane center said.\n\nMilton is the third hurricane to make landfall in Florida this year. That puts 2024 in a tie with five previous years for the most Florida landfalls in a single season, said Phil Klotzbach, a senior research scientist at Colorado State University. The other years were 1871, 1886, 1964, 2004 and 2005.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, speaking at a briefing earlier Wednesday, said the state is prepared. Hundreds of search and rescue personnel and 180 high-water vehicles have been embedded in likely storm impact sites, he said. Over 6,000 state National Guard members and 3,000 more from other states are at the ready, along with 50,000 linemen who will work on restoring power after the storm.\n\nHurricane Milton tracker:Follow the latest path of the storm\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ Flash flood emergencies remained in effect early Thursday for parts of west-central Florida, according to the hurricane center. The National Weather Service reported that shortly after 1:30 a.m. ET, between 5 and 9 inches of rain had already fallen, and additional rainfall amounts of 3 to 6 inches were possible in the warned area.\n\n∎ In St. Petersburg, Florida, authorities are responding to a water main break that will \"impact potable water services across the entire city,\" officials said in a statement. The city shut off all potable water service at midnight and officials warned that the temporary shutdown is expected to last \"until the necessary repairs can be completed.\"\n\n∎ High winds and extreme rainfall rates were expected along and to the north of Interstate 4, the weather service said. A gauge in St. Petersburg, Florida, recorded 5.09 inches of rain in an hour on Wednesday night. In total over 22 hours, a gauge at St. Petersburg's Albert Whitted Airport reported 18.31 inches of rain. Along the Northeast Florida coast, a peak storm surge of 3 to 5 feet is forecast.\n\n∎ Tornadic supercells − dangerous, rotating thunderstorms that can produce tornadoes − were beginning to sweep across the Florida peninsula, hurricane officials said. The weather service office in Melbourne received reports Wednesday from Okeechobee, Indian River, St. Lucie, and Martin counties \"that suggest multiple tornadoes touched down,\" said William Ulrich, warning coordination meteorologist for the weather service office in Melbourne.\n\nWinds cause damages in Tampa Bay area as power outages mount\n\nIn downtown Tampa, fierce winds tore down traffic lights, ripped signs off the ground, and sent construction barricades scudding across the wet pavement. Milton’s winds also ripped off plywood meant to keep the storm out, and a portion of a downtown building’s brick facade collapsed, partially blocking the road.\n\nOver 430,000 homes and businesses were without power in Hillsborough County by early Thursday, according to USA TODAY power outage data. Power outages began to impact services in the area.\n\nThe Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office said on X, formerly Twitter, that its non-emergency line is currently down due to a power outage. The office advised residents to call 911 for \"any emergency\" as authorities work to get the line back up and running.\n\nTampa Bay Water asked residents in the area to \"limit water use immediately\" as its regional water supply system and some facilities are experiencing power outages.\n\n\"The regional supplier continues to run critical facilities on generator power but is asking residents to begin conserving water immediately to help maintain water supply to Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas counties, and cities of New Port Richey and St. Petersburg,\" the water utility company said in a statement. \"Work to restore power may not occur until impacts from Hurricane Milton subside.\"\n\nMLB stadium damaged; crane collapsed at construction site\n\nAfter making landfall Wednesday night, Milton battered the Tampa Bay area with high winds and heavy rains. St. Petersburg officials confirmed shortly before midnight that destructive winds damaged the roof at Tropicana Field, home of Major League Baseball's Tampa Bay Rays.\n\nFootage from local television stations and photos shared on social media showed part of the stadium’s roof torn off amid high winds. A storm deployed weather sensor on the public beach at Anna Maria Island, near the mouth of Tampa Bay, reported 84-mph sustained winds, with a gust to 106 mph at 10 p.m, said Tyler Fleming, a meteorologist with the weather service in Tampa Bay.\n\nEarlier this week, DeSantis announced that the St. Petersburg stadium would serve as a 10,000-person base camp for debris cleanup operations and first responders. St. Petersburg Fire Rescue told ABC News that authorities were in contact with people inside the stadium and confirmed they were safe.\n\nOfficials also reported late Wednesday that a crane collapsed at a building construction site. According to the Tampa Bay Times, the crane collapsed into an office building that houses several businesses and left a hole in the building.\n\nThe building damaged by the crane had closed ahead of Milton’s landfall, according to the newspaper. By early Thursday, the crane remained on the ground, blocking the nearby street.\n\n“The public is urged to continue to shelter in place and avoid both areas until further notice,” the city of St. Petersburg said in a statement. “No injuries have been reported in either incident at this time.”\n\nEarlier, the city shared a video showing winds uprooting a tree at a local hotel.\n\nFeeding America CEO: Taylor Swift donated $5M to relief efforts\n\nTaylor Swift has donated $5 million to hurricane relief efforts for victims of Helene and Milton, the non-profit organization Feeding America announced Wednesday.\n\n\"We’re incredibly grateful to Taylor Swift for her generous $5 million donation to Hurricanes Helene and Milton relief efforts,” Feeding America's CEO Claire Babineaux-Fontenot wrote in an Instagram post. “This contribution will help communities rebuild and recover, providing essential food, clean water, and supplies to people affected by these devastating storms.\"\n\nFeeding America, a U.S.-based organization dedicated to helping to end hunger, works with local food banks, food pantries, and food programs.\n\n— C. A. Bridges, USA TODAY NETWORK - Florida\n\nPresident Biden: 'It's a matter of life and death'\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were among the administration officials urging Florida residents Wednesday to follow safety instructions as Milton bore down on the state.\n\n“It’s a matter, literally, of life and death,” Biden said at a White House emergency briefing, referring to the hurricane as “the storm of the century.”\n\nBiden has approved emergency declarations for Florida and sent search and rescue teams as well as emergency food, water, power generators and ambulances to the region. In an evening briefing, the president said the Defense Department has also positioned helicopters and high-water rescue vehicles as close to the storm as possible to be ready to conduct life-saving missions.\n\nHarris, the Democratic presidential nominee, encouraged residents in the storm's wake to take precautions. “This is a storm that by every measure, understand, it's going to be more dangerous, more deadly and more catastrophic,” she said.\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, who located to Florida's capital, Tallahassee, for Milton’s landfall, said there are more than 1,000 federal personnel in Florida addressing the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and other recent storms. She has directed an additional 1,200 search-and-rescue workers to the state to respond to Milton.\n\n\"Floridians, they're no strangers to these storms,\" Criswell said. \"But this one, Hurricane Milton, it is expected to be catastrophic. And I promise you that FEMA is ready.\"\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nReverse storm surge in Tampa Bay\n\nAs Milton approached, the water began rushing out of Tampa Bay in a phenomenon known as reverse storm surge. The phenomenon happens when powerful winds in a landfalling hurricane blow from the land over a bay or waterway and push the water out. South of Tampa along the coast, storm surge was flooding into communities, with increases in water levels exceeding 4-8 feet in some locations. Officials along the Southwest Florida coast warned the storm surge could continue rising into the early morning hours.\n\nMeteorologist Tyler Fleming confirmed to USA TODAY Wednesday night a reverse surge is happening in Tampa Bay. He said water levels for the bay are below normal tide, but urged people to remain indoors until officials give the all-clear.\n\n\"It can cause infrastructure problems and people tend to walk out, which is incredibly dangerous with the water coming back in,\" he said.\n\nNearly 100 tornado warnings from Milton\n\nEven before making landfall, Milton brought a punch for many Floridians as its outer bands prompted 98 tornado warnings from the Tampa Bay, Melbourne and Miami offices of the National Weather Service, the agency said Wednesday.\n\nNWS-Miami meteorologist Will Redman said a preliminary report found at least nine tornadoes were confirmed in Miami, where the office had received 23 reports for South Florida as of 7 p.m. ET. The reports came from trained spotters and residents either seeing a tornado touch down or damage from a possible tornado, according to Redman, who said the worst of Milton has passed for that area.\n\n\"We were never expected to get too much rain from the hurricane,\" Redman said. \"We're just expected to get tropical storm-force winds from the storm with the outer bands.\"\n\n− Krystal Nurse\n\n'Wall of black': Tornadoes cause widespread damage\n\nReported tornadoes tore through parts of southwest Florida on Wednesday, including in Collier County and Lee County, causing extensive damage across Fort Myers and Cape Coral.\n\nNorth Fort Myers resident Scott Fincher was sitting on the lanai of his Pine Lakes community home with his family, waiting for Milton. As they waited, they passed the time watching the local news, which was reporting on the \"tornado outbreak.”\n\nReporters then announced a tornado was headed into sister community Lake Fairways, which shares a boundary with Pine Lakes. That’s when Fincher knew: they had to hide.\n\nFincher immediately began moving everyone into the home: his wife, his sister-in-law and his dog. “Just as we were moving everybody in, that’s when it came through,” Fincher said, “and when I heard the rumbling.”\n\n“It was a wall of black,” Fincher said. “It was just as black as could be . . . I felt fear. You could feel the ground shaking a little bit, the house and everything.”\n\n— Kate Cimini, Fort Myers News-Press\n\nDamage, fatalities reported in Southeast Florida\n\nSuspected tornadoes damaged “dozens” of homes along the Treasure Coast in southeast Florida, according to authorities. The storm caused trees and live wires to fall, and neighborhoods were impassable in Martin County.\n\nIt's \"absolutely atrocious,\" said Martin County Sheriff William Snyder. \"It's a mess.\"\n\nSt. Lucie County officials confirmed to local television stations that there were multiple fatalities after tornadoes tore through the area. County Sheriff Keith Pearson told WPBF-TV the fatalities were reported in Spanish Lakes Country Club Village in Lakewood Park, a neighborhood in St. Lucie County north of Fort Pierce.\n\n\"We are going through the rubble,\" Pearson said. \" ... It's devastating. There are no words to describe it.\"\n\nOne of Port St. Lucie's emergency management officials was personally affected by the storm's destruction when a suspected tornado took out his home in northwest Fort Pierce. Billy Weinshank, Port St. Lucie's emergency operations division director, was at work when the storm struck his home, where seven people and \"a couple\" of pets were staying, said Sarah Prohaska, the city's communications director.\n\n\"His house is pretty much destroyed,\" Prohaska said, but noted that all of the people and pets were evacuated safely.\n\n— Treasure Coast Newspapers staff\n\nFor various reasons, several opt to ride out hurricane\n\nIt happens every time a hurricane approaches, no matter how dangerous or how much officials plead for residents to evacuate: Some invariably defy those orders and decide to ride it out.\n\nWhile millions of Floridians poured onto highways to get away from Milton on Tuesday and Wednesday, many opted to hunker down in vulnerable areas. Some residents said their house was elevated and would avoid the storm surge. Others said they feared running out of gas on traffic-jammed highways. Some said they wanted to leave but lacked the means to do so.\n\nLloyd Martinez and two of his friends are among the few staying in the coastal community of Everglades City, about 80 miles south of Fort Myers in the threatened west side of the Florida peninsula, figuring their lodging on the second floor of a riverside seafood restaurant will be safe.\n\n“We’re gonna be fine,” Martinez said.\n\n− Christopher Cann, Chris Kenning and Trevor Hughes\n\nFlorida removed tons of Helene debris before Milton's arrival\n\nDeSantis said Wednesday the state cleared out more than 3,000 truckloads of debris left behind by Helene ahead of Milton's arrival, in an effort to minimize the number of objects that could become projectiles amid high winds.\n\nLandfills have been operating 24 hours a day and a couple of extra ones were opened as the state encouraged residents to also pick up debris and dump it, DeSantis said.\n\nTropicana Field, home of the Tampa Bay Rays, has been converted into a 10,000-person base camp for debris cleanup operations and first-responders, but officials said storm-debris collection would stop Wednesday afternoon as Milton approached.\n\n− N'dea Yancey-Bragg\n\nHomeless man with criminal record has few options\n\nAs the storm worsened Wednesday afternoon, Nolan Salter sought shelter beneath a building awning in downtown Tampa. Salter, who is unhoused, said he was hoping a friend who recently left town will return soon with a job opportunity for him.He hopes to survive until then.Court records show Salter, 32, got divorced in 2021 and was arrested for drug possession in 2023. Because of his criminal record, many traditional shelters are off-limits for him, and he said he didn’t feel comfortable hiding from the storm in a parking garageSalter said the downtown Tampa bus terminal has some large concrete pillars he felt he could shelter behind if the wind got higher. He said he hoped his heavy jacket, waterproof leather boots and multiple layers of socks and shirts would protect him.Munching on Doritos, Salter said he has more food but worried about access to drinking water. “It’s going to get really bad,” he said as he balanced his belongings in a garbage bag atop a bike with a flat rear tire. Finishing the small bag of chips, he zipped up his jacket and headed into the storm.\n\nBiden denounces Trump's 'onslaught of lies'\n\nBiden said he has spoken with DeSantis and other local and state leaders about Milton and gave them his personal cellphone number to contact him directly if necessary.\n\nThe president also called out former President Donald Trump for leading an “onslaught of lies” on FEMA’s recovery efforts regarding Helene.\n\nBiden said these include baseless claims that property is being confiscated, flood victims are limited to $750 in federal relief aid and FEMA is diverting hurricane relief funds to shelter migrants. Trump has pushed each false claim.\n\n“Now the claims are getting even more bizarre,'' Biden said. \"Marjorie Taylor Greene − a congresswoman from Georgia − is now saying the federal government is literally controlling the weather. It's beyond ridiculous. It's got to stop.\"\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\n'It’s selfish to stay and make other people put their lives at risk'\n\nAlex Ortiz was on the road for hours, trying to get her mother, her three dogs, eight cats and herself as far away as possible from Milton. They ended up in Destin, 370 miles north of their Pasco County home in Florida. She’d already seen the havoc wrought by Helene, and it cost her: She lost her Toyota Rav4 and a lot of her belongings stored in a ground-level garage.\n\n“I’m exhausted,” said Ortiz, 25. She and her mother had originally planned to stay at a motel in Tallahassee, but didn’t feel safe when they arrived there. They were running out of options. Her mother is partially disabled because of arthritis and most hotels and shelters either don’t take animals or limit their number.\n\n“What am I going to do? Throw some of them out of the car?” Ortiz said. She already had a friend take in her rabbit, but two of her dogs are seniors and prone to seizures. She loves her pets so much, she packed the urns of ones that had died previously into a rented Plymouth Voyager van.\n\n“It’s selfish to stay and make other people put their lives at risk because you put yours at risk,” the lifelong Florida resident said. “Some people here think nothing bad can happen to them, like this is nothing. It’s nothing until it’s something.”\n\n− Phaedra Trethan\n\nRiding out Milton in home turned refuge\n\nKatie Combs’ living room is full of damp family photos and birth certificates salvaged from her mother’s home after it was wrecked by Hurricane Helene. The storm – which left Combs’ home untouched – inundated and completely emptied her mother’s house in Indian Rocks Beach.\n\n“We found two dining chairs just floating in the ocean … a random tennis shoe hundreds of yards away,” Katie Combs said.\n\nNow, as Hurricane Milton approaches, Combs and her family nailed up boards and brought in furniture at her house in Pinellas Park – which has become a refuge for loved ones whose homes were destroyed by Helene. Recently affixed with a new roof, the house sits 20 feet above sea level and is several miles from the coast, in a city just north of St. Petersburg. She and her family stayed there during Helene and did not lose power.\n\n“If we had to, we could just get in the car and just drive and sleep in the car with the cat,” she said. “But now that we're here and my mom is staying with a friend about 25 minutes away, I don't think getting her and leaving is an option.”\n\n− Christopher Cann\n\nMilton too dangerous for boat owners to stay\n\nAt the Davis Island Yacht Club in Tampa, Commodore Robert Tintera and fellow sailboat racer Emily Wagner spent Wednesday morning fighting increasingly gusty wind and rain to install a remote camera to monitor dozens of members’ boats moored along the docks. A skeleton crew of club members remained at the facility during Helene to loosen and tighten lines as necessary. But they’ve decided it’s just too dangerous to stay for Milton.Tintera's nearby home was significantly damaged by the surge from Hurricane Helene.“The thing I was worried the most about was my sailboat, and it was my house, two motorcycles and a car that got flooded,” said Tintera, who planned to evacuate Wednesday afternoon. “Our hope is that the weak side of the storm pushes the water out of the bay.\"\n\nMetalworker will ride out Milton with 10-foot metal bunny\n\nIn Tampa, while many other people made last-minute preparations, metalworker Dominique Martinez took another tack, driving around in his white pickup with a 10-foot-tall, purple metal bunny in the back. Martinez planned to ride out Milton in his studio home, which is inside an old city firehouse on high ground in Tampa. Because he wasn’t worried about his safety, he said, he could take the time to drive around his sculpture with the aim of bringing some levity to the situation.“So many people come up and are like, ‘this is so cool,’” he told USA TODAY as the wind intensified. “The proof is in the pudding. Look at your smile!”\n\nMapping fuel shortages:Gas shortages grow in Florida ahead of Milton\n\nFlorida's east coast also will face Milton's wrath\n\nMilton is zeroing in on Florida's west coast, but across the panhandle the east coast won't emerge unscathed. The National Weather Service in Melbourne said the storm is likely to have Category 1 hurricane strength when it rolls over the area. The service warned Wednesday that Milton is “likely to result in a rare and historic event for parts of the area” and the region’s residents could face “devastating impacts from hurricane winds and gusts,” including major flooding.\n\nStorm shelters throughout Brevard County, home to Melbourne, opened Wednesday morning ahead of Milton’s arrival on the Space Coast.\n\n− Dinah Voyles Pulver and Michelle Spitzer, USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nMarco Island resident will ride out the storm\n\nMARCO ISLAND, Fla − On Wednesday morning in Marco Island, 180 miles south of Tampa, increasing winds began whipping palm trees Wednesday. Cars pulled into the city’s last open gas station, its windows covered with plywood and its owner manning the till because his workers didn’t feel safe to coming to work.\n\nOutside, Tim McCoy, 72, filled a supply of gas canisters. McCoy, who owns the island’s Sandbar restaurant that was full of revelers the night before, said he’d been through nearly 20 years of hurricanes including Hurricane Ian in 2022, when the island lost power and an 8-foot storm surge flooded hundreds of buildings and vehicles.\n\nHe was planning to stay for Milton because his home is on elevated ground. He was most worried about losing electricity.\n\n“We don’t have to worry about the flood, we just have to worry about power,” McCoy said, adding that \"if it was a direct hit, I’d probably be out of here.”\n\n− Chris Kenning\n\nMilton forces cancellation of thousands of flights\n\nSeveral Central Florida airports have closed. More than 1,700 U.S. flights have been canceled for Wednesday, according to flight-tracking website FlightAware. The same goes for Thursday.\n\nAmerican Airlines and United Airlines had added seats and extra flights Monday and Tuesday to help people evacuate the area. Now those airlines along with Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines have issued waivers that allow travelers going to or from some Florida airports to change their tickets for no extra charge. Customers can check their airline’s website for specific details on travel advisories.\n\nIf a flight gets canceled for any reason, customers are entitled to a refund, according to Department of Transportation rules.\n\n− Eve Chen, Zach Wichter, Nathan Diller and Kathleen Wong\n\nHurricane Milton travel impact:What to know about flights, cruises, hotels and theme parks across Florida\n\nMost people have left this retirement town\n\nMuch of the coastal retirement community of Venice is under an evacuation order, including some areas hosting emergency shelters. Mayor Nick Pachota said officials believe those shelters will be safe enough for people to ride out the storm in, but that most people have left already.\n\nHelene hit Venice’s coastal areas hardest with storm surge, but Milton is expected to bring high winds and rain, along with a storm surge twice that of Helene. Venice, with a population of about 27,000, is about 70 miles south of Tampa.He said a significant concern are the piles of debris left by Helen, which are expected to be thrown around by Milton’s wind.Because so many elderly people retire there − the city’s median age is 68 years old, compared to 38 for the U.S as a whole − officials worked closely with their state counterparts to evacuate nursing home residents and others who could not move themselves.“We made a very big push to get everybody out of here and most of our facilities heeded that request,” Pachota said.\n\nWatch Hurricane Milton live cameras:Storm approaching Florida\n\nIs there a hurricane after Milton?\n\nWith more than seven weeks left in the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season, there's a good chance that catastrophic Hurricane Milton won't be the last storm to impact the U.S. this year.\n\nIn fact, forecasters are continuing to watch several other systems across the Atlantic basin, including one east of Florida that could become Tropical Storm Nadine later Wednesday.\n\nIf the system becomes Nadine, it would be the 14th named storm of the 2024 Atlantic hurricane season. A typical season – which lasts from June 1 to Nov. 30 – has 14 storms. Read more here.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nMilton's size could mean more than wind speed\n\nMilton may wobble between a Category 3 and Cat 5 hurricane, but forecasters say that ranking doesn't capture the storm's true potential. The scale that ranks hurricanes – officially known as the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale – is a rating based on maximum sustained wind speed, which ranges from 74 to 157 mph, or higher. The scale does not take into account potentially deadly hurricane hazards such as storm surge, rainfall, river flooding and tornadoes.\n\nIn Milton's case, experts are focusing their concerns on the storm's growing size and potential for massive storm surge along populated areas − two of the things that don't factor into category rankings. The situation was slightly different with recent Hurricane Helene, where the storm's winds were a bigger concern as it made landfall in a less populated area with lots of trees and vulnerable structures.\n\nMilton winds peaked Monday evening as one of the top 5 strongest Atlantic hurricanes on record with sustained winds of 180 mph. Though the winds have eased modestly, the storm has grown in size.\n\n\"Milton has the potential to be one of the most destructive hurricanes on record for west-central Florida,\" the National Hurricane Center warned.\n\n− Doyle Rice\n\nFEMA warns: 'Avoid spreading false information'\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), said the agency is \"prepared to respond and stands ready to support\" Florida with resources requests.\n\n\"Hundreds of FEMA staff are on the ground in Florida supporting Helene recovery and coordinating with the state to prepare people for the next storm,\" the agency said in a news release.\n\nWhat category is Hurricane Milton?Florida has bigger worries than that.\n\nFEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell pushed back against Trump’s claims about Hurricane Helene recovery efforts, saying she was disappointed in the misinformation he was spreading. FEMA was forced to address misinformation on its webpage and social media platforms after Trump spread claims about hurricane relief efforts, including allegations that there are “no helicopters, no rescue” in North Carolina and that the federal government is only giving $750 to those who have lost their homes.\n\n— Saman Shafiq\n\nContributing: Reuters\n\nThis story was updated to add a video.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/hurricanes/2018/09/15/delawares-worst-storms-hurricanes-noreasters/1318484002/", "title": "Delaware's worst storms since 1800s include hurricanes, nor'easters", "text": "Every year Delawareans keep a sharp eye on hurricanes moving up the coast, and some of them over the years have hit hard enough to become legends — hurricanes Hazel, Agnes and Sandy, for example.\n\nSo it might surprise you to learn that only two storms since 1851 have actually brought hurricane-force winds with them, and icons like Hazel weren't among them.

Even a near miss has in the past caused severe damage throughout the town.\n\nNow as Hurricane Dorian approaches, let's look back at some of the worst hurricanes in Ocean City's history.\n\nThe Storm of 1933\n\nThe Storm of 1933, or the Chesapeake-Potomac Hurricane, made landfall near Virginia Beach, Virginia, on Aug. 23, 1933, according to the National Weather Service. The eye of the storm traveled up the Chesapeake Bay toward Washington, D.C.\n\nAcross the region, the storm caused 18 deaths, according to NWS. More locally, the Storm of 1933 devastated parts of Ocean City.\n\n\"Many stories have been told about Ocean City, scarcely any being alike, but there is no difference in the stories that the people were badly frightened at the mountainous waves that batter down the boardwalk, smashed windows and in south Ocean City destroyed a number of places of business,\" wrote the Democratic Messenger newspaper of Snow Hill, according to the Ocean City Life-Saving Station Museum.\n\nBeyond destroying the town's Boardwalk and flooding much of it, the storm most notably formed the town's inlet, according to the museum. What was believed to be the storm surge created the inlet, washing away the town's rail bridge, buildings and formed a channel between the Sinepuxent Bay and the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nHurricane Gloria\n\nHurricane Gloria in 1985 was once a Category 4 hurricane, but struck North Carolina's Outer Banks as a Category 2 storm, according to NWS. After landfall, the storm continued north paralleling the Virginia and Maryland coastline, causing nearly 200,000 people to lose power in the two states.\n\nThe storm also caused Ocean City to evacuate an estimated 50,000 residents and visitors before the storm, according to the town.\n\nGloria also caused \"significant\" flooding damage to areas of the beachfront town and destroyed sections of the boardwalk in its wake.\n\nMore:Why don't hurricanes make landfall in Maryland, Delaware?\n\nMore:The next 100-year storm won't wait a century to bring major destruction\n\nHurricane Sandy\n\nHurricane Sandy, also known as Superstorm Sandy, formed in the southwestern Caribbean Sea. The stormed shifted north past the Mid-Atlantic, eventually making landfall in Brigantine, New Jersey, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe storm caused approximately $50 billion in damages and at least 147 deaths in 2012, according to NOAA.\n\nIn the Ocean City area, part of the town's 100 foot-long fishing pier was destroyed by the hurricane, according to NOAA. The town was also inundated by up to four feet of storm surge, the worst Ocean City had seen since Hurricane Gloria.\n\nMore:How Hurricane Dorian will affect Delmarva, and how you can prepare\n\nMore:Sand cliffs are forming on Maryland, Delaware and Virginia beaches.

It buzzed with emergency vehicles responding to the first storm-related fatality the state has seen since Hurricane Irene in 2011.\n\nNeighbors weren’t ready to talk about the woman killed on Tuesday by a falling tree branch from Tropical Storm Isaias, out of respect for the family. Another new resident wasn’t even aware of what had happened. And authorities have not yet released the woman’s name.\n\nA RECAP OF THE STORM:'All hell started breaking loose:' Isaias spawns tornadoes, kills one in Delaware on Tuesday\n\nThousands of Delawareans on Tuesday were cleaning up and assessing the damage to their homes and cars from Isaias.\n\nIt will take days to know the true extent of the storm’s damage in Delaware and elsewhere along the coast, but the Delaware Emergency Management Agency compared Tuesday's storm to Tropical Storm Henri in 2003, which led to more than $16.1 million in damages in the First State alone.\n\n“This is like the equivalent of several strong thunderstorms in a several-hour period,” said DEMA Director A.J. Schall. “It was disastrous and is a huge headache for those that are impacted.”\n\nISAIAS BY THE HOUR:Tornadoes spotted 4 times in Delaware; updated forecast; homes and cars destroyed\n\nBased on preliminary reports, Schall estimates the storm may have caused more than $20 million in damages. The final number includes damage to the dozens of homes in Dover and New Castle County, as well as a school, that is now uninhabitable; debris cleanup; and damages to utility infrastructure like downed poles and wires.\n\nIt took nearly two weeks for Isaias to journey across the Atlantic Ocean before making landfall in North Carolina late Monday night, and it never became more than a low-level Category 1 storm. Yet it still wreaked havoc on multiple coastal states and impacted millions of residents along the East Coast.\n\n“I think a lot of people think with tropical storms, ‘It’s not a hurricane; we don’t have to worry,'\" said Delaware State Climatologist Daniel Leathers. \"But there can still be huge impacts with a tropical storm of any strength, really.\"\n\nThe damage, he said, \"really highlights the potential impacts even with ‘just’ a tropical storm.”\n\n‘What else is 2020 gonna bring?’\n\nIn Middletown’s Summit Bridge Farms, a neighborhood with some of the most significant storm damage, residents dug through fallen trees Wednesday afternoon to find their belongings, which had been carried away by Isaias’ winds the day before.\n\nIf they were lucky, they found their yard decorations and deck furniture, sometimes houses away from their own. But some people had no idea where their lost items were carried when a tornado touched down in the area.\n\nThe homes were struck in a way that clearly outlined the path of the storm.\n\nA crop field behind one resident’s house showed traces of the tornado’s path before it reached the neighborhood, where homes on either side of the path were minimally damaged, some escaping without any signs of wear.\n\nBut other houses were hit hard like the home of Amy Brennan. She was home when the tornado went through, her two teenage sons asleep on the second floor.\n\nShe said she heard rumbling and yelled for the boys to come down, one of whom did. When she next looked up, her 14-year-old son, Conner, was at the top of the stairs, just as the storm started to tear the second story off her home.\n\nA SCHOOL HIT HARD:Delaware middle school condemned after taking damage from Tropical Storm Isaias\n\n\"Thank gosh it was only for a second,\" Brennan said. Conner had held tight to the railing and somehow made it down the stairs to join the family.\n\nThey're all shaken, but safe.\n\n\"I can't imagine the power of that swirling wind. ... The roof is just gone. I don't even know where it is,\" Brennan said.\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, State Farm, one Delaware’s largest insurance company, reported its customers had filed 590 homeowners claims, nearly five times more than the number of auto claims — 120 — it had received.\n\nBut the insurance company said Wednesday’s numbers are only preliminary and will likely increase as the days go on. The claims also don’t take into account other insurance companies that did not report their numbers.\n\nWhile State Farm’s claim numbers are remarkable just one day after Isaias swept through, the storm’s damage extended well beyond cars and homes.\n\nWinds from the tropical storm, as well as the tornadoes it produced, knocked down electrical lines, cutting power to more than 115,000 customers, Delmarva Power said.\n\nAs of 4 p.m. Wednesday, the company had restored power to all but about 8,000 customers. The power company said crews would be working “around the clock” in 12-to-16-hour shifts to get power back to the remaining customers.\n\nMore than 800 workers from as far away as Florida and Texas have joined the effort, but some of the most damaged areas in the state may not have electricity until Friday evening, the company said.\n\nDelaware emergency officials said infrastructure such as bridges and roadway structures were largely spared in the storm, though more than 20 roads in New Castle County remained closed Wednesday, long after the wind and rain subsided. Coastal impacts were minimal, with no major flooding or beach erosion reported.\n\nStill, the damage inland was extensive.\n\nState emergency officials are coordinating with county emergency agencies to assess damages and decide whether any federal assistance is needed. They also met with Federal Emergency Management Agency officials to discuss the next steps as Delaware recovers.\n\nThose damages are what led Gov. John Carney on Tuesday to issue a state of emergency to better coordinate cleanup efforts among state agencies. The designation was also set Tuesday night in case roads needed to be closed due to lingering flood risks, DEMA’s Schall said.\n\n“‘What else is 2020 gonna bring?’ is what I keep asking myself every morning when I wake up,” said Schall, adding that hurricane season runs until Nov. 30.\n\n“If there’s anything this year has taught us, it’s that people need to be prepared.”\n\nWhat Delawareans can learn\n\nTropical Storm Isaias was not the first vicious storm to hit Delaware, and it won’t be the last.\n\nIt was, however, among the most damaging the First State has seen in recent years, arguably since Superstorm Sandy slammed the region in October 2012, said Leathers.\n\n“It really did more than I think a lot of people assumed it would,” Leathers said. “It’s amazing what the path will do. If this had been 150 miles to the east, we wouldn’t be talking about many impacts here at all.”\n\nHURRICANE SEASON IS HERE:Delaware and hurricanes: What Tropical Storm Isaias reminds us about coastal risk\n\nIt wasn’t that the National Hurricane Center or National Weather Service forecasts were off on Isaias' track or expected wind and rain. In fact, predictions of how much rain and how fast winds would blow were about spot-on, Leathers said.\n\n“The thing that’s always a wild card when it comes to land-falling hurricanes is the potential for tornadoes,” he said. “It was just a matter of, this time, this was a very dynamic storm.”\n\nThough the National Weather Service issued tornado watches and warnings as soon as they detected conditions rife for producing twisters, “whether or not tornadoes are produced within a weather system is really hard to forecast that far ahead of time,” Leathers said.\n\n“It’s unusual for us — we just typically don’t see that number of tornadoes,” he said. “But we have had tornadoes before with tropical systems.”\n\nInitial reports suggested several separate tornadoes touched down in Kent and New Castle counties Tuesday, but the National Weather Service said on Wednesday it was most likely one tornado that touched down multiple times. It will take at least another day or more to make that determination.\n\nFour sightings had been reported — on Sandtown Road near Felton, along Route 13 in Smyrna, in the area of Route 8 and Bennington Street in Dover and on Gum Bush Road near Townsend. It’s not unusual for a tornado to touch down then revert to more of a funnel cloud, then touch down again somewhere else, Leathers said.\n\nNormally when a hurricane or tropical system makes landfall, they begin to weaken. Warm ocean waters are key to fueling tropical systems, and without that source, the storms often start to flounder.\n\nBut the conditions were perfect for Tropical Storm Isaias to maintain its strength on its rapid northward journey up the East Coast. An upper-level trough in the atmosphere gave the storm its fast-moving forward speed, but also helped it keep its strength. That, combined with the dynamic nature of the storm’s wind field, created the perfect recipe for tornados, Leathers said.\n\n“This particular one, even though it was never that strong from a hurricane standpoint, because of the overall meteorological situation and the path it took, it did a lot of damage from the coastal Carolinas all the way up into New England,” Leathers said. “People need to remember that: This was a tropical storm, but there were fatalities and injuries and property damage.\n\n“That’s why, if you hear a tropical storm is coming into your area, it’s important to take that seriously.”\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal videographer Jenna Miller and intern Kry'stal Griffin contributed to this report.\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.

Ginis said he would compare Florence to a Mid-Atlantic version of Hurricane Harvey, both for its size and strength as well as its likelihood to linger for days and drop torrential rain on the area.\n\nFlorence is not unusual, but it is unique – just like every other storm has its own characteristics, Ginis said.\n\n\"Usually storms rapidly intensify in the tropics where the water is very warm,\" he said. \"Now we see a storm intensify in the Mid-Atlantic to a Category 4.\"\n\nIt also is unique because how quickly it intensified so far north. It took less than 48 hours for the system to go from a tropical storm to a Category 4 hurricane.\n\nWhile Hurricane Florence’s track – according to the latest forecast – will largely spare the First State, Delawareans have not always been so lucky.\n\nTropical cyclones have claimed hundreds of lives, most notably in an unnamed hurricane in 1785, which killed 181 people. Since then the Gale of 1878, which traveled along the Delmarva peninsula and into the Delaware Bay was the deadliest, killing 18 people.\n\nStorms like the Gale of 1878 and others from the south spell trouble for Delaware because it places the state in the most dangerous zone: the northeast quadrant of a hurricane. Whipping winds and forward motion from facing the system from that side are what make many storms go down in history.\n\nBut we can thank the coastal region’s geography for making it difficult for hurricanes to make a direct hit. Our position in the Mid-Atlantic, slightly tucked in compared to how Hatteras Island and Long Island jut out, is a big reason why no hurricane has ever made first landfall in the First State, said Delaware Climatologist Daniel Leathers.\n\n“So most storms, when they get to the coast of the U.S., have some kind of south to north component to them. And because we kind of sit back in that little notch, we don’t usually have landfalls here,” he said. “An exception is Sandy, which could have made landfall.”\n\nTechnically, that is because it would require a storm to work against the jet stream and make a left turn, he said.\n\n“Only under rare circumstances,” he said.\n\nUnlike those caught in hurricanes of Delaware’s early days before telephones and satellites, the state now reaps the benefits of having more prediction tools on hand than just barometers, watching the waves and facing the wind to see where the low pressure is (it’s to the right, by the way, if you’re facing the wind).\n\nIt is still difficult to predict how strong storms will be days in advance, but technological improvements in weather forecast models led the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland to declare a state of emergency well in advance of Florence’s arrival, Ginis noted.\n\n“It’s unbelievable, even compared to 10 years ago,” he said. “Most models have locked the landfall location in North Carolina for five days. It’s just incredible accuracy. That’s one of the reasons why [those states] were able to issue a state of emergency so much in advance, I think for the first time in history.”\n\nWhile hurricanes are remarkable for their strength and damaging winds, nor’easters can cause just as much damage and look no different to someone stuck in floodwaters.\n\n“Nor’easters are a much larger spatial storm, much larger than hurricanes,” Leathers said. “And some of them can end up nearly as strong. Certainly, nor’easters cause more damage here in an average year than tropical systems do. But if we get a really bad [tropical system], it can cause a huge amount of damage.”\n\nWith so much rain this summer – some portions of Delaware saw more than 6 inches fall in the last week – coastal areas at low elevations will struggle with inundation this week.\n\n“This will be very challenging for emergency managers, because the storm will stay in the same place for two to three days,” Ginis said, adding that some forecasts show up to 40 inches of rain in the worst-case scenario. “Which is going to be really devastating from that region.”\n\nAnticipating those problems, mandatory evacuation orders have been issued in parts of North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia. Maryland also has declared a state of emergency in advance of Florence’s arrival.\n\nIn South Carolina, more than 1 million people are expected to flee from coastal areas, Gov. Henry McMaster said Monday, vowing that state officials \"are not going to gamble\" with people's lives, as reported by USA Today.\n\nNo state of emergency, warnings or watches associated with the storm have been reported in Delaware as of 3 p.m. Tuesday. At that time, the state was expected to see anywhere from 2 to 6 inches of rainfall, had a 5 percent chance of flash flooding and could see tropical-force winds as the hurricane lands.\n\nDelaware's hurricane history\n\nSuperstorm Sandy, 2012\n\nBy the time Hurricane Sandy unleashed its wrath on Delaware and surrounding states in late 2012, the storm was actually a post-tropical hybrid storm, a nasty combination of a hurricane and a nor’easter.\n\nSandy first formed deep in the Caribbean, impacting those nearby islands before slamming into southern New Jersey as a Category 2 storm with a wind span of more than 1,150 miles, according to FEMA.\n\nThe storm impacted 24 states along the East Coast and inland, causing $70.2 billion in damages. Hundreds of thousands of homes in New Jersey and New York were damaged and millions lost power.\n\nSandy killed at least 145 people in the United States, Haiti, Cuba, Dominican Republic, the Bahamas and other nearby areas.\n\n­­­\n\nHurricane Irene, 2011\n\nBecause Sandy was so devastating in the Mid-Atlantic, it seems that some have forgotten about Hurricane Irene, Leathers said.\n\nIrene formed from a large tropical wave off the western coast of Africa, just like Hurricane Florence, in mid-August 2015. Moving toward the United States, the storm gained strength in the Caribbean Sea and became a Category 3 storm as it moved across the Bahamas, according to NOAA.\n\nThe storm then passed by Florida and Georgia, well offshore, before making­­­ landfall with Category 1 winds in North Carolina.\n\nIrene was one of 19 tropical storms that year and dropped 9 inches of rain on parts of Kent and Sussex counties within a 24-hour period, according to Leather’s office.\n\nIrene caused a reported 48 deaths in the United States, Dominican Republic and Haiti.\n\nFEMA spent nearly $2 million on emergency response needs following that storm, and NOAA estimates it caused a total of $15.8 billion in damages.\n\nHurricane Isabel, 2003\n\nHurricane Isabel also was a storm formed by a tropical wave moving westward from Africa. At one point the storm was a Category 5 in the Atlantic, but was downgraded to a Category 2 when it made landfall near Drum Inlet, North Carolina, on Sept. 18, 2003.\n\nThe Delaware Bay coast was under a hurricane watch at one point during the storm, which caused up to 6.5-foot storm surges at the mouth of the Delaware River.\n\nHurricane Florence: what's an eyewall, anyway?\n\nNOAA reported that Isabel caused 16 deaths: 10 in Virginia, and 1 each in North Carolina, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Florida.\n\nThe storm caused an estimated $1.685 billion in property damages. NOAA estimated that Delaware suffered $20 million in damages from this storm.\n\nLeathers said this storm caused serious flooding in the Chesapeake Bay and also dumped a ton of rain on the First State. It was harsh on Delaware because it came in from the south and moved west, placing Delaware on the powerful, right front quadrant of the system.\n\nDelaware Storm Evacuation Routes\n\nHurricane Dennis and Tropical Storm Floyd, 1999\n\nHurricane Dennis, which never actually made landfall August 1999, it caused serious damage in North Carolina and brought rough winds and surf to the First State, resulting in beach closures, erosion and more than 100 water rescues.\n\nDennis is responsible for four deaths in Florida, the National Hurricane Center found.\n\nAbout two weeks later, Tropical Storm Floyd crossed the southeastern part of the state and dropped more than a foot of rain on some parts of the state, causing serious flooding. This storm also had made landfall in North Carolina as a Category 2 storm.\n\nFloyd was responsible for 47 deaths, two of which occurred in Delaware, and caused an estimated $3 billion to $6 billion in damages. At the time, the National Hurricane Center called it the deadliest hurricane to hit the United States since Hurricane Agnes in 1972.\n\nLeathers said Floyd dropped up to 10 inches of rain on some parts of the state, causing flooding in the south all the way to the northern areas of the Brandywine, White Clay and Red Clay waterways.\n\nHurricane Gloria, 1985\n\nHurricane Gloria’s center crossed the Outer Banks of North Carolina on Sept. 27, 1985, bringing storm surge and damaging winds all along the coast north to Connecticut, historical records show.\n\nGloria caused eight deaths and about $900 million in damages. Significant beach erosion in Delaware was caused by this storm, as well as damages from winds and storm surge, Leathers said.\n\nHurricane Belle, 1976\n\nHurricane Belle paralleled the Delmarva coastline in early August, 1976, before making landfall on the south coast of Long Island. The entire coast from Georgia to Maine was under a hurricane watch during that time, NOAA archives show.\n\nThis storm significantly weakened before landfall, historical records show. Ocean City, Maryland, reported some of the highest wind gusts at 60 knots.\n\nThe National Hurricane Center reported considerable flooding from the event, largely due to widespread rainfall leading up to the event.

But there's been no state of emergency declared.\n\n\"It's looking better today than it did yesterday,\" said Delaware Emergency Management Agency spokesman Gary Lang. \"We're anticipating peripheral effects here in Delaware.\"\n\nStates of emergency are in effect in North and South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland. Delaware officials aren't anticipating the need for such a declaration this week.\n\nThe storm's expected southward turn reduced precipitation predictions in Delaware. On Tuesday, it was thought parts of Sussex County would get 2-4 inches. That was downgraded Wednesday to a statewide rainfall expectation of 1-2 inches after landfall.\n\nStorm surge is not expected to be heavy on Delaware's coast.\n\nHigh surf along Delaware beaches — and a potential for coastal flooding ahead of the storm — is related to a more persistent onshore flow caused by Florence, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Alex Staarmann, but it is not storm surge.\n\nAll but the most southern tip of the Delmarva Peninsula is outside the forecast tropical storm warning zone, and no part of it is contained in the hurricane warning zone.\n\nParts of Kent and all of Sussex counties are expected to see wind speed increases, as will New Castle County, but to a lesser extent.\n\nDEMA agents stayed in touch with local governments throughout Wednesday, but Lang said there hadn't been a need to activate state resources because the projection got better.\n\nStill, he cautioned against careless optimism.

Some weakening is expected on Thursday, but Florence will be an extremely dangerous hurricane when it lands, experts agree.\n\nAs the storm slows down off the coast, it could dump 20-30 inches of rain in some coastal areas, and some isolated 40-inch totals are expected throughout the storm.\n\n\"We here in North Carolina are bracing for a hard hit,\" North Carolina Gov.

A consent decree signed last month by Drummond Co. Inc., a coal mining and processing company that dates back to 1935, and the Black Warrior Riverkeeper in U.S. District Court will require the company to remediate the long-shuttered Maxine Mine site near the town of Praco. The consent decree calls for elimination of the discharges of acid, sediment, and toxic, heavy metals, among other pollutants, that have been flowing into the Locust Fork for decades. “The rulings in this case and the consent decree itself are critical to protecting the Black Warrior River from harmful legacy impacts of coal mining, and set a precedent for polluters throughout the state,” said a news release from Barry Brock, senior attorney for the Southern Environmental Law Center, which represented Black Warrior Riverkeeper in this case. The consent decree requires Drummond to pay $2.65 million in court costs and $1 million for a supplemental environmental project to mitigate the effects of past pollution, plus set aside funds to operate treatment systems for at least 30 years.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office has entered a contract with a former Dunleavy aide for up to $50,000 in part to advise the administration on what legal fights to pursue against the federal government. The contract with Strategic Synergies LLC was signed in April and released by Dunleavy’s office last week. Brett Huber is listed on the contract as the firm’s sole owner. The contract period is for April 25 through Oct. 24. Alaska has long had a contentious relationship with the federal government over lands and resource development and other issues. The state has a history of pushing back in areas where it thinks the federal government is overreaching. Huber was Dunleavy’s campaign manager in 2018 and an aide to Dunleavy following the Republican’s election. Huber went on the manage an unsuccessful campaign in 2020 against a voter initiative that ends party primaries and institutes ranked choice voting for general elections. He was brought back to the administration last year as a senior policy advisor for “statehood defense.” Huber left work in state government April 2, said Patty Sullivan, a Dunleavy spokesperson. She said the position Huber held within the administration “has not been filled, and existing staff cannot perform the unique work.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Cities across metro Phoenix have partnered with the Salt River Project to figure out how best to increase water storage on the Verde River. In the long run, the partners want to offset the declining capacity of Horseshoe Reservoir by raising the height of the Bartlett Dam, which sits about 20 miles downstream, to store that amount of water and then some. The SRP and 20 partners are working with the federal Bureau of Reclamation on the effort. The partnership is kicking off a four-year study into the feasibility of modifying the Bartlett Dam. Congress authorized the study last year, after a two-year-long SRP and Reclamation appraisal study, the Arizona Capitol Times reports. Ron Klawitter, a senior principal at SRP, said accumulating sediment at Horseshoe Reservoir has led to the loss of more than 45,749 acre-feet of water storage, about one-third of the reservoir’s original capacity. An acre foot contains 325,851 gallons. Exploring how to address that loss, the feasibility study will look at the impacts of raising the height of the 287-foot Bartlett Dam by between 62 feet and 97 feet. If the dam were raised by 97 feet, that would increase its capacity to 628,000-acre feet from its current 178,186 acre-feet.\n\nArkansas\n\nHuntsville: Ronnie Hawkins, a brash rockabilly star from Arkansas who became a patron of the Canadian music scene after moving north and recruiting a handful of local musicians later known as The Band, has died. His wife, Wanda, confirmed to The Canadian Press that Hawkins died Sunday morning after an illness. He was 87. “He went peacefully, and he looked as handsome as ever,” she said by telephone. Born just two days after Elvis Presley, the Huntsville native known to friends as “The Hawk” (he also nicknamed himself “The King of Rockabilly” and “Mr. Dynamo”) was a hell-raiser with a big jaw and a stocky build. He had minor hits in the 1950s with “Mary Lou” and “Odessa” and ran a club in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where acts included such early rock stars as Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis and Conway Twitty. Hawkins didn’t have the gifts of Presley or Perkins, but he did have ambition and an eye for talent. He first performed in Canada in the late ’50s and realized he would stand out far more in a country where homegrown rock still barely existed. Canadian musicians had often moved to the U.S. to advance their careers, but Hawkins was the rare American to try the reverse. With drummer and fellow Arkansan Levon Helm, Hawkins put together a Canadian backing group that became the Hawks, educated in the Hawkins school of rock. They hooked up with Bob Dylan in the mid-’60s and by the end of the decade were superstars on their own who had renamed themselves The Band.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state could soon ban the declawing of cats solely for the convenience of humans. Legislators advanced a bill last week to halt what animal rights activists say is a painful procedure used primarily to prevent torn furniture and scratched skin. Claws on cats grow from the bone, not skin. Removing them sometimes requires amputating bones, while other procedures sever tendons to prevent a cat from extending its claws. Animal rights activists have long said declawing is inhumane when done solely for the benefit of humans, arguing the procedure is painful, leaves the animal defenseless and can cause other health problems. The American Veterinary Medical Association “discourages declawing as an elective procedure,” saying it is not medically necessary in most cases. But the association says it is sometimes needed “when a cat’s excessive or inappropriate scratching behavior causes an unacceptable risk of injury or remains destructive.” The bill that passed the Assembly on Thursday would ban declawing except for a medically necessary purpose of addressing a recurring infection, disease, injury or abnormal condition that affects the cat’s health. The California Veterinary Medical Association wrote in a letter to lawmakers that the veterinary industry has “appropriately regulated itself regarding this procedure over the years, and continues to do so in a thoughtful and compassionate manner.”\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: Rescuers have recovered the body of a second victim after a boat carrying 13 people capsized on a lake over the Memorial Day holiday weekend. A Colorado Parks and Wildlife rescue team located the body Tuesday morning in 107 feet of water at Lake Pueblo State Park after an all-night search, the state agency said in a statement. The 11 others on the boat survived. The Pueblo County coroner plans to release the victim’s identity after next of kin are notified. The eight children and three adults were on the large, flat boat near a picnic area at Lake Pueblo State Park when witnesses reported high winds apparently overturned the boat Sunday evening. The second victim, 38-year-old Jessica Prindle, of the community of Pueblo West, died at the scene, the coroner’s office said. The survivors were treated for hyperthermia at hospitals, Colorado Parks and Wildlife said in a statement. Park manager Joe Stadterman said the accident “underscores the importance of being extremely careful around the water.” “If you are on or even near the water, we strongly urge you to wear a life jacket,” he said. Lake Pueblo is about 40 miles south of Colorado Springs.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The practice of exchanging cannabis or cannabis-related products for donations or other purchases – known as “gifting” – could now carry a heavy price tag in the state. Under legislation signed last week by Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont, towns can fine residents up to $1,000 for gifting a cannabis plant or related products. The state also has the authority to issue $1,000 fines for not paying state sales taxes on the exchanges. Unregulated cannabis bazaars have cropped up around the state since the drug was legalized last year. Thousands of people have attended the events, often paying a fee to be admitted, and exchanged cannabis-related products for other items or received them along with the purchase of an item such as a T-shirt. The Connecticut Post reports cannabis advocates say the bill penalizes people for doing something that’s now legal in the state. The legislation’s supporters say it still allows friends and family to gift cannabis as long as no money is exchanged.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The opening trial day in the criminal corruption case against the state auditor came to an abrupt halt Tuesday when the judge decided to give attorneys more time to consider issues raised by defense arguments that the indictment against Auditor Kathy McGuiness is defective. Judge William Carpenter Jr. ordered a halt to the proceedings after expressing concern about arguments made by defense attorney Steve Wood and the prosecution’s response to those arguments. Wood argued in a Wilmington courtroom that the indictment should be dismissed because it fails to allege where McGuiness’ supposed crimes occurred. Wood said venue regarding where an alleged offense occurred is among essential elements required by Delaware law in an indictment. McGuiness lives in Sussex County, and her office is in the capital, Dover, in Kent County, but prosecutors brought the case in New Castle County. “Nothing happened here,” said Wood, who rejected prosecution arguments that jurisdiction in New Castle County – or any county for that matter – is appropriate because McGuiness is a statewide elected official. Deputy Attorney General Maria Knoll argued the indictment is sufficient for trial because McGuiness serves all three counties, and her alleged crimes affected all three counties. The judge appeared skeptical of that argument.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: With signs in hand after traveling from afar, thousands of people made their way to see D.C.’s annual Memorial Day parade Monday afternoon – the first parade held since the pandemic began, WUSA-TV reports. Some families traveled from across the country to be in the city for the parade’s return and to pay a visit to monuments around town. Area bands were in full gear in the sweltering heat to honor the men and women who died in service to their country. Rick Johnson, a retired Marine who served for 22 years, said he hopes those who came out take time to understand the true meaning of the day. “We as Americans need to truly understand what being free is and what the American flag truly represents,” he said. A Virginia woman, who asked to only go by Marlene, said though she’s lived in Arlington for 20 years, this is the first time she was able to give her thanks in person and honor those who are no longer here. As the bands played familiar tunes, and veterans passed by, Chris Stockwell, an Army veteran, said he is thankful for those who chose America and choose it every day. “Not everybody goes out there and serves, but those that do, we need to show support for those people,” Stockwell said. “They go out there and give their all to this country.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: Detectives have arrested an 18-year-old man after receiving a tip that he threatened a mass shooting at a school in a social media post. Corey Anderson’s post showed him with a handgun, a rifle and a tactical-style vest along with a caption that said: “Hey Siri, directions to the nearest school,” Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a news release. Anderson was arrested at his home near Tampa on Sunday and charged with a written or electronic threat to conduct a mass shooting or act of terrorism. “This type of threat is unacceptable. This man intentionally instilled fear into our community as a sick joke, but be warned, this is no laughing matter,” Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a statement. The sheriff said his agency will “do everything within our power” to track down anyone who makes school threats. “Protecting our students is our greatest priority,” Chronister said in the release. “We take school threats very seriously, if you see something suspicious, please contact us immediately.” Deputies discovered that the weapons in the photo were airsoft guns, the news release said. Anderson was booked into jail and later released on bond, jail records show.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The district attorney of coastal Georgia’s largest county has become the latest prosecutor in the state to say she’ll generally stop prosecuting misdemeanor marijuana cases involving possession of less than an ounce of the drug. Like other prosecutors, police chiefs and sheriffs who have stopped marijuana enforcement, Chatham County District Attorney Shalena Cook Jones cited the Georgia Bureau of Investigation’s refusal to test for small amounts of marijuana unless other felony charges are involved. “Without a verified test, the state cannot prove that the accused violated the law,” Jones said in a statement. She also cited Georgia’s 2019 law that made hemp farming illegal, saying it’s hard to tell the difference between legal hemp and illegal marijuana. The change began immediately. Officials in other jurisdictions including the Atlanta suburbs of Cobb, DeKalb and Gwinnett counties, as well as Athens-Clarke County and Augusta-Richmond County, have made similar announcements since 2019. “Disposing of low-level petty offenses that do not threaten public safety and do not involve a victim allows the state to focus already-limited resources on the serious cases that do,” Jones said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The former head of the Hawaii National Guard has been chosen to be the city’s new police chief. The Honolulu Police Commission chose retired Army Maj. Gen. Arthur “Joe” Logan from among four finalists. Logan takes over from interim Chief Rade Vanic. Logan retired from the military in December 2019. Earlier in his career, he worked as a Honolulu police officer for 20 years. The department is still recovering from the 2019 conviction of former chief Louis Kealoha after he used his law enforcement power to frame his then-wife’s uncle for stealing their mailbox. He’s serving a seven-year federal prison sentence. His wife, a former city prosecutor, is serving 13 years. Logan said he was “just as surprised as anyone” by the decision, and his goal was to motivate, inspire and mentor people in the department. “I have to make myself available to the public to get their insights and answer their questions and concerns and show that the department ... is going to help them in what they would like in their community,” he told reporters after his selection. Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi congratulated Logan and said building back public trust and restoring morale within the department need to be top priorities.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Just under a third of the state’s registered voters cast ballots in the May 17 primary election, nearly matching the percentage that voted in the 2018 primary. Including new election-day voter registrations, 32.4% of registered voters cast ballots in the 2022 primary, the Idaho Press reports. That compares to 32.6% of registered voters who participated in the 2018 primary. In both of those primaries, there were hotly contested races for governor. Gubernatorial races normally guide turnout numbers, said former longtime Idaho Secretary of State Ben Ysursa. “If you get a third, 33%, that’d be a great turnout. That’s a sad commentary on our process,” Ysursa said, “especially when the whole ballgame’s in the primary.” Idaho is a strongly Republican state, and so the primary election is generally a strong predictor of the general election outcomes. Voter turnout in the state’s primary has been stagnant or declining for years since peaking in 1972 with more than 58% of registered voters casting ballots. Turnout was high that year because it was the first time residents between the ages of 18 and 20 were allowed to vote. “That was a big deal,” said Andy Brunelle, a retired Forest Service employee who worked for the state and tracked voter turnout as an editor for the Idaho Blue Book for many years, starting in the late 1970s.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An attempted murder charge has been filed after an attack on the “Walking Man,” a 75-year-old homeless man who over years has become a recognized figure in downtown Chicago. Joseph Kromelis was badly burned while resting on Lower Wabash Avenue last Wednesday and might not survive, Assistant State’s Attorney Danny Hanichak said. A 27-year-old man charged with attempted murder and aggravated arson was denied bond during a court hearing Monday, the Chicago Tribune reports. “This defendant did not target someone he got in an argument with, someone who wronged him or someone that he even knew,” Hanichak said. “This defendant decided to target the most vulnerable person possible: a 75-year-old homeless man sleeping on the street.” The man told police he poured gasoline on blankets without knowing Kromelis was under them, the prosecutor said. Kromelis has been the subject of news stories and a documentary. He once told the Tribune he roams around downtown “as a way of life.” In 2016, Kromelis was attacked with a bat. A GoFundMe account raised more than $32,000, though it was unclear at the time if he wanted the money, the Chicago Sun-Times reports.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Dozens of St. Vincent Health and Ascension Health workers in the state who were suspended without pay for not receiving the COVID-19 vaccine are asking a federal court to open a class-action lawsuit. The 64 workers claim the hospital network discriminated against them because they objected to the vaccine on religious grounds. “Ascension Health established a coercive process calculated to force healthcare workers and staff to abandon their religious objections to the COVID-19 vaccination and receive the vaccination against their will,” the lawsuit said. Ascension Health owns St. Vincent Health. In July 2021 Ascension Health announced a requirement that its associates had to get the COVID-19 vaccination by November. There are roughly 14,700 associates in Indiana. Ascension Health said in a July release that “tens of thousands” of its workers had already been inoculated. “But we must do more to overcome this pandemic as we provide safe environments for those we serve,” the release said. Like other hospital networks in Indiana, St. Vincent Health allowed workers to get an exemption for religious beliefs or medical conditions. But the 64 workers who filed the lawsuit Friday say St. Vincent Health and its parent company “failed to individually and properly assess each application for religious exemption.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: An invasive earthworm native to east Asia that was discovered in Iowa in 2018 has now spread to at least 11 counties. Officials in Dubuque and Muscatine counties were the first to report finding jumping worms, which are also known as crazy worms or Alabama jumpers due to their vigorous writhing and wriggling when disturbed. The snake-like worms can grow up to 8 inches long and are found amid leaf litter and closer to the soil surface than other earthworms commonly seen in Iowa. A map released in April by Iowa State University Extension and Outreach showed that the worms have now been found in Polk and Story counties, as well as Buchanan, Clayton, Jefferson, Johnson, Linn, Scott and Winneshiek. The ISU Extension website notes: “We assume jumping worms are much more widely spread than reports indicate.” ISU Extension said the worms, which have been infiltrating U.S. soil since the late 1800s, likely arrived in North America in potted plants, nursery stock or soil. They’re typically 3 to 5 inches long but are known to grow up to 8 inches. Jumping worms are darker and smoother than earthworms commonly found in Iowa. Identifiable characteristics include a cloudy-white and smooth narrow band; that band is raised on other earthworms. They do not produce an exterior layer of slime.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The recent bulldozing of a camp for homeless people has advocates arguing that Topeka should adopt more liberal policies modeled after ones in Kansas City, Missouri. Social worker Russell Burton and other advocates hope to raise the issue at the Topeka City Council’s meeting June 7, The Kansas City Star reports. Burton wants the city to require outreach workers to visit before a camp is bulldozed and to remain until city workers leave, something Kansas City mandates under a policy adopted in mid-April. He also wants to require the city to store people’s personal items for 60 days, as Kansas City does, twice the time set by Topeka’s policies. Topeka on May 10 razed an encampment just north of the Kansas River where more than a dozen people were living. Ken Saffer, a 57-year-old resident of the encampment on and off since 2017, said his belongings were confiscated, including clothing, tools and a generator. Others scrambled to collect medication and important documents. Spokesperson Gretchen Spiker said the city provided more than the required 72 hours notice before clearing the camp and followed its policies regarding belongings. She said the city “went above and beyond” to protect individuals’ constitutional rights.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: A new park that will allow public access to the Kentucky River is planned in Fayette County. The city plans to purchase 30 acres on the river near the Interstate 75 bridge into Madison County, Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton said in a statement. The city has signed an agreement, but the Urban County Council still needs to approve it. “This will provide new opportunities for recreation in Lexington. It will be a beautiful new park. And those who love kayaks and canoes will have a place to get onto the river and travel 12 miles between locks,” Gordon said. The $1.16 million cost for the property will come from fees developers pay to the city for the purpose of acquiring land for parks, officials said. Outdoor recreation has grown significantly in the past two years, and the park will establish a new kind of regional tourism with other river counties, said Mary Quinn Ramer, who is president of Lexington’s Convention and Visitors Bureau.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State and local governments and educational institutions could not require proof of vaccination against COVID-19 for entry into government facilities under legislation advanced by a state Senate committee Tuesday. The 4-2 vote sends the House-passed bill by Rep. Larry Bagley, R-Stonewall, to the full Senate. As it came out of the committee, the bill would subject any government or state-run educational institution to civil penalties if it requires COVID-19 vaccinations for entry. Backers say government entities shouldn’t be asking about a person’s health status. Opponents of the bill said they didn’t want local governments subjected to civil fines for trying to prevent the spread of the disease. The bill would not apply to government health care facilities that would risk losing federal funding under any federal requirements for vaccines. It passed the House last month on a 59-26 vote. If approved by the Senate, it would go back to the House for approval of Senate amendment. The deadline for final adjournment of the legislative session is Monday at 6 p.m.\n\nMaine\n\nWaterville: The Maine Attorney General’s Office has ruled that the fatal shooting of a man by police last year was justified. Waterville police responded in February 2021 to reports of Eric Porter, 32, armed with a knife and threatening people outside a hotel. The attorney general’s office said Friday in a report about the shooting that police ordered Porter to drop the knife and surrender when he charged at an officer with the weapon. Another officer shot and killed Porter, the attorney general’s report said. The report said officers tried using PepperBall launchers at Porter to no effect, and an electroshock weapon also didn’t subdue Porter because of his thick winter coat. Attorney General Aaron Frey wrote in the report that the officer who shot and killed Porter believed his colleague “would have been seriously injured or killed had he not shot Mr. Porter.”\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: Thanks to the preservation of an early 19th-century plat, residents can soon see for themselves how the town – founded by Jonathan Hager in the 1760s – began to blossom in the years after the American Revolution, the Herald-Mail reports. After nearly two years in the hands of an expert document conservator, the plat and other documents – including a rare copy of Gen. Robert E. Lee’s proclamation to Marylanders in the days preceding the Battle of Antietam – are finally home with the Washington County Historical Society. Plans are to keep the delicate originals stored and preserved but to display copies for everyone to see. “My best guess is the plat plan was generated in the early 1800s,” said society President Bill Maharay. “It descended through the Hager family; it’s on vellum, and it shows the development of Hagerstown through various growth patterns.” This plat shows where the town was expanding as it developed. “And it’s not done in an orderly fashion,” Maharay said. “What I find most interesting is the water source for the town was the stream that starts up over by where the post office is. It’s now all underground, but it shows that stream pattern. And then the area on North Potomac where it rises up past Franklin was called the ‘healthy’ part of town because of sanitation.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Firefighters battling a huge fire in the grandstand of a Boston horse racing track were hampered by a limited water supply and had to use thousands of feet of hose, officials said. There were no reports of injuries in the fire at Suffolk Downs that was reported about 10 p.m. Monday. The fire was knocked down by about 2 a.m. Tuesday, but crews remained on site to put out hot spots, the Boston Fire Department said in a tweet. Suffolk Downs, which first opened in 1935, has not had live racing since July 2019, but the grandstand remained open for simulcasting. The fire was first seen in the old press box on the roof, according to a statement from HYM Investment Group, which is redeveloping the site, but the cause remains under investigation. Boston firefighters were aided by several other area departments. The 161-acre site partially in Revere is being redeveloped into a mix of housing, retail, hotel, office and lab space. “The fire did not impact the area of Suffolk Downs currently under construction and redevelopment of the site remains ongoing,” HYM said in its statement.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Any summer plans for late-night scooting through downtown Detroit have been thwarted by a new curfew established by city officials. The curfew, first reported by Outlier Media, applies to rentable electric scooters in Detroit’s Central Business District, bordered by the John C. Lodge Freeway, Interstate 75, Interstate 375 and the Detroit River. In cooperation with scooter operators, scooters will be shut down in this area between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays. The curfew was announced by the Detroit Police Department during a press conference addressing summer safety efforts, including increased patrolling in Greektown and drag racing restrictions. Electric scooters operating in Detroit include Lime, Bird, Spin, LINK scooters operated by Superpedestrian and Boaz Bikes. During the curfew and within the designated area, enforcement by the operators varies, but some scooters will operate at reduced speeds or allow riders to finish their already activated trips. The city has not determined when the summer curfew will end, Outlier reports.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The City Council has approved $1.2 million in legal settlements with two people injured by police during protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of officers two years ago. The settlements with St. Paul resident Virgil Lee Jackson Jr. and Nashville freelance photographer Linda Tirado mean the city has agreed to pay a total of $5.4 million to settle federal civil rights lawsuits over injuries caused by police in May 2020, Minnesota Public Radio reports. The City Council approved the two settlements Thursday. The council agreed to pay Jackson $645,000. His lawsuit said that a Minneapolis police officer repeatedly shocked him using a Taser’s “drive stun” mode, pressing the electrodes directly onto his skin. He was in a parking lot at the time. Tirado lost the sight in her left eye after an officer fired a rubber bullet while she covered protests outside a police station. The City Council agreed to pay her $600,000. Floyd, 46, who was Black, died after then-Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, pinned his knee on Floyd’s neck for 91/ 2 minutes as Floyd was handcuffed and pleaded that he couldn’t breathe. Chauvin was sentenced to 221/ 2 years in prison for murder and manslaughter.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A federal judge on Tuesday dismissed a lawsuit accusing the state of using a discriminatory proof-of-citizenship requirement for some new voters under a law dating back to the Jim Crow era. The dismissal came weeks after Mississippi repealed a 1924 law that required naturalized citizens – but not people born in the U.S. – to provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote. A new law enacted in its place has also drawn opposition but is being grudgingly accepted by voting rights groups who say it ultimately should protect naturalized citizens from being incorrectly marked as noncitizens when they register to vote. The secretary of state had been running names of potential new voters through a state Department of Public Safety database of people with Mississippi driver’s licenses and identification cards. Voting rights advocates said this practice disproportionately hurt people of color by flagging them as possible noncitizens. The new law says that if the public safety database raises questions about citizenship, the potential new voter’s name must be run through a federal immigration database. Groups that advocate for voting rights and immigrants’ rights said the federal database provides a safeguard to protect naturalized citizens from being incorrectly marked as noncitizens when they register to vote.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A federal judge has ordered St. Louis County to pay $300,000 to two people who sued after police barged into their home six years ago with guns drawn and without a warrant. A final judgment in the case was entered Thursday against the county, ordering it to pay Jon Luer and Andrea Steinebach for damages stemming from the home intrusion, the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri said in a news release. The ACLU said Luer and Steinebach were awoken about 3 a.m. July 10, 2016, to find armed officers in their hallway searching for a suspect who had skipped out on cab fare. The two officers interrogated the couple’s teenage son and searched his room. The officers left after deciding he was not the suspect but did not file an incident report about their contact with the family, the ACLU said. “Our family is still haunted by the illegal middle-of-the-night invasion of our home by the very people that are supposed to protect us,” Steinebach said in a statement. Last year, the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the family’s lawsuit could proceed, calling police actions in the case a “severe, warrantless intrusion.” A police spokeswoman referred questions to the St. Louis County Counselor’s Office, which did not immediately return a phone message seeking comment.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: The state’s top schools administrator has been cited in the case of a vehicle illegally passing a stopped school bus last month. Superintendent of Public Instruction Elsie Arntzen was cited Thursday after speaking with an officer, Helena Police Lt. Jayson Zander said. According to a police report, a school bus driver said a truck driven by Arntzen passed his bus while it was stopped to pick up children just after 7:30 a.m. May 19 in a Helena subdivision. The bus driver recognized Arntzen and recorded the license plate number on the red pickup truck, the police report said. A video of the incident reportedly “does not show the license plate of the vehicle involved,” Arntzen’s office said in a statement Friday. “Superintendent Arntzen does not recall the alleged incident,” Brian O’Leary, spokesman for the Office of Public Instruction, said in a statement Thursday. “She does acknowledge she drives a red pickup and lives in the area.” Montana’s 2021 Legislature passed a bill to improve bus safety after a student in northwestern Montana was hit and critically injured by a driver who passed a stopped bus in November 2019. Arntzen testified during a February 2021 legislative committee hearing in support of the bill, which doubled the fine for illegally passing a school bus to a maximum of $1,000.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A large fire that raged through a chemical plant was extinguished by Tuesday morning, and nearby residents who were initially evacuated were allowed to return to their homes, authorities said. Thick smoke billowing from the Nox-Crete facility just southwest of downtown Omaha could be seen as far away Monday evening as the Elkhorn River, about 20 miles to the west. Battalion Chief Scott Fitzpatrick said the first call for help came shortly before 7 p.m. Monday, and firefighters who initially entered the building found a much bigger fire than they had anticipated, forcing them to retreat. Fire crews then fought the blaze from outside the building, noting the presence of chemicals and propane bottles inside. Explosions could be seen and heard as propane tanks ruptured. No injuries were reported from the fire or explosions. Officials said the smoke posed no major toxicity risks to the public. The cause of the fire wasn’t immediately known. According to its website, Nox-Crete makes a chemical coating and deactivator that keeps curing concrete from bonding to forms. It also makes liquid floor hardeners, joint fillers, curing and sealing compounds, and water repellents.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The federal Bureau of Land Management is collecting public comment until Wednesday on a big north-south electricity transmission project that Nevada’s main utility, NV Energy, says is a key to its plan for a statewide renewable energy network. The project, dubbed Greenlink West, would stretch about 350 miles to connect electricity facilities near Las Vegas in southern Nevada and Yerington in the north by the end of 2026. It would generally run parallel to and east of the California state line. Conservationists and protesters say they do not want to see that much public land disturbed, and members of a tribe adjacent to the route say the transmission lines would adversely affect culturally significant land. Barbara Durham, tribal historic preservation officer for the Timbisha Shoshone Tribe, told the Las Vegas Sun that disturbed areas could include former village sites and areas where tribal ancestors found food and traded objects. Timbisha Shoshone homelands are in Nevada’s Nye, Mineral and Esmeralda counties and California’s Inyo, Kern, San Bernardino and Mono counties. “We would prefer that they go through already existing areas that have been disturbed,” Durham said. “No matter which way they go, they’re going to find the same thing.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampton: Fireworks shows at a popular beach were canceled for Memorial Day weekend and put on hold for several weeks because endangered piping plovers are nesting there. Local officials hope they can still have fireworks on the Fourth of July at Hampton Beach, which is close to the Massachusetts border. Hampton Beach Village District Chairman Chuck Rage said two nests were found on the beach. Piping plovers are endangered in New Hampshire and threatened nationally. The New Hampshire Fish and Game Endangered Wildlife Program has been monitoring and protecting breeding piping plovers and their habitat on the seacoast since 1997. The sighting of endangered piping plovers prompted officials to cancel fireworks shows at the beginning of the summer season at Hampton Beach last year, too. The small birds nest in the sandy dunes at Hampton and Seabrook beaches. The number of nests is expected to reach a new record in the state this year, with 16 in total, according to the New Hampshire Fish and Game Department. The fireworks shows will resume when the eggs hatch and the plovers abandon their nests on the beach, which could take about a month.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewton: Paddlers who want to camp overnight along the Delaware River within a national recreation area must now have a reservation and pay a fee. An increase in visitors to the area who choose to stay overnight has prompted the move. The 62 primitive river campsites within Delaware Water Gap National Recreation Area will cost $16 per site, per night. Starting in 2015, the park piloted a similar system for six of the sites known as Alosa. This new change brings all river campsites under that system. “Falling asleep and waking up at a primitive boat-in campsite along the banks of a nationally designated scenic and recreational river is a unique and special experience, particularly within one of the most densely populated areas of the country,” said Elizabeth Winslow, fee program manager. Because the Water Gap is part of the National Park Service, the recent announcement by New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy that entrance fees at state parks are being lifted this summer does not apply. The Water Gap does not charge an entrance fee but does have several areas, such as boat launches and beaches, which have user fees. Winslow said there are several concerns about the primitive sites, such as flooding, resource protection and operational issues, that have reduced the number of official river campsites in the past 20 years.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: As nearly 3,000 firefighters in northern New Mexico continued to battle the nation’s largest active wildfire Monday, federal forest officials worried about future flash floods, landslides and destructive ash from the burn scar. The nearly 8-week-old fire was surrounded by containment lines cut and scraped around half of of its perimeter, enclosing 493 square miles of forested mountains and foothills east of Santa Fe. A Forest Service Burned Area Emergency Response team has started publishing data from its post-fire assessments. Micah Kiesow, team leader and a soil and watershed program manager with the Santa Fe National Forest, said steep mountain slopes had acted like a sponge before the fire. “Post-fire in some of these areas, especially the high soil burn severity areas and the moderate, we’re looking at now a steep slope that’s more like a parking lot,” Kiesow told the Santa Fe New Mexican. He said that could signal an “extreme change in watershed response” during monsoon season. Flooding presents another problem for communities near burn scars with ash flowing into rivers and streams, according to Kiesow. Many water treatment facilities aren’t equipped for the expensive, time-intensive process of filtering ash. Experts say ash and debris can harm water quality with high levels of nitrates and phosphorus.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A black bear wandered into the city, climbed a tree several blocks from the state Capitol and rested on branches about 30 feet off the ground Tuesday before workers tranquilized the animal and caught it in a net. The bear plunged into the net in the early afternoon after a state wildlife crew used a fire department ladder truck to get in close to immobilize the animal. The bear had climbed a towering pine tree on the edge of Washington Park in a residential neighborhood about a half-mile from the Capitol. The sprawling park is in the center of Albany, hemmed in by busy streets and surrounded by commercial strips and city neighborhoods of brownstones and single-family homes. Albany police tweeted out several pictures of bear in the tree, including one in which the animal looked like it was taking a nap. Police said the bear would be medically evaluated before being released into a forested area of the Catskills, south of the city. Police closed off the street off for a few hours as the state Department of Environmental Conservation crew worked to get the bear safely out of the tree.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Republican legislation that supporters argue would give parents more say over their children’s public schooling and health – but that critics say would intimidate and harm LGBTQ youth – headed to the state Senate floor after another affirmative committee vote Tuesday. The “Parents’ Bill of Rights” legislation includes a provision that would prevent instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in public school curricula for kindergarten through third grade. Schools would have to notify parents about changes to their child’s health and services that they are receiving, such as psychological treatment, or before they could change a child’s name or pronouns in records. LGBTQ activists likened these provisions to those in a Florida law opponents dubbed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill. Several urged GOP lawmakers Tuesday to stop the measure, saying more young people would have their sexuality revealed against their will. Other youth will keep their sexuality hidden, increasing further the threat of suicide, opponents said. “This bill proposes forced outing of queer kids,” said the Rev. Vance Haywood, senior pastor of St. John’s Metropolitan Community Church in Raleigh. “It’s creating an environment where we’re telling folks that it’s not OK to be yourself. You have to hide parts of who you are.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The longest-serving member of the state Senate declined to comment Tuesday on whether he’s the subject of an ongoing investigation following a report that he’d traded scores of text messages with a man jailed on child pornography charges. Republican Sen. Ray Holmberg had previously announced plans to resign Wednesday, six months before the end of his term. “There is a time,” Holmberg told the Associated Press on Tuesday when asked about why he was abruptly ending his 46-year career. Police and federal agents in Grand Forks seized video discs and other items from Holmberg’s home in November. “The rain will stop one of these days, and things will go on,” he said, declining to elaborate. Homberg said he planned on attending a luncheon with some current and former lawmakers Tuesday. He plans on turning in his state-issued computer and legislative credentials that include access to the state Capitol on Wednesday. Holmberg has been one of the Legislature’s most powerful lawmakers for decades, serving as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. Four times, he chaired the Legislative Management committee, which decides committee assignments and chooses study topics that often inspire legislation.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohio students would have to take a self-defense class to graduate from high school if a bill introduced Tuesday by two Republicans in the state House becomes law. “Young women between the ages of 16-19 are the most vulnerable to be sexually assaulted,” Rep. Tom Young, R-Washington Township, said in a statement. “This training will also provide opportunity for development of relationships between students and their local law enforcement and school resource officers.” Called the Student Protection Act, House Bill 639 would require incoming freshmen in public and private schools to complete self-defense training as part of their health education starting in the 2023-2024 academic year. The instructors would have to be school resource officers or certified self-defense instructors. “Physical, emotional or sexual abuse and assault are never okay. These behaviors should never be tolerated or go unreported,” Rep. Andrea White, R-Kettering, said in a statement. “Reinforcing this message with our young people, while equipping them with defensive tactics and proactive strategies will help them protect themselves and avoid dangerous situations.” She added that self-defense training could also help students identify early signs and symptoms of mental health issues and potentially aggressive behavior in their peers. Young said the bill has been in the works for months, and the timing of its introduction soon after a mass shooting at a school in Uvalde, Texas, was coincidental.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s cannabis regulator was busy last week working on final implementation of a “seed-to-sale” tracking system, the latest major update as it prepares to be reformed as a stand-alone agency this fall. The changes represent a watershed moment for the Oklahoma Medical Marijuana Authority in its nearly four-year history. After launching in 2018, the agency struggled to keep up with the exploding industry that quickly boasted more dispensaries than any other state in the country and has been plagued with black market activity, while also supporting over 380,000 licensed cardholders who regularly purchase more than $64 million of medical cannabis products monthly. Now under the guidance of its fourth executive director, the agency continues to expand its personnel and oversight duties. Seed-to-sale, which went into effect Thursday, means every product sold to a consumer should theoretically be traceable back to its literal roots – a capability officials claim will create a safer and more legitimate industry. The marijuana authority’s independence from its current place in the state Health Department won’t happen until Nov. 1, but work is already happening to hire its own personnel to handle administrative positions, human resources and payroll.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: Officials in Clackamas County said Tuesday that they have finished duplicating the majority of primary election ballots that were rejected by vote-counting machines because of a printing error that resulted in blurred barcodes on tens of thousands of ballots. Elections officials were forced to transfer the voter’s intent from a spoiled ballot to a fresh one that could be read by the machines. The county will now focus on counting military and overseas ballots and processing ballots that need voter signature resolution, elections officials said in a news statement. Elections officials expect to finish tallying the vote by the end of the week and to certify all election results by June 13, the state’s deadline.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: On Roosevelt Boulevard, where 10% to 13% of the city’s traffic fatalities happened each year prior to the pandemic, plans to redesign the city’s “corridor of death” – as some residents and safety advocates call Roosevelt – could be gaining traction. Studies show Black communities have been hit even harder by a national surge in traffic fatalities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Roosevelt Boulevard is a chaotic, almost 14-mile maze that passes through some of the city’s most diverse neighborhoods and census tracts with the highest poverty rates. Driving can be dangerous, but biking or walking can be even worse, with some crosswalks longer than a football field and taking four light cycles to cross. “You would not design a street or a road like that today,” said Christopher Puchalsky, policy director for Philadelphia’s Office of Transportation, Infrastructure and Sustainability. “It feels like an expressway, but it’s in the middle and between neighborhoods.” The city is hoping for federal money to begin a long-term, billion-dollar redesign of Roosevelt outlined in a study released in 2019, as well as to fund a series of smaller projects to improve safety at high-fatality stretches on the road by 2025.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Dan McKee, the Rhode Island State Police and the state Department of Education have asked every school district to complete a comprehensive survey of potential emergency hazards. The effort, announced at the State House on Tuesday, is aimed at identifying potential school safety issues and addressing any necessary repairs or upgrades. Through the School Building Authority, the Department of Education will approve up to $500,000 in emergency funds for each district to make additional security upgrades. They will be reimbursed once the work is completed. Approximately $25 million is available statewide. McKee said the country is still processing the mass school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, in which 19 children and two teachers were killed by a lone gunman. Since then, he said, there have been 12 new mass shootings across the nation. “No one thing alone will end gun violence,” McKee said. Limiting high-capacity magazines and banning assault weapons will help reduce that risk, he said. “The safety of our children must be the highest priority,” the Democrat said. Every school superintendent will conduct walkthroughs of buildings, including reviews of doors and windows, car access, landscape features, lighting, alarm and camera systems, and communications systems.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With hurricane season officially starting Wednesday, state emergency officials want residents to prepare. Gov. Henry McMaster proclaimed Hurricane Preparedness Week began Sunday. The South Carolina Emergency Management Division is emphasizing this year that people know their evacuation zone, how to prepare their home to ride out a storm and what highways they need to take to evacuate with the slogan “Know Your Zone, Prepare Your Home, Remember Your Route.” Preparing a home not only includes checking hurricane shutters and roofs but also making sure to have the right kind and right amount of insurance, the agency said. And it’s not just coastal homes that need preparation. Recent hurricanes to hit South Carolina have brought massive floods inland and can also bring tornadoes and high winds well away from the coast. Health officials said residents should also make sure their COVID-19 boosters and vaccinations are up to date and include masks and other disease-fighting items in their hurricane kits in case they need to evacuate to areas where there is high spread of disease. Four hurricanes have directly or indirectly impacted South Carolina in the past six years. Meteorologists are predicting an above-average number of hurricanes and tropical storms this year.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Republican candidates in state House races are raking in unprecedented amounts of campaign cash ahead of next week’s primary election. And a handful of ultra-competitive contests in the Sioux Falls area are driving that trend. A review of campaign finance reports filed this week by dozens of state House candidates in legislative primary races statewide found that dozens have brought in tens of thousands of dollars ahead of the June 7 election. And of the 10 candidates reporting the highest fundraising totals, more than half are seeking office in Sioux Falls or the surrounding area. Three of the top seven fundraisers come from a single contest that could tip the scales in an intra-party power struggled that’s pitted two factions of the state GOP against each other.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: After years of a stalemate, the Shelby County Commission is once again poised to consider funding new voting machines. County commissioners have in the past voted down a similar arrangement, voicing support for hand-marked paper ballots over ballot marking devices. If approved, the agreement would spend $5.8 million on new machines from vendor Election Systems & Software LLC, known as ES&S, having the equipment fully operational by the August 2022 general election; $2.4 million of those funds would be reimbursable by the State of Tennessee. “We are at risk for the election that’s coming up in August, so that’s why we’re trying to move forward with having a process by which hopefully having this new equipment will achieve the outcome that it’s intended for,” said Shelby County Commission Chairman Willie Brooks Jr. Voters would then be able to choose at the polls between a paper ballot and an electronic ballot. The ballot marking machines will not allow voters to overvote and are accessible for voters with disabilities. The machine used to count votes can tabulate both printouts from the ballot marking machines and paper ballots that have been filled out by hand. It will also catch if someone has overvoted on a paper ballot, asking the voter if they want to move forward.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Officials are warning beachgoers to stay away from an overly friendly dolphin off North Padre Island. The marine mammal has gotten a bit pushy in the water off the island about 20 miles east of Corpus Christi, according to a press release from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “Biologists report the animal is showing more aggressive behavior, separating children from their parents in the water, and isolating swimming pets from their owners,” the release said. The problem is that people have been feeding, swimming and playing with the dolphin for more than a year despite warnings from biologists, law enforcement and residents to stay away from it, according to the release. It said the dolphin “has become so used to humans that it now seeks out people, boats, and any form of interaction.” The mammal also has wounds caused by boats, and there are concerns about its safety, officials said. People are being asked to leave the dolphin alone. Boaters are asked to avoid stopping if the dolphin comes too close and to slowly move away. Swimmers are being asked to leave the water if they see the dolphin, the release said. “While the dolphin may seem friendly, this is a wild animal with unpredictable behavior,” according to NOAA.\n\nUtah\n\nMonument Valley: Federal officials signed an agreement with leaders of the Navajo Nation on Friday that provides funding for clean drinking water infrastructure for reservation residents and resolves questions about long-standing Navajo claims to water rights in the drought-stricken U.S. West. The signing formalizes the Utah Navajo Water Rights Settlement, which became law in 2020 as part of President Joe Biden’s bipartisan infrastructure bill. As part of the agreement, the federal government will pay the Navajo Nation $210 million for drinking water infrastructure in San Juan County – the part of the 27,000-square-mile reservation that lies in Utah. Many Navajo homes lack running water. Residents often fill containers at public taps or rely on water deliveries from volunteer organizations. Utah, which was also party to the agreement, will pay the Navajo $8 million as part of the settlement. “We had two real problems in our state. One was the Navajo Nation had claims to the Colorado (River) that would impair Utah’s water rights,” U.S. Sen. Mitt Romney told The Salt Lake Tribune. “The other concern we had was about half the Navajo Nation residents (in Utah) didn’t have running water.” The settlement also quantifies the Navajo Nation’s water rights, quelling Utah’s anxieties.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The Vermont City Marathon and Relay returned to the city Sunday, after being canceled or shortened the past three years amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The race started at Battery Park. To prevent a crowded start, there were waves of marathoners taking off at different times, and they looped the half-marathon course twice. More than 2,300 runners signed up for the marathon, while 11 people were expected to participate in the handcycle competition. In the relay, a total of 550 two-person teams and 434 squads of three to five people signed up. Veteran handcyclist Alicia Dana of Putney, Vermont, was first across the finish line, and Sergio Reyes, 40, followed as the first marathoner to complete the course. The Palmdale, California, resident also won the men’s race in 2019. Annemarie Tuxbury, 28, a native Rhode Islander, won the women’s race.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Authorities said two women were missing Tuesday after a group of people in rafts and on paddleboards went over the Bosher Dam on the James River a day earlier. WWBT-TV reports 12 people were involved in the accident Monday afternoon. WAVY-TV reports the dam has a 12-foot drop, and water levels have been high. Images of the search show the river seemingly placid above the dam but roiling below, with some of the group’s paddleboards and inflatable rafts caught in the currents below the rush of water. One of them managed to reach a nearby house for help. Assistant Fire Chief Jeffrey Segal said kayakers in the area helped to rescue nine more. But Segal said two women were unaccounted for despite a very thorough search. Crews searched for the two women until dusk, and the search resumed Tuesday morning, Henrico County police said in a news release. Police said they have worked with friends and families of Lauren E. Winstead, 23, of Henrico County, and Sarah E. Erway, 28, of Chesterfield County, listing them as missing. Police warned that the river is at dangerous levels in some areas and that anyone entering the river should be extremely cautious.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: A cougar attacked a 9-year-old girl who was playing hide-and-seek at a church camp, seriously wounding her and sending her friends running in fear. Lily A. Kryzhanivskyy and two other children were playing in the woods Saturday at the camp near the small town of Fruitland, northwest of Spokane. Lily jumped out to surprise her friends when the cougar attacked, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said. Adults rushed to help and found the girl covered in blood. She was airlifted to a hospital, where she had surgery for multiple wounds to her head and upper body. Lily was released from the intensive care unit Monday and remained hospitalized in stable condition, the department said Tuesday. Following the attack, adults staying at the church camp found the young male cougar and killed it. “We are extremely thankful for this little girl’s resiliency, and we’re impressed with her spunk in the face of this unfortunate encounter,” Fish and Wildlife Police Capt. Mike Sprecher said. “It happened fast, and we are thankful that the adults at the camp responded so quickly.” Tests completed over the weekend showed the animal did not have rabies, the agency said. Cougar attacks on humans are rare. There have been just two fatal attacks on humans in Washington state in the past 100 years.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nAlum Creek: Guided hikes, exhibits and interactive programming will greet guests during the weekend’s grand opening of the Claudia L. Workman Wildlife Education Center, officials said. The event Saturday is being hosted by the West Virginia Division of Natural Resources and the Forks of Coal State Natural Area Foundation. Those who attend the free event in Alum Creek can tour the 9,500-square-foot building, explore the 102-acre property and attend shows presented by the West Virginia Raptor Rehab Center, the Division of Natural Resources said in a statement. “We’re looking forward to having everyone come out and experience all that we have to offer, including ‘Touch a Snake’ and ‘Bird ID’ activities,” said Ashley Anderson, the agency’s park activities coordinator. The opening fulfills the vision of the center’s namesake, Claudia Workman, whose husband donated the land in 2015 so a nature-based education center could be built. The center has five main areas that include an introduction to Forks of Coal State Natural Area, an aquarium and reptile exhibit, a wildlife management area, a habitat management area and a wildlife observation area. It will be open Tuesday through Saturday beginning June 7.\n\nWisconsin\n\nOshkosh: The judge presiding over a case involving a violent altercation in a Wisconsin high school postponed the trial after defense attorneys argued that public sentiment related to the school shootings in Texas could taint the jury pool. Grant Fuhrman, accused of stabbing a high school resource officer multiple times with a barbecue fork in Oshkosh in 2019, is charged with attempted first-degree intentional homicide, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. The 19-year-old man has pleaded not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect. During a struggle, the officer shot the then-16-year-old student. Neither of them was seriously injured, and the officer was cleared of wrongdoing. Fuhrman’s attorneys filed a motion to delay last week, four days after an 18-year-old entered an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, and fatally shot 19 children and two teachers. The defense said their client could not get a fair trial in the current environment. The request said the Texas case would have been on the minds of every potential juror if the interview process had started Tuesday as scheduled. “The length of time between the outside influence and the trial is critical. Here that time frame is mere days,” the motion said. Judge Daniel Bissett granted the delay and scheduled a status hearing for July 7.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A record haul in super PAC spending has poured into the race for the state’s sole U.S. House seat this year, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. More than $1 million has been reported to federal officials in such spending, with much of it aimed at unseating Rep. Liz Cheney, who angered many other Republicans with her stance against ex-President Donald Trump for his role in the deadly insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The spending total by independent expenditure-only political committees has already more than doubled Wyoming’s previous record, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/13/new-water-crisis-drag-show-threats-nurses-strike-news-around-states/50730699/", "title": "New water crisis, drag show threats: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Toforest Johnson, 49, has spent half his life on death row for the murder of a sheriff’s deputy, a killing he says he did not commit. Johnson’s attorneys asked the Alabama Supreme Court on Friday to “right a grievous wrong” and grant him a new trial. The filing is the latest effort in a case that has seen former judges, prosecutors and the local district attorney join in calls to reexamine the 1998 conviction and death sentence. Johnson’s attorneys are asking the justices to review a lower court decision denying the new trial request. They argued that the conviction rested on the testimony of a single witness who was paid a reward and that her testimony “was at odds with the physical evidence and directly contradicted by the state’s theory of the case in other proceedings.” Johnson was convicted and sentenced to death for the killing of Jefferson County Deputy Sheriff William Hardy, who was shot twice in the head while working off-duty security at a hotel in 1995. The conviction came after Johnson’s first trial ended with a hung jury. A co-defendant in the case was acquitted. Former Alabama Attorney General Bill Baxley, former Chief Justice Drayton Nabers, and several former judges and prosecutors submitted briefs to the circuit court or wrote editorials supporting a new trial for Johnson. Danny Carr, the district attorney in the county where Johnson was convicted, also called for a new trial.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Lance Mackey, one of mushing’s most colorful and accomplished champions, has died. The four-time Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race winner died Wednesday from cancer, his father and kennel announced on Facebook. He was 52. Officials with the world’s most famous sled dog race said Iditarod Nation was in mourning. “Lance embodied the spirit of the race, the tenacity of an Alaskan musher, displayed the ultimate show of perseverance and was loved by his fans,” officials said in a statement. The son of 1978 Iditarod champion Dick Mackey and brother of 1983 champion Rick Mackey, Lance Mackey overcame throat cancer in 2001 to win an unprecedented four straight Iditarod championships, from 2007 through 2010. It wasn’t just the 1,000-mile race across Alaska where he excelled. During his Iditarod run, twice he also won the 1,000-mile Yukon Quest International Sled Dog Race between Canada and Alaska with only two weeks’ rest between races. But after the string of wins, he was beset by personal problems, health scares and drug issues that prevented him from ever again reaching the top of the sport. The treatment for his throat cancer cost him his saliva glands and ultimately disintegrated his teeth. He was then diagnosed with Raynaud’s syndrome, which limits circulation to the hands and feet and is exacerbated by the cold weather with which every musher must contend in the wilds of Alaska.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Democrat Katie Hobbs’ campaign announced Sunday that she would not debate Republican Kari Lake as the two battle for the governor’s office, calling off any negotiations with Lake and the state commission overseeing debates. The decision came after more than a week of efforts by Hobbs, currently secretary of state, to change the debate into separate half-hour interviews with the moderator. The Citizens Clean Elections Commission, which has held debates for two decades featuring candidates for statewide and legislative offices, flatly rejected that proposal Thursday. Instead, the commission urged its staff to work with Hobbs to come up with minor changes to the debate and gave her a week to come to an agreement. Hobbs’ campaign manager’s statements to the commissioners made it seem unlikely that a deal could be reached. Nicole DeMont instead repeated the campaign’s concerns that debating Lake would “just create another spectacle, like we saw in the GOP primary debate. But on top of that, I would just add, you can’t debate a conspiracy theorist, and at the last debate, she brought the conversation back to the 2020 election no less than a dozen times.” The GOP primary debate featured four candidates who almost immediately devolved into a free-for-all of talking over and constantly interrupting each other.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: The University of Arkansas-Fort Smith plans to use the donation of $18.7million, the largest in the school’s history, to improve both its nursing and art and design programs. The Windgate Foundation awarded UAFS the money after much discussion and a grant proposal requesting money to draw more students to those two fields. The $9.9 million reserved for nursing will bring in new students and faculty. After speaking with the Fort Smith medical community, Paula Julian, the executive director of nursing, said the area needs double the number of nurses it has. “This is the greatest nursing shortage of our lifetime,” Julian said. For nursing, officials have divided the money into two phases. In the first, Julian expects to hire more than 20 nursing educators. The second phase creates two new degrees, the associate degree of nursing and the RN-to-BSN pathway. Julian said that along with these new degrees, the school will offer classes at nontraditional hours such as evenings and weekends. The other $8.8 million of the gift is dedicated to art and design. Construction will begin next year on an expansion to the Windgate Building, with the new square footage to be partly used as studio space for faculty and students. The department will also expand the number of classes it offers, such as adding ceramics.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: An arson investigation is underway after fire destroyed a historic church in South Los Angeles early Sunday, authorities said. The blaze at Victory Baptist Church broke out shortly before 2:30 a.m. and quickly grew to major emergency status, said Nicholas Prange, a spokesperson with the Los Angeles Fire Department. Two firefighters were hospitalized with mild to moderate injuries after battling the flames, Prange said. One became trapped by a collapsing ceiling before being rescued, he said. The Los Angeles Times said Victory Baptist has played a major role in the spiritual and political history of South LA. Founded in a local storefront on Easter Sunday in 1943, the church moved into its current building on McKinley Avenue a year later. In the 1950s, its Sunday night services were broadcast on television nationally. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. spoke at the church in 1964. An arson team with the House of Worship Task Force was part of the investigation, officials said.\n\nColorado\n\nArvada: Authorities have arrested a suburban Denver man on suspicion of first-degree murder and other charges in the death of a 27-year-old police officer who was fatally shot while trying to break up a large family disturbance over the weekend. Sonny Thomas Almanza, 31, of Arvada, was arrested by police late Sunday in connection with the shooting death of Arvada Officer Dillon Vakoff, police said in a statement released Monday. Vakoff died at a hospital Sunday after being shot while he and another officer responded to the disturbance that spilled into a street outside a housing complex. He was the second Arvada police officer to be killed in the line of duty in two years. Almanza was taken into custody at a hospital, where he is recuperating from injuries sustained while exchanging gunfire with Vakoff and another officer early Sunday. He will be transferred to Jefferson County Jail when he is released from the hospital, the Arvada department said. Vakoff and his fellow officer had been dispatched to check on the well-being of two minor children when they encountered the disturbance, police said. A suspect opened fire, wounding a woman, at which point the officers returned fire, Police Chief Link Strate said at a news conference Sunday. The suspect then fired at Vakoff, Strate said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Sports fans won’t be able to place bets at Hartford’s XL Center until next spring. Officials told the Hartford Courant that delays in receiving crucial construction components due to global supply chain issues are to blame and that the project isn’t expected to be completed until at least March. It had been hoped the 4,000-square-foot sportsbook, featuring a bar and restaurant, would be open in time for the start of the NFL season this weekend. A main component delaying the project is a large glass wall that will overlook a major intersection and is expected to transform the building’s bunker-like appearance. “We’re groping along, frankly, because the window system is frustrating us,” Michael W. Freimuth, executive director of the Capital Region Development Authority, which oversees arena operations, told the newspaper. “We’re trying to keep going, but the wall system is going to delay us.” The state-financed, $4 million project was approved after lawmakers passed legislation legalizing sports gambling last year. The legislation called for the creation of sports betting venues at 15 locations. The XL Center hosts University of Connecticut men’s and women’s basketball as well as minor league hockey and concerts.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A report released Thursday once again underscored the need for the state to streamline its delivery of substance use services, expand collaboration of treatment within emergency departments and increase reimbursement rates for those treatments. Those were just some of the nearly 60 recommendations detailed in the study conducted by HMA Institute on Addiction, which was commissioned by New Castle County along with Kent and Sussex county officials to evaluate the landscape of addiction treatment in Delaware and target areas for improvement. The First State is not alone in its struggle to combat addiction and reduce overdose deaths, which skyrocketed amid the COVID-19 pandemic and have continued to plague communities across the country. There were 515 overdose deaths in the state last year – a 15% increase from 2020, which saw 447 deaths in Delaware, according to the report. There were 437 overdose deaths in 2019, state Department of Health and Social Services figures show.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Several Metro stations are operating under new names as of this week, WUSA-TV reports. The name changes, which will be reflected on signage and maps across the system, were approved by the Metro Board of Directors in December 2021. Travelers will see the changes immediately on digital maps throughout all rail stations and on bus displays, as well at the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority website and Trip Planner. The station previously known as White Flint is now North Bethesda. Largo Town Center has become Downtown Largo. Tysons Corner is now simply called Tysons. Prince George’s Plaza changed to Hyattsville Crossing, and West Falls Church’s secondary name, VT/UVA, is now VT only.\n\nFlorida\n\nDaytona Beach: A shooting scare at a central Florida high school was a “cruel prank” carried out by two groups of students who now face criminal charges and possible expulsion, police said. Rumors, lies and conspiracy theories have been “floating around” on social media since Friday’s lockdown at Mainland High School, Daytona Beach police said Sunday in a lengthy Facebook post. “This entire incident appears to have been a cruel prank by several students that has now gotten out of control due to internet trolls, misinformed people and in some cases, people that are not even in Florida,” police said. Investigators said officials at the school became aware of a threat written on a bathroom stall Thursday. School officials and law enforcement reviewed video and interviewed two students who had entered the bathroom around the time the graffiti was discovered. The students denied involvement, and it was determined that no threat existed, police said. On Friday, two groups of students in the cafeteria “decided to capitalize on the threat” and “appear to collaborate with each other to create a panic,” police said. They were seen on video “getting into specific positions and locations within the cafeteria, timing their actions,” and several female students told an administrator someone had a gun.\n\nGeorgia\n\nBrunswick: Fishermen, shrimpers and business owners dependent on coastal tourism have filed lawsuits over pollution caused when a cargo ship capsized off the Georgia coast in 2019. The two federal lawsuits filed last week say the pollutants released by the capsize of the Golden Ray and the harm caused by the subsequent salvage operation have damaged the area’s sensitive marine ecosystem – and the plaintiffs’ livelihoods. The South Korean-owned Golden Ray capsized with more than 4,200 automobiles in its cargo decks shortly after departing the Port of Brunswick on Sept. 8, 2019. The wreck occurred in the sound between St. Simons and Jekyll Islands. Removal dragged on for more than two years. The lawsuits accuse the companies connected to the shipwreck of negligence and of violating the federal Clean Water Act and the federal Oil Pollution Act, which was enacted in 1990 following the Exxon Valdez disaster. Plaintiffs are asking the court to order the companies to pay civil penalties, remediate the sound and award compensatory damages. “The Golden Ray was grounded near environmentally sensitive areas that serve as a unique habitat for a variety of species, including, but not limited to, shrimp, fish, migratory birds, crabs, and food sources for all marine life, including, but not limited to, fiddler crabs,” the lawsuits said.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A new program at the University of Hawaii aims to offer more mental health services to Indigenous students. The COVID-19 pandemic hit Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander students particularly hard, HawaiiNewsNow reports, and a dearth of counselors with similar backgrounds and culturally relevant treatments has compounded the situation. Under the Ka Malu a Waʻahila program, the John A. Burns School of Medicine offers therapy, monthly group support and self-help tools at no charge, according to the news outlet.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A “Drag Kids” program slated for this year’s Boise Pride Festival prompted a wave of political pressure and anonymous threats. Festival organizers said they envisioned a short performance where kids could put on sparkly dresses and lip-sync to songs like Kelly Clarkson’s “People Like Us” on stage. But others, including Idaho Republican Party Chairwoman Dorothy Moon, expected a lurid scene where children would “engage in sexual performances with adult entertainers.” The event garnered national attention from far-right websites and podcasts, and by last Tuesday, organizers realized this wasn’t the “normal” amount of opposition, said the festival’s president, Michael Dale. Moon and the Idaho GOP sent out statements directing constituents to ask the festival’s corporate sponsors to pull support for this past weekend’s three-day event. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare announced it was pulling $38,000 in funding and resources. A conservative pastor from California began rallying like-minded congregations, asking members to tell the Ada County Sheriff to arrest any festival organizer who “contributes to the delinquency of minors.” A group known for armed protests told followers to show up Sunday. On Thursday afternoon, festival organizers made the decision to postpone the kids’ performance. “We wanted to ask these kids first and foremost because it affects them and their confidence and their lives. And they still wanted to do it,” Dale said, fighting back tears. “But it came to be an issue of their health, their well-being, and that of the festivalgoers.”\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Democrats who run state government celebrated Monday while announcing that tax-rebate checks totaling more than $1.2 billion had begun heading to 6 million taxpayers. Rebates on income and property taxes are part of a $1.83 billion inflation-relief package built into this year’s budget. “Everyone knows inflation is a global problem with local consequences,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said at a Chicago news conference. “Prices at the pump and at the supermarket have taken Illinois families on a roller-coaster ride over the past months. It’s exactly the kind of thing that responsible government should help our residents with and we have, starting today.” With eight weeks remaining before the November election, the timing is perfect for Pritzker, Comptroller Susana Mendoza, who shared Monday’s spotlight, and virtually every member of the General Assembly. Rebates will arrive by mail or direct deposit in the closing days of the campaign season, when voters make up their minds. Individual taxpayers making less than $200,000 will receive a $50 rebate, with $100 to couples filing jointly earning less than $400,000, Revenue Director David Harris said. Taxpayers will also receive $100 for claimed dependents, up to three. Property tax rebates will be equal to the amount a homeowner claimed as a credit on income tax returns last year, up to $300, Harris said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Five women and a religious abortion-rights group filed a new lawsuit in Marion County on Thursday challenging the state’s near-total abortion ban on the grounds of religious freedom. Hoosier Jews for Choice and the five women – residents of Marion, Monroe and Allen counties – claim the ban violates the state’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The 2015 measure, signed into effect by then-Gov. Mike Pence, prevents the government from impeding someone’s religious exercise unless there’s a strong argument in favor of the state’s interest. The defendants in the case include members of the Medical Licensing Board of Indiana and prosecutors in five counties. The lawsuit says the belief that life begins at conception, which is widely shared by Christian anti-abortion advocates, “is not a theological opinion shared by all religions or all religious persons.” “For example, under Jewish law, a fetus attains the status of a living person only at birth,” the lawsuit says. “Jewish law recognizes that abortions may occur, and should occur as a religious matter, under circumstances not allowed by (the near-total abortion ban) or existing Indiana law.” That would include when an abortion could prevent a “mother’s mental anguish” from severe physical or mental health issues.\n\nIowa\n\nAltoona: The former owners and operators of Adventureland Resort have told a court that the family of the 11-year-old boy who drowned there in 2021 may have contributed to the deadly accident and its aftermath. That argument was part of a court filing last week by Adventure Lands of America Inc. in response to a lawsuit blaming the theme park for the death of Michael Jaramillo and injuries to members of his family. A raft carrying the family on the park’s Raging River ride overturned July 3, 2021, resulting in the drowning of Michael and severe injuries to his brother, who were trapped underwater for an extended period. Attorney Guy Cook represents the then-owners of the park, who have since sold the property to another operator. His filing denies key allegations of the family’s lawsuit alleging the accident was the result of mismanagement, neglect and safety violations under CEO Michael Krantz. In addition to saying the Jaramillos themselves may have been negligent or failed to appropriately “mitigate” the accident’s results, Cook’s response argues that the park complied with government regulations and that others – possibly including “government entities” – may have been the “sole proximate cause” of the tragedy. The response does not say what the Jaramillos allegedly may or may not have done to contribute to the accident.\n\nKansas\n\nOverland Park: A suburban Kansas City police officer who shot and killed a 17-year-old four years ago will not face civil rights charges, federal prosecutors announced Friday. John Albers was shot by officer Clayton Jenison after he backed a minivan out of his family’s garage in Overland Park in January 2018. Officers went to the home to check reports that Albers was posting threats to harm himself on social media. Albers’ parents were not home at the time. The Justice Department said its two-year investigation into the shooting found no evidence to contradict an earlier finding in a civil court that Jenison used unreasonable force in shooting Albers. However, federal law requires that investigators prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the officer “willfully” used unreasonable force, federal prosecutors said. Evidence gathered during the investigation “does not clear the high bar that the Supreme Court has set for meeting this standard, and the department has therefore closed its investigation into this matter,” federal prosecutors said in a news release. Jenison shot twice at Albers as he backed the van past him and out of the driveway, investigators said. When the van spun around to face the street and began slowly backing toward the house, Jenison fired 11 more shots. Albers was hit by six bullets and died at the scene.\n\nKentucky\n\nPaducah: Construction of the new U.S. 60 Cumberland River Bridge in western Kentucky will take a big step forward this week as crews plan to float a 700-foot steel truss up the river and install it, officials said. The truss was expected to float from Paducah to the construction site at Smithland, then be placed atop the main piers Monday through Wednesday, according to the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. Security during the procedure will be tight, but a public viewing area will be available at the north end of the bridge construction site so people can watch the slow process of raising the truss and putting it into place, District 1 Chief Engineer Kyle Poat said. There will be lane restrictions on the existing Cumberland River Bridge while the truss is being installed. The $63.6 million project is expected to be completed next year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Taxpayers have until Oct. 6 to claim millions in state income tax refunds before they become unclaimed property. The Louisiana Department of Revenue sent letters to 20,400 people and business taxpayers advising them to claim their refunds before they are transferred by law to the Unclaimed Property Division of the state treasurer’s office. More than $36 million in unclaimed refunds is due for transfer if not claimed, the department said in a news release. To claim a refund, taxpayers must complete and return to the revenue department the voucher in the Notice of Unclaimed Property letter dated Aug. 18. The department will issue paper checks to all taxpayers submitting completed vouchers by the October deadline. Any refund not claimed by the deadline remains the property of the taxpayer and can be retrieved from the Unclaimed Property Division.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A federal judge has denied a request from fishing groups that sought to challenge new fishing rules designed to protect rare whales. The lobster fishing groups wanted a federal judge to stop regulators from placing new restrictions on the harvest of the crustaceans. The rules are intended to protect North Atlantic right whales, which number less than 340 and are vulnerable to entanglement in fishing gear. U.S. District Court Judge James Boasberg denied the request in a Thursday ruling. It’s the latest in a string of legal setbacks for lobster fishermen who are coping with increasingly strict fishing rules meant to save the whales. The Maine Lobstermen’s Association said in a statement that it was disappointed by the ruling, which it said “puts the future of Maine’s lobstering heritage at great risk, and along with it, the livelihoods of thousands of hard-working men and women.” Conservation groups have long pushed for stricter protections for the vanishing whales. Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity, said in a statement the ruling affirms “right whales can’t wait any longer for stronger protections from deadly entanglements in fishing gear.”\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City: Offshore wind projects like those by US Wind and Orsted were boosted Wednesday as the Maryland Energy Administration added $1.6million to fund additional projects by emerging companies. The Maryland Offshore Wind Capital Expenditure Grant Program, a fund aimed at assisting new or existing emerging businesses entering the offshore wind supply chain in Maryland, will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis for qualifying proposals until Jan. 1, 2023, or until all funding has been awarded. “Proposed projects must provide a positive net economic benefit to the state and local communities through job opportunities while encouraging diversity, inclusion and equity in their business operations. Proposed projects should also be designed to serve the larger U.S. offshore wind market and related industries,” the state energy agency said in a statement. Developments like MARWIN I and Momentum Wind by US Wind represent a projected 77 turbines 15 to 18 miles off the coast of Maryland and Delaware that are expected to turn out 1,864.5 megawatts of power for the state – enough to power 285,000 Maryland homes. The state regards the industry as a boon, bringing 12,000 direct full-time equivalent jobs, with both Baltimore-area and Ocean City-area port facilities seeing the windfall.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Voters will get the chance to decide whether the state should reject a new law allowing immigrants in the country illegally to obtain state driver’s licenses. The secretary of the commonwealth’s office announced late Friday that it had certified the signatures needed to put repeal of the law on the November ballot. The measure became law after the Democrat-controlled Massachusetts House and Senate overrode a veto by Republican Gov. Charlie Baker in June. With the override, Massachusetts joined 16 other states and the District of Columbia that have similar laws. The push to repeal the new law is being led in large part by the state Republican Party. The law was a win for immigrant rights groups that had long pushed for the measure, framing it in part as a public safety measure, noting that those seeking the licenses will have to show they can properly operate a car and get insurance in the event of an accident. Maureen Maloney, whose son Matthew Denice was killed in 2011 after being struck and dragged by a driver in the country illegally, is helping to lead the repeal effort and claimed the law hurts the integrity of state elections by creating a backdoor for noncitizens to vote. Backers of the new law say it will make the roads safer for everyone.\n\nMichigan\n\nYpsilanti: Striking Eastern Michigan University faculty members returned to their classrooms Monday, after their union reached an agreement with the university to end a walkout that started last week. University and union officials announced the tentative contract agreement Sunday night following weekend negotiations, but they didn’t immediately release the details. The university said a full class schedule would resume Monday at the Ypsilanti campus of more than 15,000 students about 35 miles southwest of Detroit, where several dozen faculty members started picketing Wednesday. The union represents more than 500 tenured and tenure-track faculty. The two sides had been split over salary increases and how much faculty members should pay for health care. Union leaders had argued that the school’s proposal would have saddled its members with thousands of dollars in additional costs. Union negotiating team chairman Matt Kirkpatrick, an associate professor of English language and literature, called the agreement “an important victory.” “We took a stand to maintain and strengthen quality education at EMU, and this agreement moves us forward,” Kirkpatrick said in a statement. The agreement would have to be ratified by the university’s board and union members to take effect.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Thousands of nurses in the state launched a three-day strike Monday, complaining of low salaries and understaffing worsened by the strains of the coronavirus pandemic. Some 15,000 nurses at seven health care systems in the Minneapolis and Duluth areas walked out. The affected hospitals said they recruited temporary nurses and expected to maintain most services. Picket signs went up and strike chants began at 7 a.m. outside 15 Twin Cities- and Duluth-area hospitals. The hospitals and the striking nurses said staff shortages are a shared concern. Minnesota Nurses Association President Mary Turner said pay raises are necessary to address the “crisis of retention” that would otherwise leave the hospitals severely understaffed. The hospitals have offered 10%-12% wage increases, but the nurses are seeking more than 30%. Hospital leaders called their wage demands unaffordable, noting that Allina and Fairview hospitals have posted operating losses and that the cost of such sharp wage increases would be passed along to patients. Union spokesman Sam Fettig said the nurses settled on a three-day rather than open-ended strike because of concerns about the impact of drawn-out labor action on patient care. “As the nurses always say, this isn’t something they want to be doing; they want to be at the bedside providing care,” Fettig said.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: As the city emerges from the depths of a crisis that made water unusable even for bathing, another is stacking up in piles of empty plastic bottles. The city has distributed hundreds of thousands of water bottles in the past six weeks. Churches, businesses and other groups have rallied to bring truckloads of water to the capital. In the state’s first week of aid, it distributed about 5 million bottles, Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday. Making things worse, the city ended its curbside recycling program in August 2019, saying the lack of interest and cost made it an impractical endeavor. Residents were referred to private recycling companies if they wanted to continue curbside service. Environmentality Recycling Solutions and Allen’s Recycling are among the private companies that pick up recyclables. Tri-Miss Recycling has drop-off points but does not offer curbside pickup, nor does it accept plastics. Derek Augustus, owner of Environmentality Recycling Solutions, said his company is working with Keep Jackson Beautiful to collect empty bottles at some water distribution sites. Keelan Sanders, executive director of Keep Jackson Beautiful, said the group already was working with the city and Jackson Public School District on exploring ways to bring back some sort of recycling program. “The water crisis has basically expedited what we’re trying to do because we saw the need, especially with all the water bottles we are being inundated with now,” he said.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Officers fatally shot a 16-year-old they say was reaching for a gun, police said Monday. Darryl Ross was shot just after 11:30 p.m. Sunday at a gas station on the city’s north side. Ross was Black. A police incident report said one of the officers involved in the shooting was Black, and one was white. The city’s new Force Investigation Unit, established last month, was handling the investigation. Police said two drug enforcement detectives spotted several people with guns at the service station and drove to the parking lot. Their car was unmarked, and they were in plain clothes but wearing black, bulletproof vests with the word “POLICE” written on the front and back. Ross, armed with a gun according to the police report, walked away quickly to an alley. The detectives followed him and announced they were police officers. Ross ran, then tripped and fell, dropping a pistol, police said. As the detectives approached, Ross reached for the pistol, the report said, prompting both officers to shoot him. Ross was taken to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead. The officers were unhurt. It was the second fatal officer-involved shooting in St. Louis in less than a week. Officers killed a 61-year-old man last Wednesday at an apartment complex. Police said a man who had been evicted engaged police in a standoff.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A federal judge on Friday ordered the Biden administration to reinstate a drilling lease that has been in dispute for decades on land near the Blackfeet Indian Reservation that is considered sacred to Native American tribes in the U.S. and Canada. The 10-square-mile oil and gas lease in the Badger-Two Medicine area of northwestern Montana was first issued in 1982. It was canceled in 2016 under then-U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, at the request of the Blackfoot tribes and conservation groups. There have been efforts to declare the area a national monument or make it a cultural heritage area, and tribal leaders have bitterly opposed drilling in recent decades. But U.S. District Judge Richard Leon said Jewell lacked the authority to withdraw the lease so many years after it was sold and after several prior studies examined the environmental and other impacts of drilling in the area. He ordered Interior Department officials to reinstate the lease and issue a drilling permit to Solenex LLC, the Louisiana company that holds the lease. Leon issued a similar order in 2018 that was later overturned on appeal. The Badger-Two-Medicine is adjacent to Glacier National Park and is the site of the creation story of the Blackfoot tribes of southern Canada and Montana’s Blackfeet Nation.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A former police captain has prevailed in her lawsuit against Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer and the city, having sued over allegations that the chief failed to promote her in retaliation for filing a discrimination complaint. A federal jury agreed Monday that Schmaderer based his decision, at least in part, to not promote Kathy Belcastro-Gonzalez to deputy chief in 2018 because of a discrimination complaint she made directly to the mayor’s office, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Belcastro-Gonzalez said in her lawsuit that she and another woman who was a lieutenant in the department filed separate complaints against the same male officer in 2010, describing the man as creating a hostile work environment for them because they were women. In 2017, the male officer in question was promoted to one of five chief deputy positions for which Belcastro-Gonzalez had also applied . That same year, Belcastro-Gonzalez went over her police superiors’ heads to complain to the mayor’s office after the earlier complaints about the male officer made through the chain of command went nowhere. During the lawsuit’s trial, two former commanders of the Omaha police internal affairs unit testified to irregularities they described as “very unusual” in the handling of Belcastro-Gonzalez’s and the other woman’s complaints.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Nevada State College won’t get a name change for now, despite a passionate plea from the school’s president, DeRionne Pollard. Pollard told the Board of Regents, the elected body of 13 that oversees the state’s public colleges and universities, that a name change to Nevada State University would have added value to the degree during a quarterly board meeting in Elko on Friday. She said that at schools across the country, the word “college” indicates a community college. The board voted to table the discussion until December so that more information could be gathered about what the name change could mean to state funding formulas including tuition and how staff are paid. Pollard said the name change wouldn’t change the school’s mission and would not compete with the research-driven campuses of the University of Nevada, Reno or UNLV. She said changing the name of the college to Nevada State University would have made a degree more valuable to the students, many of whom are the first in their family to go to college.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: After a successful first year, Oyster Week will return Sunday with a slate of events highlighting the state’s fastest-growing seafood industry. Half of New Hampshire’s 14 oyster farms will take part in events at local breweries and restaurants from Newmarket to Newington showcasing the state’s oyster harvest, which has grown by nearly 800% in value since 2013. “We really want to promote the oyster farmers and help their product,” said Kelsey Meyer, the coordinator for the New Hampshire Shellfish Initiative, which organizes the event. “It’s a local and very sustainable product.” The week will once again culminate with the second annual Seacoast Oysterfest on the deck at Bernie’s Beach Bar on Hampton Beach on Sept. 24. Along with live music, craft beer and cocktails, at least six different oyster farms will be on hand shucking their mollusks until they run out. The week kicks off Sunday with the annual Stone Church Oysterfest in Newmarket, which will pair oysters from Fox Point Oysters, Virgin Oyster Company and Rising Tide Oyster Co. with plenty of live music in the courtyard of the iconic music hall. On Sept. 21, Stoneface Brewing will unveil two new beers that were made with oysters from all the participating farms.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Two bills that expand and promote access to free meals for schoolchildren in middle-income households were signed by Gov. Phil Murphy on Friday as part of a response to food insecurity in New Jersey that was laid bare by the pandemic. Both laws will take effect during the next school year, starting in September 2023. The Working Class Families’ Anti-Hunger Act will provide free school breakfasts and lunches to those students that qualify. The second bill – which Murphy jokingly referred to as the “get the word out” act – builds upon an existing law that requires schools to create public education and promotion campaigns to inform families and communities about the availability of these programs. Both laws work to pick up after a pandemic-era federal program that provided universal free lunches in schools across the nation ended earlier this year. “There’s a stigma to receiving free food and lunch,” Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin said Friday at South Amboy Elementary School, where the announcement was made. “We are taking a big and important step today.” This would mean a saving of $1,260 in school meal costs for families, Coughlin said, saving them about 22% in overall food costs every year. About 26,000 more students would qualify for free meals, he said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Commercial cannabis sales in August grew by about $374,000 over July in data released Wednesday by the state’s Cannabis Control Division. Total sales topped $40 million for the second consecutive month, a high since regulated sales of cannabis opened for adults April 1. Meanwhile, tax data suggests the number of retailers sharing the market is growing much more quickly than the market for adult-use cannabis. Based on data from the state Taxation and Revenue Department, the number of cannabis retailers filing their taxes grew by 15%, while the revenue collected in excise taxes grew by just 2%. Total reported sales back in July topped $40.3 million, which had been the high point since the state opened sales of cannabis for adult use. In August, the total of medical and non-medical cannabis products was reported at $40.7 million, with a 2.1% drop in medical cannabis sales since July. Adult-use sales increased by 3% over the month. The top five cities, who also topped July sales, accounted for 61% of the total market in August: Albuquerque ($14.6 million), Santa Fe ($3.5 million), Las Cruces ($3.3 million), Hobbs ($1.7 million) and Rio Rancho ($1.6 million).\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Water at a public housing complex is OK to drink after earlier tests incorrectly showed the presence of arsenic, city officials said Saturday. A tweeted video showed Mayor Eric Adams and another official drinking glasses of water from a tap at the Jacob Riis Houses. Tests by an outside lab last month had showed higher than allowable levels of arsenic, but on Friday the company said the results were incorrect. Residents of the 1,700-unit complex on the Lower East Side had been told to avoid drinking or cooking with the water beginning last weekend. Adams said Saturday additional tests had confirmed the water was safe. “This morning, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene reviewed the final test results for contaminants and found the water to be well within EPA drinking water quality standards,” Adams said in a statement. “We can confidently say the water at Riis Houses is and has been free of any discernible amount of arsenic since the initial tests were initiated in August and meets EPA standards.” Adams’s office said the city would cease working with the lab, Environmental Monitoring and Technologies, and would “pursue all available legal options” and seek to reimburse residents for costs incurred during the past week.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Oral arguments over the constitutionality of the state’s photo voter identification law will be held next month, the North Carolina Supreme Court has decided in another ruling determined along partisan lines. In a 4-3 decision, the justices who are registered as Democrats agreed with attorneys for minority voters who had asked the state’s highest court in July to move the case along more quickly. These voters are plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in December 2018, moments after the Republican-controlled General Assembly approved a photo ID law. That law has never been administered. A panel of judges held a trial, and in September 2021 a majority struck down the law, saying it intentionally discriminated against Black voters. Earlier this year, in a similar 4-3 decision, the justices agreed to hear the case, instead of waiting for the intermediate-level Court of Appeals to deliberate first. The plaintiffs wrote in July that an expedited argument date as soon as September would help state officials and voters “prepare for future elections without the risk of voter confusion and disenfranchisement.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A $4.2 million project to install metal poles with reflective markers along two-lane highways across the state has been put on hold because of worries about how the new poles affected farmers driving large equipment. The posts installed this summer along state highways with shoulders less than 8 feet wide will be removed as the Department of Transportation redesigns the project. State Sen. Janne Myrdahl, who complained about the problems the posts were causing farmers, said the hard metal posts will likely be replaced by flexible ones. “I’ve rarely heard about an issue more than I heard about that in two weeks,” Myrdahl told the Bismarck Tribune. Outgoing Transportation Department Director Bill Panos said in a statement that “it’s not uncommon to pause, reassess and implement design changes when new information becomes available.” It wasn’t immediately clear how the changes would affect the cost of the project that is being paid for with federal money.\n\nOhio\n\nMason: Kings Island has been named the park of the year by Amusement Today. The trade journal’s publisher and editor-in-chief, Gary Slade, selected the park for the Publisher’s Pick Award for Park of the Year because of its “important history and celebration of it, with its 50th anniversary event this summer, its excellence in providing record-breaking rides and its ongoing commitment to quality, maintenance and extreme safety in the amusement and theme-park industry,” Kings Island wrote in an announcement on its website. The local park was also a top finalist in four other categories, coming in second and fourth, respectively, for best new show for its “Fun, Fireworks and Fifty – A Kings Island Nighttime Spectacular” and “Phantom Theater Encore”; second for best kids’ area for Planet Snoopy; fourth for best guest experience; and fifth and sixth for best wooden roller coaster, for the Beast and Mystic Timbers. According to Kings Island, the Beast is one of only two wooden roller coaters to place in the top 10 every year in the more than 20 years of the Golden Ticket Awards from Amusement Today. Kings Island first opened in April 1972, as a new amusement park to replace the old Coney Island, which closed in 1971. It opened with five original themed areas, attractions and a number of rides, 11 of which still remain today.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: An inmate found dead in his jail cell over the weekend was a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the county alleging that in 2019, he and other inmates were tortured by jail employees who forced them to repeatedly listen to the children’s song “Baby Shark” for hours. John Basco, 48, was found unresponsive in his cell early Sunday morning, Oklahoma County Detention Center officials said in a news release. He was pronounced dead after jail workers began lifesaving efforts, they said. Basco’s death is the 14th this year at the jail, which has faced criticism over inmate deaths, escapes and other incidents. Jail spokesman Mark Opgrande said there were no obvious signs of foul play, and investigators will look into the possibility of a drug overdose. The State Medical Examiner’s Office will determine the cause of death. Basco, who was booked into the jail Thursday on a drug trafficking complaint, was among a group of inmates suing the county in federal court for allegedly being handcuffed to a wall and forced to listen to the song “Baby Shark” on repeat for hours during separate incidents in 2019. A jail lieutenant retired and two detention officers were fired in connection with the incidents, and all three face misdemeanor charges. Basco’s attorney, Cameron Spradling, said he found the circumstances surrounding Basco’s death “disturbing” and called for the preservation of all evidence as the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation probe of it unfolds.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Utility companies said Monday that they have restored power to tens of thousands of customers after shutting down service over the weekend to try to prevent wildfires during high winds, low humidity and hot temperatures. Both Portland General Electric and Pacific Power enacted planned power shutoffs Friday as high, gusting winds and low humidity moved into Oregon, posing extreme fire danger. The utilities were concerned that the winds would cause power lines to break or sag, making sparks that could ignite tinder-dry vegetation. Portland General Electric halted power to about 37,000 customers in 17 service areas starting Friday, and Pacific Power shut down service to 12,000 customers. Power shut-offs due to fire weather, common in California, are new to the Pacific Northwest. The strategy appeared to be successful, with no major new blazes over the weekend. Portland General Electric also fully restored power to all affected customers by Saturday evening, the company said.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state’s highest court on Monday rejected a request from Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf that it immediately take up his challenge to Republican legislation that has bundled a constitutional amendment regarding abortion with four unrelated proposed changes. In turning down Wolf’s request, the justices said he was free to file a legal action before the lower-level Commonwealth Court. The amendments could go before voters as early as May. Wolf filed the legal action in late July, arguing that bundling together the measures in a bill before the politically divided Legislature violates a constitutional rule against passing laws that address multiple, unrelated topics. The proposed abortion amendment would say the state constitution does not guarantee any rights relating to abortion or public funding of abortions. The other amendments would require voter ID, have gubernatorial candidates choose their own running mates, enable lawmakers to cancel regulations without facing a governor’s veto and set up election audits. The two chambers, both with Republican majorities, voted mostly along party lines to advance the package of five amendments. If the General Assembly passes them again in the session that starts in January, they will go before voters as five separate referendums in the May 16 primary.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: A nonprofit plans to build an LGBTQ-friendly apartment building for low-income older adults. Four years ago, when Jodi Glass joined the board of Aldersbridge, a nonprofit that runs health care centers for older adults, she had already been working on an issue close to her heart: care of the aging population of LGBTQ people. “Elder LGBTQ folks, they don’t have children as they do now in the younger generation, and their support systems are more lateral,” she said. The idea of a better support system for older members of the queer community started percolating for Glass 15 years ago. When she joined Aldersbridge, formerly known as United Methodist Elder Care, her project gained momentum and direction as she helped form the policies, trainings and procedures to deter discrimination in assisted living and nursing homes. Glass and Aldersbridge CEO Rick Gamache had a bigger, bolder plan in mind: building an income- and age-restricted apartment complex to serve aging members of the LGBTQ community. With a little luck, a little help from the city of East Providence and the right timing, Glass’s vision is set to become a reality as Aldersbridge and the nonprofit housing developer One Neighborhood Developers try to build a 39-unit building as part of the sprawling, 390-unit East Point housing project in East Providence, on the east bank of the Seekonk River. The apartment building will consist of studios, 1-bedroom and 2-bedroom apartments on the 27-acre property. Gamache said their building will be the first of its kind in Rhode Island.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state Department of Corrections will offer a new digital tracking service to support addiction therapy for inmates in the state’s main prison for women. Eligible inmates will report their substance use, cravings and triggers on a smart device, and counselors will use the results to inform their therapy sessions. The $159,840 program is funded by the S.C. Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services. Pear Therapeutics Inc. said its program is the first of its kind in a U.S. prison. “We are excited to begin this cutting-edge treatment for our female inmates who suffer from addiction,” SCDC Director Bryan Stirling said in a press release. The Camille Griffin Graham Correctional Institution will offer the FDA-authorized tracking software as a 90-day treatment intended to increase abstinence and boost participation in cognitive behavioral therapy programs. Safety warnings say the devices are designed to work alongside existing medications and in-person clinical contact. A prison spokesperson, Chrysti Shain, said incarcerated people will still receive the therapy required by federal regulators. When used outside of prisons, the digital therapeutics can incentivize users through nonmonetary rewards and retail gift cards. Behind bars, participants will earn digital badges and rewards including “increased canteen spending, homework passes, increased tablet time, no duties or chores,” according to Shain.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem asked a state ethics board to dismiss a complaint against her without a public hearing and to seal off certain records, documents released Friday by the state’s Government Accountability Board show. The Republican governor, who is widely seen as eyeing a 2024 White House bid, argued in an April motion that the state’s then-attorney general, a fellow Republican who filed the complaint, was out for political retribution and should be removed from the complaint. Noem had pushed former Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg to resign and later for his impeachment over his involvement in a fatal car crash. The attorney general’s complaint was sparked by a report from the Associated Press last year that Noem had taken a hands-on role in a state agency. Shortly after the agency moved to deny her daughter, Kassidy Peters, a real estate appraiser license in July 2020, Noem held a meeting with Peters and key decision-makers in her licensure. Days after the meeting, Peters signed an agreement that gave her another opportunity to meet the licensing requirements. The South Dakota Legislature’s audit committee, controlled by Republicans, unanimously approved a report in May that found Noem’s daughter got preferential treatment.\n\nTennessee\n\nKnoxville: The University of Tennessee is hosting a sustainable transportation forum and an electric vehicle summit in November, and registration is now open, officials said. The Drive Electric Tennessee initiative will host the first DriveElectricTN Momentum Summit on Nov. 7 at the Knoxville university’s student union, state officials said in a news release. Then, the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation, the Tennessee Department of Transportation and the Tennessee Clean Fuels Coalition will hold the Tennessee Sustainable Transportation Forum & Expo on Nov. 8-9 at the student union, officials said. Research, technology, planning and policy developments to be shared at the forum will aim to improve transportation efficiency, reduce vehicle emissions and address mobility needs, officials said. Speakers and panelists at the forum will address topics such as alternative fuels and advanced vehicle technologies, mobility and transportation justice, and the intersections of transportation with public health and emergency response, among other issues, officials said. The DriveElectricTN Momentum Summit will focus on transportation electrification efforts and include breakout sessions on community outreach, electric vehicle infrastructure, policies and programs, and innovation, officials said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State child-abuse investigators are still pursuing families with transgender children and, in at least one case, have expanded the investigation beyond Gov. Greg Abbott’s ordered scrutiny of gender-affirming medical care, a new court filing says. The filing included affidavits from two mothers who, using pseudonyms to protect their families from harassment, described the devastating effect the child-abuse investigations have had on their children. One, 13-year-old Steve, was pulled out of class Aug. 30 and questioned by a state child-abuse investigator, leading to anxiety attacks and missed classes, disrupting his education and upending hard-won improvements to his mental health, mother Carol Koe wrote. “This is extremely upsetting given he has been doing so well in school this year, both socially and in his classes,” she wrote. The other, 14-year-old Whitley, has never received gender-affirming medical care, but the Department of Family and Protective Services has declined to close its investigation after more than six months – and instead added a new requirement, telling mother Samantha Poe on Aug. 25 that investigators wanted proof that Whitley is well-adjusted.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A professional bull rider was killed overnight Monday in what police are calling a domestic violence homicide. Demetrius Omar Lateef Allen, who went by the name Ouncie Mitchell as a pro bull rider, was found shot outside an apartment complex in Salt Lake City, police said in a news release. Allen, 27, was taken to a hospital, where he died. Police arrested LaShawn Denise Bagley, a 21-year-old woman, on suspicion of murder. Bagley and Allen had been in a relationship. Allen had come to Utah to attend the state fair and was staying with Bagley. The two got into a fight at a bar, and Allen went to Bagley’s apartment to get his things, where he was shot, police said. Bagley was booked into jail. No charges had been filed as of Monday afternoon. It was unknown if she had an attorney. Sean Gleason, commissioner of Professional Bull Riders, said in a statement that Allen is the same person who goes by the name Ouncie Mitchell. He said the organization was saddened to find out about the death of a rider who had become a familiar face on the PBR Velocity Tour and competed in the Bill Pickett Invitational Rodeo. He was from Fresno, Texas, according to his bio on the PBR website. “Ouncie got his name because he was born small,” Gleason said. “He grew up to compete with a huge heart.”\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The University of Vermont announced Tuesday that it will build 295 apartments in South Burlington over the next four years to alleviate the school’s housing needs. UVM will partner with local developer Snyder-Braverman to build “Catamount Run” in South Burlington’s City Center. Students and employees at UVM can look forward to the first 100 apartments being completed by summer 2024, another 65 units by summer 2025 and another 130 units by 2026. The apartments will hold nearly 500 beds. A tight job market and tighter housing market have some Vermont employers creating employee housing. “This initiative will increase access to housing within close reach of campus, primarily for students in our graduate and professional programs and for the talented employees we are attracting to UVM and the Greater Burlington area,” UVM President Suresh Garimella said in a press release. “The university expects this project to help address the housing shortage that poses real challenges to nearby communities.” Garimella said he had repeatedly heard from students, staff and faculty that they were having to look farther and farther away for housing because of the extremely low supply in the Burlington area.\n\nVirginia\n\nPortsmouth: The Portsmouth Humane Society is letting the dogs out. A new program called Paws Around P’Town pairs shelter dogs with community members for daylong field trips to the beach, a park or even a person’s couch, The Virginian-Pilot reports. Alison Fechino, executive director of the Portsmouth Humane Society, said she hopes the program will emphasize that helping shelter pets is possible for everyone, including those with a busy schedule. “It helps us by, first of all, getting the dogs out of their cages,” Fechino said. “And it gives them the one-on-one time they deserve.” Anyone who’s at least 18 can participate. Individuals can select a dog after reviewing its documented personality traits, or shelter staff can work to find the right fit. One recent Saturday, Suffolk residents Cassie and Hailey Caldwell picked up Morgan, a 5-year-old female pit bull mix, for a day of fun. The mother and daughter cannot have animals where they live, so weekend trips are a great way for them to enjoy time with some furry friends. They said after grabbing a “pup cup” of whipped cream for Morgan, a trip to the beach or a local park was on the itinerary. Amanda McQuarry, the shelter director, said 70 is the maximum number of dogs the facility ideally can support, but 90 is the absolute cut-off. The shelter has reached 90 this summer, but the program has alleviated some of the burden the staff experiences.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A running dispute over LGBTQ-related policies took a dramatic new turn Monday at Seattle Pacific University. A group of students, faculty and staff at the Christian university sued leaders of the board of trustees for refusing to scrap an employment policy barring people in same-sex relationships from full-time jobs at SPU. The 16 plaintiffs say the trustees’ stance – widely opposed on campus – is a breach of their fiduciary duties that threatens to harm SPU’s reputation, worsen enrollment difficulties and possibly jeopardize its future. The lawsuit, filed in Washington State Superior Court, requests that the defendants – including the university’s interim president, Pete Menjares – be removed from their positions. It asks that economic damages, in an amount to be determined at a jury trial, be paid to anyone harmed by the LGBTQ hiring policy. “This case is about six men who act as if they, and the educational institution they are charged to protect, are above the law,” the lawsuit says. “While these men are powerful, they are not above the law… They must be held to account for their illegal and reckless conduct.” The Free Methodist Church, a denomination whose teachings do not recognize same-sex marriage, founded SPU in 1891.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Lawmakers were scheduled to convene at the state Capitol outside of their regular session Monday to discuss putting millions of dollars into road maintenance and creating a new industrial plant program within the state economic development office. The new special session is set to begin more than a month after the Republican supermajority failed to reach consensus on a sweeping bill that would have barred access to abortions in most circumstances. A version of the bill passed the House, but it stalled after the Senate adopted its own version with amendments, one of which removed criminal penalties for physicians who perform illegal abortions. Instead, delegates asked for a conference committee to iron out differences. Republican Gov. Jim Justice put out a call Saturday for another special session beginning at 1:30 p.m. Monday, while lawmakers are gathered in Charleston for previously scheduled September interim committee meetings. He asked lawmakers to consider legislation that would establish a “Certified Industrial Business Expansion Development Program” within the Department of Economic Development. It would be charged with encouraging the development and construction of high-impact industrial plants “in certain circumstances where the availability of electricity generated from renewable sources is demonstrated to be necessary,” according to Justice.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and Republican challenger Tim Michels announced Monday that they have agreed to debate just one time ahead of the Nov. 8 election. The debate will be Oct. 14, hosted by the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association, held in Madison and broadcast statewide. Both campaigns put out a joint statement announcing the agreement. The debate will include journalists from across the state, according to the statement. “There are plenty of differences between the two candidates, but we agree that voters deserve this opportunity to hear directly from each candidate,” Evers’ campaign manager, Cassi Fenili, and Michels’ campaign manager, Patrick McNulty, said in the joint statement. “This will be the only debate between the candidates before the November election.” In 2018, Evers debated then-Gov. Scott Walker twice in October. Michels, co-owner of construction company Michels Corp., participated in two televised debates with his Republican challengers this summer. One was in a traditional debate format, and the other was a town hall where questions came from people in the audience. Michels also did a radio debate with former Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and state Rep. Timothy Ramthun.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A legislative committee is considering a controversial bill that would allow public inspection of some personnel files in K-12 schools. The Joint Education Committee is considering that more drastic step and another piece of legislation as lawmakers try to address harassment and bullying allegations against teachers, WyoFile.com reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}]}

An apron is where aircraft park and undergo maintenance or refueling.\n\n“Investing in Delaware’s airports provides more than just support for aviation - they are a hub for economic development in our three counties,” said Senator Carper. “These airports help us create a nurturing environment for businesses to grow and expand, and provide good-paying jobs for Delawareans.”\n\nDelaware's airport expansions\n\nJust over two years ago, commercial airfare was nonexistent in Delaware. Now, millions are being poured into the Wilmington Airport, which transports thousands of Delaware passengers with Avelo Airlines' 11 flight routes.\n\nThe Wilmington Airport has a $13 million renovation project in the works to improve parking and increase capacity. The Delaware River & Bay Authority, which owns the Delaware Airpark and the Wilmington Airport, already has bought out the former hotel adjacent to the Wilmington Airport for extra parking. The group has announced additional plans to use the space for car rentals, retail storefronts, grab-and-go restaurants and more.\n\nSlow down, Newark:The city is getting its own speed camera to deter fast drivers\n\nAlso, $6.6 million was earmarked for the airport’s 6,000-square-foot terminal expansion, which over the course of several years would increase the airport’s customer capacity, expand security screening and add amenities for customers.\n\nThe airport applied for a nearly $12 million funding grant from the Biden-Harris administration, and received $5.6 million in February.\n\nILG’s renovations aren’t the only expansion the airport has underway. Starting Oct. 7, a coach bus will connect the Wilmington Airport to American Airlines’ terminals at the Philadelphia International Airport.\n\nWinter getaways:Planning holiday travel?

Avelo does. But if you book an American Airlines flight out of Wilmington (ILG) starting in October, you can nonetheless show up at Wilmington Airport exactly as if you're going to catch a flight there.\n\nMore:Here are the details on Wilmington Airport's ambitious $13 million expansion plans\n\nYou park at Wilmington, you check your luggage at Wilmington and you go through a less-busy security gate at Wilmington. And then you get on a Landline motorcoach to the Philly airport, which will drop you off inside the Philly security gates at Terminal F.\n\nYour checked luggage will travel with you on the bus. On the return journey, the same thing will happen: You collect your bags at ILG when you get off the bus.\n\nThe service is a partnership between American Airlines and Landline, whose spokespeople are very clear that the main amenity they offer is not dealing with the unpredictability of parking and snaking security lines at PHL, one of American Airlines' busiest hubs.\n\n“Riding with Landline eliminates the hassle of trying to find a ride or driving and parking at PHL,” wrote Landline's Hannah Tamura in a statement. “The ability to clear TSA security at ILG instead of waiting in unpredictable security lines at PHL is added benefit.”\n\nThe 35-seat motorcoach service, which includes WiFi and an onboard bathroom, will launch in October with 6 round trips a day between the ILG and PHL airports.\n\nStarting last year, the bus line began offering similar service to PHL from other regional airports. Motorcoach routes now include Allentown and Scranton in Pennsylvania, and Atlantic City in New Jersey.\n\n'Flights' from Wilmington to Los Angeles can already be booked\n\nMotorcoach-assisted flights booked through Wilmington's airport can already be found online at the American Airlines site at aa.com. When we searched for American Airlines flights this fall out of ILG, there's a little note appended: \"Includes travel on a luxury bus.\"\n\nBut such flights can only be booked for dates on or after Oct. 7. This date coincides roughly with when ILG is expected to get about 500 new parking spaces. Attempts to book earlier \"flights\" out of ILG through American Airlines will result in an error message.\n\nTo book, passengers can simply search for flights out of ILG on the American Airlines website. Motorcoach berths are booked automatically with your flight. American Airlines reward miles and itinerary protection are both honored.\n\nThe flight booking proceeds as if the bus departure time from Wilmington were the time you'd leave for your flight.\n\nSo a 6:45 a.m. \"flight\" from Wilmington Airport to Los Angeles on the morning of Oct. 8 actually denotes the time the motorcoach leaves Wilmington. The bus is due to arrive at Philadelphia Airport's Terminal F by 7:35, just in time to board an 8:15 flight to Los Angeles.\n\nBut while the service is convenient, note that it doesn't appear to be free. The motorcoach service is not itemized as a surcharge, but round-trip American Airlines economy flights we searched out of ILG cost anywhere from $20-$110 more than the same flights out of PHL.\n\nThat said, through the magic and utter nonsense of airplane pricing, we were also able to find a round-trip itinerary from Wilmington to Los Angeles that was $10 cheaper than the exact same trip booked directly out of Philly.\n\nWhich is to say, the bus ride from Wilmington Airport, in that case, would cost negative 5 dollars. We'll take it.\n\nMatthew Korfhage is business and development reporter in the Delaware region covering all things related to land and money: openings and closings, construction, and the many corporations that call the First State home.

And what do they do for Trump's ...", "text": "Whatever the news surrounding Elon Musk, at least one organization still seems to favor companies formed in Delaware: the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump.\n\nCommittees associated with Donald Trump's reelection campaign have apparently funneled millions of dollars to a mysterious months-old company called Launchpad Strategies LLC whose owners and activities remain somewhat opaque, as first reported Monday by NBC News.\n\nThe company was formed late last year in Delaware, according to state business entity filings. Since then, FEC records show that two committees associated with former president Trump's campaign have pushed more than $3 million in campaign money to that company, for activities ranging from \"digital marketing\" to \"online advertising.\"\n\nLaunchpad Strategies does not seem to have done work for any campaign other than Trump's campaign, according to NBC News.\n\nSo what's Launchpad Strategies? And what's former President Trump's history with Delaware LLCs? Here's what we know.\n\nSign-up for Your Vote: Text with the USA TODAY elections team.\n\nLaunchpad Strategies LLC is registered at a condo in Dover, Delaware\n\nLaunchpad Strategies' ownership remains opaque, and so does its business. The company was formed as a Delaware LLC in November 2023 through a company called Registered Agent Solutions whose address is a beige office condo in Dover, according to Delaware state records. The condo's owners are a family trust in Phoenix, Arizona with a mailing address in the Florida panhandle.\n\nCalls to the condo's owners were not immediately returned.\n\nOn Trump campaign filings, Launchpad's mailing address is listed at a P.O. box in Raleigh, North Carolina, where officials reported that no company by that name exists in that state.\n\nThe company's apparent website, launchpad-strategies.com, is a black screen on which the company's logo emerges from a carpet of animated clouds. The website's only feature, aside from that pixelated fog, is a malfunctioning contact form.\n\nLaunchpad's activities are 'online,' and unclear\n\nTrump Save America Joint Fundraising Committee is the Trump campaign's main fundraising vehicle. And at $2.8 million, Launchpad Strategies appeared to receive more money than any entity other than the Trump campaign itself.\n\nAside from money delivered to the campaign, more than 10% of the Fundraising Committee's payouts to vendors went to Launchpad for services, which were listed as online advertising, digital consulting, and fundraising fees. Trump's campaign also directly paid Launchpad for digital consulting.\n\nTrump's campaign called Launchpad “a digital advertising company that is primarily focused on our fundraising,” in statements to NBC News.\n\nWhy should anyone care about the opaque ownership of an obscure company few have heard of?\n\nElection observers Campaign Legal Center, who issued an unsuccessful complaint against the 2020 Trump campaign over a lack of transparency on $500 million in funds, have called potential shell companies like Launchpad a red flag in an election process where money should be transparent.\n\n“It’s concerning to see a company formed just six months ago suddenly receive over $3.1 million from Donald Trump’s network of political committees, particularly since there is virtually no public information about this company,” CLC legal director Saurav Ghosh told NBC News on Monday.\n\nTrump has a long history of anonymous corporations and dealings in Delaware\n\nThe former president is, of course, no stranger to Delaware LLCs, nor Delaware courts.\n\nIn a manner of speaking, it was a Delaware transaction that helped lead to Trump's May fraud trial that ended with felony convictions surrounding purported \"hush money\" payments over relationships with porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal.\n\nMore:Delaware dissolves shell companies created to pay off women by Trump-fixer Michael Cohen\n\nTrump associate Michael Cohen created two Delaware LLCs, Essential Consultants LLC and Resolution Consultants LLC, reportedly with the intention of orchestrating hundreds of thousands in payments to Daniels and to the National Enquirer's parent company, in order to help keep those affairs quiet before the election.\n\nIn 2020, a state judge ordered the dissolution of the two companies created by Michael Cohen.\n\nFederal grand jury indictments in 2016 stated that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump campaign official Rick Gates shielded from U.S. authorities millions of dollars in payments from the Ukraine, using nine Delaware LLCs.\n\nTrump Media, whose wildly volatile stock prices have the market's equivalent of tabloid fodder after the company's successful May IPO, was also formed as a Delaware corporation. A battle over the value of shares in that company played out in Delaware courts in March 2024, after a merger with a shell company.\n\nDelaware, has, of course, also been a home for Trump's more intellectual assets. In 2016, Trump moved many of his best-known trademarks, including Trump Tower, the Trumptini and Mar-a-Lago, to a holding company in Delaware.\n\nAnd, of course, Trump once sponsored a bike race called the Tour de Trump, in Delaware.\n\nMatthew Korfhage is business and development reporter in the Delaware region covering all things related to land and money: openings and closings, construction, and the many corporations who call the First State home.

Firefly has a history of bringing in legacy rap acts such as Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Busta Rhymes, Ludacris and Nelly. There were no such artists at last week's festival.\n\nAnna Grimm of Salisbury, Maryland, wants to see Miley Cyrus and Greta Van Fleet next year. Although Miley is a pop artist, Grimm said she wants to see the festival switch things up a bit in 2023.\n\n\"I’d also like to see Firefly go back towards its roots with more indie/alt music and less pop,\" she explained.\n\nWhat Firefly concerns did fans have about this year?\n\nLow attendance\n\nThis year it looked like the crowds at Firefly were a little smaller than last year. Before last year’s event, festival organizers AEG announced they were capping the 2021 festival at 50,000 people.\n\nFirefly organizers have been pretty shy about releasing attendance stats for their festival since their 2015 event, which attracted 90,000 fans. That year, when Paul McCartney headlined, remains the biggest year in attendance in Firefly history to date.\n\nBut nine-time Firefly fan Jon Steward of West Deptford, New Jersey, said last week he noticed “attendance seemed a lot lower than in previous years.”\n\nFirefly organizers have not yet responded to requests for this year’s attendance.\n\nHigher food prices\n\nOne issue this year was the high price of food, fans said. A slice of pizza was $10, which is also what lemonade cost. A bowl of mac and cheese was $12. Bottled water was $4.\n\nFans also noted a shortage of vegetarian/vegan options this year.\n\n“There needs to be a better variety of healthier food options,” said Tyler Klein of Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. “I'm sensitive to greasy and fried foods. It makes me tired, and after a few days of eating it can trigger depression.”\n\nParking wars\n\nThe parking situation was a little messy this year, too. Fans who previously parked overnight at Dover Mall were relocated to a field that may have previously been used for camping.\n\nOvernight parking was $20, which was double the cost from last year. That new area was poorly lit and had minimal attendants, which made it difficult to find vehicles after dark.\n\nSome fans had issues finding the lot to begin with because there wasn’t a lot of signage, they said.\n\nFewer stages\n\nThere were five stages this year, one fewer than in 2021. Most of the action, however, took place across three stages (Main Stage, Pavilion and Backyard).\n\nBy comparison, there were eight stages in 2018 (Main, Pavilion, Backyard, Lawn, Porch, Tree House, Coffee House and Toyota Music Den).\n\nIn pre-pandemic times, you’d see popular artists performing on the Lawn stage. Also, popular acts and rising stars would sometimes play two sets, with one being on a smaller stage, giving fans an extra bang for their buck.\n\nTricia Witkins of Monroeville, New Jersey, wants the festival to bring back the Lawn stage, which featured acts like Portugal. The Man and Vance Joy.\n\n“They removed Lawn stage, which was the best mid-day stage. This is where I saw Lord Huron for the first time,” Witkins said. “[They] got rid of the Coffee [House, too], the coolest, chill stage where you could catch Rainbow Kitten Surprise and take a break.”\n\nCasting shade on the situation\n\nFirefly traditionally was held in the summer before the pandemic and has been held in September since 2021, which has allowed fans to beat the scorching heat.\n\nAt the same time, Witkins pointed out that there were few places to hide from the sun last weekend.\n\n“Shade is nowhere to be found this year,” she said.\n\nTougher security measures\n\nFestival security at the gate seemed stricter this year, fans said.\n\nDepending on which line you stood in, some members of security required fans to take off their baseball caps in order to check the inside of their hats for weapons. Some fans were denied entry into the festival if they wore bandanas.\n\nThe measures did not seem to be evenly applied among fans, they said.\n\n“I watched a guy bring in a bat and Goldfish box while I watched a lady have to throw away her belt because it was considered a weapon,'' Witkins said.\n\n... but there were plenty of positives about Firefly 2022\n\nStill plenty of good vibes\n\nMusic is the excuse a number of fans use to hang out at Firefly every year. But the real stars of the festival are “the people.”\n\nLyndsay Mercier of Philadelphia has been to Firefly twice. Although she said she expected more pizazz for this year’s 10th anniversary, she still had a “magical” time.\n\n“Whether it's someone handing you a free delicious kiwi, placing a deli sticker on your arm that says ‘hot,’ handing you a tiny rubber ducky just because, or asking to take your photo because they love your outfit – the people in attendance are what makes Firefly stand out from other music festivals,” Mercier said.\n\nLori Jones of Dover has been to every Firefly and is happy that fans are still kindhearted and thoughtful to one another.\n\n“I like the freedom to express yourself without judgment. Everyone is coming together to enjoy music and art,” said Jones, who added she would love to see big names like Metallica, Calvin Harris, The Cure and Pearl Jam play Firefly in 2023.\n\nStrong Wi-Fi connection\n\nPhone signals and Wi-Fi connections were strong this year, much better than in pre-pandemic times. That’s maybe because it looked like there were fewer people in attendance this year. But it was still appreciated by fans.\n\nFaster lines, less walking\n\nTo piggyback off the previous point about attendance, the lines for getting inside the festival were arguably the fastest in Firefly history.\n\nThe reduction in stages was looked at as a blow for some, others said they relished the fact that fewer stages shrunk the festival grounds a bit, making it easier on your feet with a lot less queueing up along the way.\n\nAndrew Stead of Perkasie, Pennsylvania, has been to eight Fireflies, but this year was extra special.\n\n“This was the first year I got to bring my daughter, and it was the best one so far.”\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal will keep you updated on new developments for Firefly 2023.

The team practices from 6 to 8 p.m. up to four nights a week during the season and plays as many as two games per weekend to keep them ready for their toughest competition.\n\nFootball may give these boys a way to let out energy and a little aggression, but it's provided them with a family in the process, King said.\n\n\"They love to play,\" he said. \"And everybody needs the opportunity.\"\n\nMany parents say the team holds their children accountable and encourages them to do better. Chanelle Brock, a parent and avid supporter of the Titans, said she got her 10-year-old son Michael involved soon after she watched the coaches working together with the kids.\n\nNow, her son plays \"where he's needed,\" often taking up positions at offensive guard, offensive tackle and defensive tackle while learning how to be part of a team.\n\n\"I liked the teaching style,\" she said. \"I said, 'That's where we need to be.' It's good for them to be a part of something. Watching them push each other, come together ... it gives them a sense of community.\"\n\nMany boys say they want their football careers to extend long into the future, through college and all the way into the National Football League. They rattled off favorite teams and uniforms, their 10- and 11-year-old voices filling the library of the William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center library as they goaded each other about their Sunday superstars.\n\n\"I tell the boys all the time, 'I'm not worried about you playing on Sundays',\" Rogers said. \"'I want you playing Saturdays.' It's about college and getting an education.\"\n\nThey even have a chant to remind them there's more to the game than just winning and losing.\n\n\"1-2-3, Titans!\" the boys shout, quickly followed by, \"4-5-6, Be a leader!\" It's how they start and finish their games.\n\nThe boys remember these lessons off the field, too. Eleven-year-old Osi Chukwuocha said they've learned how to believe in themselves, even when the points may not be in their favor.\n\n\"You don't give up when you get scored on,\" he said with a smile, \"though we didn't have to use that 'til we got to Florida.\"\n\nFor his father and coach Nnamdi Chukwuocha, the sense of family provided in this team has proved to be the best part of the Titans. Since his son started playing for men like Coach Snow and Coach King, he has watched his son grow as a player and a person.\n\n\"Let me speak as both a parent and a coach – good coaches are what bring out the best in players,\" said Nnamdi Chukwuocha, who also is a Wilmington City Council member. \"You guys make it easy for me to stand on the sidelines and give a few pep talks.\"\n\nThat's why parents drive their kids hours to away games, challenging programs in Philadelphia, Baltimore and Virginia to duels on the field. It's why the kids run hills for hours on end, conditioning themselves for the next big rival. It's why coaches stay late, carpooling players to get them to and from practice for a sport they love.\n\nOver a seven-month season, the team leaves feeling like much more than a bunch of players bonded by a sport, parents said.\n\n\"[The kids] came together as individuals, worked together as a team and in the process, we all became a family,\" said parent Becky Purdy, looking at the boys. \"It's been a really special experience.\"\n\nCoaches and players agree – the Wilmington Titans gives them something more. Someday, they'll be cheering each other on at bigger stadiums with bigger crowds. They dream big, Rogers said, because they know with the right foundation, they can accomplish anything.\n\nRogers looked around at his players, shaking his head and smiling.\n\n\"This is life-changing, right here,\" he said.\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

About 10 years later, he moved to what Memphians mostly think of as the original Leonard's Pit Barbecue at Bellevue and McLemore.\n\n\"In all the time I've been here, I've never had a person come up and say, 'I went to so and so before I went to Leonard's,' and if anyone had, I would've heard about it by now,\" Leonard's owner Dan Brown said.\n\nBrown started working for Leonard's in 1962, left when he was drafted in 1967 and returned in 1970 to find that it had been sold to an investment group with plans to open a chain of fast food restaurants. He stayed on, and while there were Leonard's all over town and one in Jackson, there was never a national expansion. The Bellevue store closed in 1991, and in 1993, Brown purchased what was left from the three investors who remained. The sole remaining Leonard's is on Fox Plaza Drive.\n\nJim Neely, who lived in South Memphis from the time he was born in 1937 until he joined the Air Force in 1955, remembers Leonard's but can spout off a list of other places from back in the day, too: Uncle Joe's (two of those). Culpepper's. Jeff's Barbecue. Gus's, maybe.\n\n\"Seems to me it was called Gus's. I believe that was the name,\" Neely said. \"It was in the white part of South Memphis, a brick place, and it had fine barbecue. If you were black, you could get someone to bring it to you at the back door.\"\n\nAfter the Air Force, Neely stayed in California until the early 1970s, and he opened Neely's Interstate Barbecue in 1978.\n\n\"When I was coming up, every neighborhood, black or white, had their own favorite barbecue place,\" Neely said. \"It was a phenomenon. That's the very reason I'm in this business today. I wanted to recapture that, but I just can't seem to put my finger on it.\"\n\nOthers would argue. Neely now has three local restaurants and a concession in the airport, and he trained the nephews who would go on to open their own now-closed places in Memphis and Nashville and snag the Food Network show \"Down Home with the Neelys.\"\n\nPopular then and now\n\nSome of today's other popular barbecue restaurants opened in the '70s. Payne's opened in 1972, and Cozy Corner in 1977. Gridley's, an institution with one outpost left in Bartlett though not under original ownership, opened in 1975.\n\n\"There was a time when I'd have to drive all the way over to Summer Avenue to get barbecue because Clyde Gridley was the only person in town doing it right,\" Neely said. \"Well, there was another Uncle Joe's, way out in North Memphis by the old Firestone plant. He had such a little pit that I might drive out there and he'd be out, but I'd go back two hours later. You know how it is when you get a taste for something.\"\n\nOf course, other places came and went. Gridley worked for Loeb's, a chain of about 100 barbecue restaurants over seven states that spanned decades, closing incrementally beginning in the 1980s. Don Pelts owned The Public Eye before he opened Corky's in 1984. Tops, which opened in 1952, is now in 15 locations around the area. Brady and Lil's opened in the '50s and in 1980 was purchased by Frank and Hazelteen Vernon, who in 1987 changed the name to the The Bar-B-Q Shop.\n\n\"I lived next door to Lil and I was only 4 years old, but I had a crush on her like you would not believe,\" Neely said. \"They moved to New York and when they moved back here and opened, Brady had a great product. And you talk about a cat daddy. Man, he was a real cat daddy.\n\n\"And he invented barbecue spaghetti.\"\n\nAnd there's the Rendezvous, open 70 years.\n\n\"My dad opened on November 6th Street, the other alley, in 1948,\" John Vergos said. \"It's about 50 yards from where we are now. The only reason we moved is because NBC bank took that spot.\"\n\nIn 1968, Charlie Vergos planned to move to Beale Street where Silky O'Sullivan's is today. But when Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed April 4, businesses started moving away from Downtown Memphis.\n\n\"No one would lend him any money to stay Downtown,\" John Vergos said. \"He didn't want to move out east, so he had to find another place and that's how we ended up where we are.\"\n\nCharlie Vergos started his restaurant as a tavern, serving sandwiches and snacks, but was fooling around with ribs by the time he took his family on a trip to New Orleans in the early 1950s.\n\n\"He was just piddling around, but when he discovered those spices, he brought them back and combined them with his Greek seasoning and that's how we got Rendezvous ribs,\" John Vergos said. \"Everyone else was mostly doing sandwiches.\"\n\nBrown, at Leonard's, says he thinks ribs were so unimportant to Leonard's in the early years that they didn't even smoke them.\n\n\"This sounds crazy, but we used to roast them in the oven back when,\" he said. \"I don't even remember selling a rib until much later on.\"\n\nBut Neely says that in South Memphis, ribs were anywhere you wanted them.\n\n\"Everything you got was a sandwich. Now you just say you want it pulled or chopped, but back then, when you ordered you'd either say a shoulder sandwich or a rib sandwich,\" he said. \"If you got a rib sandwich, it would be three ribs between two slices of bread with coleslaw. Bones in 'em, so you'd take it apart anyway, but they called it a sandwich.\"\n\nThe barbecue patriarch\n\nCharlie Vergos died in 2010; Neely is by age and by temperament the patriarch of Memphis barbecue.\n\n\"People ask me what makes my barbecue different from other places, and I tell them one word: me. I've been around it all my life,\" he said. \"When I lived in California, every time I crossed that bridge I'd head somewhere for barbecue.\"\n\nHis memory is long, his knowledge deep.\n\nVergos said that other than Leonard's, he doesn't know of any place open before the Rendezvous, but he remembers his father talking about a place called \"Johnny something\" back in the '30s and '40s. Maybe Johnny Moore's?\n\n\"Johnny Mills,\" Neely said with about 10 seconds' thought. \"Down around where W.C. Handy Park is now. It was a black restaurant, but he cooked for everybody. Mayor Crump would go in there, and they'd clear the place out. He had a helluva reputation.\"\n\nMemphis barbecue now\n\nToday, pigs fly. You can have Memphis barbecue all over the country, shipped via FedEx from here to there. There are more than 100 barbecue restaurants open, and who knows how many shuttered.\n\nMemphis sealed its international reputation as a barbecue city in 1978 when 26 teams came together in a parking lot to see who could smoke the best meat. It was Bessie Louise Cathey — the first winner at what would become the Memphis in May World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest was a woman. Since then, it's largely been a man's game, with the notable exception of Melissa Cookston, who has been named grand champion twice and won the whole hog division five times.\n\nToday, \"Barbecue,\" as it's simply known around here, draws more than 200 teams and more than 60,000 people to Tom Lee Park the third weekend of May, where teams compete for a big trophy and a big purse in shoulder, whole hog and ribs categories.\n\nIt's all pork, which Miller, the author, points out is the original American barbecue and one of the reasons he feels like Memphis can potentially plant the flag as the most important barbecue city in the country.\n\nKansas City will likely dispute the claim. After all, its annual competition is twice as large. But it should be noted that they also allow beef and chicken, where in Memphis those are just ancillary categories.\n\nWhen they come for our flag, we just need to say one name: Henry Perry.\n\nPerry was a porter in a Kansas City saloon when in 1908, he started smoking meat and selling from a stand in an alley. It caught on, and eventually Perry opened a restaurant, then a bigger one. He trained Charlie Bryant, who took over the business when Perry died in 1940. Later it went to Bryant's brother, Arthur, and that's how the renowned Arthur Bryant's barbecue came to be. Perry was generous with his knowledge and taught other men how to smoke, who in turn passed their knowledge on and continued the Kansas City barbecue tradition.\n\n\"Perry is the man that is credited with starting Kansas City barbecue,\" Miller said.\n\nThere's a little thing they leave out on the website. Perry, who was born in 1875, ended up in Kansas City after spending years working up and down the Mississippi in steamboat kitchens. Where did he hop on his first boat? In the port of his hometown.\n\nMemphis, Tennessee.\n\nAt a glance\n\nMemphis In May World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest\n\nWhen: May 16-19\n\nWhere: Tom Lee Park\n\nTeams: 225 teams from 22 states and four countries will take part in this year's contest\n\nDetails: memphisinmay.org, click on World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest\n\nIt came from Memphis\n\nBarbecue pizza was invented in Memphis by Horest Coletta at Coletta’s, the restaurant at 1063 South Parkway East that his father founded in 1922 as an ice-cream stand. In the mid-1950s, sailors from all around were stationed at the Memphis Naval Air Station in Millington and they wanted pizza. Coletta obliged, but it didn’t catch on with locals. His solution was to top the pie with a familiar food — barbecue — and soon everyone was eating it, including Elvis. There's an Elvis room there today.\n\nBarbecue spaghetti started here, too. Brady Vincent of Brady & Lil's created the dish after he and Lil moved back to Memphis from New York and opened their restaurant. Unlike many versions which are little more than barbecue sauce and pork on noodles, this one has an Italian touch, a bit of marinara to it. When Frank Vernon purchased Brady & Lil’s, he also acquired the spaghetti recipe and today you can get it at the The Bar-B-Q Shop (which is what the name changed to in 1987).\n\nBarbecue nachos from Memphis? Natch. Walker Taylor, owner of the Germantown Commissary, credits them to an employee named Rosie. Serving from a concession at a festival, she ladled cheese sauce over tortilla chips and someone asked for a handful of pulled pork on top. She obliged, and today they’re all over menus in town.\n\nWhere did barbecue originally start?\n\nAuthor Adrian Miller and other culinary scholars believe barbecue was born in the Caribbean.\n\nOn his first voyage, Christopher Columbus encountered indigenous tribes cooking on a platform over green wood that produced smoke and slow heat. The Spanish referred to the apparatus as \"barbacoa\" and took the concept with them as they went north.\n\nWhen Hernando de Soto landed in Tampa Bay in 1539, he had pigs with him. In winter 1540, de Soto and his men made camp with the Chickasaw Indians near what is known today as Tupelo, Mississippi. There's a record of a pig roast with the Indians, cooked barbacoa style.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/05/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2016/05/18/film-log/84549512/", "title": "Film capsules 5/20", "text": "Poughkeepsie\n\nNEW THIS WEEK\n\nAlice Through the Looking Glass — (PG, fantasy action/peril and some language) Alice returns to the whimsical world of Wonderland and travels back in time to save the Mad Hatter.

Alabama saw 109,000 of its 361,226 confirmed and probable COVID-19 cases reported in December. The surge came after the Thanksgiving holiday, and health officials said they are concerned caseloads will continue to grow in January from the fallout of Christmas and New Year’s gatherings. “We are being overwhelmed right now,” State Health Officer Scott Harris said. “I believe, unfortunately, we are going to see even worse numbers than we have now, and the ones we have now are pretty bad.” The cumulative number of confirmed and probable cases was 251,787 on Nov. 30 and rose to 361,226 cases Dec. 31. While there were some backlogged cases recorded in December, almost all of the reported cases were from December.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Health officials said the state plans on receiving almost 53,000 doses of coronavirus vaccines this month from drug companies Pfizer and Moderna. That figure is about 7,000 fewer vaccines than the state received in December. Thus far, only front-line health care workers in hospitals, residents and employees at long-term care facilities, emergency personnel, community health aides and people conducting vaccinations have been eligible to be inoculated in Alaska. Starting Monday, another tier of people will begin receiving vaccines. That group includes people working in health care who are at the highest risk of contracting the virus, are considered essential to the health care system, and do regular work that can’t be done remotely or postponed. Almost 50 Alaska residents spoke at a public hearing last Monday to advocate for their demographic to be included in the next vaccination group. That group included teachers, older adults and seafood industry workers, the Daily News reports. Alaska has so far vaccinated over 13,000 people, according to a state tracker last updated last Monday.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Despite a surge of coronavirus cases, Gov. Doug Ducey on Saturday rejected the state’s top education official’s call for him to order public schools to use only distance learning for the next two weeks unless they have waivers from health officials. “Given the severity of our state’s situation and the virus’s trajectory after the holiday period,” schools need a “two-week quarantine period” for education leaders and local officials to use local health data “to decide the appropriate instruction model for their communities,” Superintendent of Public Instruction Kathy Hoffman said in a Twitter thread. Hoffman called for the two-week “quarantine period” for schools after the Department of Health Services on Saturday – the second day of the new year – reported nearly 8,900 additional known COVID-19 cases, giving the state a two-day pandemic high for new cases. However, Ducey spokesman C.J. Karamargin said the governor “will not be considering this request or issuing this kind of mandate. This is a local decision. The online option is already available, and the governor has repeatedly made his preference clear: Kids have already lost out on a lot of learning, and he wants schools opened, safely.” Many schools are set to resume classes this week after the winter holidays.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Coronavirus hospitalizations in Arkansas have again set a new record high, as the pandemic strains medical resources across the state. There were 1,216 people in Arkansas hospitals with confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, state health officials reported, an increase of 31 from the day before. Arkansas has repeatedly broken previous records for hospitalizations and case counts over the past week, as the virus surges following holiday gatherings and travel. The Arkansas Department of Health also reported 1,597 new confirmed cases of COVID-19, 403 more probable cases and another 18 deaths. Those case counts are down from Friday’s record high, but Gov. Asa Hutchinson warned that the numbers were deflated by a drop in testing on New Year’s Day. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven’t been tested, and some who get sick don’t show symptoms.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Hospitals struggling to provide enough oxygen for the sickest coronavirus patients in the Los Angeles area began to receive help Saturday when U.S. Army Corps of Engineers crews arrived to update their oxygen delivery systems. The collaboration comes as the six aging hospitals struggle to maintain oxygen pressure while treating an unprecedented number of patients with respiratory issues. Some COVID-19 patients can require 10 times as much oxygen as a normal patient. California started the new year Friday by reporting a record 585 coronavirus deaths in a single day. The state Department of Public Health on Saturday reported another 386 deaths and more than than 53,341 new confirmed COVID-19 cases. More than 20,000 people were hospitalized as of Saturday with COVID-19; 4,500 of them were in intensive care, according to state records. The southern half of the state has seen the worst effects, from the agricultural San Joaquin Valley to the Mexico border. Hospitals are swamped, and intensive care units don’t have any more beds for COVID-19 patients. Makeshift wards are being set up in tents, arenas, classrooms and conference rooms.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A day after Gov. Jared Polis announced that restrictions for places like restaurants and gyms will be eased in much of the state starting this week, some local public health officials said they were concerned about the move. The governor cited improving statewide COVID-19 metrics in lifting certain restrictions in 33 counties, including Denver and the entire Front Range, but his announcement Wednesday came as not all of those counties meet the individual requirements to downgrade restrictions, the Denver Post reports. “It appears that if there’s enough pressure from the business and economic forces in the state that we will change the dial to meet those demands, and that’s kind of frustrating,” said Mark Johnson, executive director of Jefferson County Public Health. The announcement came a day after Colorado said it had confirmed the United States’ first case of a new and apparently more contagious variant of the coronavirus. “We don’t believe that it in any way reflects the spread of the disease or how dangerous the disease is or our concern about what is going to happen with Christmas, New Year’s or the new variant that is more infectious,” Johnson said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Some of the city’s public school students will return to their physical classrooms later this month for the first time since last spring, according to the superintendent of schools. Superintendent Iline Tracey announced on the district website Thursday that officials are preparing for “a limited return of students to a hybrid learning model” starting Jan. 19. The New Haven district has been closed for in-person instruction except for some special-needs programs since the coronavirus pandemic forced schools across the country to shut down last March. Officials in New Haven chose to keep school buildings shuttered in September as other districts in Connecticut offered either full-time or part-time in-person learning. A plan to reopen New Haven’s schools on Nov. 9 was shelved amid rising COVID-19 cases. Tracey said schools will open Jan. 19 to students in prekindergarten through fifth grade as well as students in special-education programs and programs for new immigrants at two of the district’s schools. Two schools, Quinnipiac School and West Rock School, will remain closed because city health officials determined that a lack of ventilation renders them unsafe during the pandemic, Tracey said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: After health workers, long-term care staff and long-term care residents are inoculated, the next people to get the COVID-19 vaccine in the state will be front-line essential workers and residents 65 and older. Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Delaware Division of Public Health, announced the state’s decision during Gov. John Carney’s weekly coronavirus press briefing Tuesday. Front-line essential workers include first responders such as firefighters and police, as well as teachers, U.S. Postal Service workers and grocery store workers. The group also includes corrections officers, food and agricultural workers, day care workers and public transit workers. But these people likely won’t start getting the vaccine until mid- to late January due to the limited supply of the vaccine. “Please be patient with us. There’s just not enough vaccine for everyone right now,” Rattay said, adding that employers need to start planning how they will administer their vaccine to workers. People who work in Delaware but live in a neighboring state will likely be eligible for the vaccine in Delaware because they will likely get it through their employer.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Curators Sam Vong and Shannon Perich at the National Museum of American History are collecting written submissions from people across the country describing how they experienced 2020, WUSA-TV reports. “As historians, what we really want to do is document what’s going on before it kind of escapes from us,” Vong said. The Smithsonian museum has put out an open invitation to submit, with the hope that Americans’ recollections will preserve for the future the experiences of a year that really was like no other. “All of these stories will help people drill down or will open up new avenues of exploration and research,” Perich said. The submissions can be mundane. “What did it mean to sit in your home by yourself?” asked Perich. “The only way we’re ever going to know the answer to that question is if people tell us.” Or they can be extraordinary, like one of Vong’s favorites so far from a former Bhutanese refugee who resurrected a grassroots media outlet to share information during the pandemic. The submission period opened in December and runs through March.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Health officials reported a two-day total of 30,767 new cases of the coronavirus in the state and 217 new deaths Saturday. Florida’s Department of Health did not release numbers on New Year’s Day. The state has also chosen not to report COVID-19 cases on two other holidays, Thanksgiving and Christmas. The two-day total brings the overall number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Florida to 1,354,833. The agency posted that 21,015 cases were reported Friday and 9,752 reported Saturday. The state’s death toll throughout the coronavirus pandemic stands at 22,074. On New Year’s Eve, the state reported the highest daily jump in COVID-19 cases ever detected in Florida, with 17,192 new cases. Also on Thursday, state health officials disclosed in a statement tweeted on the department’s HealthyFla site that evidence of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain first seen in England has been detected in a Martin County man with no recent travel history. Martin County is north of Palm Beach County, which along with Miami-Dade and Broward counties have comprised the state’s hardest-hit region in dealing with coronavirus cases.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: As vaccines are being administered to health care workers and long-term care facility residents and staff, law enforcement and first responder agencies are in line to get them soon. Gov. Brian Kemp and Georgia Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Kathleen Toomey announced Wednesday that adults 65 and older, law enforcement officers, firefighters and first responders were being added to Phase 1A – the highest-priority group eligible to receive vaccinations. Some Augusta-area firefighters and deputies have already started getting vaccinated. The Richmond County Sheriff’s Office said some deputies were inoculated last week, and it is in the process of compiling a list of deputies interested in getting the vaccine. Dr. Stephen Goggans, the director of the East Central Health District, said the timeline for first responders and those 65 or older to get vaccinated was moved up because some parts of the state have already completed or are close to completing vaccinations for health care workers and long-term care facilities.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Residents have been warned to be extra vigilant and continue to follow safety guidelines as cases of a new, seemingly more contagious strain of the coronavirus have recently been reported in the U.S., health officials said. The Hawaii Department of Health, along with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there have been increased efforts to find the new variant and to understand how it is transmissible, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. It has not been detected in Hawaii. Confirmed cases of the new coronavirus strains have been found in the United Kingdom and South Africa and in the U.S. in Colorado, California and Florida. “All we know is that we have not yet found it,” State Laboratories Division Dr. Edward Desmond said. “We’re going to cast a wide net to see if we can quickly find it when it is here, and then we can make decisions about whether that should impact our community mitigation measures.” The vaccines being distributed are thought to be effective against the new strain. Health officials have said about 25,000 COVID-19 vaccines have been administered statewide. Local pharmacies received a surprise shipment of 3,800 doses last week, boosting the total delivered in December to 65,250.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gov. Brad Little plans to propose tax cuts and investments in transportation, education and water projects to lawmakers this month following another monthly revenue report that exceeded projections despite rising coronavirus infections and deaths. The Republican governor in a statement last month spent little time trumpeting the budget numbers and his fiscal conservatism as he has in the past during live news conferences. The latest numbers show a projected budget surplus of $630 million after November tax revenue came in $45 million higher than expected. For 2020, state revenues were ahead of projections by nearly $170 million, or 10.6%. Little warned that tax cuts and investments are threatened by the pandemic that could overwhelm hospitals with COVID-19 patients. Among those getting sick with the virus are health care workers, he said. “Health and the economy are intertwined,” Little said. “Idahoans must choose to do a better job of wearing masks and avoiding gatherings with people outside their households if we are going to continue this trend.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state’s public health department reported 29 COVID-19-related deaths Saturday, the smallest one-day total in Illinois since mid-November. Not only was the total, included in a news release from the Illinois Department of Public Health, lower than any single day since Nov. 13, but it is also just about a quarter of the 111 daily deaths the state has been averaging over the past two weeks. The latest numbers bring the number of COVID-19-related deaths in Illinois since the pandemic began to 16,674 and the number of cases to 975,352. The health department also reported that there were 4,762 new confirmed and probable cases, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 975,352. But the release included a potentially worrisome statistic as well. The cases that were detected among 61,987 tests submitted on New Year’s Day helped raise the statewide average positivity rate over the past week to 8.3% from 6.8% a week ago, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Anxiety, depression and other mental health conditions have become more prevalent among Hoosiers since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, the state’s top health officials said in calling for renewed attention on mental health resources. Many of those reporting mental health woes are affected by COVID-19 itself, Jennifer Sullivan, secretary of the state’s Family and Social Services Administration, said during Gov. Eric Holcomb’s weekly briefing Wednesday on the state’s coronavirus response. That includes dealing with loss and fear, disruption to daily life with recurrent needs for quarantine and isolation, changes to school and work schedules, unexpected illness of friends and family, and disruption to normal social supports. Cold weather and the holiday season, too, have likely added difficulties for people with existing mental illnesses and those experiencing acute stress, she said. As a way to help, Sullivan encouraged Hoosiers to use the state-run BeWellIndiana.org to take a mental health self-assessment. Since April, more than 25,000 Hoosiers have completed those assessments. For more than three-quarters of those taking the surveys, there was confirmation of a mental health diagnosis, Sullivan said.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A federal judge has rejected an argument by Tyson Foods that is is not liable in the death of a worker because it was following federal guidance when it kept meatpacking plants open during the coronavirus pandemic. Tyson was sued in August by the family of Isidro Fernandez, who worked at the company’s plant in Waterloo, after he died April 26 from complications of COVID-19. More than 1,000 Tyson workers tested positive for the virus in May, and at least six died. The families of Fernandez and at least three other employees who died claim in lawsuits that the company was negligent in how it reacted to the pandemic. Tyson fired seven managers in December after an investigation found that supervisors held a betting pool on how many employees would test positive for the coronavirus. The Fernandez case was filed in state court but was moved at Tyson’s request to federal court after the company claimed it was following the direction of federal officials, including President Donald Trump, when it remained open in April. But last Monday, U.S. District Judge Linda Reade rejected the argument.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state will rely on genetic tests to identify cases of a new and apparently more contagious coronavirus strain that was first seen in England, the director of the state Department of Health and Environment said last week. No cases of the new strain have been detected in Kansas. Cases have been confirmed in Colorado, Florida and California. Dr. Lee Norman said Kansas already does genetic testing with about 1% of COVID-19 patients and plans to increase its lab capacity so it can do more tests. Norman told reporters during a Statehouse news conference that Kansas already has seen other variations of the virus that causes COVID-19, including a “Utah strain” and a “Wisconsin strain.” “Viruses always change, kind of over time, with minor genetic variations. Mostly, they don’t make much difference,” Norman said. “They’re more alike than different, quite honestly.” The state on Friday reported another 138 deaths from COVID-19 since Wednesday, for a total of 2,879 since the pandemic began. Kansas has confirmed 227,745 COVID-19 cases, an increase of 5,312 since Wednesday, the health department said.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: New coronavirus cases leaped in the state in the week ending Saturday, rising 22.7% as 18,408 cases were reported. The previous week had 14,999 new cases of the virus that causes COVID-19. Kentucky ranked No. 24 among the states where the coronavirus was spreading the fastest on a per-person basis, a USA TODAY Network analysis of Johns Hopkins University data shows. Testing has changed around the holidays, making comparisons difficult. Labs and testing sites closed. People traveled or prepared for the holidays instead of getting tested. The worst weekly outbreaks on a per-person basis were in Boyle, Lawrence and Clinton counties. Adding the most new cases overall were Jefferson County, with 2,743 cases; Fayette County, with 1,170 cases; and Kenton County, with 702. Weekly case counts rose in 79 counties from the previous week. The worst increases from the prior week’s pace were in Oldham, Hardin and Jefferson counties. The share of Kentucky test results that came back positive was 18.9% in the latest week, compared with 13.6% in the week before, a USA TODAY Network analysis of COVID Tracking Project data shows.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: With the announcement that the state soon will allow people ages 70 and older to get the coronavirus vaccine, residents clamoring for the immunizations have hurried to pharmacies trying to receive a shot, even though those vaccinations don’t begin until Monday and require a scheduled appointment. The Louisiana Department of Health said Friday that it has received multiple reports of people who meet the new, expanded criteria showing up at pharmacies, overwhelming their phone lines and even calling some hospitals trying to get vaccinated days before doses are available. Health department spokeswoman Aly Neel stressed that only a limited supply of 10,000 Moderna vaccine doses will be available this week for those newly eligible, that only certain pharmacies will be administering those doses, and that appointments are required to receive the shot, or the person will be turned away. Still, news of wider availability was drawing intense interest, which Neel described as a promising sign. With thousands of first doses of the two-dose vaccines administered to the first-prioritized groups, Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Thursday that he is expanding the list to include anyone 70 and older, people with kidney failure and additional health care workers.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Protesters gathered outside the Maine Statehouse on Saturday to criticize how Democratic Gov. Janet Mills has handled the coronavirus pandemic. WABI-TV reports the protest organized by the Swinging Gate Organization attracted a large crowd despite snowy weather. “There’s this undercurrent of pent-up energy that’s not doing well under this governor’s rule, and it’s important to harness that organic energy that’s out here that needs something to do; their hands are tied,” said event organizer Dick Campbell. More than 25,000 people have tested positive for the virus in Maine, including nearly 350 new confirmed cases announced Sunday. One additional death was announced, bringing the total since the pandemic began to 359. Just under 33,000 people in the state have been vaccinated against the virus. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Maine increased over the past two weeks, going from 445 on Dec. 19 to 528 on Saturday.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Maryland Department of Health is working with regional and federal partners to test patient samples for infection with the new variant of the coronavirus. The Baltimore Sun reports the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are collaborating with the state’s public health lab, as well as state laboratories in California and Delaware, to test for the apparently more contagious variant. There have been at least two cases of the COVID-19 variant identified in the U.S., one in California and another in Colorado. A Maryland health department spokesman said the variant has not been detected in Maryland. The CDC has said medical professionals do not now believe that the new variant is more deadly than existing ones or that it will not respond to vaccines. But it could much more contagious and make the pandemic even harder to contain.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker signed a wide-ranging health care bill Friday that he said will codify in law many of the emergency changes made to the state system in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The Republican said the new law extends requirements for all insurance carriers in Massachusetts to cover COVID-19 testing and treatment. It also increases insurance coverage for telehealth services, which have become vital during the pandemic. Baker’s office said the law also expands the scope of practice for nurse practitioners, other specialized nurses and optometrists; takes steps to protect consumers from surprise medical bills; and calls for a study on the effects of COVID-19 on the health care system, among other steps. Meanwhile, a COVID-19 field hospital that was supposed to open at UMass Lowell last week instead will open Monday after staffing shortages delayed the “soft launch.” While the site has capacity for 77 beds, the facility has so far only recruited enough nurses to staff one 14-bed pod. Lowell General Hospital currently has 63 COVID-19 patients at its main campus.\n\nMichigan\n\nCalumet: A judge has ordered the shutdown of a cafe in Michigan’s Upper Peninsula where customers have been supporting an owner who has defiantly served indoor diners despite coronavirus restrictions. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration got a restraining order against Cafe Rosetta in Calumet, a small town in Houghton County. Since November, bars and restaurants in Michigan have been limited to carryout service or outdoor dining in an effort to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Kristi Painter, a state food scientist, visited the cafe for an undercover exam and observed a busy place with 17 people eating or drinking. She ordered a cup of bean soup and a half turkey sandwich. “I did not observe any signs encouraging mask use. … I observed a tip-jar like container that was labeled ‘Legal Fund-join our fight to stand up for your rights,’ ” Painter said in a court filing. Cafe co-owner Amy Heikkinen, a mother of six, said she can’t afford to limit her business to carryout orders. She said sales are up because of her dispute with authorities. “It’s my right to earn an income to protect and feed my family,” she said. “That’s the right of every American. You can’t make me not work.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state on Saturday reported 54 deaths from COVID-19, along with 2,543 positive coronavirus tests, in its final reporting period of 2020. The new numbers bring the state’s pandemic death toll to 5,377 people. A total of 417,832 cases of the coronavirus were detected since the pandemic began. The Department of Health has reported a slowdown in new cases, with the average number of daily new cases decreasing by 48% over the past two weeks. In that period, the state reported one of the nation’s lowest rates of new cases per capita, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. Gov. Tim Walz has kept a ban on indoor dining in place through the holiday period, but some businesses defied that order for New Year’s celebrations. The attorney general has sued one such bar, Alibi Drinkery in Lakeville, for repeated violations of the order. Despite a court injunction ordering it to close, people packed into the bar for a New Year’s party, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: A hospital is offering $5,000 bonuses for qualified nurses as it works to recruit staff during a pandemic and at a time when health care workers are in short supply. WCBI reports Baptist Memorial Hospital - Golden Triangle is offering a number of incentives including the bonus as it works to recruit amid a nationwide nursing shortage. Johnny Judson is responsible for recruiting nurses for the hospital. “I am literally in every school, nursing school, in the area, including along the Alabama border,” he told the station. “I go up to north Mississippi, south Mississippi, and I go to these nursing schools, and I talk to these students.” He said the country’s nursing shortage has been going on for years, and the coronavirus pandemic has made things worse. The bonus is for registered nurses with at least two years of experience. Judson stressed that there are no shortcuts when it comes to hiring new staff. “We put incentives in place to attract more people, but we don’t lower the standards,” he said.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The chairman of the Missouri Veterans Commission resigned after releasing an investigative report that criticized the commission for its response to the coronavirus pandemic, which has claimed more than 140 lives at seven veteran nursing homes since September. Tim Noonan told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch on Thursday that he was resigning, citing comments Gov. Mike Parson made last week about the veterans and the commission. A summary of the investigation was released earlier in December, but Noonan, who was commission chairman since 2017, had resisted an open records request from the Post-Dispatch to release the full report. Officials inside Parson’s administration and state Sen. Jill Schupp, a Democrat from Creve Coeur, had urged Noonan to release the full report, and he did so after Attorney General Eric Schmitt directed him to, Noonan said. That came after Parson on Wednesday expressed frustration with the commission, which is an independent body. “I’m not going to worry about everybody’s personal lives that sit on the commission, or the chairman,” Parson said. “I’m just going to absolutely worry about the veterans, and that’s my whole focus.” Noonan said he resigned because of those comments.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Montana PBS has announced plans to renew a broadcast created at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic in March to support schoolchildren who were learning remotely or in temporary quarantine. The new schedule for the Learn at Home broadcast was set to launch Monday and continue through the end of the school year June 4, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. The shows run each weekday from 6:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and cover multiple subjects from language arts, social studies, science and math for elementary and middle school students. “We know that not all households in the state have the same access to devices and a strong internet connection but that most homes have a TV that receives our broadcast signal,” Montana PBS Director of Education Nikki Vradenburg said. Chief Operator Paul Heitt-Rennie estimated most households have tuned into the Learn at Home program. He said Nielsen data through the summer showed it was watched by up to 150,000 households, or up to 45% of households in the state. “Every educator we talked to asked us to keep it going,” Vradenburg said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Restaurants that were allowed to start selling carryout cocktails amid the pandemic want to continue doing so even after the public health crisis wanes. The Omaha World-Herald reports the Nebraska Restaurant Association plans to push for the expansion during the upcoming 2021 legislative session. The waiver extends until the end of the pandemic emergency. “This is a way for our restaurants to survive and come out the other side of this pandemic,” said Zoe Olson, the executive director of the restaurant group. Olson said the association’s proposal would include a requirement for some sort of seal on carryout beverages that, if broken, would indicate someone had opened their takeout drink in transit. The proposal would also end to-go drinks at some point, so legislators could review the policy and decide whether it should be extended. But the idea is getting some pushback from groups that oppose binge drinking and drunken driving. “When you increase the availability and the ease of access to alcohol, that’s when you get increased harms,” said Chris Wagner, executive director of Project Extra Mile, an Omaha-based group that seeks to prevent or reduce problems associated with alcohol.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Community advocates and health officials are working to engage with the state’s diverse communities and reach out in Spanish and other languages as Nevada lays plans for mass coronavirus vaccinations. Erika Marquez, a University of Nevada, Las Vegas public health professor and vice chair of the Nevada Minority Health & Equity Coalition, said merely translating information about the vaccine into other languages is not enough. “We had to engage these communities in the conversation, and that takes some time,” Marquez told the Las Vegas Sun. Nevada is a diverse state with a 29% Latino population that includes native Spanish speakers. Nevada also has a fast-growing group of Asian American and Pacific Islanders, of which 70% speak a language other than English at home, according to data shared by Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote. Marquez’s coalition has been working throughout the pandemic to share information encouraging physical distancing, hand hygiene and masks with diverse communities and is preparing vaccine education materials in English, Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, Chinese and Thai.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has set a goal of administering 100 shots per hour at each of the 13 state-run COVID-19 vaccination sites when it moves to Phase 2. Perry Plummer, the former assistant commissioner of safety, is overseeing vaccine distribution. He told WMUR-TV the goal is realistic, but it will take time to get the effort up to speed. “We expect this to be a little bit of a windy road and to make sure we’re ready to take turns wherever we need to, to make sure we can get people vaccinated in the State of New Hampshire as quickly as possible,” Plummer said. The first phase of distribution has focused on health care workers, nursing home residents and staff, and first responders. The second phase includes teachers, critical workers in high-risk settings, homeless shelter residents and others. As of Friday, more than 21,000 vaccines had been administered.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: More than 70% of the state’s supply of COVID-19 vaccine had not been used as of Thursday, echoing a national trend of slow distribution, according to data released by state officials. Of the 265,000 doses of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines that have been delivered to New Jersey, 72,657 residents had been given a shot by Thursday afternoon. Despite months of planning, state officials said Wednesday that a lack of personnel, along with logistics and timing issues, was to blame. “Remember, you need health care workers to do this,” Gov. Phil Murphy said at a briefing. “I’m not qualified to deliver these vaccines.” The slow rollout has been frustrating to a public eager to end a pandemic that has infected at least 477,000 New Jerseyans, killed more than 19,000 and caused vast economic hardship. State Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said the rollout of the Moderna vaccine in particular has been slow because it was delivered just before Christmas. Persichilli said 57% of the state’s stockpile of Pfizer doses had been administered as of Wednesday, calling it “one of the highest percentages that I’ve seen nationally.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: More than 6,500 businesses and nonprofits will receive up to $50,000 under a state program created to help companies cope with economic fallout from the pandemic. That’s about half of the companies that applied, the Albuquerque Journal reports. “The number (of applications) that we couldn’t fund was very hard for us,” said Marquita Russel, CEO of the New Mexico Finance Authority, the state agency that administered the program. The state implemented the program to help businesses as part of a bigger $320 million coronavirus relief package passed by New Mexico lawmakers. The program uses $100 million in federal coronavirus relief funds allocated to the state. About $40 million of that sum was allocated for businesses located outside the state’s four largest cities. Russel said while her agency had expected to receive roughly 10,000 applications, it received more than 14,000. In all, 6,530 applications were funded. Russel said the agency prioritized businesses that experienced the most significant losses as a result of the pandemic.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The New York City Sheriff’s Department shut down a series of illegal New Year’s Eve parties for violating coronavirus restrictions, operating without a liquor license and other infractions, authorities announced Friday. More than 300 people gathered Thursday night for karaoke and dancing at an illegal bottle club on 58th Street in Queens, the department said on Twitter. Five people were charged with offenses including violating emergency orders that ban indoor gatherings, providing alcohol without a liquor license and obstructed egress. Deputies also raided an illegal gathering on Prince Street in Soho, where more than 145 people were partying in a space with no liquor license, the department said. Four people were charged with multiple offenses. The patrons were not wearing masks in the venue’s overcrowded sixth floor. Deputy sheriffs also found nearly 80 people dancing and smoking hookah at Stars Hall in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn. The organizer of the event was ticketed for violating an executive order.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: COVID-19 hospitalizations and test positivity rates both are reaching record highs in the state. The News & Observer of Raleigh reports there were a record-high 3,576 people hospitalized with COVID-19 over the weekend, according to data reported by 95% of the state’s hospitals. Two weeks ago, there were 2,783 people hospitalized with the virus. That’s a difference of 793 people. On Friday, the last day for which data is available, the state’s health department says 13.6% of COVID-19 tests came back positive. That brought the seven-day average of daily testing results to 14.2%, the highest rate since at least April. The average is seen as giving a better indication of COVID-19 spread because it better accounts for daily spikes and valleys. Every day since Christmas has seen a double-digit positivity rate, including Thursday’s record-high 15.5%.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFort Yates: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is prioritizing the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines to those who speak Dakota and Lakota languages. Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Mike Faith told KXMB-TV the policy is aimed at keeping customs alive. “It’s something we have to pass on to our loved ones – our history, our culture, our language. We don’t have it in black and white; we tell stories. That’s why it’s so important,” Faith said. The Standing Rock reservation straddles the North Dakota and South Dakota border and is home to about 8,000 people, more than half of whom live in North Dakota. Faith said only about 300 people on the reservation are fluent in the language. Front-line health care workers already have begun receiving the vaccine at the Fort Yates hospital, but starting this week, priority will be for those who speak their native language. In addition to those who can carry on the culture, the next phase includes elders, law enforcement, tribal courts and the school system, tribal officials said. Tribal Health Director Margaret Gates said the Lakota and Dakota speakers “are the most important asset to our tribe and people because of the language.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As Gov. Mike DeWine applies pressure to get COVID-19 vaccines administered faster throughout the state, those charged with inoculating people against the virus say a combination of factors has contributed to a slow rollout. Vaccines arrived during the holidays, when more workers were off and less likely to be available to get the vaccine. In some cases, “vaccine hesitancy” has contributed to lower demand as well, they say. Shipments also have been unpredictable, sometimes arriving later than expected or in smaller quantities than previous allotments, making it difficult to plan for distribution. Protocols require a 15-minute observation window for each patient, limiting the number of people who can cycle through a chair each day. “This is not your routine stop by the primary care office to get a flu shot. This is a whole different operation,” said Dr. Andy Thomas, chief clinical officer at Ohio State University’s Wexner Medical Center. On Wednesday, DeWine said he had grown “impatient” with the rollout and challenged hospitals to administer the vaccine within 24 hours of receiving it, calling it a “moral imperative” to get the vaccine out as quickly as possible.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state has reported more than 1,000 new COVID-19 cases, as hospitalizations from the disease caused by the novel coronavirus remained near their all-time high. Oklahoma recorded 1,083 new confirmed cases of the virus Friday and another 38 fatalities, state health officials said Saturday. The Oklahoma State Department of Health has delayed reporting case counts over the holiday weekend. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven’t been tested, and some who get sick don’t show symptoms. There were 1,910 people hospitalized with the virus in Oklahoma on New Year’s Day, according to the department. The state’s record was set last Monday, when there were 1,927 people with the virus in Oklahoma hospitals. Over the past week, more than 18% of coronavirus tests in Oklahoma have come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A health care worker was hospitalized after having a severe allergic reaction to the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, according to the Oregon Health Authority. The worker, an employee at Wallowa Memorial Hospital, experienced anaphylaxis after receiving a first dose of the vaccine last week, officials said late Thursday. The health authority said vaccines for COVID-19 can cause mild to moderate side effects in some people, including pain and swelling on the arm and sometimes fever, chills, tiredness and headache. “The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that in rare cases, some people have experienced severe allergic reactions after getting a COVID-19 vaccine,” health officials said in a press release. “An allergic reaction is considered severe when a person needs to be treated with epinephrine or EpiPen, or if they must go to the hospital.” Health officials will continue to track adverse reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Scores of costumed performers took to the streets of their south Philadelphia stomping grounds for a New Year’s celebration of Mummers tradition, far from the customary parade route and despite official cancellation of the annual event and a ban on large gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic. Participants in brightly colored costumes, some with faces painted, paraded down 2nd Street in South Philadelphia on Friday following trucks that blared string band or popular music. Some wore masks, but many did not. Mayor Jim Kenney announced in July that the city would not grant permits to planned outdoor events with more than 50 people, effectively canceling the large annual parade and other events as officials struggled to keep a lid on the spread of the virus. Some Mummers leaders and organizations also asked members to stay home. City spokeswoman Lauren Cox said there were no major issues Friday but said seeing pictures of many participants without masks was “very concerning given the seriousness of this current wave of the pandemic.” She urged voluntary quarantines and testing for anyone who had been in large crowds.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The first person to get vaccinated against the coronavirus in the state got his second shot Saturday. Dr. Christian Arbelaez, an emergency room physician at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence, received his second dose without the fanfare that surrounded him nearly three weeks prior, the Providence Journal reports. The moment came as his workplace continues to treat a post-Thanksgiving wave of patients and is bracing for another wave after Christmas and New Year’s Day. “It’s this perfect storm – can we take care of everyone?” Arbelaez said. “Do we have capacity? Do we have front-line workers well enough? Those are all the things that worry me.” More than 20,500 people have received their first shots in Rhode Island, according to state health officials.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Nearly 700 nonprofits are receiving state grants totaling $25 million to help offset costs during the coronavirus pandemic. The state Department of Administration announced Wednesday that 686 nonprofits would receive grants ranging from $2,500 to $50,000. Among the groups that got the money are arts organizations, churches and food banks. The grants can be used to cover expenses such as staffing and operating costs as well as personal protective equipment and revenue loss. The state had to turn down another several million dollars’ worth of requests, as a total of 1,590 nonprofits applied for $76 million in aid. The volume of requests led to a two-week delay in notifying winners. That delay had put more stress on businesses already strained by the pandemic, Frank Knapp, president of the state’s Small Business Chamber of Commerce, told The Post and Courier. The monies were allocated by the Legislature in September to spend federal COVID-19 aid for South Carolina. The state is also issuing $40 million to small businesses affected by the pandemic.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A federal judge says a state court can’t use the COVID-19 pandemic as an excuse to delay a Codington County trial. U.S. District Judge Charles B. Kornmann also criticized South Dakota’s response to the pandemic, saying it has done “little, if anything,” to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Kornmann ordered that unless the Codington County state court resolves Matthew Kurtenbach’s May 2019 case by Jan. 15, Kurtenbach will win a federal petition he filed claiming wrongful imprisonment and a violation of his right to a speedy trial. “South Dakota cannot ‘take advantage’ of its own failures to follow scientific facts and safeguards in entering blanket denials of the rights of speedy trials,” the judge wrote. Kurtenbach petitioned the court at least 25 times for a right to a speedy trial. At one point, Kornmann directly criticized Gov. Kristi Noem’s actions during the pandemic. “The Governor has steadfastly refused to impose a statewide mask mandate. She has often questioned publicly the scientific fact that mask wearing prevents the virus from spreading,” the judge wrote.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Shelby County Health Department will begin vaccinating workers and residents at congregate care facilities, including nursing homes and assisted living facilities, this week, the department said Saturday. The health department started vaccinating first responders with the Moderna vaccine Dec. 28 and is continuing to vaccinate law enforcement officers, firefighters and paramedics, said spokesperson Joan Carr. Doug McGowen, chief operating officer for the City of Memphis, said there are 50,000 health care workers and 6,000 first responders in the Shelby County community, and “it’s going to take a while” to get all of those individuals vaccinated. Some people in priority group 1a2, which includes funeral home workers and people who are 75 or older, have also been vaccinated by the health department. As of Saturday afternoon, all the available weekend appointments for vaccinations at the department’s two drive-thru centers had been filled. The health department has also started vaccinating staff at mass COVID-19 testing sites.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Coronavirus hospitalizations fell slightly Saturday but remained near their record high, as health officials said there were about 600 intensive care beds available across the state of nearly 29 million people. Texas reported 12,319 COVID-19 patients in hospitals Saturday, ending five consecutive days of record-breaking hospitalizations. But even with the decrease of more than 160 patients from Friday, the virus continued to strain medical resources. Intensive care units in several parts of Texas were full or nearly full, with 626 ICU beds available statewide Saturday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. The department reported 96 new fatalities, as well as 3,995 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 487 probable cases. The actual number of cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven’t been tested, and some who get sick don’t show symptoms. Over the prior seven days, nearly 1 in 5 coronavirus tests in Texas came back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Less than a quarter of the 127,375 doses of COVID-19 vaccine reportedly received in the state have been used to vaccinate health care providers and long-term care facility residents and staff as of the end of the year, Deseret News reports. “The initial rollout of the vaccine has been slow, slower than anticipated, slower than we wanted,” said Rich Lakin, immunization program director with the Utah Department of Health. “We hope to be at a much faster pace in the next 15 days.” Utah is already starting to speed up the process, health department spokesperson Tom Hudachko said Thursday. More than 6,000 doses were reportedly administered in the state Thursday, double the daily increases earlier in the week. What’s making the difference, Hudachko said, is that local health departments, including tribal clinics, and long-term care facilities are able to give doses much faster than hospitals. In Davis County, a mass drive-thru clinic at the Legacy Events Center is able to vaccinate 28 health care workers at a time with appointments, he said. At long-term care facilities, CVS and Walgreens and other contractors are quickly inoculating both residents and staff.\n\nVermont\n\nStamford: The town has voted to overturn in its community Gov. Phil Scott’s emergency orders issued with the intention of protecting the state during the COVID-19 pandemic. The select board of the town of about 800 people along the Massachusetts border voted 3-2 Tuesday to “terminate” the governor’s restrictions. The three board members in favor of the idea cite a section of Vermont law that they believe allows them to reject the governor’s order. Select board member Daniel Potvin said during the meeting that quarantine requirements, restrictions on large family or public gatherings, and face mask requirements “violate the constitution” in part because they were imposed without normal due process of law. He asserted it was important to stand up against such measures because it could lead to more loss of personal freedoms later on. Scott hasn’t enforced the orders heavy-handedly, he said, “but that could change.” Potvin said Friday the town is expecting some type of legal action from the state of Vermont, but “until it’s cleared up, the governor’s orders are still in effect.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State Sen. Ben Chafin has died after contracting the coronavirus, Senate Republicans said Friday. Chafin represented southwest Virginia and was from Russell County. A Republican, he was first elected to the House of Delegates in 2013 and then moved to the state Senate in 2014. He was 60. Lawmakers from around the state mourned Chafin’s death late Friday. “I knew Ben as a lawmaker, an attorney, a banker, and a farmer raising beef cattle in Moccasin Valley, working the land just as generations of his family had done before him,” Gov. Ralph Northam said. “He loved the outdoors, and he loved serving people even more.” Senate Republicans said in a statement: “He served to ensure that his region and community, and the people he loved, would never be forgotten.” Chafin is the first Virginia lawmaker to die from the virus.\n\nWashington\n\nVancouver: Quartz Mountain Distillers was surprised last week by a $14,060 fine from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for producing hand sanitizer, but the company found out the next evening that the fee is not being enforced. Owner Randy Kyle said the distillery began making hand sanitizer in April. The family owners gave almost all of it away to help local health care workers remain safe, the Columbian reports. All distillers that made hand sanitizer during the COVID-19 pandemic were facing the fine. The Department of Health & Human Services on Thursday announced it was directing the FDA not to enforce the fine after the FDA received heavy backlash on social media. “Small businesses who stepped up to fight COVID-19 should be applauded by their government not taxed for doing so,” the Department of Health & Human Services said on Twitter. Kyle said he was unaware of any fine from the beginning of the pandemic. If the company were forced to pay it, he would have to closed down. “I’d just have to lock the door and walk away,” he said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state has reported a weekly record in the number of positive coronavirus cases entering the new year. West Virginia had at least 6,915 confirmed virus cases for the six-day period last week, excluding Sunday, according to health statistics. Officials have cautioned that figures could be skewed due to a lag in reporting cases over the Christmas holiday period. Sunday’s cases won’t be reported until Monday. Still, the state had its three highest daily figures last week since the start of the pandemic: at least 1,385 positive cases Tuesday, 1,618 Wednesday and 1,516 Thursday. Last week’s cases marked the ninth weekly record in the past 13 weeks. The previous record of 6,871 positive cases was set two weeks ago. There also were a record 810 people hospitalized for the virus Friday. As of Saturday there were a record 27,418 active cases of the virus statewide, up 57% in the past month.\n\nWisconsin\n\nGrafton: What was initially thought to be a major human error of someone damaging 57 vials of the coronavirus vaccine at the Aurora Medical Center Grafton has since grown into a federal investigation. A pharmacist at the facility intentionally removed 57 vials of the Moderna coronavirus vaccine from the refrigerator and left them out overnight knowing that the vaccines would be “useless” to those who received them. On Dec. 26, Aurora gave 57 people the vaccine from the tampered vials. After further review, the vials were discarded, and an investigation began. On Wednesday, Aurora notified Grafton police, and it became public that the vials were left out intentionally. The pharmacist was arrested Thursday. The FBI and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were also investigating, police said. Jeff Bahr, president of Aurora Health Care Medical Group, called the pharmacist a “bad actor.” According to Grafton police, the now-former pharmacist intentionally took the vials out of the refrigerator and left them out overnight knowing it would render the vaccines “useless” and make people who received them believe they were vaccinated when they were not.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Bars and restaurants across the state will be allowed to return to normal operating hours beginning next Saturday as COVID-19 hospitalizations decline in the state. Gov. Mark Gordon made the announcement last Saturday, praising businesses for adapting to health orders and thanking “the people of Wyoming who recognized the strain on their hospitals and health care workers and acted accordingly,” The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. “These have not been easy times for anyone,” he said. “We are not out of the woods yet, but continued personal safety measures while the vaccine is being distributed will enable our state’s schools and businesses to continue to remain open.” The updated health orders allow bars and restaurants to resume on-site consumption from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m., and they allow gyms to increase the number of participants in group fitness classes from 10 to 25. Counties can still opt out of the requirements if local conditions move to safer levels in accordance with White House metrics.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/events/2023/01/23/fun-things-to-do-best-events-sarasota-bradenton-venice-feb-2023/69805771007/", "title": "Fun things to do, best events Sarasota, Bradenton, Venice Feb. 2023", "text": "As we near the end of January, February approaches with a fresh lineup of fun things to do, including some of our area's biggest annual events.\n\nThunder by the Bay Music & Motorcycle Festival and Venice Italian Feast & Carnival are set to return to Sarasota County, as are Bradenton Area River Regatta and Cortez Commercial Fishing Festival in Manatee County.

Daily Times\n\nThink back to those summer nights at the beach. In the dunes by the shore, did you ever spot a firefly?\n\nWhen you saw it, did it look different than the others, with a bright green light instead of a warm yellow glow? Did it flash twice, not once?\n\nIf so, you saw one of the rarest creatures on earth, the Bethany Beach firefly. The bugs are found only along the coast of Delaware, mostly from the Indian River Bridge and south, according to Delaware State University Associate Professor Christopher Heckscher. He helped rediscover the firefly back in 1998, after it went more than four decades unseen by scientists.\n\nIt looks a lot like the bug people are most familiar with, the common Eastern firefly, except it is half the size.\n\nWith the recent completion of Delaware’s Wildlife Action Plan for 2015 through 2025, there is now a guide for how to protect the endangered firefly, along with other species of concern in Delaware. Right now the bugs are facing four major threats, according to Heckscher: impacts from past development, sea-level rise, invasive species and future development.\n\nThe bugs are only found in wetlands that are formed in the depressions between dunes called interdunal swales. Unlike other dune wetlands, the ones along Delaware’s coast are unique because they are freshwater – some even meet fresh groundwater sources.\n\n“It is my suspicion the reason the species is so rare is that they’re associated with these freshwater interdunal wetlands,” Heckscher said.\n\nBecause of Route 1, the dunes are unable to move. That’s good, because it allows them to remain freshwater, but in some ways it is bad because instead of interdunal wetlands, spots are becoming more heavily wooded and swamp-like.\n\n“That’s not real good for the fireflies,” Heckscher said. “By controlling the seas during storm events we’ve created a system where we’re losing interdunal swales.”\n\nThen there is the threat of future development – though because most of the firefly’s habitat is on state-owned land that’s less of a concern, according to state program manager for biodiversity Anthony Gonzon.\n\nBecause the swales are freshwater, salt water intrusion from things such as sea-level rise or storm events are also a major threat.\n\n“If we get sea-level rise to a certain point, we’re going to lose the freshwater aquifer that occurs under the dunes,” Heckscher said.\n\nInvasive species such as phragmites can also out-compete and kill native vegetation, another threat to the dune habitat.\n\nIn the wildlife action plan the state identifies actions to take moving forward, including creating a habitat and species management plan just for the firefly, planning for habitat movement and law enforcement to protect interdunal swales from disturbance. Gonzon said a part of that would be surveying the population.\n\n“It’s trying to create some resiliency in habitats,” Gonzon said. “There’s going to be things you can stop and there’s going to be things you can’t.”\n\nThe state will work with partners to look at the habitat and multiple species in it on a range of scales, from how the species interact with the worldwide ecosystem to how they interact with grains of sand.\n\n“Knowing what was there also gives us the opportunity to restore it after the fact,” he said.\n\nAnd the plan does that for all of Delaware, not just the coast. It is a guiding document for anyone’s use, stating which species the state is most concerned about, what issues impact them and how to protect them. The state’s last wildlife plan allowed them to get funding that contributed to the restoration of osprey populations in the area, Gonzon said.\n\nThe plan can be found online at www.dnrec.delaware.gov.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/10/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2022/07/02/fireflies-possible-extinction-across-us/7795410001/", "title": "Fireflies face challenges, possible extinction across the US", "text": "Chasing lightning bugs on a summer night is a rite of passage for many youngsters.\n\nYou know how it goes, pursuing the flickering lights across the dusk sky until you clap your hands in a sphere around one. And then waiting to catch a glimpse of the small flash between your fingers before letting it go again.\n\nIn North America, there are more than 170 species of Lampyridae, or light-emitting beetles, and there are more than 2,000 types worldwide. And they've been around for millions of years.\n\nBut you may feel as if you are seeing fewer flashes across the night sky compared to when you were younger. You could be right, because there are signs the flashy beetle that once was so commonplace – as was the pastime of catching them – may become a thing of the past.\n\nLightning bugs or fireflies:What are those glowing insects called?\n\nShort answer: Fireflies are hurting\n\nThe lights of fireflies are being snuffed out. At least that’s what the evidence suggests.\n\n“If we go from qualitative assessment alone, they seem to be on the decline,” said Sérgio Henriques, the invertebrate conservation coordinator for the Indianapolis Zoo’s Global Center for Species Survival.\n\n“If you ask people on the street,” he said, “many people will fondly think of a time when they used to see more and now don’t see as many.”\n\nPart of the problem, however, is that there isn’t great data on lightning bugs to be able to speak quantitatively or with specificity.\n\nResearchers across the country, like Henriques, are trying to change that. They are working to gather more information. There has been a recent and ongoing effort to better grasp populations of lightning bugs, or fireflies, across North America and assess the threat of extinction, he said.\n\nThe results of that research were fascinating – if not frustrating.\n\nThe fireflies they surveyed fell into three main categories. The first are species that are considered not threatened, and Henriques said there are just a few like that. These are species with a wide geographic range and that alone makes them of lesser concern at the moment.\n\nThe second group makes up 40% and includes those fireflies where too little is known about them: “They have been seen so little and reported so infrequently,” Henriques said. While that means they could be doing well, they also could be in such a small pocket that they are on their way out or, worse, are already gone.\n\nThe last set is the threatened category, which accounts for about 14% of types of fireflies. These are the species where there is enough information to know they are on the decline.\n\nThese include the Bethany Beach firefly (Photuris bethaniensis), which is only found along the Atlantic coastline in Delaware, according to The Xerces Society. The conservation group based in Portland, Oregon has been working with the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) to document fireflies' plight.\n\nLong answer: Habitat, light pollution and chemicals\n\nFor fireflies, \"primary drivers of decline include habitat loss and degradation, light pollution, and climate change,\" according to the State of the Fireflies of the United States and Canada report issued in January 2022 by the Xerces Society, IUCN and Albuquerque BioPark.\n\nFireflies do well in areas with some moisture and humidity – they often live near ponds, streams, marshes, rivers and lakes or in the margins where these areas meet fields and forests. However, as the climate continues to change and we have more drought-like conditions, the ecosystems and conditions where they survive are shrinking.\n\nThe beetles also are losing their habitat to development. As forested areas or those with tall grasses and native species continue to be lost to buildings, parking lots and perfectly manicured lawns, lightning bugs are left without a home.\n\nAnother major reason they are suffering is because of light pollution.\n\nDecades ago, there were not as many lights, such as lights on streets corners and outside of homes. While they are good for the safety of cities and roads, not so much for the fireflies.\n\n“That comes at a cost for wildlife that 'sings' with light,\" Henriques said.\n\nThe firefly's light is like a whisper, he said, “while our lights are really loud in comparison and drown them out.”\n\nFireflies have a pretty short lifespan – just a couple months – and thus a narrow window to reproduce. All the lights at night disorient them and can interfere with their ability to find a mate.\n\nEveryone from homeowners to city planners can help fireflies in their search for a mate, said Lynn Faust, author of \"Fireflies, Glow-worms, and Lightning Bugs: Identification and Natural History of the Fireflies of the Eastern and Central United States and Canada.\"\n\n\"Any nighttime light reduction will help fireflies find mates: Your back porch light, all night floodlights all the way to horribly brightly lit-like-battleships school and businesses and towns,\" she said. \"Individually people need to be mindful of all outdoor lighting they use- use it when needed but otherwise turn it out.\"\n\nScrub Hub: Is there a good turf grass replacement that’s dog-friendly and low- or no-mow?\n\nThere are a couple species of lightning bugs that do better, though still not well, with light. That includes a species called the Big Dipper, which is what firefly spotters likely see in backyards across the eastern half of the U.S. While they will avoid light where possible, they can tolerate it for a bit longer than most others.\n\nOne of the other main threats comes from chemicals: The use of pesticides and herbicides on lawns. While meant for annoying mosquitoes or pesky weeds, those applications can wreak havoc on fireflies in multiple ways\n\nLightning bug larvae are extremely sensitive, so those chemicals can poison and kill them while they are still in the soil before growing wings. The pesticides can also kill their food – largely slugs and snails and other types of bugs – so they are left with nothing to eat. If the chemicals don’t wipe out their dinner, it gets in their system and effectively poisons the fireflies when they feed.\n\nAll these issues are putting fireflies at risk, and to lose a family of insects that have been around for 100 million years would be a travesty, experts said.\n\n\"The fleeting wonder of watching fireflies reminds me not to take things for granted – not time, not the tiny beings that live around us, not the healthy habitats that sustain biodiversity. Fireflies remind us that we are lucky to be alive and sharing the world with them,\" wrote endangered species conservation biologist Richard Joyce on The Xerces Society blog this week, noting this weekend's annual celebration of World Firefly Day on July 2.\n\nBeyond their beauty, lightning bugs serve critical environmental functions.\n\nThey loosen soil, which allows sunlight, oxygen and water to penetrate down below. The beetles also maintain a balance by eating slugs and snails, keeping those critters in check. And they serve an important role in the food chain themselves as grub for spiders and frogs, for example.\n\n“They are an indicator species of the health of the soil system,” said Cliff Sadof, a professor of entomology at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. “If they are going down, then we need to pay more attention to the health of our soils and the species that rely on them.”\n\nThere is an ongoing initiative to better survey and know the extent of lightning populations across the nation. Called the Firefly Watch, researchers are asking citizens to follow a procedure that allows them to count the number of fireflies they see over a short period of time.\n\nWhile this is a simple measure, citizen science efforts like this can help get a broad brush view of what is going on, Sadof said. It can help provide a foundation to help launch more in-depth studies.\n\n“If someone wants to contribute to our understanding of the abundance of fireflies,” he said, “that’s the best way to do it.”\n\nHenriques also said there are “little and easy” things you can do to help lightning bugs across the state. He suggests reducing lights at night, planting native species or installing a rain garden. Another option: reducing the chemicals you use on your yard or in your house.\n\n“Fireflies are a privilege,” he said. “It would be such a waste of a treasure if they were to decline or be gone.”\n\nContributing: Mike Snider, USA TODAY\n\nContact reporter Sarah Bowman via email at sarah.bowman@indystar.com and on Twitter: @IndyStarSarah.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/21/arthur-ashe-missing-marilyn-pacifier-eating-pup-news-around-states/39609687/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: A man wanted on drug and weapons charges has posted a video denying he fed methamphetamine to a so-called attack squirrel that he considers a pet. Mickey Paulk posted the video on his Facebook page Tuesday night as authorities continued searching for him. It shows him stroking a rodent that he indicates was the same one seized during a search and then released by authorities. “You can’t give squirrels meth; it would kill ’em. I’m pretty sure, (but) I’ve never tried it,” he said. Paulk said the squirrel was safe and not a threat to anyone. “The public isn’t in danger in any kind of way from the methed-out squirrel in the neighborhood,” he said with a laugh. He also said Wednesday that he was working with an attorney and relatives on a plan for turning himself in to authorities. Paulk said he had “a few loose ends to tie up,” including getting the squirrel to a temporary home in Tennessee.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Federal marine biologists for the first time have recorded singing by one of the rarest whales on the planet, the North Pacific right whale. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researchers used moored acoustic recorders to capture repeated patterns of calls made by male North Pacific right whales. It’s the first time right whale songs in any population have been documented, NOAA Fisheries marine biologist Jessica Crance says. She spoke to southern right whale and North Atlantic right whale experts to confirm that singing had not previously been documented. Researchers detected four distinct songs over eight years at five locations in the Bering Sea off Alaska’s southwest coast, Crance says. Only about 30 of the animals remain. Whalers nearly wiped out the slow-moving whales, which remain buoyant after they are killed.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State test scores are improving, but only by a few percentage points. Early AzMERIT standardized test results show small increases in the percentage of students passing the test in most grade levels in reading and math. But the scores still show more than half the students in most categories, including in third-grade reading, aren’t passing the test. Arizona’s education leaders introduced AzMERIT, an attempt at a reinvigorated state standardized test, in 2015. Schools have a lot riding on test scores. School letter grades are largely decided by test scores, and high-achieving schools get extra funding under the results-based funding program. This is also the first year high schools were able to opt out of the AzMERIT test and choose a different assessment over AzMERIT, such as the ACT and SAT exams.\n\nArkansas\n\nMountain Home: Hickory Park will get a splash of color this weekend thanks to Care Center Ministries of Mountain Home. Volunteers with the ministry will meet at 9:30 a.m. Saturday at the downtown park to paint the pavilion, park benches, some of the playground equipment and sidewalks. Anyone is welcome to come lend a hand Saturday morning, pastor Ty Cotter said. “We’ll have extra gloves, glasses and paint. They just need to show up,” he said. On June 1, Care Center Ministries representatives and civic leaders gathered at Hickory Park for a ceremony where the nonprofit “adopted” the care and upkeep of the facility. Saturday’s event will be the official kickoff of Care Center Ministry’s park stewardship, but volunteers have already been inside the park performing some landscaping work.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Officials say someone climbed a more than two-story-tall Hollywood public art piece and stole a statue of Marilyn Monroe. The statue depicting Monroe in her iconic pose from the 1955 film “The Seven Year Itch” went missing early Monday from the “Four Ladies of Hollywood” gazebo. Los Angeles Councilman Mitch O’Farrell says a witness saw someone climb the gazebo on the Hollywood Walk Fame and saw off the statue. Los Angeles police say investigators have recovered fingerprints from the gazebo. The gazebo, erected in 1994, pays tribute to women in film, with depictions of Dolores Del Rio, Dorothy Dandridge, Mae West and Anna May Wong making up the structure’s pillars. Monroe, whose real name was Norma Jeane Mortenson, died in 1962.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A report indicates the Mile High City had the highest increase in the nation in its violent crime rate last year, but crime remains low compared with the most violent large U.S. cities. The Denver Post reports the city recorded 629 violent crimes per 100,000 residents, resulting in a 9% increase between 2017 and 2018. The report by the Brennan Center for Justice shows the rates of homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults in the 25 most populous U.S. cities dropped 4% on average last year. Denver Police Deputy Chief Barb Archer says the department didn’t find a specific cause driving the violence. The department says all categories of crime have declined or stayed level for first five months of 2019.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont has signed legislation that increases the minimum age to purchase cigarettes and other tobacco products to 21. The bill signed into law Tuesday by the Democrat also prohibits the sale of electronic cigarettes and vaping products to anyone under 21. The new law takes effect Oct. 1. Harold Wimmer, president and CEO of the American Lung Association, says such “Tobacco 21” laws are “more important than ever” given the increase in youth e-cigarette use. He says adolescents and young adults are uniquely vulnerable to the effects of nicotine and nicotine addiction, making Connecticut’s legislation “an important, life-saving measure.” The law also bans smoking on the grounds of child care centers and schools. Critics say it violates the rights of adults ages 18 to 21.\n\nDelaware\n\nBethany Beach: As thousands of people flock to Dover for Firefly Music Festival, one of the world’s rarest fireflies is battling for survival at beaches in the state. The Bethany Beach firefly, a rare species found in only seven unique habitats along Delaware’s southern coast, lost one this year to new residential construction, according to a local scientist who has studied the species. At that new development, beach houses are being built on million-dollar lots in a wetland that had been identified as home to the state’s most dense population of the fireflies. “Imagine if you start losing the species, but you still have a Firefly Festival. That connection is lost,” said Tara Cornelisse, a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity. “I look to it as a beacon of hope, if we can protect it.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: District of Columbia lawmakers voted to add $47 million in excess reserves from the Washington Convention and Sports Authority to the city’s fiscal 2020 budget. The Washington Post reports $24 million will go toward fixing the city’s dilapidated public housing complexes. The rest will upgrade 911 dispatch centers. Tuesday’s approval came after a weeks­long dispute over whether the funds could be redirected from the reserve. The District’s chief financial officer, Jeffrey S. DeWitt, argued that using the funds would violate obligations to bondholders who invested in the convention center. He threatened not to certify the budget if the council redirected the money. However, a spokesman for DeWitt said the issue had been resolved Monday evening. Advocates said the money would cover renovating at least 400 units.\n\nFlorida\n\nHolmes Beach: Police trying to find the rightful owner of a prosthetic ear that washed up on their beach got a happy phone call from South Carolina on Thursday. Holmes Beach Police Sgt. Brian Hall said a woman called saying the rubber ear that police posted on Facebook belongs to her husband. Hall said the Beaufort couple was vacationing in the Tampa Bay area when the man went swimming. She said he was trying to put the ear in his pocket for safekeeping when “a wave knocked it off his hand.” The police department posted a photo of the left ear, saying a local resident found it in the sand Saturday after the “World’s Strongest Man” contest on Anna Maria Island. Prosthetic ears can cost thousands of dollars. Hall said the department will mail it to South Carolina. “We will put it in box. I hope nobody sees it and freaks out,” he said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is shifting its presidential primary to late March, leaving the group of states that vote on Super Tuesday. The primary has been set for March 24, three weeks after Super Tuesday is held March 3, which Georgia has joined in past election cycles. The date announced Wednesday by Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger could relegate the state’s voters to a less influential position in deciding each party’s nominee. But it will also give state and county election officials a bit of breathing room in a tight timeline to replace the state’s outdated touchscreen voting machines. New touchscreen machines are in the process of being acquired, and a vendor has yet to be selected.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. Navy will christen a new guided missile destroyer, the USS Daniel Inouye, during a ceremony this weekend. U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii will speak at Saturday’s ceremony in Bath, Maine. Inouye’s widow, Irene Hirano Inouye, will be the ship’s sponsor. The Arleigh Burke-class ship is being named after the war hero and politician who broke racial barriers in Congress. Inouye represented Hawaii in the U.S. Senate for a half-century until his death in 2012. He played key roles in congressional investigations of the Watergate and Iran-Contra scandals and served as chairman of the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee. He received the Medal of Honor for bravery in World War II with the mostly Japanese-American 442nd Regimental Combat Team. He lost his right arm.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: The University of Idaho has ordered a student who owns a beverage company to stop using the name “Vandal Beer.” The Moscow-Pullman Daily News reports university officials sent the letter, citing trademark infringement, to Vandal Beer owner R. Austin Nielsen earlier this week. The school’s mascot is the Vandals. Nielsen announced plans last week for his company to start producing the gold pale ale in Coeur d’Alene next month, with plans to release it in north-central Idaho retail stores in August. Nielsen said he pitched the Vandal Beer idea to the University of Idaho a while ago, but school officials told him he wasn’t allowed to use the Vandal name. He said he came up with the idea while he was a student in the university’s Idaho Entrepreneurs program. Nielsen has said he will donate a portion of all Vandal Beer sales to University of Idaho scholarships.\n\nIllinois\n\nWauconda: A Civil War reenactment at a northeastern Illinois forest preserve is back on after the event was temporarily canceled by a county official over questions of its value, as well as the use of the Confederate flag. The (Waukegan) News-Sun reports Lake County Forest Preserves District President Angelo Kyle announced Wednesday that Civil War Days will still be held July 13-14 at Lakewood Forest Preserve in Wauconda. Kyle noted contractual obligations for the event that’s been held for 27 years and can draw up to 3,000 people. The announcement comes two days after Kyle canceled the event over concerns about the reenactment not telling the victims’ perspective and featuring many Confederate flags. Wayne Carle, who helps plan the event, says the reenactors put on the show to keep history alive.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University is planning several events commemorating the upcoming 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing commanded by school alumnus Neil Armstrong. The university says events begin July 18 with a presentation on the landing by Apollo 11 flight director Gene Kranz, followed by a July 20 screening of “Armstrong,” a new documentary film featuring home videos shot by Armstrong and unseen footage from NASA. Purdue will host a special exhibition of items from its Armstrong archives July 19-20. Other July 20 events include children’s activities on the Purdue Mall and a lunar module landing celebration timed around the 4:17 p.m. touchdown ahead of Armstrong becoming the first person to walk on the moon. Armstrong, a 1955 Purdue graduate, died in 2012 at age 82.\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City: A company that’s been fined thousands of dollars for the stink coming from its plant has lost its lawsuit targeting the city’s odor ordinance. The Sioux City Journal reports Judge Leonard Strand of the U.S. District Court in Sioux City granted the city of Sibley’s motion for a summary judgment. Strand disagreed with Iowa Drying & Processing’s contention that the ordinance was unconstitutionally vague. Iowa Drying & Processing had said the city’s enforcement unfairly targeted the company and interfered with its efforts to sell the plant, which had drawn residents’ complaints for years. One resident, Josh Harms, sued Sibley after city officials threatened legal action against him for saying on a website that Sibley smelled like “rancid dog food.” Strand ruled against the city in Harms’ case.\n\nKansas\n\nHutchinson: Hutchinson Zoo director Ryan VanZant says last month’s flooding covered more than one-third of the zoo. The Hutchinson News reports the zoo – except for the gift shop and train – has been closed since May 21 after consecutive storms caused water to rise at the zoo. VanZant said in a Facebook post Wednesday that five buildings and two playgrounds were affected by flood waters. He said staff moved animals to safety ahead of the rising water and built temporary housing where the animals are being kept while waiting for the water to recede and the cleanup to begin. A Facebook fundraiser has been started to help cleanup costs. The Hutchinson Friends of the Zoo says the goal is to raise $10,000 before Family Fun Day on Aug. 17.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A state agency says it has secured another $5 million federal grant to continue a program providing youth-support services. Kentucky’s Department for Behavioral Health, Developmental and Intellectual Disabilities says the latest grant will continue the program through March 2024. The Transition Age Youth Launching Realized Dreams program allows youth ages 16 to 25 to easily access quality, developmentally appropriate, youth-driven support services. Officials say the goal is to help participants achieve their goals and transition into adulthood successfully. Officials say available services include expedited assistance in locating housing, mental health services and substance-abuse treatment. Since 2014, the program has helped more than 1,900 youth. Officials say youth and young adults can visit one of Kentucky’s 20 drop-in sites to access behavioral health services.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Billions of mosquito lookalikes are showing up in the area, blanketing car windshields, littering the ground with little bodies and even scaring some folks. They’re aquatic midges, often called “blind mosquitoes.” They don’t bite, and they’re good for the environment, but they’re a nuisance. Entomologist Nick Delisi of the St. Tammany Mosquito Abatement District says that “they tend to emerge in the billions.” Sloshing down bug-spattered windshields has become such a chore that the manager of the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway says Motorist Assistance Patrol trucks on the 24-mile-long bridge have had to replenish their water almost daily. Mosquito control officials say they don’t plan to do anything to control the swarms because they die in less than a week and their larvae clean up waterways.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Legislature sent a proposal to the governor Wednesday to ditch the state’s presidential caucuses for a primary system that would be the nation’s first to allow voters to rank candidates. The Democratic-led Senate approved funding the bill, which had already passed the House. It now heads to Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who hasn’t taken a position. As the 2020 presidential primary season nears, Maine is among an increasingly small handful of states that still have caucuses, including Iowa, Nevada and Wyoming. If primaries are approved, Maine voters will use ranked-choice voting to indicate which candidates they want delegates to support. That could get hairy in the Democratic primary, where more than 20 people are running.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A memorial dedication, gun violence forum and moment of silence are among the events scheduled for the one-year anniversary of the attack on The Capital Gazette newspaper that killed five employees. Police say a man with a history of harassing people at the paper shot and killed the journalists June 28, 2018, in its Annapolis newsroom. The Capital Gazette reports the attack will be formally remembered next week with a concert, the unveiling of a memorial garden, a forum on gun violence and a moment of silence. The events also coincide with Maryland’s first statewide observance of Freedom of the Press Day. At 2:33 p.m. June 28 – the time the gunman entered the newsroom – Tribune properties across the country will take a moment of silence for the victims.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A veterinary hospital got quite a surprise recently when a family brought in their bulldog after he stopped eating. The Angell Animal Medical Center found 19 baby pacifiers in the dog’s stomach. It started in April when the Wellesley family noticed that their 3-year-old dog, Mortimer, started getting nauseated before meals. His owner, Emily Shanahan, brought Mortimer to the vet, who prescribed medicine to take care of the issue. But it didn’t help, and Mortimer eventually stopped eating entirely. Shanahan went to Angell, where they took an X-ray and discovered the pacifiers. Vets think Mortimer had been taking the pacifiers from Shanahan’s two children over the course of months. The pacifiers were removed without surgery, and Mortimer has fully recovered and is back at home.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer has ordered state agencies to step up efforts to reduce phosphorus pollution and otherwise improve water quality in Lake Erie. Whitmer signed an executive directive Thursday instructing three state departments to support the initiative. The departments of Agriculture and Rural Development; Environment, Great Lakes and Energy; and Natural Resources will submit annual progress reports. Michigan adopted guidelines last year for making Lake Erie healthier, including cutting phosphorus loading into its western basin 40% by 2025. Whitmer’s directive puts a focus on lessening nutrient inflows from the Detroit River, the River Raisin and the Maumee River.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Peter: An invasion of gnats is presenting a risk to the health and lives of livestock in this southern Minnesota town. The Mankato Free Press reports that gnats cause weight loss and stress for any animal with their bites and by gathering around eyes and in airways. Brooke Knisley, who runs an organic produce farm with her husband in St. Peter, says one of her friends has lost 16 chickens to the gnats this year. Knisley says she’s trying to reduce the risk for her own flock by running fans in the chicken coop, hanging fly strips and placing vanilla-soaked rags near where the gnats congregate. Gnats are also an irritant for cattle and horses, and many owners are keeping their animals inside until the invasion passes.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Persistent flooding across wildlife management areas has decimated some wildlife habitats and food supplies, leading the state to allow supplemental deer feeding in Issaquena and Warren counties. The executive director of the state Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks says the deer stuck on a flooded levee have depleted their resources. Russ Walsh says the stressed deer are in bad shape. Resident Melissa Lyons raises two cattle on the levee and says that “the only things thriving are the buzzards.” She says the deer are starved and weak, and her husband recently removed 20 dead deer from their hay field. Supplemental feeding requires a wildlife agency permit that expires this fall.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: McDonald’s has started a trans-Atlantic barbecue feud with the introduction of a Kansas City-themed hamburger in the U.K. Outgoing Mayor Sly James said Tuesday that the fast-food chain should “stay in your lane” in a tweet that included a picture of what he says a “real” burger looks like. Kansas City is known for its style of dry-rubbed, slow-cooked meats drizzled in tomato-molasses sauce. Other Twitter users rushed to join the mocking after McDonald’s proclaimed “Yeehaw” as it promoted its “Kansas City Stack” on social media. Barbecue powerhouse Q39 kidded “Yeehaw, mate!” while Joe’s Kansas City Bar-B-Que retweeted a scathing critique of the burger along with a slew of various laughing emojis. McDonald’s says the bacon-topped burger is available until June 25, but not in America.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: AT&T has started dropping cellphone customers in the state’s northeast, citing customers’ regular data use outside its service area. The Billings Gazette reports the company began notifying customers earlier this year that they would lose their mobile coverage. AT&T spokeswoman Suzanne Trantow says the company can no longer be the primary provider for a “small number of customers who live or have a billing address outside our owned network coverage area.” She declined to give the specific area or the number of customers dropped. Verizon dropped the rural Montana customers in 2017, citing the costs of customers using data while roaming off its network. Scobey-based Nemont Telephone Cooperative has become the only provider for some parts of the region, but T-Mobile has been expanding operations.\n\nNebraska\n\nMcCook: Family Fun Nights have been scheduled for the summer at Red Willow State Recreation Area. The state Game and Parks Commission says a typical Family Fun Night begins at 6 p.m. with a meal provided by the park. Events start at 7 p.m. and include kayaking, fishing and archery. All equipment is provided. Just before dark, everyone heads back to the campfire to finish off the evening with s’mores. Family Fun Nights are scheduled for June 26, July 5 and 19, and Aug. 2. The park sits about 11 miles north of McCook, just west of U.S. Highway 83. A park entry permit is required. Go online at Calendar.outdoornebraska.gov for more information.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: City officials have activated a program that lets people settle fines for parking tickets with donations of school supplies. The Las Vegas City Council approved the program in 2016 and voted Wednesday to activate it for a month. Anyone who is issued a fine between June 19 and July 19 can clear it by taking new, unwrapped school supplies to the city’s parking services offices on Main Street. The donation has to be made within 30 days of receiving a parking ticket. The supplies must be of value equal to or greater than the fine. A receipt also is required. The supplies will be given to the Teacher Exchange, which serves about 390 schools in southern Nevada. It’s part of the Public Education Foundation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A committee of lawmakers has reached a compromise on changes to the state’s new work requirements for Medicaid recipients. The rules, which are just starting to take effect, require most recipients to spend at least 100 hours a month working, going to school or participating in community service. The House and Senate passed different versions of a bill to broaden the allowed exemptions and end the work requirements entirely if 500 people lost coverage. A committee reached a compromise Thursday to suspend, but not eliminate, coverage for noncompliance. The state would have until July 2021 to waive the requirements in several scenarios, including if the state is unable to contact all participants to explain the rules. The full Legislature will vote on the amended bill next week.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy has signed legislation requiring ride-hailing services to show additional identification after the March death of a University of South Carolina student who police say got into the car of an Uber impersonator. Among the new requirements is that ride-hailing services must issue two identifying markers to each driver. They must be displayed on the front windshield and rear window. Murphy, a Democrat, signed the legislation Thursday in Robbinsville, the hometown of Samantha “Sami” Josephson. The act is known as Sami’s Law. Police say Josephson got into the car of an Uber driver impersonator in Columbia, South Carolina. She was killed and her body dumped in the woods 65 miles away. A man has been charged with kidnapping and murder in the case.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLovington: Lea County has approved more than $5 million in upgrades to an airport in the heart of the state’s booming oil region. The Hobbs News-Sun reports the county commission gave the green light last week to improvements to the Lea County Regional Airport – most funded by federal and state grants. The improvements call for doubling the expansion of the holding area for flight patrons and renovating the apron area on the airside of the terminal. They also including upgrading a runway safety area and extending the primary runway. Officials say increased ridership is spurring the recommended improvements. The Lea County Regional Airport is located in Hobbs – a key city in the booming Permian Basin.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Artist Kehinde Wiley will unveil his first monumental public sculpture in Times Square this fall in response to Confederate statues nationwide. Times Square Arts, the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts and gallery owner Sean Kelly announced Thursday that the bronze “Rumors of War” sculpture features a young black man dressed in urban streetwear mounted atop a horse. The project originated when Wiley saw Confederate Gen. J.E.B. Stuart’s monument in Richmond, Virginia. Wiley is known for his paintings of black Americans and his commissioned portrait of President Barack Obama, displayed at the National Portrait Gallery. He says the new statue’s inspiration is war and “an engagement with violence.” “Rumors of War” will display in Times Square from Sept. 27 to December before finding a permanent home at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nOak Island: Advocates for sea turtles say a hefty fine is in store for whoever dug into a nest of loggerhead sea turtle eggs. The Oak Island Sea Turtle Protection Program says the nest was tampered with Monday. Sand was displaced from the covered hole, and it was burrowed into. The News & Observer reports none of the eggs were broken or harmed. But the group wants beachgoers to know that disturbing sea turtle nests carries a federal fine up to $50,000 and possible prison time. Last week, a woman was arrested in Miami after police said she stomped on sea turtle nests and poked them with a stake. Loggerhead turtles are protected under the Endangered Species Act.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s female prison population has reached capacity, leaving some inmates in the custody of counties. The Bismarck Tribune reports that the state’s female prison population reached capacity for the first time in May. Under 2017 legislation, county inmates are transferred to state prisons based on the severity of crimes, medical needs and other factors. Last week, only six of 12 inmates intended for movement from county to state were admitted. The statewide system for women has a daily average capacity of 224 inmates. Donnell Preskey, who represents the North Dakota Association of Counties, says a mechanism must be established to reimburse counties for the cost of holding inmates who should be in state facilities.\n\nOhio\n\nBrecksville: A national park that protects about a quarter of the Cuyahoga River is preparing to celebrate the river’s health 50 years after it infamously caught fire. A ceremonial torch traveling the length of the 85-mile-long river will make a stop in Cuyahoga Valley National Park on Friday afternoon on its way to Cleveland. The public event comes one day before the 50th anniversary of the June 22, 1969, fire. It will feature the passing of the Xtinguish Torch Fest torch along with music, poetry and the unveiling of a new sculpture. Speakers, including a regional director of the National Park Service, will outline efforts to restore the river from its abysmal earlier condition to a vibrant place for wildlife and outdoor recreation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney has announced plans to expand its operations at Tinker Air Force Base. Pratt & Whitney Vice President Kevin Kirkpatrick, Gov. Kevin Stitt and Mayor David Holt announced what is called a “multimillion-dollar investment” to expand its military aftermarket services at the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Complex based at Tinker. The project is also expected to add more than 100 jobs. Pratt & Whitney is a division of Farmington, Connecticut-based United Technologies Corp. and performs engine services and maintenance for the Air Force at Tinker.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Gov. Kate Brown deployed the state police Thursday to try to round up Republican lawmakers who fled the Capitol in an attempt to block a vote on a landmark climate plan that would be the second of its kind in the nation. Minority Republicans want the cap-and-trade proposal aimed at dramatically lowering the state’s greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to be sent to the voters for approval instead of instituted by lawmakers. Negotiations with Democrats fell apart late Wednesday, prompting conservatives to pursue a walkout, said Kate Gillem, a spokeswoman for Senate Republicans. Some members have even left the state to avoid a vote, Gillem said. State police don’t have jurisdiction beyond state lines. Democrats have an 18-to-12 majority in the chamber but need 20 members present for a quorum.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: A mural by the artist who painted the official portrait of Michelle Obama is being dedicated in the city. Amy Sherald’s overall body of work represents everyday lives of black Americans. So it’s fitting that the 6-story-tall mural dedicated Thursday portrays Najee Spencer-Young, a 19-year-old participant in Philadelphia’s Mural Arts education program. Sherald tells the Philadelphia Inquirer she chose Spencer-Young during a class trip to her studio. The artist saw it as an opportunity to boost the self-esteem of the teenager and those who look like her. The mural depicts Spencer-Young in a black-and-white flower print trench coach and mustard yellow hat, looking confident and composed – and very imposing – against a bright blue background.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo signed a bill Wednesday to preserve federal abortion protections in state law. The Senate passed the bill and immediately transmitted it to the House, which resumed its session to pass it. Raimondo signed it in her office, calling it an “important, consequential bill.” “Fundamentally this bill is about health care,” she said. Rhode Island is one of the Democratic-led states taking steps to enshrine the right to an abortion should the U.S. Supreme Court ever overturn the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Raimondo said she wanted to sign quickly, in light of the uncertainty across the nation. The new law says the state will not restrict the right to an abortion prior to fetal viability or afterward if an abortion is necessary for the health or life of the mother.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A zoo plans to send off two African elephants in order to bring in Southern white rhinos. Riverbanks Zoo and Garden of Columbia announced Wednesday that 48-year-old Robin and 37-year-old Belle will soon join a larger herd. The zoo says the public can attend special activities before the elephants leave. The destination for the elephants hasn’t been determined. Zoo officials say 13 elephants have lived at Riverbanks since 1973. The zoo says there is a chance elephants will return in the future. Director of Animal Care and Welfare John Davis says the zoo hopes to add more space and manage a breeding group one day. Southern white rhinos haven’t lived at the zoo since 1989. The new exhibit is scheduled to open next year.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Sioux Falls Freemasons and Architecture Inc. opened a time capsule Wednesday afternoon, revealing multiple artifacts the Masons had placed downtown nearly a hundred years ago. Lisa VandeVoort, business manager at Architecture Inc., said the time capsule – placed on June 6, 1924 – was opened as renovations were being done to the building. The Masons never specified a date to open the capsule, VandeVoort said, “so doing it during renovations made sense.” Dozens of items were removed from a box set in the building’s cornerstone, including a Masonic Bible, several editions of the Argus Leader and a typewritten copy of the address read during the time capsule ceremony 95 years ago. The capsule also included a sealed envelope with stamps from the time, as well as a handbook for new owners of telephones.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The three new eagles at Radnor Lake State Park’s Barbara J. Mapp Aviary Education Center are finally ready to meet the public. After months of park staff working to acclimate the eagles to their new environment, Radnor hosted a free open house Thursday, for American Eagle Day, for bird lovers to get at least a glimpse of the majestic creatures. “One of the long-term goals has been to have captive bald eagles (that could not be released back into the wild due to their injuries) in the aviary where visitors could interact with them,” Radnor Park manager Steve Ward said. The two bald eagles are housed in the park’s new $110,000 flighted aviary, a 38-foot-tall netted enclosure that gives the birds freedom of movement and protects them from other predatory wildlife within the natural area. The golden eagle has its own enclosure.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A federal law enforcement official says the FBI received a call three years ago about the 22-year-old man who opened fire on a courthouse downtown. Brian Isaack Clyde was shot and killed Monday by security officers at the Earle Cabell Federal Building. There were no other serious injuries or deaths in the attack. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, says a member of Clyde’s family called a national tip line to say he was suicidal and had a fascination with guns. The official said the July 1, 2016, call expressed concern for Clyde but did not contain a specific threat and was therefore not investigated. It came while Clyde was enlisted in the U.S. Army. Clyde’s mother, Nubia Brede Solis, told The Dallas Morning News that his half-brother had called the FBI with concerns.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A state commission has agreed to provide a $21.4 million grant to a multicounty coalition for a proposed new 80-mile rail route to haul crude oil from eastern Utah to existing Union Pacific tracks northwest of Price in Carbon County. The Salt Lake Tribune reports that the Community Impact Board last week approved the funding for the Seven County Infrastructure Coalition for planning and environmental reviews. Supports say the planned Uinta Basin Railway would help Uintah and Duchesne counties develop their energy-dependent economies and reduce tanker traffic on highways. The coalition has contracted with the investment bank Drexel Hamilton, which will commit between $5 million and $15 million of its own funds, to raise private capital, commercialize the project and secure a partner to operate the rail line.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state Department of Fish and Wildlife is reminding people not to release aquarium fish into the wild. It is illegal to release the fish into Vermont waters. While most tropical fish are unlikely to become established in Vermont waters due to the cold weather, biologists say that if the aquarium fish survive and reproduce in the wild, they can be difficult – if not impossible – to control or eradicate. They can also cause changes in the native aquatic environment by competing with native species and introducing exotic parasites and diseases. Vermont biologists recently discovered goldfish, which are native to China, living in the sewer drains of Williston, which connect to public waters. Aquarium plants can also pose a threat if they are released into the wild.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state plans to mark four centuries of black history with a new exhibit and a tribute to tennis star Arthur Ashe Jr. The exhibit begins with the 1619 arrival in Virginia of the first enslaved Africans in English North America and continues all the way to the present day. “Determined: The 400-Year Struggle for Black Equality” will open Saturday at the Virginia Museum of History & Culture in Richmond as the city officially dedicates Arthur Ashe Boulevard. Renowned civil rights activist Rep. John Lewis of Georgia will be the keynote speaker. The exhibit features dozens of artifacts to tell the story of black Virginians, including slavery-era restraints, an African-inspired banjo and a stool from a Richmond lunch counter where students held a sit-in to protest segregation.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The proof is in the pee. A new federally funded study has confirmed, not surprisingly, that marijuana use went up in the state after its first legal pot stores opened in 2014. In fact, consumption doubled over three years – a conclusion scientists reached after performing the decidedly unglamorous work of analyzing raw sewage. The researchers tested wastewater from Tacoma, a city whose drug-use trends tend to mirror those of Seattle, for a substance that is produced when people metabolize the active ingredient in pot. It is excreted in urine. The researchers said they can’t tell whether the increase in metabolites means more people are using weed or the same old users are consuming more of it. Another possible explanation is that the THC products sold legally in stores are more potent than what was commonly available on the black market.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State agricultural officials are warning about a fungal disease that attacks boxwood shrubs. The Department of Agriculture says in a news release that boxwood blight has been detected on residential and commercial landscapes throughout the state. Boxwood blight produces dark brown leaf spots and causes rapid defoliation that sometimes kills young boxwoods. It’s found in more than two dozen states and was first detected in West Virginia on plants shipped from out-of-state nurseries in 2015. The statement says residents should buy shrubs from reputable nurseries and only buy plants that appear healthy. Gardeners and landscapers should sanitize gardening tools between different plantings of boxwoods.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Assembly has approved a bill that would require online vendors like Amazon to collect and remit sales taxes from third-party sellers in perpetuity, a move that would trigger income tax cuts. Under the bill, revenue from the tax collections would be used to cover reductions in the lowest- and second-lowest income tax brackets. According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, taxpayers could expect an average reduction of $27 for tax year 2019 and an average reduction of $59 in tax year 2020 under the new rates. The Assembly passed the bill Thursday afternoon on a voice vote. The measure goes next to the state Senate. Coupled with an income tax cut plan Republicans inserted in the state budget, taxpayers could expect a total annual reduction of $91 in 2019 and $124 in 2020.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Some rodeo circuit cowboys say they will boycott this year’s Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo because of the new, tournament-style format the “Daddy of ’em All” adopted in roping and steer wrestling events. Under the new format, slack will now become a qualifying round to make it into the rodeo performances in steer roping, tie-down roping, team roping and steer wrestling. Each performance will see event winners and money paid out, and the contestants will start with a clean slate in the finals. Tie-down roper Hunter Herrin tells KGAB-AM the change means cowboys will compete more for less money. Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo Chairman Chad Mathews tells the Wyoming Tribune Eagle the new format means a better spectator experience and payouts to more contestants.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/05/17/stevie-wonder-pet-cemetery-songwriter-jamboree-news-around-states/39487727/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From staff and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A group of historic treasures has a new home, with five pieces by African American artists from the state joining the permanent collection of the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts. The works now on display in the gallery were acquired through a partnership with the Souls Grown Deep Foundation, a group dedicated to documenting, preserving and promoting African American artists of the South. One of the largest of the works is “Lost Americans,” a 2008 mixed media work by the late Thornton Dial Sr. of Emmelle. Dial’s works used many found objects, which he often found beside train tracks. Another new earthy piece is “Wheel at the Fairground,” from 1988 by the late Jimmy Lee Sudduth of Fayette. The artist came up with his own medium by combining clay and sugar and using that to paint pieces of plywood. The three other new pieces are quilts by the famous Gee’s Bend quilt makers of Wilcox County.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: Residents who burn wood, coal and oil for heat are facing new air pollution control measures. Draft rules made public by the state Tuesday are expected to result in additional bans on burning wood and coal in Fairbanks North Star Borough, as well as higher fuel oil and electric bills, The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reports. New rules are required under the federal Clean Air Act. The deadline is the end of December, officials said. The Fairbanks area each winter is regularly out of compliance for fine particulate, a mix of solid particles and liquid droplets that can be inhaled deep in the lungs. Wood smoke contributes up to 80% of Fairbanks’ fine particle pollution. Residents burn wood as a cheaper alternative to fuel oil. The goal is to reduce smoke pollution in Fairbanks and North Pole by 5% annually with attainment expected in 10 years, officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The U.S. government plans on replacing barriers through 100 miles of the southern border in California and Arizona, including through a national monument and a wildlife refuge, according to documents and environmental advocates. The Department of Homeland Security on Tuesday again waived environmental and dozens of other laws to build more barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. Barriers will go up at Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, a vast park named after the unique cactus breed that decorates it, and Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, which is largely a designed wilderness home to 275 wildlife species. The government will also build new roads and lighting in those areas in Arizona. Environmental advocates who have sued to stop the construction of the wall say this latest plan will be detrimental to the wildlife and habitat in those areas.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Less than a week after the state’s first medical marijuana dispensaries officially opened their doors, patients who would rather eat their pot than smoke it will soon have their chance. Robert Lercher, a spokesman for BOLD Team, says the cultivator intends to have gummy chews, concentrates and vape cartridges available with the next harvest, with products hitting dispensary shelves by the end of next week. Voters approved a medical marijuana amendment in 2016. Only two dispensaries, both in Hot Springs, are licensed, and only one cultivator has harvested a crop, though two others expect to harvest their own this summer. As of Tuesday night, the two dispensaries, Doctor’s Orders RX and Green Springs Medical, had sold more than 26 pounds of the drug in its flower form and totaled sales of about $177,000.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A cafe is brewing up what it calls the world’s most expensive coffee – at $75 a cup. Klatch Coffee is serving the exclusive brew, the Elida Natural Geisha 803, at its branches in Southern California and San Francisco. The 803 in the coffee’s name refers to the record-breaking $803 per pound for which the organic beans sold at a recent auction after winning the Best of Panama coffee competition, says Bo Thiara, co-owner of the Klatch branch in San Francisco. He calls the annual competition the coffee world’s equivalent of the Oscars. Only 100 pounds of the beans were available for purchase, and most went to Japan, China and Taiwan, Thiara says. Klatch secured 10 pounds and is the only chain in North America to have it. Klatch describes the coffee as a rare variety of Arabica from Panama that has a floral, tea-like flavor with hints of jasmine and berries.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: Officials say this year’s snowpack could recover the state’s hydrological system following last year’s drought. The Gazette reports federal data shows the snowpack in the state’s southwest corner at 19.5 inches, 220% of the median snowpack Tuesday. Colorado Climate Center climatologist Becky Bolinger says the state’s soil, reservoirs, rivers and streams could likely see recovery following the snow and cold that arrived in February and March. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration hydrologist Greg Smith says the Upper Colorado River Basin is seeing encouraging conditions, and the Upper San Juan River Basin experienced its third wettest March on record this year. According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, about 15% of the state is abnormally dry, and less than 1% is in moderate drought.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The West Hartford Libraries has launched its year of happiness, offering a full year’s worth of special programming centered around the things that make people happy – like music, meditation, food, games and even homebrewed beer. “We wanted something that’s positive and all inclusive of ages,” says Carol Waxman, the children’s librarian at the Noah Webster Library, who will offer special programming like chocolate making to children. Also part of the year of happiness is the bolstering of a program called “Hunger Doesn’t Take a Vacation.” Through the summer program, in partnership with the Fern Street Food Ministry at the Universalist Church of West Hartford, the library offers backpacks full of food to children who during the school year would receive free lunches. The full list of happiness events can be found online.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Environmental groups are asking federal officials to take emergency action to protect a species of firefly unique to southern Delaware. In an emergency petition filed Wednesday with the Department of the Interior, environmentalists claim the Bethany Beach firefly is at immediate risk of extinction because of imminent destruction of a significant portion of its habitat. The filing comes partly in response to a planned residential development that would be accessible by a unique wooden cul-de-sac that has been built on pilings over one of the freshwater marshes where the firefly lives. Environmentalists say threats to the bug also include sea level rise, climate change and mosquito-control pesticides. The petition was filed by the Center for Biological Diversity and the Xerces Society for Invertebrate Conservation.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The city is set to get its first official pet cemetery. News outlets report that people will be able to secure final resting places for their beloved pets at the historic Congressional Cemetery, where officials plan to open the Kingdom of Animals section next month. Cemetery President Paul Williams says the section will span about third of an acre at the 35-acre cemetery and will accept all pets, ranging from birds to alligators. The cemetery calls this an extension of its popular members-only dog walking group, whose volunteers have revived the grounds over the past two decades. The group costs about $235 per year and $50 per dog to join. Burial prices will range from $500 to $1,500.\n\nFlorida\n\nNaples: An audience member called 911 on an Egyptian-American comedian who made a joke about being of Middle Eastern descent. The complainant called police Sunday, one day after Ahmed Ahmed performed at the Off The Hook Comedy Club in Naples. Ahmed says he asked if anyone of Middle Eastern descent was in the audience. After a few people clapped, Ahmed replied, “Hey, it only takes one of us” followed by a pause and then “to tell a joke.” He added, “Seriously, lock the doors.” The caller told the 911 dispatcher that after audience members acknowledged being from the Middle East, Ahmed said, “That’s great. We could organize our own little terrorist organization.” He said that bothered him. Ahmed says he never said that. The club has rebooked Ahmed for next week.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Former President Jimmy Carter plans to teach Sunday school this weekend just days after undergoing surgery for a broken hip, a spokeswoman says. Carter, 94, was released from the hospital Thursday morning after getting a hip replacement. He plans to continue recuperating at his home in rural Plains, said a statement from Carter spokeswoman Deanna Congileo. Carter’s wife, Rosalynn Carter, went home with her husband after she was admitted to the hospital Wednesday for observation and testing after she “felt faint,” Congileo said. “Both President and Mrs. Carter extend their thanks to the many people who sent well wishes the past few days,” Congileo’s statement said. She said Carter plans to teach his regular Sunday school class this weekend at Marantha Baptist Church in Plains.\n\nHawaii\n\nKahului: An airport has opened a $340 million facility for car rental companies. The Kahului Airport Consolidated Rent-A-Car facility is the largest single public works project on Maui, The Maui News reports. The facility that opened Wednesday houses all major rental car companies in one spot and connects passengers with the airport via electric tram. The project took three years to complete, was environmentally friendly and created hundreds of local jobs, officials say. The project will help save energy costs, reduce waste and increase indoor air quality, the state Department of Transportation said. Democratic Gov. David Ige visited the site Tuesday and said the project was “funded with no taxpayer dollars involved.” Funding came from a state facility charge and a daily $4.50 payment by rental car customers, officials say.\n\nIdaho\n\nPocatello: A man has been ordered to pay $2,000 in restitution after damaging an archaeological site in Challis. U.S. Attorney Bart Davis announced this week that 38-year-old Alan Thorkelson of Challis pleaded guilty last month to digging at a Shoshone-Bannock tribal cultural site without authorization. The Devil Canyon Archaeological Site was being monitored because of previous issues with graffiti; court records say Thorkelson was caught digging at the site in October of 2017. U.S. District Judge David Nye ordered Thorkelson to pay the restitution during a sentencing hearing late last month. Mary D’Aversa with the Bureau of Land Management says looting archaeological sites like the one in Challis is especially harmful because they are significant to tribal communities.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new plan has been introduced that aims to end HIV in the state by the year 2030. Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, the Illinois and Chicago public health departments, and the AIDS Foundation of Chicago introduced the Getting to Zero Illinois plan this week. It’s the results of nearly two years of planning that included town hall meetings, surveys, focus groups and community feedback from across the state. State officials say nearly 40,000 people were living with HIV in Illinois in 2017. The plan focuses on efforts including increasing HIV treatment access, allocating resources to communities with the greatest disparities and measuring progress through surveillance. The city of Chicago is providing $40 million toward the effort to 40 organizations, and the state is providing almost $26 million to 62 agencies.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Kurt Vonnegut Museum and Library has reached its goal of raising $1.5million to acquire and begin renovations on a building to serve as its permanent home. The museum announced Wednesday that it met a deadline for the fundraising effort. The museum’s founder and CEO, Julia Whitehead, says it’s “a wonderful step forward,” and people “are recognizing that we have something very special here.” Whitehead said in March that the museum signed a purchase agreement for a building to display a new exhibition about Vonnegut’s book “Slaughterhouse-Five.” It will also display other exhibitions and the organization’s large collection of Vonnegut artifacts and memorabilia. The museum has been operating for eight years but is currently closed to the public. Vonnegut was born in Indianapolis. He died in 2007 at age 84.\n\nIowa\n\nOkoboji: This lake town now has a vodka named for it. Foundry Distilling Co. is launching the first brand in its Heritage Collection of spirits: Okoboji Vodka. It’s made from 100% corn with the majority grown in Iowa and will be available at retailers in the Lake Okoboji region this summer. “This is special for me as my dad grew up about 10 miles away from Okoboji in Lake Park,” says Scott Bush, founder of Foundry Distilling Co. “We used to go up to Okoboji as kids to see Grandpa and Grandma Bush, and those are memories I will always cherish.” Bush hopes Okoboji Vodka will strike a chord with others who have strong sentimental ties to that region of Iowa. Foundry Distilling Co. was founded in 2018 and has developed two unique offerings: the Private Barrel Program and the Brewer/Distiller Alliance.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Despite an increase in state funding for higher education, four of the state’s six major universities are asking for tuition increases for next year. During a meeting Wednesday, some members of the Kansas Board of Regents expressed frustration with the university administrators for seeking increases. The Wichita Eagle reports the board will vote on the proposals in June, and it is unclear if there are enough votes to approve them. University officials said the proposed increases would be the smallest in decades. The University of Kansas and Wichita State are asking for a 1% increase for Kansas residents. Emporia State requested a 2.5% increase, and Kansas State is seeking a 3.1% hike. Pittsburg State and Fort Hays State did not ask for higher tuition.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The city is suspending paper recycling due to “changes in the global marketplace” for recycled materials. City officials say there is an overabundance of material in domestic markets, and Lexington’s recycling center cannot store the paper long term. Residents are being told to put office paper, newspaper, magazines, cereal boxes, paper towel rolls and similar products in the trash. Residents can continue to recycle corrugated cardboard, like moving and shipping boxes. Nancy Albright, Lexington’s Commissioner of Environmental Quality and Public Works, says the city is seeking new recycling outlets for paper. She says at least three new nearby mills are expected to begin receiving materials by late fall. A city news release says recycling markets across the country are under strain due to increased standards in China.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: The city’s downtown will be alive Memorial Day weekend with South Louisiana Songwriters Festival, the only songwriter jamboree in the United States. The SOLO event is a seminar and presentation mash-up May 21-26. Songwriters collaborate in small groups for four days, starting Tuesday. Nick Lowe, known for the pop hit “Cruel to Be Kind,” will kick off the festivities Wednesday night with a show at Warehouse 535. On Thursday kids from local schools, who have been participating in their own version of the workshop, will perform Songs Over Style and the School Program Showcase. By Friday evening the top 12 workshop songs are presented at the Methodist Church downtown. Saturday and Sunday are the true festival days, with five stages total between Blue Moon Saloon and Warehouse 535.\n\nMaine\n\nYork: It was the vision and legacy of the late art patron Mary Leigh Smart and artist Beverly Hallam to create an artist’s residency at their 44-acre oceanfront property. Today that vision is ever closer to reality, with interviews underway for the inaugural residents who will arrive in York this fall. The Surf Point Foundation was created by Smart and Hallam in 1988 so that upon their deaths their duplex home, a second house called Wild Knoll where author and poet May Sarton once lived, and the surrounding property would be transformed into a residency for artists, art historians, architects, critics and designers. For the residents, Executive Director Yael Reinharz says that “special attention will be given to women and people of color. And we also want to place a priority on people who have a connection to Maine.”\n\nMaryland\n\nAssateague Island: The island has a new member in its wild horse herd, officials announced Wednesday. Mother N2BHS-A, also known as “Gokey GoGo Bones,” gave birth to a chestnut filly Saturday morning, according to a news release from the National Park Service. The new foal, N2BHS-AR, and band live most of the year in the very busy developed area and campgrounds. For this reason, the National Park Service expressly reminds visitors that it is essential to remain a minimum of a bus length, or about 40 feet, away from the wild horses at all times, officials said. “Everything is new to a foal,” the park service said in a release. “N2BHS-AR will learn how to interact with the environment from her mother and other members of her band.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNewburyport: A 71-year-old man has embarked on a 3,600-mile, coast-to-coast walk to draw attention to the plight of military veterans. William Shuttleworth departed his hometown of Newburyport on Wednesday for what he estimates will be a 7 1/ 2 -month trek to Vandenberg Air Force Base in Lompoc, California. He plans to talk to veterans along the way and raise public awareness about the health care, housing and economic issues that many face. The Air Force veteran tells The Daily News of Newburyport he was inspired while working last year at a California park where many veterans were camping because they were homeless and struggling with addiction. He has mapped his route and plans to walk about 25 miles per day. He intends to camp because he hasn’t reserved overnight accommodations.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A massive portrait of Stevie Wonder will be the latest addition to the downtown skyline. Measuring roughly 100 feet tall, the new mural of the iconic Motown singer is being painted by London-based artist Richard Wilson, who was busy this week finishing details of Wonder’s face and neck. The musician turned 69 on Monday. The portrait on the side of the Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts spans roughly 8,000 square feet and is large enough to be seen by an airplane passing overhead. “For me, he’s the greatest living singer, songwriter and musician,” Wilson says. “In 300 years, I’m sure he’ll be looked (at) as a Beethoven, Mozart, Bach – that kind of epic influence on humanity.” Wilson flew himself to Detroit earlier this month to start the project on his own dime. He conservatively estimates the entire mural will cost “at least $10,000” and take another two weeks or so to complete.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The federal Bureau of Land Management on Wednesday renewed mineral rights leases for a proposed Twin Metals copper-nickel mine in the state’s northeast, a project that environmentalists fear would spoil the pristine Boundary Waters Canoe Area. The leases cover land in the Superior National Forest that encompasses vast reserves of copper, nickel and precious metals. According to Twin Metals Minnesota, the renewed leases add new conditions, including higher annual royalty payments, project milestones and additional environmental requirements. Environmental groups are fighting the project, fearing effects on the nearby Boundary Waters Canoe Area, the country’s most-visited wilderness. Nine area companies who contend the project would hurt their business are suing in federal court to block the leases.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A new local law will ban the state’s largest city from asking people about their salary history when they apply for municipal government jobs. The Jackson City Council approved the ordinance Tuesday, and it takes effect June 14. Council members and Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba say the law is intended to alleviate the problem of women being paid less than men for the same jobs. It applies only to city government jobs, not to jobs in the private sector. The National Conference of State Legislatures says Mississippi and Alabama are the only states without laws requiring equal pay for equal work, though one is working its way through the Alabama Legislature. Councilman De’Keither Stamps wrote the Jackson law and says he hopes other cities, counties and school districts in Mississippi will adopt similar ones.\n\nMissouri\n\nEugene: The first section of a new biking and hiking trail created on an abandoned rail line has opened in the Kansas City area. A ribbon-cutting ceremony that’s planned for June 1 for the Rock Island Trail will make it official. The 6.4-mile section of trail stretches from southern Kansas City to the nearby suburb of Lee’s Summit. Advocates say that when another stretch is completed, it will attract thousands of hikers and cyclists and spur new development. Eventually, the county hopes to connect the trail to the 240-mile Katy Trial. Highlights of the new stretch of trail include a section that passes through the 453-foot-long Vale Tunnel, which was completed in 1904. Trains stopped using the rail line in the early 1980s.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Missoula City-County Health Department officials say the number of cases of whooping cough in the area has topped 100, including many people who have been vaccinated. Department Director Ellen Leahy says protection from the vaccine wanes over time. Vaccines against whooping cough, or pertussis, are given as a series between 2 months and 18 months of age and another around age 5. A booster is given to preteens. The Centers for Disease Control says women should get a booster during the third trimester of each pregnancy. Missoula County had confirmed 103 cases of whooping cough through Tuesday and was hiring more nurses to help with testing. Leahy told KGVO-AM that 975 tests have been submitted, and another 58 were pending at the state lab.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State lawmakers have kicked off a debate on a proposal to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes as activists push a much broader ballot measure that would place the issue before voters next year. Supporters argued Wednesday that the legislative bill is narrowly tailored, with restrictions on how much users can possess and a ban on marijuana smoking. Senators who oppose the measure say the drug is still illegal at the federal level and argue that its benefits and dangers haven’t been fully studied. The sponsor, Sen. Anna Wishart, of Lincoln, says the bill is intended to address the concerns of many groups. Legalization supporters are circulating petitions to place the issue before voters on the November 2020 ballot, where it’s likely to pass.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: The governor has signed a bill that prevents insurers from denying coverage to patients due to a pre-existing condition. Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak said at a bill signing Wednesday that the measure ensures that health care protection even if the Affordable Care Act is struck down at the federal level. He also signed a bill to address “surprise” medical billing and said the practice can saddle a patient with a five-figure bill. He said the legislation aims to prevent an out-of-network provider who gives emergency medical care from overcharging a person. Assembly Speaker Jason Frierson praised the bill and said the measure makes sure that patients are cared for.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nCanaan: A school cafeteria worker says she lost her job after giving a student lunch for free. Bonnie Kimball tells the Valley News she was fired March 28 by her employer, a vendor that supplies food to the Mascoma Valley Regional High School in Canaan. She told the student she followed what a boss had told her. She says she told the student quietly, “Tell (your) mom you need money.” A day later, she says, she was terminated. A spokeswoman for Manchester-based Cafe Services said in a statement Thursday that it “would never authorize an employee to not feed a student or staff member a meal.” But the spokeswoman said Cafe Services can’t discuss confidential details regarding a worker’s employment or termination. The district school board voted Tuesday to continue using the company.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The fear of poachers stealing oysters from polluted waters and making consumers sick has long thwarted efforts to grow the shellfish in dirty water in the state, despite the potential to help improve water quality. But a proposed remedy could actually make matters worse by removing state oversight, possibly causing the very illnesses state regulators have long feared. A bill pending in the Legislature would allow oyster colonies to be planted in polluted waters for research, water quality improvement or shoreline stabilization purposes. But it also would block the state Department of Environmental Protection from regulating the patches, which even the most ardent supporters in the environmental community agree would be going too far. Lawmakers agreed Thursday to send the bill back for amendments.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: Now in its third year, the Las Cruces UkeFest is bringing top-notch instructors and performers to town this weekend, as well as ukulele players from across the country. This year’s festival, running Friday through Sunday, features well-known performers Victoria Vox, Kevin Carroll, Abe Lagrimas, Jr. and The Quiet American, Aaron and Nicole Keim. The festival kicks off with a concert at the New Mexico State University Atkinson Recital Hall at 7 p.m. Friday. The concert will begin with a couple of songs performed by the host club, the Las Cruces Ukes, and then the professionals will take the stage. For non-players, concert tickets are available separately for only $10, with children ages 12 and under admitted free with a paying adult. Events Saturday and Sunday include workshops, a prize drawing and an evening jam session. Registration for the full festival is $135, or $75 for full-time students with ID.\n\nNew York\n\nBeacon: The sloop Clearwater is celebrating 50 years of sailing on the Hudson River. Clearwater’s founders and crew members will gather with public officials along the Hudson in Beacon on Friday to mark the anniversary of the sloop’s launch May 17, 1969. They will hold an on-board christening ceremony. Folk singer Pete Seeger and like-minded environmentalists wanted the ship to be a symbol of the river and a sort of floating classroom. It was built to look like the Dutch sloops that used to carry food and other supplies up and down the Hudson River.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: The police department has honored a college student who was killed when a gunman opened fire inside a classroom. News outlets report the family of UNC Charlotte student Riley Howell was awarded the Civilian Medal of Valor posthumously Wednesday from the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department. Howell’s parents, siblings and girlfriend accepted the award on his behalf and received a standing ovation. Howell, 21, was shot while tackling the shooter who is accused of killing him. Howell’s move is credited with saving lives. Also killed in the April 30 attack was 19-year-old student Ellis R. Parlier. Four other students were wounded. Police charged Trystan Andrew Terrell, 22, with two counts of first-degree murder, four counts of first-degree attempted murder and other offenses in the shooting.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Regulators say the state’s oil production remained at a near-record level in March. The Department of Mineral Resources says the state produced an average of 1.39 million barrels of oil daily in March. That was down from a record 1.4 million barrels a day from the record set in January. North Dakota also produced a record 2.8 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day in March, up from 2.6 billion cubic feet in February. There were 15,353 wells producing in March. That’s down 56 wells from the record set in January. The March tallies are the latest figures available. There were 65 drill rigs operating in North Dakota on Wednesday, down one from the March average.\n\nOhio\n\nNewark: A country club plans to appeal an order that it sell back a lease to the state historical agency to provide public access to ancient burial mounds. Licking County Judge David Branstool recently ruled that the Ohio History Connection can reclaim the 2,000-year-old Octagon Mounds from Moundbuilders Country Club if it can afford to pay the price a jury will set in September. The agency sued the club last year to buy back its lease with Moundbuilders. The U.S. Interior Department has said it won’t nominate Hopewell Ceremonial Earthworks, which includes Octagon Mounds, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site unless the course is removed. The president of the club’s trustee board says the club is willing to move elsewhere if it’s paid fairly.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Authorities say falling debris is still a danger after a skyscraper was damaged when it was battered by a dangling scaffold holding two men. Police blocked some roads and a park to most vehicle and pedestrian traffic Thursday, a day after two window washers were rescued from the scaffold above the nearly 850-foot Devon Tower. Both men refused treatment after they were brought to safety. It’s unclear what caused the scaffold to hit the building, shattering windows and dropping glass. The cause of the accident is under investigation. Firefighters secured the scaffold with ropes as it hung from a crane 20 to 30 feet above the roof. The tower houses corporate offices for Oklahoma City-based Devon Energy Corp.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Lawmakers have approved the largest statewide expansion of the federal free lunch program, ensuring all students living up to three times above the poverty line will have access to free meals. It’s the first time a state has offered to completely take on school meal costs, which can often run tens of thousands of dollars for individual school districts. The move is expected to provide hundreds of thousands of students with free breakfast and lunch. About 1 in 7 Oregon households is “food insecure,” according to the Oregon Center for Public Policy, meaning that families have trouble putting food on the table and often don’t know where they’ll get their next meal. At least 174,000 children have limited access to food, more than the population of Oregon’s second-largest city, Eugene.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrison City: A school district is defending itself after video surfaced of a safety drill that had a teacher posing as a shooter and donning what appeared to be a Middle Eastern headdress. The video appears to show the actor wearing a kaffiyeh. The Penn-Trafford School District says organizers didn’t intend to portray the shooter as Arab or Muslim at the January training. The district says volunteers were provided costumes by a consultant group, and there was no intent to represent any particular culture or religion. The statement said the person portraying the shooter also wore a long blond wig and a paintball mask. The Islamic Center of Pittsburgh says that “to stereotype the shooter is appalling given the data on active shooters and the recent shootings at the Tree of Life and Christ Church.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Despite millions in overspending by some agencies, the state is projected to end the budget year with a $24 million surplus, according to a report issued Wednesday by state budget officer Tom Mullaney. The fiscal year ends June 30. WPRI-TV reports Mullaney predicted last fall that the state was headed for a $42 million deficit. State agencies are still overspending, but numbers have improved. Mullaney says agencies are on track to overspend by about $16 million, down from $51 million last fall. Most of the agency deficits are in social services. Top Democrats in the state House are currently in negotiations over the next budget. Legislators have been holding hearings on Gov. Gina Raimondo’s nearly $10 billion budget proposal since it was introduced in January.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nRock Hill: The Catawba Indian Nation is bringing back the Yap Ye Iswa, or Day of the Catawba, festival after a 12-year hiatus. The free festival is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday at the Catawba Cultural Center. The festival dates back to 1990 as a way to connect the tribal and non-tribal communities with the Catawba Indian Nation. Festivalgoers will get a taste of the tribe’s culture through performances by drummers and dancers to authentic Catawba songs. There also will be traditional art by Catawba artisans, pottery and beadwork demonstrations, and traditional Native American food. The Herald reports the Catawba Indian Nation is the only federally recognized tribe in South Carolina. Its reservation sits on about 700 acres east of Rock Hill.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Attorneys for oil pipeline opponents are fighting an attempt by a sheriff to be dismissed from a lawsuit challenging new state laws that aim to prevent disruptive demonstrations against the Keystone XL pipeline. They say in a Tuesday court filing that Pennington County Sheriff Kevin Thom should remain a defendant in the suit spearheaded by the American Civil Liberties Union because he’ll be enforcing law that amounts to an unconstitutional infringement on free speech. Thom’s attorneys say he must enforce state laws but isn’t responsible for defending them. Plaintiffs’ attorneys counter that Thom must use personal discretion in enforcing the laws, effectively making him a policymaker.\n\nTennessee\n\nMurfreesboro: An elementary school will no longer have a student portray Adolf Hitler in its living history exhibit after a group of students began giving Nazi salutes. James Evans, a spokesman for the Rutherford County school district, said in an email that the student portraying Hitler was supposed to give a speech and a Nazi salute. Evans said other students started giving the salute as well, both in and out of rehearsals. The issue became public when Middle Tennessee State University professor Keith Gamble tweeted that his daughter was sent to the principal’s office for yelling at the other children to stop. Evans said the girl was taken to the office because she would not calm down. He said the district does not condone “hate-filled or insensitive” actions or symbols.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The ex-owner of a tiger rescued from a filthy cage in an abandoned house has been charged with animal cruelty. Houston police arrested 24-year-old Brittany Garza on Wednesday on the misdemeanor count involving a non-livestock animal. She’s free on $100 bond. An attorney for Garza, Jay Cohen, declined comment Thursday. The Cleveland Amory Black Beauty Ranch in Murchison has cared for the 350-pound tiger since it was found in February by people entering the house to smoke marijuana. A judge ruled in April that the sanctuary, 70 miles southeast of Dallas, can keep the tiger and that Garza must pay nearly $12,000 for the animal’s care. The shelter is doing an online poll to name the tiger. The choices are Ezekiel, George, Loki or Navi.\n\nUtah\n\nOgden: Wildlife officials have released into a northern Utah reservoir thousands of tiger muskie fish, a hybrid predator that’s popular with anglers and helps keep other species in check. The Standard Examiner reports the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources recently released 28,000 of the fish at Pineview Reservoir. Assistant aquatic program manager Cody Edwards says less than 10% of the fish will make it to adulthood. The fish are released when they’re 2 inches long, but they can grow over 30 inches in length. A cross between a northern pike and muskellunge, tiger muskies have been stocked there since at least the 1990s. They’re sterile fish introduced as a top-level predator to keep the population of other species in check and prevent big booms and busts in the ecosystem.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: At least three people have been arrested after a group of climate protesters disrupted a session of the state House of Representatives. The House was in session Thursday when protesters began to shout climate slogans and throw leaflets onto the floor from the visitors’ gallery. Democratic House speaker Mitzi Johnson tried to restore the session but adjourned and closed the House chamber after the protesters refused to be silenced. The protesters say they wanted the Legislature to do more to combat climate change. After most of the protesters had left, three people remained. They were arrested and escorted from the chamber after they refused repeated orders from capital police to leave.\n\nVirginia\n\nArlington: A state panel has unanimously approved a request from Arlington County to rename a highway that currently honors Confederate President Jefferson Davis. The Commonwealth Transportation Board voted unanimously Wednesday to change the name of U.S. Route 1 in northern Virginia from Jefferson Davis Highway to Richmond Highway. Arlington County requested the change last month, and Gov. Ralph Northam supported the change. The road is already called Richmond Highway in Fairfax County and Alexandria. The county estimates it will have to spend $17,000 to pay for new street signs. County officials say the changes will be implemented by Oct. 1. The board meeting Wednesday took place at a hotel located on Jefferson Davis Highway.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A trio of Seattle companies, including two of the city’s hospitals, have announced $15 million in donations for projects aimed at the homeless. The money will help fund three projects geared toward helping the chronically homeless, who experts say make up a limited proportion of the homeless overall but can be among the most difficult to reach. The funds will pay for a relatively small portion of three buildings slated to create about 290 units of housing that include on-site staffing to help residents stay connected to services. Swedish Health Services, Providence St. Joseph Health and Premera Blue Cross each donated $5 million. Representatives of Plymouth Housing, the group behind the projects, did not make a total budget available for the projects but said the first of the three is slated to cost about $34 million.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State health officials and Boy Scout leaders say they’re preparing for the possibility that some children may bring measles to the World Scout Jamboree this summer. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports officials are encouraging measles vaccinations for the 45,000 Scouts and leaders expected to travel across the world and country to attend. The state hasn’t had a confirmed measles case since 2009. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 23 states had 839 total confirmed measles cases as of May 10. The preventable disease was declared eliminated in 2000. The CDC says this is the greatest number of measles cases the country has seen since 1994. Scout leaders say seemingly sick individuals will be examined before event admittance, and an outbreak would lead to a quarantine.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: “Evicted,” an immersive exhibit based on Matthew Desmond’s Pulitzer Prize-winning book about low-income evictions in the city, is coming to the near west side in June. It will be on view June 21 through Sept. 30 at the Mobile Design Box. Admission will be free. Milwaukee will be the first stop on a national tour for the traveling version of the “Evicted” exhibit, which the National Building Museum in Washington created and has been showing for more than a year. Bringing “Evicted” here highlights an issue that affects not just cities but suburban and rural areas, too, said Keith Stanley, executive director of Near West Side Partners, a nonprofit organization that’s hosting the exhibit. Desmond studied the relationship between eviction and poverty in Milwaukee for nearly a decade.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Filters installed on storm drains in the state’s largest city will attempt to keep trash out of a creek. Crews have installed 12 water filtration units called “Gutter Bins” on storm drains in downtown Cheyenne. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports the Laramie County Conservation District, local Rotary clubs and Casper-based Frog Creek Partners took part in the project. Brian Deurloo with environmental technology company Frog Creek Partners estimates 40 million cigarette butts litter Cheyenne annually. He estimates about a million pounds of pollution wash into Crow Creek each year. Each filtration unit costs about $700. Conservation district staff and Rotary volunteers will maintain the bins for the first couple of years.\n\nFrom staff and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/05/17"}]}
