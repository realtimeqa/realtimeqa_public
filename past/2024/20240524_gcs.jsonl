Some died. Some lost their jobs or businesses.\n\nEveryone felt COVID-19, from Steph Sparrow who shut down her Santa Paula tattoo shop three times to Joel Vitt of Ventura. Both his parents died during the pandemic. He keeps their ashes in his living room in hopes he’ll one day be able to invite their friends to a memorial.\n\nShortly after the virus emerged in March 2020, Ventura County Health Officer Dr. Robert Levin speculated the pandemic could bring as many as 1,000 deaths to the region. The estimate was ridiculed by people who contended the severity was exaggerated.\n\nA year later, the virus has been linked to more than 900 deaths. The number grows even as vaccines embolden hope the pandemic will run its course.\n\nVentura County Star reporters Cheri Carlson and Tom Kisken chose to document the pandemic through people whose lives were altered. Some of them relived moments that made headlines — a health official’s decision not to mandate masks and church members who defied public health orders.\n\nOthers went through things that tragically became common. A woman juggled cellphones outside her dying husband’s hospital room. A 76-year-old Oxnard woman with a heart condition tried to find hope in isolation.\n\nTogether, their stories breathe life, death and even music into the Year of COVID. Here they are.\n\nFeb. 15, 2020: COVID-19 hits home\n\n0 cases in Ventura County, 0 deaths\n\nAll Dwight Everett knew for certain is it wasn’t the tequila.\n\nThe retired electrician was on the fifth day of a Grand Princess cruise to Mexico. He and his wife had just returned to the ship from a Puerto Vallarta tour of a factory that uses blue agave cactus to make tequila.\n\nThey drank only samples. But Everett's body ached as if he had the flu. His head pounded. He woke up in the night drenched in sweat, his back aching so much he blamed it on the mattress.\n\nHe sat out the next three ports, anchored in bed.\n\nEverett and his wife finally returned to their home in Camarillo after a flight to Los Angeles and a ride from the airport that felt as if it would never end. He called his doctor and asked for a blood test, certain of what it would show.\n\nDwight Everett, of Camarillo, was the first person in Ventura County to test positive for the coronavirus.

It was almost a relief. Quote icon\n\nHe was watching television news a few nights later when he learned of a 71-year-old Placer County man who died after testing positive for the coronavirus. He had been on the same cruise to Mexico.\n\nEverett realized he probably didn’t have Valley fever.\n\nHe drove to the parking lot of St. John’s Pleasant Valley Hospital in Camarillo. A health-care worker decked out in what looked like a space suit of protective gear stabbed a swab so deep into Everett’s nose he thought it would come out the other side.\n\nThe swab came back positive.\n\nOn March 10, 2020, county officials announced lab tests performed at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta confirmed the result. Everett was case No. 1 one in Ventura County. By then he was already holed up at home in isolation, starting to recover.\n\n“I was happy that it was diagnosed so I knew what it was,\" he said. \"It was almost a relief.”\n\nCruise to Mexico: Second Grand Princess cruise passenger from county tests negative for COVID\n\nAlmost. Because the virus was so new and Everett didn't think he had it, he didn't wear a mask on the ship or the journey home. His wife, Burnetta Everett, who was on the cruise too, later tested positive but developed only minimal symptoms.\n\nEverett doesn't know, will probably never know, if he passed the virus to her or anyone else.\n\n“I could have infected a boatload of people,” he said, adding he doesn’t think that happened. “Nobody that I came in contact with that I know of became sick.”\n\nLooking back at the year of COVID-19 in Ventura County The Star takes a look back at how COVID-19 has affected Ventura County since it hit the area one year ago.

Contributed photo/John Gahan\n\nJohn Gahan picked the strings on his mandolin as he played in the porch light.\n\nHis wife, Clare, sat on a couch inside their den, a book in her lap and a scarf tied around her head. She listened as she heard the first few bars of “Off to California.” One of their favorites, John played it every night.\n\nThe one-man show on their porch started 10 days earlier after Clare’s brother in Barcelona told them people played on their balconies while the city was in lockdown. Hit hard by COVID, they did it in honor of all those working at hospitals and clinics.\n\nJohn thought he could do the same.\n\nHis mandolin had gone ignored for a month after Clare was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma on Feb. 15.

But friends, family and neighbors kept stopping by; sometimes leaving groceries or a book for Clare, a few staying for a short visit from the backyard.\n\n“We didn’t always feel lucky this year, I have to admit,” said Clare, whose last few scans showed no signs of cancer. “But I think for us, all things considered, we were lucky.”\n\nMarch 27\n\nAn Air National Guard team deploys in Ventura County to help with the escalating need for emergency food supplies.\n\nApril 1\n\nSchool districts across Ventura County announce they will stay closed for the rest of the year.\n\nApril 5: 'A political action' for God\n\n279 cases, 9 deaths, 97 people recovered\n\nSylvie Lariviere-Traub closed her eyes in prayer.

You could feel solidarity.”\n\nYou could feel controversy.\n\nLariviere-Traub, whose husband died of esophagus cancer five months earlier, came for the feeling of peace she believes emerges when people pray together.\n\nShe came in support of Godspeak leader Pastor Rob McCoy, who organized the service and protested churches had been labeled as non-essential.\n\nThe congregation moved back inside for good in May, staying there despite subsequent restrictions and ultimately a court order to move outdoors.\n\nLariviere-Traub, a dual citizen of Canada and the United States, took off her mask along with most church members. She kept coming on Sundays, even volunteering to welcome members.\n\nSylvie Lariviere-Traub prays after Communion at Godspeak Calvary Chapel in Newbury Park April 5, 2020.

FILE PHOTO\n\nThough many California communities and businesses had already passed mandates requiring masks be worn in public places as a partial shield against COVD-19, Levin told Ventura County supervisors he could not do the same.\n\n“There is no evidence that cloth masks plus social distancing is any better than social distancing alone,” said the health officer catapulted by the pandemic into a spotlight that brought both praise and calls of condemnation.\n\nAlong with words that made headlines, Levin issued a white paper citing scientific studies with one report suggesting cloth coverings could even increase risks.\n\nTweet Facebook Email Email this story Share Share this story Dr. Robert Levin We were told, everyone in the country was told, not to use surgical masks. Quote icon\n\nMore than anything else, he voiced fears a mask mandate would increase the use of medical face masks, then in scarce supply.\n\nHe said surgical and N95 masks needed to be reserved, even donated, to hospitals for doctors, nurses and other workers at high risk of COVID exposure.\n\nThat, Levin said nearly a year later, is the point missed by people frustrated by words they contended gave skeptics who saw masks as an infringement one more reason to place others at risk.\n\nBack in April: Ventura County won't mandate cloth mask use\n\n“We were told, everyone in the country was told, not to use surgical masks,” Levin said. “I felt comfortable with what I had done. It was based on documented research.”\n\nWhen Gov. Gavin Newsom issued a statewide mask mandate in June, Levin embraced it, noting the shortage on medical masks had ended.\n\nNow, he preaches about masking, social distancing and avoiding public gatherings as sort of a COVID prevention trinity.\n\nHis own mask?

Stu Vitt, a retired pharmaceutical representative who sang in the church choir and umpired his boys’ Little League games, was being sent to Community Memorial Hospital to be held overnight.\n\nA routine COVID-19 test came up positive.

By the end of the year, there would be a third.\n\nAt home, she would — obsessively at times — watch the case numbers and positivity rates, looking for signs of hope. She ramped up a new hobby of weight lifting as a stress reliever and made T-shirts and prints that people could buy to support the studio.\n\nEach time she thought the business would have to close for good, something would come along — a small business loan or a grant from the county.

For a few weeks, her paychecks from the school district kept coming in.\n\n“It wasn’t a lot, but it allowed us to pay our bills and pay our rent,” she said. “It got us through the month.”\n\nThey had given up entertainment, spent much less on gas and cut their food budget in half.\n\nBut in June, when she plugged in their expenses and pay into a free online budgeting program, the two columns didn’t match up.\n\n“There were a lot of moments that I was like, OK, there’s no way we can make rent this month,” she said.\n\nAn opening at a Santa Barbara Christian school came along a few weeks before classes were scheduled to start.

She was thinking if we are together, maybe we can have at least some food to give to the families to survive. Quote icon\n\nThe story is common in this part of Oxnard.\n\nIt’s why Obeso drives a borrowed Ford pickup — nicknamed \"Grandpa\" because it was made 28 years ago — from Oxnard to North Hills to Moorpark and back to Oxnard.\n\nWearing one face mask over another, she and other volunteers collect donated potatoes, cheese, meat, vegetables, sometimes shampoo and diapers.\n\nThey deliver the goods to farmworkers, often right in the fields or in parks or large Sunday events held outside a Masonic lodge with mariachis playing.\n\nThe efforts grew out of a United Farm Workers food pantry in part because Obeso understood many farmworkers like her use so much of their paycheck for rent there is little left for food.\n\nShe knew the pandemic meant many field workers could no longer work because they were sick. Those who were harvesting finished their day in the late afternoon when store shelves early in the pandemic were bare of toilet paper and other necessities.\n\n“When she started feeling suffering, she saw it in other people too,” said her friend and fellow volunteer Elizabeth Cordero. “She was thinking if we are together, maybe we can have at least some food to give to the families to survive.”\n\nThe more than three dozen volunteers she works with include a nurse and a retired longshoreman.

She called family members on her own cell, juggling the devices for what might be one of the last family conversations.\n\nFor Wright, the night felt way too familiar. Too often lately, she heard the last words people spoke to each other or listened to pleas to stay strong and hang on.\n\n“Those are the words I take home sometimes,” she said.\n\nShe called it overwhelming and also a privilege.\n\n“Even though I see a lot of very sad illnesses and a lot of dying, I get to see so much love,” she said.\n\nThat night, she sat at a nurse’s station as a wife played music for her husband over her phone.

Nothing felt right about celebrating.\n\nFor 10 years and counting, Contreras worked as a housekeeper at Ventura County Medical Center. He liked that each day brought a new set of challenges. He cleaned and readied rooms on an intensive care unit one shift, in a lab the next or at the emergency room a shift after that.\n\nEverything became more intense when COVID-19 hit.\n\nSome things changed right away: The sort of burning smell of a new ultraviolet light he used now to combat the virus. The sores behind his ears from the masks he wore shift after shift. The empty hallways and lounges as the doors closed to visitors.\n\nSome changes came later, after the holidays as the sick started coming in record numbers.\n\n'Like a war zone': ICU beds expand, body bags in play as Oxnard hospital faces surge\n\nHe waited to clean a room as security staff rolled away a body all too often.

Her patient had just died. The other nurse said to wait, because her patient had just died, too. They would have to call for them both.\n\nContreras struggled to find a word to describe what it felt like in the hospital as 2020 turned into 2021 and January quickly became the county’s deadliest month of the virus.\n\n“Tired,” he said after a few moments.\n\nNurses were tired of their patients dying.

If you would like your loved one remembered in this way, email me at ccrowder@dmreg.com or submit their name here.\n\nTogether, we can make certain the Iowans lost will always be more than a number.\n\n— Courtney Crowder\n\nREMEMBERING:\n\nA\n\nConnie Abegglen, 74, Merrill.

Doug Carter, superintendent of the Indiana State Police, added the probable cause affidavit remains sealed.\n\n'Hiding in plain sight':Libby German's grandparents react to murder charges\n\nKelsi German, Libby's older sister, tweeted Friday morning, \"Just know how grateful I am for all of you. No comments for now, any questions please refer to the Carroll county prosecutor's office. There is tentatively a press conference Monday at 10 am. We will say more then.\n\n\"Today is the day,\" she wrote.\n\nThe girls' slayings as well as the blizzard of news coverage, social media speculation and bits of chilling evidence released in the case, have tormented and captivated Hoosiers and other Americans even this many years after the crimes.\n\nIn July of 2021, Carroll County imposed a total blackout on releasing any information about possible persons of interest in the investigation, according to Carroll County Sheriff Tobe Leazenby.\n\nHere's a closer look at what we know about what took place that day on that lonely trail.\n\nWho were Abigail Williams and Liberty German?\n\nAbby and Libby were friends and eighth-graders at Delphi Community Middle School, before they were killed.\n\nTo honor them, family members initially thought about raising money for new bleachers or a scoreboard at a softball field where the girls played. Their idea grew into the L&A Park Foundation, a nonprofit created to oversee the construction of a $1 million park, including three ball fields, an amphitheater and playgrounds.\n\nConstruction began in the spring of 2019 on the 20-acre Abby and Libby Memorial Park and it opened for play in July of 2021.\n\nDelphi murders early timeline:The search for Abby and Libby’s killer\n\nWho is Richard Allen?\n\nFor years police officers and family members have decried the rampant rumors that have circulated in the case as well as the side-by-side photos comparing actual persons to the police sketches that some people have posted on social media sites, saying such speculation doesn't help the investigation and can be harmful to others.\n\nThe arrest of Richard Allen only further illustrates that message, as many noted his name has not been one of the many discussed previously on social media or podcasts.\n\nPolice have not released any information on Allen's arrest or his background at this time. During Monday's press conference, police and the prosecutor's office repeatedly said \"today is not the day\" for releasing details of the investigation, the arrest or the suspect.\n\nAllen has entered a 'not guilty' plea\n\nAllen worked at the local CVS as a licensed pharmacy technician and has seemingly been hiding in plain sight as police have previously suspected.\n\nLibby's grandmother, Becky Patty, told reporters that Allen had processed photos of the girls at a local drug store and did not charge the family for the cost.\n\nWRTV's Kara Kenney reported that CVS issued a statement, which can be seen in the tweet below.\n\n'The pain isn't less':Five years after their murder, Delphi teens still mourned\n\nWhat lead to this Delphi case announcement\n\nThe self-imposed blackout on releasing information about the case to the media highlights the importance of Friday's announcement.\n\nWhile there have been no official statements or updates on the investigation prior to the planned press conference, a podcast devoted to murder mysteries questioned in September whether a recent visit to Peru, Ind., by the superintendent of the Indiana State Police had anything to do with the unsolved murders of two Delphi teenagers.\n\nThe hosts of the true-crime podcast The Murder Sheet, Áine Cain and Kevin Greenlee, reportedly took photographs of ISP investigators in and near the Wabash River, near Peru, Ind., about 40 miles from where the teenagers were found killed five years ago.\n\nWabash River search'The Murder Sheet' podcast: Could water search be linked to Delphi murder investigation?\n\nWhat is next in the Delphi case\n\nDelphi police and the prosecutor's office said a public court hearing will be set to determine if the documents, including the affidavit in the case, will remain under seal.\n\nAllen, who has entered a preliminary plea of not guilty, will appear in court on Jan. 13 for a pre-trial hearing.\n\nHis trial is tentatively set to begin on March 20.\n\nHow were the Delphi girls killed?\n\nSocial media groups dedicated to the case have speculated for years about how the girls were killed, but that information has never been publicly released.\n\nPolice officials and prosecutors have remained tightlipped about the investigation, saying repeatedly that they need to withhold certain key details to maintain the integrity of the case.\n\n\"When we have the person we want, we want to know what they know about the case,\" Sgt. Kim Riley of the Indiana State Police, said in an interview with IndyStar in 2020. \"That's why we've held back on the information that we've given out.\"\n\nFamilies speak about Delphi murders:Four years later, family says it's 'like it happened yesterday'\n\nInvestigation of Ron Logan\n\nIn May of 2022, The Murder Sheet Podcast published and affidavit that the Journal & Courier confirmed to be authentic.\n\nThe affidavit indicates that Logan, who died in January 2022, lied to investigators.\n\nIt also indicated that Logan asked his cousin the morning of Feb. 14, 2017, to tell police — if asked — that he picked up Logan at his house between 2 and 2:30 p.m. Feb. 13, 2017, and drove to an aquarium store in Lafayette.\n\nFor more on Ron Logan, including quotes from an interview conducted just days after the killings, click the link below.\n\nDelphi murders update on Ron Logan:Possible suspect in Delphi murders been on police radar since the killings\n\nWho is 'anthony_shots'?\n\nIn the course of the investigation in December 2021, police uncovered an online profile used to communicate with young girls, using the name anthony_shots. The man's photo used on the profile is not a person of interest.\n\nThe online profile was used from 2016-17, police said, to solicit nude images from juvenile girls.\n\nKegan Kline was named by police as the suspect behind the catfish account. Kline is a suspect in a Miami County child exploitation and child pornography case.\n\n\"During Kegan’s interview,\" the 2020 affidavit stated, \"he initially denied creating fake social media accounts and talking to underage girls. Later in the interview, he admitted to creating the anthony_shots profile and speaking to underage girls.\"\n\nKegan Kline affidavit:Affidavit links man to fictitious social media profile cited in Delphi murder investigation\n\nWho is Kegan Kline?\n\nThe probable cause affidavit for Kline's 30 charges in Miami County indicated police first interviewed him on Feb. 25, 2017 — 12 days after the girls were killed.\n\nHLN reporter Barbara MacDonald reported she spoke with Kline in December after the Indiana State Police indicated Kline's social media profile \"anthony_shots\" was of interest in the killings.\n\nMacDonald asked why the state police focused on Kline's catfish social media profile.\n\n“I have not a clue,\" Kline told HLN. “I think it’s because they said I was the last person to talk to her, is what they told me.”\n\nIn March of 2022, nearly 200 pages of police interview transcripts with Kline were reportedly uncovered by The Murder Sheet podcast after they were accidentally posted to a county website, according to Fox59.\n\nIn them, police question Kline about communications the 'anthony_shots' profile had with Liberty German the night before she died, and plans to meet up with her the day she was murdered.\n\nIn an August 2020 interview transcript, police tell Kline they believe individuals other than Kline had access to \"anthony_shots.\"\n\nIn the HLN interview, FOX59 reported, Kline also said ISP reportedly told him “they knew it was my dad” that killed the teenagers.\n\nKeegan Kline police interviews:Transcript refers to conversations 'anthony_shots' had with murdered Delphi teen\n\nInvestigators are asking anyone who may have communicated with, met or attempted to meet the person connected with the profile to email abbyandlibbytip@cacoshrf.com or call 765-822-3535.\n\nIs James Brian Chadwell a suspect?\n\nOne person who garnered attention surrounding the case was James Brian Chadwell II, a 42-year-old Lafayette resident accused of kidnapping and sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl in April, 2021.\n\nA knock on Chadwell's door by police officers interrupted his sexual assault of the girl he had locked in his basement, forcing him to quickly dress and answer the door, according to prosecutors.\n\nJames Brian Chadwell:Lafayette girl found in basement says Chadwell sexually assaulted her, affidavit shows\n\nAfter the arrest, residents were quick to point out the nature of the alleged crimes and a resemblance to the first suspect sketch.\n\n\"The information has obviously been shared with us, and our investigators are looking into him,\" Leazenby said.\n\nAttempts to follow up on the investigation into Chadwell's possible connection were prevented when police imposed the information blackout in July.\n\nSince his arrest, Chadwell has been involved in a jailhouse fight, and requested a change of venue citing worldwide media attention.\n\n\"Mr. Chadwell continues to be associated with Abigail Williams and Liberty German's killings,\" his attorney Shay Hughes said, noting that the New York Posts published information that indicated Chadwell is guilty.\n\nGood Morning America keeps Delphi murders in spotlight\n\nOn Feb. 10, 2022, the national show 'Good Morning America' featured the case ahead of the five-year anniversary. They discussed the latest statements from ISP Superintendent Doug Carter and family members.\n\n\"My resolve to catch him is as strong now as it was day one,\" Carter said. \"The only difference between now and day one is we know about you, a lot about you. Today could be the day. Sleep well.\"\n\nWhat else do we know about the Delphi murders?\n\nInvestigators have released these four bits of key evidence in the case.\n\n• FBI description: The suspected killer is thought to be a white man who weighs between 180 and 200 pounds and stands between 5 feet, 6 inches tall and 5 feet, 8 inches tall. He has been described as wearing blue jeans, a blue jacket or coat and a hoodie.\n\n• Police sketches: There were two police sketches released in the case.State Police released an image done by an FBI sketch artist on July 17, 2017, that showed an older-looking man with a goatee, who was wearing a cap and a hoodie. On April 22, 2019, State Police released a new sketch of the suspect,one in which the suspect is clean-shaven and looks to be much younger than the earlier sketch. Police say the new sketch takes precedence over the old one and added that the killer is now thought to be between the ages of 18 and 40 — but may appear younger than his true age.\n\n• Smartphone image, audio: A day after the girls were found, police released a grainy image of the suspect taken from video on Libby's smartphone. A week later, they released audio of a man's voice saying \"down the hill.\" The longer version of the same smartphone video released in 2019 shows the gait of the man as he was walking on the bridge — as well as a longer version of audio, where he can be heard saying \"Guys ... Down the hill.\"\n\n• Location of suspect: At the same April 2019 press conference, Doug Carter, superintendent of the State Police, said new information leads investigators to believe that the killer is from Delphi, and they believe he either still lives or works in Delphi, or frequently visits the area.\n\nDelphi murders:Is Abby and Libby’s killer one of Delphi’s own? ISP says, yes\n\nWhat have their families said?\n\nMike Patty, the grandfather of Liberty German, has spoken out publicly at news conferences and in interviews with the media about the toll that the case has taken.\n\nPatty said in an interview in February 2018 that he was still optimistic that there would be a break in the case. Finding the killer, he said, would allow his family — and Abby's mother, Anna — to finally start to grieve.\n\n\"This is what you wake up with every day. It’s the last thoughts before you go to bed. And some nights, I still don’t sleep. For three months, I didn’t sleep,” Patty said in 2018.\n\n“And I’m not going to sleep until I know another family won’t have to go through this, like we are right now.”\n\n'Horrible to live like this':Family members and community still torn apart a year after Abby and Libby were killed\n\nKelsi German has said she considered her younger sister, Libby, to be her best friend. She dropped Libby and Abby off near the Monon High Bridge trail early in the afternoon of Feb. 13, 2017.\n\nFinding their killer has become a calling for her. In February 2020, on the third anniversary of their murders, Kelsi posted this poignant message to her 14,000-plus Twitter followers at @libertyg_sister: “Today 3 years ago,” she wrote, “was my last real day with my best friend and I wish I would’ve done it differently. I miss you.”\n\nKelsi talked more with a reporter from Lafayette Journal & Courier about how special her sister was — and her recollections of the events of that fateful day.\n\nAre police holding a Delphi murders news conference this year?\n\nIndiana State Police announced they plan a news conference to update the investigation of the Delphi murders and who might have killed Libby German and Abby Williams on Feb. 13, 2017.\n\nThe press conference is planned for 10 a.m. Monday morning at the Delphi United Methodist Church. Follow us here and on our social media accounts as we keep you updated with latest.\n\nAre Delphi murders a cold case? After 3 years with no arrests, police say case isn't cold\n\nHow many officers are working the case now?\n\nThe State Police news release said there were two Carroll County detectives, two Indiana State Police detectives \"and other law enforcement officers\" assigned to the case.\n\nThere were hundreds of officers and volunteers helping out in the days and weeks after the girls disappeared and their bodies were found, but now much fewer are working actively on the case.\n\nPolice also say they've received tens of thousands of tips in the case. State Police Supt. Doug Carter and other law-enforcement officials have insisted in the past that the Delphi Murders investigation is not a cold case.\n\nIs there new evidence in the case?\n\nNo new official evidence, but an augmented reality smartphone app called CrimeDoor released a video based on evidence from the crime scene that gives users a closeup view of computer-generated images of the girls standing on the Monon High Bridge, as the killer slowly approaches them across the abandoned, weather-beaten rail trestle.\n\nCrimeDoor app:Augmented reality app might help find Delphi teens' killer\n\nThe free portion of the app lets users access news accounts of crimes. If they want to digitally walk through a crime scene, users must pay $1.99 to download the augmented reality portion of the case.\n\nKelsi German, Libby's older sister, has expressed support for the app, saying it may \"hopefully solve cases and get arrests for many unsolved cases.”\n\n'Down the Hill' and other podcasts about the Delphi murders\n\nThe unsolved murders of Abby and Libby have been the subject of a several true crime podcasts. One of the most prominent was launched by HLN, formerly CNN Headline News, that premiered on Feb. 5, 2020, prior to the third anniversary of the girls' deaths.\n\n\"Down the Hill: The Delphi Murders\" examined the slayings' impact on the small town , as well as how the case continues to haunt the community.\n\n'Down the Hill':HLN explores Delphi murders in new podcast\n\nOne of the top true-crime podcasts, \"My Favorite Murder,\" gave their take on the case in Episode 235.\n\n\"Casefile\" did an hour-long episode on the case, \"Unsolved\" released a 90-minute episode recapping the murders, while \"Scene of the Crime: Delphi\" did a 7-episode series on the basics of the case in early 2020.\n\nAre tips still being taken in the case?\n\nYes. Investigators are still seeking information and ask that people who reach out to them provide key details, such as a name, age, phone number, and why the caller thinks that person may be connected to the case. Such tips can be made anonymously and there is a significant reward for information leading to an arrest in the case.\n\nAnyone with such information is urged to call the Delphi homicide tip line at 844-459-5786. Tips also may be emailed to abbyandlibbytip@cacoshrf.com.\n\nLafayette Journal & Courier reporters Ron Wilkins and Dave Bangert contributed to this story.\n\nDwight Adams is a digital producer on Gannett's Midwest Digital Optimization team.

Afful will be a top target and is poised to emerge as a big-time player. The Spartans will be physical. Will they be as deep as the other North Jersey superpowers? No, but they don't use that as an excuse.\n\nState of the Program:DePaul football continues to be a success story\n\nDon Bosco\n\nCoach: Dan Sabella (1st season)\n\nDivision: SFC United Red\n\n2018 record: 6-5\n\nPlayers to watch: Jalen Berger, senior WR/RB; Jahquil Batts, senior QB; Kyle Monangai, senior RB; Cameron Lenhardt, freshman DL; Michael Courtney, senior S, Jahmir Greene, senior DL.\n\nOutlook: Dan Sabella has found a home at Don Bosco Prep and he is charged with restoring the Ironmen to national prominence. It all starts behind center, where Batts is expected to take a big step forward in his play. Berger and Monangai are the best 1-2 punch in New Jersey.\n\nState of the Program:Don Bosco football looks to climb back to prominence\n\nDumont\n\nCoach: Rick Burd (3rd season)\n\nDivision: SFC American Red\n\n2018 record: 5-5\n\nPlayers to watch: Matthew Stewart, senior, RB; Devon Turner, sophomore, RB; Joseph Carabillo, senior, WR; Lucas Nallen, senior, LB; Juan Vera, senior, DL.\n\nOutlook: Dumont wants to move forward after two years at .500. Winning a playoff game is now a goal, and the team's 18 seniors will try to make it happen.\n\nState of the Program:Can Dumont football break through in 2019?\n\nDwight Morrow\n\nCoach: Joe Hoyle (1st season)\n\nDivision: SFC Patriot Gold\n\n2018 record: 4-5\n\nPlayers to watch: Ryan Fletcher, junior, WR/DB; Veron Garrison, senior, C/LB; Quintin Goodwater, junior, TE/LB; Jalen Hoyle, junior, QB/S; Khaleb Hunt, junior, RB/DB; Hector Lebron, senior, OT/DT.\n\nOutlook: Numbers went up drastically from last season, thanks in part to a few players who transferred back to their home district from non-publics. Slot receiver Ronald Thomas (Don Bosco) will be among those aiming to help carry over momentum from three straight competitive seasons.\n\nState of the Program:Dwight Morrow football focused on the future\n\nEastside\n\nCoach: James Magazine (1st season)\n\nDivision: SFC Liberty Red\n\n2018 record: 1-9\n\nPlayers to watch: Samir Chapman, senior, FB/LB; Michael Jackson III, senior, QB; Ahsin Jacobs, sophomore, WR/DB; Jahsin Jacobs, sophomore, DE; Jadyn Kitchings, senior, WR/CB; Chris Santana, senior, WR/LS.\n\nOutlook: It might be asking a lot for the Ghosts to gain ground in a tough division. Yet that doesn’t rule out a marked improvement, especially with the return of four players who were two-way starters as freshmen. Team speed is Eastside’s biggest asset.\n\nState of the Program:Eastside football rebuilding its foundation\n\nElmwood Park\n\nCoach: Tom Mulligan (6th season)\n\nDivision: NJIC Liberty\n\n2018 record: 0-9\n\nPlayers to watch: Eddie Alfieri, senior, FB/LB; Ryan Briggs, senior, OL/DL; Abe Kario, senior, OL/DL; Joe Lovera, senior, HB/LB; Messiah Muckle, junior, HB/WR/DB; TJ Vandervliet, senior, OL/DL.\n\nOutlook: Pride and toughness are two of the main concepts Mulligan has been preaching to his players. He likes the way the team has jelled in the preseason, and the Crusaders are ready to get back in the win column.\n\nState of the Program:Elmwood Park football out to restore its football identity\n\nEmerson\n\nCoach: Nick Calandrino (5th season)\n\nDivision: NJIC Patriot\n\n2018 record: 6-3\n\nPlayers to watch: Gio Ramaci, LB; Joey Lacorazza, RB/LB; Frank Savino, QB; Cole DeMagestris OL/DL.\n\nOutlook: The Cavaliers had a promising season cut down by injuries at the end of last season. They have a small, but determined squad. Lacorazza will be the key player on both sides of the ball.\n\nState of the Program:Emerson football hoping not to get caught in numbers game\n\nFair Lawn\n\nCoach: Rob Gentile (4th season)\n\nDivision: SFC Freedom Red\n\n2018 record: 2-6\n\nPlayers to watch: Jalen Corporan, junior, RB/LB; Ali Ljapo, junior, QB/DB; Kyle Irby-Mason, senior, FB/OL/DL; Tami Kabiawu, junior, WR/DB; Tyler Massey, senior, OL/DL.\n\nOutlook: The Group 4 Cutters feature several key juniors, and their two-way stalwarts must remain healthy to give them a chance to win a couple of close games.\n\nState of the Program:Fair Lawn football looks for improvement in 2019\n\nFort Lee\n\nCoach: Charles Salame (1st season)\n\nDivision: SFC American Red\n\n2018 record: 2-7\n\nPlayers to watch: Stefano Casale, junior, QB; Dean Park, sophomore, RB; Evan Diaz, senior, WR; Joshua Estella, senior, OL/DL; Adrian Lasval, senior OL/DL.\n\nOutlook: Salame will try to turn the Bridgemen around before joining the Ivy Division in 2020.

There are big numbers and a new approach to try to maximize the Boilermakers' talent and ability. Some early success could set up a late-season run.\n\nState of the Program:Garfield football proud of the past, but seeking a brighter future\n\nGlen Rock\n\nCoach: Jim Kurz (11th season)\n\nDivision: NJIC Colonial\n\n2018 record: 5-4\n\nPlayers to watch: Chris Fink, senior OL/DL; Myles Loscalzo, senior; Liam Miele, senior OL/DL, Greg Schlett, senior QB/LB; Anthony Scotto, senior WR/S; Owen Stephenson, senior WR/S; Matt Theuerkauf, senior; Conor Kazanjian, senior.\n\nOutlook: The Panthers qualified for the playoffs but were outmanned by Westwood in the first round. Schlett is a two-sport standout and a fiery leader. Glen Rock will be in the mix for the division title.\n\nState of the Program:Glen Rock football steady as a, you know, rock\n\nHackensack\n\nCoach: Benjie Wimberly (8th season)\n\nDivision: SFC Liberty Red\n\n2018 record: 5-5\n\nPlayers to watch: Daniel Mai, senior, TE/LB; Jayden Robertson, junior, QB; Tymere Robinson, senior, RB/LB; Robert Walker, senior, T/DT; Jordan Wimberly, senior, WR/DB.\n\nOutlook: The Comets return eight seniors who are three-year starters and this talented, veteran group is capable of challenging for division and North Group 5 sectional titles.\n\nState of the Program:Hackensack football expects to challenge for titles in 2019\n\nHasbrouck Heights\n\nCoach: Nick Delcalzo (35th season)\n\nDivision: NJIC Meadowlands\n\n2018 record: 12-0\n\nPlayers to watch: Zai'heer Jenkins, senior, WR/DB; Spencer Lee, senior, QB; Rocco Minichello, junior, SB/LB; Matteo Ochoa, senior, OL/LB; Mike Robertson, senior, RB/LB.\n\nOutlook: The Aviators are 33-1 over the previous three seasons, and a relatively new cast must step up quickly to lead the challenge for another North Group 1 title.\n\nState of the Program:Hasbrouck Heights' football title streak will be put to the test\n\nHawthorne\n\nCoach: John Passero (19th season)\n\nDivision: NJIC Liberty\n\n2018 record: 6-3\n\nPlayers to watch: Jalen Palmer, senior RB/DB; Joe Aliano, senior, DB; Adam Deitrich, senior, LB; Shane Rooney, senior, WR.\n\nOutlook: Expect a learning curve and adjustment period as several first-year starters get acclimated.\n\nState of the Program:Hawthorne football needs newcomers to step up\n\nIndian Hills\n\nCoach: Dominic Mulieri (1st season)\n\nDivision: SFC Freedom Red\n\n2018 record: 3-7\n\nPlayers to watch: Gavin Ballinger, senior, C/DT; Aiden Chumas, senior, WR/LB; Michael Crespo, senior, WR/DE; Kenny Fazio, senior, WR/S; Christian Murillo, senior RB/LB; Amir Shaghaghi, senior, G/DT.\n\nOutlook: The Braves have an alum at the helm in Mulieri, who has stated his desire to invest in the long haul. While there is strong senior leadership, finding a QB is a priority, and that likely will come from the underclassmen.\n\nState of the Program:Indian Hills football seeks stability in 2019\n\nKennedy\n\nCoach: Ron Jackson (16th season)\n\nDivision: SFC Liberty Red\n\n2018 record: 6-4\n\nPlayers to watch: Emmanuell Briggs, senior, OL/DE; Andre Gardner, senior, RB/CB; Shafear Johnson, senior, WR; Steven Rojas, senior, LB; Caleb Ruffin, senior, TE/DE; Jamier Wright-Collins, senior, RB/LB.\n\nOutlook: The Knights’ three regular-season losses in 2018 came by a combined eight points. Earning their second playoff bid of the 2000s represented an important step forward. Jackson is encouraged by the offensive line’s play in the preseason, and the unit’s improvement should keep Kennedy trending upward.\n\nState of the Program:Kennedy football hungry for more football success\n\nLakeland\n\nCoach: Tom McCormack (10th season)\n\nDivision: SFC American Red\n\n2018 record: 8-2\n\nPlayers to watch: Ray Schmitt, senior, RB/DB; Jude Padovano, senior, RB/LB; Todd Geyer, junior, QB; TJ McCormack, junior, LB/OL.\n\nOutlook: The Lancers return six starters, as they shoot for a third consecutive postseason appearance.\n\nState of the Program:Revamped Lakeland football looks to stay relevant\n\nLodi\n\nCoach: Mark Maggio (3rd season)\n\nDivision: NJIC Colonial\n\n2018 record: 3-7\n\nPlayers to watch: Chris Diaz, senior WR/DB; Jason Nunez, senior RB/WR; Gabe Herrera, senior OT/DT; Aaron Morivick, junior WR; Ayden Lyubimov, junior TE/LB; Joe Valardi, junior QB; AJ Ascencio, junior RB/LB.\n\nOutlook: A lot of sophomores played last year for the Rams and showed promise. Maggio believes its the core of a group that can bring championship football back to Lodi. The Rams need to stay healthy and smart.\n\nState of the Program:Lodi football looks to get back to winning ways\n\nLyndhurst\n\nCoach: Rich Tuero (6th season)\n\nDivision: NJIC Liberty\n\n2018 record: 9-2\n\nPlayers to watch: Piotr Partyla, senior RB/LB; James Blake, senior OL/DL; Tommy Ryan, senior OL/DL; Joe Cutola, senior OL/DL; Justin Gerena, senior TE/LB.\n\nOutlook: With a monster senior class and Partyla back after an All-State type of season, they are thinking about earning some rings in Lyndhurst. The Golden Bears haven't won a sectional title since 1983.\n\nState of the Program:Lyndhurst football poised to take the next step in 2019\n\nMahwah\n\nCoach: Chris Diaz (3rd season)\n\nDivision: SFC American Red\n\n2018 record: 5-4\n\nPlayers to watch: Kyle Teel, senior, QB; Ryan Cabrera, senior, RB; Jacob Kezmarsky, senior, OL; Christian Ash, senior, OL; Mark Pierro, senior, DL.\n\nOutlook: The Thunderbirds are ready for another playoff run with Teel under center and 10 starters back on defense.

They have some pieces to replace after graduation, but Picinic is one of the best small-school players in North Jersey, and his team hasn't lost a divisional game since 2016.\n\nState of the Program:For New Milford football, it's the dawn of a new era\n\nNorth Arlington\n\nCoach: Paul Savage (3rd season)\n\nDivision: NJIC Meadowlands\n\n2018 record: 1-8\n\nPlayers to watch: Danny Gonzalez, senior; Jeremiah Mercado, senior, OG; Christopher Stirone, senior, OG/NT; Robert Tomasco, senior FB/LB; Joe Witt, junior, QB; Pete Ziakos, junior, C.\n\nOutlook: The Vikings are in search of their first on-field win since 2016 (last year’s was a forfeit vs. Ridgefield). They have good speed and three returning starters on the O-line, while Witt switches to quarterback from receiver.\n\nState of the Program:North Arlington football starting a youth movement\n\nNorthern Highlands\n\nCoach: Greg Russo (1st season)\n\nDivision: SFC Patriot Red\n\n2018 record: 4-6\n\nPlayers to watch: Charlie Cheney, senior, WR/DB; Ethan Harris, senior, RB; Nick Holle, junior, TE/LB; John Ozdemir, senior, LB; Jack Stephen, senior, QB/LB.\n\nOutlook: The Highlanders have finished at or near .500 almost the entire decade and Russo, after serving as an assistant, takes over a veteran team seeking to reach the next level.\n\nState of the Program:Northern Highlands football looks to take the next step\n\nNV/Demarest\n\nCoach: Tony Mottola (11th season)\n\nDivision: SFC Patriot Gold\n\n2018 record: 4-6\n\nPlayers to watch: Jake Benishay, senior, WR/DB; Jaden Felletter, senior, WR/RB/DB; Ben Marinaccio, senior, RB/DB; Jack Mottola, senior, TE/LB; James Zampetti, senior, OL/DL.\n\nOutlook: The Norsemen can produce a winning season and fourth consecutive postseason bid if they develop an offensive line that can help guide an inexperienced quarterback.\n\nState of the Program:NV/Demarest football aims to continue playoff streak\n\nNV/Old Tappan\n\nCoach: Brian Dunn (20th season)\n\nDivision: SFC Patriot Red\n\n2018 record: 8-3\n\nPlayers to watch: Pat Passalacqua, senior, OL/DL; Jake Piccinich, senior, WR/DB; Jack Renaghan, junior, OL; Sebastian Santana, senior, OL; Kevin Weis, senior, TE/DL.\n\nOutlook: The Golden Knights return a majority of starters on offense and defense and can vie for division and Group 4 sectional titles if a quality quarterback emerges.\n\nState of the Program:NV/Old Tappan football capable of another sectional title run\n\nPalisades Park/Leonia\n\nCoach: TJ Kroncke (1st season)\n\nDivision: NJIC Colonial\n\n2018 record: 1-8\n\nPlayers to watch: Leo Driottez, junior, QB; Stephano Hadoulis, junior, RB; Chris McKnight, junior, WR; Derrick Bueno, junior, WR; Nate Meano, senior, OL/DL; Dennis Bajanov, LB/TE.\n\nOutlook: Kroncke hopes to steady the ship as the fourth coach in four seasons.

It probably is, but can the Paladins compete against the rest of the North Jersey superpowers?\n\nState of the Program:Will a year of experience boost Paramus Catholic's fortunes?\n\nPark Ridge\n\nCoach: Tom Curry Jr. (6th season)\n\nDivision: NJIC Patriot\n\n2018 record: 9-2\n\nPlayers to watch: Vincent Pinto, senior QB/LB; Brendan Hughes, junior WR/LB; Justin Wagner, senior WR/DB; Dylan Conkling, senior OL/DL; Daniel Kim, junior RB/LB; Daniel Gutin, junior WR/LB; Casey Allen, junior OL/DL.\n\nOutlook: Pinto will be one of the must-see players in North Jersey this season. As fun as he is to watch on offense, his skills at linebacker at legit. The Owls haven't forgotten how close they were to a sectional title a year ago.\n\nState of the Program:Park Ridge football keeps carrying on\n\nPascack Hills\n\nCoach: Brooks Alexander (19th season)\n\nDivision: SFC American Red\n\n2018 record: 0-8\n\nPlayers to watch: Chris Centeno, senior, OL/DL; Michael DelGrande, senior, OL/DL; Nick Dimassimo, senior, OL/DL; Cameron Funesti, senior, WR/DB; Tom Glickman, senior, OL/DL; Billy Pulzello, senior, WR/DB; Gabe Velez, senior, QB/RB/DB.\n\nOutlook: The Cowboys experienced their first winless season since 1995. The good news is, a winning campaign followed that one, and there is enough returning this year that history can repeat. Pascack Hills’ last playoff appearance came in 2015.\n\nState of the Program:Pascack Hills football looks to get back on track\n\nPascack Valley\n\nCoach: Len Cusumano (4th season)\n\nDivision: SFC Patriot Gold\n\n2018 record: 3-6\n\nPlayers to watch: Stephen Begen, senior, QB/FS; Sean Deady, senior, OT/DL; James Della Pesca, senior, TE/LB; Sean Duffy, senior, C/DT; Chase Rickert, senior, OT/DL; Jake Williams, senior, RB/LB.\n\nOutlook: The Indians are accustomed to being in the playoffs. This year, they’d like to get back to having a winning record, too.

The 2017 team had the program’s best scoring offense (27.4 points per game) in two decades, and last year featured the best defense (19.1) in 10 years. The goal is to get both sides of the ball in sync.\n\nState of the Program:Passaic football generating 'buzz' in the community again\n\nPassaic Tech\n\nCoach: Matt Demarest (8th season)\n\nDivision: SFC Liberty Red\n\n2018 record: 2-8\n\nPlayers to watch: Gabriel Balevski, senior, QB; Jaheim McGuire, senior, TE/WR; Devon Virgil, senior, WR; Jimmy Agresta, senior, LB; Sahmee Clyburn, senior, LB; Ontray Dixon, junior, LB.\n\nOutlook: The Bulldogs have more depth and experience than last year, in particularly at the skill positions, which should result in more wins and success.\n\nState of the Program:Passaic Tech football returns a year older and wiser\n\nPassaic Valley\n\nCoach: Chet Parlavecchio (10th season)\n\nDivision: SFC Freedom Red\n\n2018 record: 4-5\n\nPlayers to watch: Giovanni Giovatto, senior, RB/LB; Vincent Colletti, senior, RB/LB; Antonio Bargiel, junior, LB; Matt Ciarlo, junior, LB; Alex Martin, junior, QB.\n\nOutlook: Led by Giovatto and Colletti, and given the return of four offensive linemen, this could be one of the strongest Passaic Valley teams in years.\n\nState of the Program:Passaic Valley football getting back to business\n\nPompton Lakes\n\nCoach: Scott Mahoney (15th season)\n\nDivision: NJIC Liberty\n\n2018 record: 4-5\n\nPlayers to watch: Justin Garcia, junior, RB; Dan Malkinski, junior, RB; Philip Latora, senior, TE/LB; Kyle Kleinot, senior, DE/OL; Brian Woodard, senior, WR; Michael Eberhart, junior/QB; Jason Testino, senior, DB.\n\nOutlook: With the return of a battle-tested crew, the Cardinals should compete for a conference title and qualify for the postseason for the fourth year in a row.\n\nState of the Program:Pompton Lakes football returns a year older and wiser\n\nRamapo\n\nCoach: Drew Gibbs (19th season)\n\nDivision: SFC Patriot Red\n\n2018 record: 13-0\n\nPlayers to watch: Sam Basa, senior, OG/LB; Aidan Labell, senior, K/P; Luke Robinson, senior, WR/CB; Miles Shifar, senior, OT/DE; Jake Tirone, senior, WR/CB; Chris Valvano, senior, QB/CB.\n\nOutlook: Few teams can graduate the talent that the Green Raiders did and still expect to be a title contender, but they are in that boat. The defending North Group 3 champs exhibit a keen work ethic, which should help them overcome relative inexperience.\n\nState of the Program:Ramapo football enjoying sustained run of success\n\nRamsey\n\nCoach: Anthony Petrock (4th season)\n\nDivision: SFC American Red\n\n2018 record: 6-4\n\nPlayers to watch: Bryan Creamer, junior, RB; Andrew Goehrig, junior, WR; Nick Labonowski, junior, OL/DL; Conor Vatcher, junior, OL/DL; Jonas Hyman, senior, LB.\n\nOutlook: Experience is at a premium with 16 seniors to replace and not much starting experience. Petrock still plans to be a playoff contender and sees talent in the lower grades.\n\nState of the Program:Ramsey football sees a bright future ahead\n\nRidgefield Park\n\nCoach: Steve Dunn (1st season)\n\nDivision: SFC Patriot Gold\n\n2018 record: 2-7\n\nPlayers to watch: Logan Martinez, senior, RB/LB; Jalexin Pimental, sophomore, WR; Matthew Vercelli, junior, QB/S; Tyler Colon, sophomore, RB/LB.\n\nOutlook: Can Steve Dunn be the guy to get the program back on track?

As explosive as the offense is, keep an eye on the defense, which returns its top three tacklers and could rival the 2016 unit that allowed 7.8 points per game for a 12-0 squad.\n\nState of the Program:Ridgewood football remains a model of consistency\n\nRiver Dell\n\nCoach: DJ Nimphius (16th season)\n\nDivision: SFC Patriot Gold\n\n2018 record: 8-3\n\nPlayers to watch: Holden Brodersen, senior; Jack Gillies, senior, QB; Ethan Kupfer, junior, RB/LB; Joe Mellett, senior, RB/DB; Mike Sirico, senior, QB/RB/WR/DB.\n\nOutlook: The Golden Hawks have reached a sectional final six consecutive years, and newcomers need to develop quickly to make a charge at a North Group 3 final.\n\nState of the Program:River Dell football looks for dozens of ways to win\n\nRutherford\n\nCoach: Andy Howell (10th season)\n\nDivision: NJIC Colonial\n\n2018 record: 11-1\n\nPlayers to watch: Chris Avramidis, senior, OL/DL; Steve Cisneros, senior, OL/DL; Sebastian Gaeta, senior, OL/LB; Kris Guzman, senior, SB/RB; Owen Meister, senior, WR/P.\n\nOutlook: The Bulldogs return just a handful of starters from an 11-1 team that won the North Group 2 Bowl title, and sophomores must emerge to help them vie for double-digit victories.\n\nState of the Program:Rutherford football working to continue its winning ways\n\nSaddle Brook\n\nCoach: Leo Ciappina (12th season)\n\nDivision: NJIC Meadowlands\n\n2018 record: 4-5\n\nPlayers to watch: Nick Ciolino, sophomore, SB/DB; Dante Guzman, senior, SB/DB; John Hacker, junior, WR/DL; Christian Lapid, senior, OL/LB; Jason Muoio, senior, RB.\n\nOutlook: The Falcons hope to challenge for a .500 record and possible North Group 1 playoff bid despite graduating a majority of starters. Key players must avoid injuries.\n\nState of the Program:Saddle Brook football sets sights on playoff bid\n\nSt. Joseph\n\nCoach: Augie Hoffmann (6th season)\n\nDivision: SFC United Red\n\n2018 record: 10-2\n\nPlayers to watch: Audric Estime, junior RB; Amin Vanover, senior DE; Christian Abraham, junior RB; Michael Alaimo, senior QB; Luke Wypler, senior OT.\n\nOutlook: With already seven Division I pledges (and more on the way), the Green Knights are loaded and the consensus preseason No. 1 team in New Jersey.

We examined the histories of local arts and entertainment organizations, public parks, sports teams, and venues, as well as individual accomplishments by Sarasotans in various fields ranging from politics and literature to the circus and rock ’n’ roll. We also revisited the busting of color barriers and the legacies of Overtown and Newtown.

But frequent roster churn tends to quickly dim memories of established players who made pit stops in unfamiliar cities — heck, recently dealt lineman Michael Bennett, who entered the NFL as a Buccaneer, is about to join his fourth club (Seahawks, Eagles, Patriots, Cowboys) in less than three full seasons.\n\nSo that got me thinking about current and past stars who have had forgettable stints in uniforms you might not recall. We're not going to insult your intelligence with luminaries who have recently bounced (Odell Beckham, Antonio Brown, Jadeveon Clowney) or those who shone for multiple franchises, say Peyton Manning or Adam Vinatieri. And don't want to bore you Millennials by going to deep into the vault for Y.A. Tittle or Night Train Lane.\n\nBut in the spirit of the NFL's 100th season, here's a list (certainly not exhaustive) of 100 guys who might have played in places you have no memory of — the objective being I want you to say, \"I totally forgot he played there\" or, even better, \"I never realized he played there.\"\n\n(Note: Guys whose rights were traded — Eli Manning and Philip Rivers, for example — but didn't play in some capacity for multiple teams were not considered.)\n\nNFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.\n\nOn to the list, which is organized alphabetically ...\n\n1. RB Shaun Alexander: The record-setting 2005 MVP in Seattle, he rushed for 24 yards in his final four games for Washington in 2008.\n\n2. DE Jared Allen: The colorful quarterback roper for the Chiefs and Vikings split his final two seasons with the Bears and Panthers.\n\n3. G Larry Allen: A legendary strongman in Dallas, he finished out his career with arch rival San Francisco in 2006 and 2007.\n\n4. K Morten Andersen: One of two pure kickers in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he retired as the league's all-time leading scorer, topping the career charts for both the Saints and Falcons, too. However Andersen was a nomad from 2001 through 2004, suiting up for the Giants, Chiefs and Vikings.\n\n5. S Steve Atwater: The popular Bronco played his final season for the Jets, one of many greats on this list who limped to the finish line with Gang Green.\n\n6. CB Champ Bailey: Another Broncos great, you'll likely recall he began his career with Washington in 1999 before being traded — with a second-round pick! — for Clinton Portis in 2004. But do you remember Bailey spending the 2014 preseason with the Saints before retiring?\n\n7. TE Mark Bavaro: One of the most dominant dual-threat tight ends ever, Bavaro played briefly for the Browns and Eagles after leaving the Giants.\n\n8. RB Jerome Bettis: He may seem like a prototypical Steeler, but he won 1993 offensive rookie of the year honors with the Los Angeles Rams and spent 1995 on the Busch Stadium turf for the St. Louis Rams.\n\n9. QB Drew Bledsoe: You know he was replaced by Tom Brady in New England and was subsequently dealt to Buffalo. Bledsoe later got Wally Pipp'd by Tony Romo in Dallas.\n\n10. WR Anquan Boldin: After seven years with Arizona, he remained a highly productive player for the Ravens and 49ers. He played his last year for the Lions in 2016 but did don a Bills uniform in the summer of 2017 before retiring.\n\nGREATEST PLAYERS OF ALL TIME:Who tops our list of the 100 best?\n\nNFL's 100 WORST TEAMS:Who were most hopeless squads in history?\n\n11. WR Tim Brown: The longtime Raiders star played his 17th and final season in Tampa.\n\n12. WR Isaac Bruce: After shining with the Rams for 14 seasons, he concluded his career in San Francisco.\n\n13. QB Mark Brunell: Jacksonville's all-time leading passer also started in Washington for three seasons. He spent the balance of his career backing up Brett Favre in Green Bay, Drew Brees in New Orleans and Mark Sanchez in New York.\n\n14. WR Dez Bryant: Had you already forgotten about that ill-fated practice in New Orleans when he tore his Achilles before he could play a game for the Saints in 2018?\n\n15. RB Reggie Bush: If you were asked how many teams he played for, would you have answered five? He was featured in New Orleans, Miami and Detroit. Not San Francisco, and certainly not Buffalo, where he \"rushed\" for minus-3 yards in his final season.\n\n16. RB Earl Campbell: Probably the greatest Houston Oiler, he spent his final 1½ seasons in New Orleans.\n\n17. WR Cris Carter: Minnesota's all-time leading receiver entered the NFL with the Eagles and left as a Dolphin.\n\n18. TE Dave Casper: The Hall of Fame \"Ghost\" is closely associated with the Raiders, for whom he began and ended his 11-year career. But he played 48 combined games for the Oilers and Vikings before finishing up with the L.A. Raiders in 1984.\n\n19. RB Jamaal Charles: You likely remember the Chiefs' all-time leading rusher taking a one-year detour to Denver. But what about his two-game cup of coffee in Jacksonville?\n\n20. TE Dallas Clark: One of Peyton Manning's trusted targets was also a Buccaneer and Raven. Seriously.\n\n21. RB Larry Csonka: Did you know it was Csonka, then with the Giants, who was involved in the ill-fated handoff that led to Philadelphia's miraculous \"Miracle at the Meadowlands\" victory in 1978?\n\n22. QB Randall Cunningham: You knew he starred for the Eagles and resurrected himself in Minnesota. But do you remember him wrapping his career as a backup for the Cowboys and Ravens?\n\n23. QB Len Dawson: Before becoming a champion and Super Bowl MVP for the Dallas Texans/Kansas City Chiefs, he muddled through the early part of his career with the Steelers and Browns.\n\n24. RB Eric Dickerson: His 1987 trade from the Rams to the Colts was one of the more stunning in league history. His stops with the Raiders and Falcons and a failed physical in Green Bay to end his career are largely forgotten.\n\n25. TE Mike Ditka: He's synonymous with the Bears as a player and coach. But he also played for the Eagles and won a Super Bowl as a member of the Cowboys.\n\n26. RB Tony Dorsett: The longtime Dallas star concluded his 12-year career in Denver.\n\n27. QB Boomer Esiason: The biggest passing game of his career (522 yards) occurred when he was a Cardinal.\n\n28. G Alan Faneca: Arguably one of the two best guards to play in the last 15 years (keep reading to learn the other), he played for the Jets and Cardinals after spending a decade in Pittsburgh.\n\n29. RB Marshall Faulk: The centerpiece of \"The Greatest Show on Turf\" Rams was drafted by the Colts in 1994 before being traded.\n\n30. QB Brett Favre: Prior to becoming King in the North, he partied a little too much for the Dirty South Falcons, who drafted him in 1991. And prior to becoming the Hand of the King (Aaron Rodgers?) while in Minnesota, Favre tried to play through a bit too much pain for the Jets in 2008.\n\nNFL's 100 GREATEST TEAMS OF ALL TIME:Which squad is best in league history?\n\n31. QB Nick Foles: He's now with the Jaguars ... remember? He used to start for the St. Louis Rams ... remember? He used to back up Alex Smith in Kansas City ... remember?\n\n32. DE Dwight Freeney: He didn't finish his illustrious career with the Colts — right, right. But he played for the Chargers, Cardinals, Falcons, Seahawks and Lions? Whoa.\n\n33. RB Eddie George: Oiler? Oh yeah. Titan? Of course. Cowboy? Huh?\n\n34. OLB Kevin Greene: No linebacker tops his 160 career sacks. Maybe you associated the bulk of his production with the L.A. Rams or Steelers ... though he played as many seasons as Carolina (three) as he did in Pittsburgh, plus another in San Francisco.\n\n35. RB Franco Harris: His bid to break Jim Brown's career rushing record (at the time) came up just short in Seattle in 1984.\n\n36. OLB James Harrison: Stop reading, Steelers fans ... OK, Harrison also spent time with the Ravens and Bengals before wrapping his career with the hated Patriots. Welp, at least he didn't join the Browns, too.\n\n37. QB Matt Hasselbeck: The first man to quarterback the Seahawks to a Super Bowl started his career as Favre's backup, ended it as Andrew Luck's and started 21 games for the Titans while mentoring Jake Locker.\n\n38. KR Devin Hester: The return man extraordinaire should go into the Hall after accruing his record 20 non-offensive TDs, one coming with Atlanta. Hester also spent the 2016 regular season in Baltimore. But only diehards will recall his final two games in the 2016 playoffs ... with Seattle.\n\n39. RB Priest Holmes: The fantasy stud to have from 2001 to 2003 during his time with the Chiefs, he spent the first four years of his career as an undrafted free agent with the Ravens.\n\n40. WR Torry Holt: Almost to a man, those great St. Louis Rams players faded into virtual anonymity. Holt's last catch came as a Jaguar. He tried to latch on with the Patriots but didn't make it out of training camp.\n\n41. G Steve Hutchinson: The league's best guard post-Larry Allen in my judgment — Let's get him into the Hall next year, please — Mr. \"Poison Pill\" starred in Seattle and Minnesota before hanging up his spurs with Tennessee.\n\n42. RB Steven Jackson: Talk about poor timing. He missed the heyday of The Greatest Show on Turf, was stuck on two bad Atlanta teams and finished up with the Patriots — yes — during a year (2015) they failed to reach the Super Bowl.\n\n43. RB Edgerrin James: If you thought his final game occurred in a Cardinals uniform, you'd be wrong. It came in Seattle's threads.\n\n44. QB Ron Jaworski: If you know your NFL history, then you know the first man to lead the Eagles to a Super Bowl was drafted by the Rams in 1973. If you're really good, then you know \"Jaws\" was a backup in Miami and Kansas City during his final two seasons.\n\n45. WR Andre Johnson: The greatest Houston Texan prior to the arrival of J.J. Watt, Johnson wound down his career by touring with other AFC South teams (Colts, Titans).\n\n46. WR Chad Johnson: Ochocinco made his bones — and was a must-watch performer thanks to his frequent celebrations — in Cincinnati. But he reached the Super Bowl during a quiet 2011 season with the Patriots before his career came to an unfortunate end before he played a regular-season game for the Dolphins.\n\n47. WR Keyshawn Johnson: A No. 1 overall draft pick of the Jets and Super Bowl champ with the Bucs, his final seasons were with the Cowboys and Panthers.\n\n48. DE Deacon Jones: The man who coined the term \"sack\" was a relentless force for the Rams. But his career quietly ended amid stints in San Diego, where he was a teammate of fellow over-the-hiller Johnny Unitas, and Washington.\n\n49. CB Ty Law: He just entered the Hall of Fame, deservedly recognized for his role at the roots of the Patriots dynasty. But Law's final years were spent as a mercenary for the Jets (twice), Chiefs and Broncos.\n\n50. DB Ronnie Lott: Perhaps the greatest safety ever, his final four seasons were split between the Raiders and Jets. He even signed with the Chiefs but never played for them.\n\n51. TE John Mackey: He and Ditka revolutionized their position. Mackey spent most of his 10-year career trucking through defenses for the Baltimore Colts before his final year with the Chargers.\n\n52. QB Archie Manning: Peyton's and Eli's dad was the first great player in Saints history, though was never surrounded by much talent. His final three seasons were divided between New Orleans, Houston and Minnesota.\n\n53. WR Brandon Marshall: You know he was a vagabond, but can you name all seven teams that issued him paychecks? Stumped? ... Broncos, Dolphins, Bears, Jets, Giants, Seahawks and Saints, though he never played in a game for New Orleans.\n\n54. G Randall McDaniel: He was a Pro Bowler 11 times for the Vikings ... and once for the Buccaneers.\n\n55. QB Donovan McNabb: Bit of a shock when the Eagles traded him to the Redskins. His abbreviated hitch with the Vikings is hazier ... probably because he lost his job to Christian Ponder.\n\n56. WR Art Monk: He set several league receiving records during his 14 years with the Redskins, though their fans shudder to think that Monk wound up wearing jerseys for the Jets and hated Eagles.\n\n57. QB Joe Montana: You doubtless knew he finished with the Chiefs, but didn't want to exclude him from the list for those born after 1994.\n\n58. QB Warren Moon: He spent most of his illustrious career lofting those beautiful spirals for the Oilers. He was also a Pro Bowler for the Vikings and Seahawks before carrying a clipboard in Kansas City. (And just imagine his numbers had he not had to prove himself for six years with the Canadian Football League's Edmonton Eskimos.)\n\n59. WR Randy Moss: \"The Freak\" immediately vaulted to superstardom with the Vikings. You might only know he \"played\" for the Raiders because Oakland traded him to New England. After that? Moss actually went back to the Vikings, then joined the Titans and nearly won that elusive Super Bowl ring during his final season in San Francisco.\n\n60. QB Joe Namath: Broadway Joe hung it up on the Sunset Strip after an anticlimactic season with the Rams.\n\n61. WR Terrell Owens: Let's play the Brandon Marshall Game. Ready? Go — 49ers, Eagles, Cowboys, Bills and Bengals. Shoulda been a Raven, too. T.O. also joined the Allen Wranglers, an indoor team, nearly played for the Seahawks and almost went the CFL route.\n\n62. LT Orlando Pace: Another jettisoned Rams star. Pace's last season occurred in Chicago.\n\n63. DT Alan Page: The only defensive lineman to earn league MVP honors, Page was the most dangerous of those Purple People Eaters. But like Pace, Page's curtain came down in the Windy City.\n\n64. QB Carson Palmer: Among the best passers in the checkered histories of the Bengals and Cardinals. The same does not apply to the Raiders.\n\n65. DE/OLB Julius Peppers: Does it seem like he's only been retired a few months? Did it seem like he played 17 years, his Carolina sandwich filled with sacks from Chicago and Green Bay?\n\n66. RB Adrian Peterson: Nice to see his old Vikings fans shower the current Redskins back with applause last week. In the interim did you erase memories of AD strapping it up for the Saints and Cardinals?\n\n67. DT John Randle: Yet another longtime Viking, he actually played three years with Seattle before retiring.\n\n68. FS Ed Reed: It still boggles the mind that his final season in 2013 was divided between the Texans and Jets.\n\n69. CB Darrelle Revis: He wasn't a Jets teammate of Reed's in 2013, because Revis was with the Buccaneers. The next year he won a ring in New England (man, time flies). After two more years with the Jets, you're forgiven if you don't recollect Revis' abbreviated tenure with the 2017 Chiefs.\n\n70. WR Jerry Rice: The original GOAT, we still can't quite believe Rice crossed the Bay from San Francisco to Oakland in 2001. Wait, the Seahawks also let him wear Steve Largent's No. 80 for 11 games? Wait, he almost played for the Broncos in 2005 before retiring rather than accept a limited role? Crazy stuff.\n\n71. S Bob Sanders: Man, the 2007 defensive player of the year was a force when he was healthy ... which was all too rare. His final two games were spent in a Chargers uniform.\n\n72. CB Deion Sanders: Still can't believe he came out of retirement to wear No. 37 for the Ravens. Cowboys fans have probably also erased Prime Time's year in Washington from the memory banks.\n\n73. C Jeff Saturday: His NFL life began with the Ravens in 1998, though he didn't even play a preseason game for them, and ended with Saturday snapping to Aaron Rodgers. You know about the rest.\n\n74. RB O.J. Simpson: 49ers faithful probably still cringe at the thought of surrendering five high draft picks, including a first rounder, for the Juice's forgettable final two seasons.\n\n75. DE Bruce Smith: His record 200th sack came with Washington.\n\n76. RB Emmitt Smith: The last of his record 18,355 rushing yards came with Arizona.\n\n77. QB Kenny Stabler: The Snake slithered out of Oakland after a decade of Hall of Fame service but hung on for five more years in Houston and New Orleans.\n\n78. CB Aqib Talib: Does it seem like the Dolphins are his fifth team? Do you have any memory of him as a Buccaneer?\n\n79. QB Fran Tarkenton: The NFL's most prolific passer pre-Marino, Tarkenton's reign in Minnesota was interrupted by a five-year interlude with the Giants.\n\n80. RB Fred Taylor: Jacksonville's all-time leading rusher picked up another 424 yards on the ground for New England between 2009 and 2010.\n\n81. DE/OLB Jason Taylor: Spent a year with the Redskins, then went back to Miami. Spent a year with the Jets — reaching a championship game for the only time — then went back to Miami.\n\n82. QB Tim Tebow: He worked miracles for the Broncos in 2011 ... then barely worked at all for the Jets. But had you mentally deleted his breathlessly covered tryouts with the Patriots (2013) and Eagles (2015) before he became a Mets farmhand?\n\n83. RB Thurman Thomas: Buffalo's one-time league MVP spent his 13th and final season in Miami.\n\n84. LB Zach Thomas: A little odd this five-time all-pro hasn't gotten more Hall of Fame consideration. He played one year for the Cowboys after a dozen for the Dolphins.\n\n85. RB LaDainian Tomlinson: In case anyone forgot he played for both the Chargers and Jets (especially the Jets), LT tattooed his calves with the teams' logos.\n\n86. DE Justin Tuck: After achieving glory with the Giants, he finished quietly with the Raiders.\n\n87. DE Osi Umenyiora: After achieving glory with the Giants, he finished quietly with the Falcons.\n\n88. QB Johnny Unitas: He was drafted by the Steelers but never got a chance to play for them. He joined the Chargers for his final season and barely got a chance to play for them. In between those gigs, pretty good.\n\n89. QB Michael Vick: Indelible memories of his highlights for the Falcons and his second chance with the Eagles. But none from his time with the Jets and Steelers.\n\n90. RB Herschel Walker: His 1989 trade from the Cowboys to the Vikings was a pivotal moment in NFL history. His times with the Eagles and Giants, not to mention his Dallas return, were not.\n\n91. QB Kurt Warner: He lifted the Rams and Cardinals to heights rarely seen by those franchises. He also spent a year in New York tutoring Eli Manning.\n\n92. WR Reggie Wayne: He decided to join the Patriots in the 2015 preseason ... and decided two weeks later that he was fine not playing for them.\n\n93. C Mike Webster: Very few of Pittsburgh's \"Steel Curtain\" era royalty moved on to new NFL homes. But Webster was an exception, winding up in Kansas City for his final two seasons.\n\n94. WR Wes Welker: Did you know the undrafted free agent originally signed with the Chargers? Or that he spent three seasons in Miami? Or that following his years of ridiculous productivity with Brady and Peyton Manning, he played one final year in St. Louis?\n\n95. DE Reggie White: Admit it, you forgot he unretired in 2000 to play a season for the Panthers ... and finished with a career-low 5½ sacks.\n\n96. DT Vince Wilfork: Didn't get to finish up in New England, but he did so in Houston.\n\n97. DE Mario Williams: The No. 1 pick of the 2006 draft by the Texans, Williams' final five years were passed in the AFC East with Buffalo and Miami.\n\n98. RB Ricky Williams: While I mostly wanted to drop a Toronto Argonauts reference, don't forget he played for the Ravens in 2011.\n\n99. DB Rod Woodson: He's best known for his stellar decade in Pittsburgh and, secondarily, being a pillar of the famed 2000 Ravens defense. But Woodson also played in the Bay Area for both the 49ers and Raiders.\n\n100. QB Steve Young: Before becoming a two-time league MVP for the Niners, he suffered two brutal seasons in Tampa Bay (his time with the Bucs following his professional debut with the USFL's L.A. Express).\n\n***\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Nate Davis on Twitter @ByNateDavis.\n\nIf you love talking football, we have the perfect spot for you.

Barnes\n\nSpecial to USA TODAY\n\nNinety-one years after its debut, The Cavalier Hotel reclaimed its well-deserved reputation as a luxury destination in Virginia Beach when it reopened its doors earlier this year.\n\nBuilt over the course of 13 months from 1926 into 1927 to a tune of $2 million, The Cavalier was so-named as a result of a local newspaper contest, and it quickly became the place to be upon opening. Its private train depot welcomed guests non-stop from Chicago, and limousines ushered guests from the rail station, as well as from arriving steamer ships.\n\nWhen it opened, The Cavalier had 195 guest rooms and the grounds spanned 350 acres, including a golf course on 290 of those acres. Within the guest rooms, bathtubs featured an extra handle that would draw seawater direct from the Atlantic Ocean, and the in-room sinks had ice water spigots that would draw cold water, anytime, from a large wooden ice-filled tub on the hotel roof.\n\nIn addition to hosting seven U.S. presidents overnight — Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon — The Cavalier welcomed the top celebrities of the era, including Frank Sinatra, Muhammad Ali, Elizabeth Taylor, F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ella Fitzgerald and many, many more. And, when the oceanfront Cavalier Beach Club opened in 1929, it became a popular entertainment destination; big band leaders Benny Goodman, Cab Calloway, Glenn Miller and Lawrence Welk all performed there.\n\nAs with many historic hotels, when World War II broke out The Cavalier turned from a luxury hotel into a military facility; the U.S. Navy moved in in October 1942 and used the building for its radar training. The hotel’s history fluctuated for decades after the war, closing in 1973 when its sister hotel, Cavalier Oceanfront, opened, and then reopening again in 1976. Finally, a family feud caused a court-ordered sale of the hotel in 2012, and the winning bid went to The Cavalier Associates, a group that intended to renovate and restore the hotel rather than demolish it.\n\nFast forward and after three years and nearly $85 million in renovations, led by Gold Key | PHR, The Cavalier reopened this spring, and the results are nothing short of spectacular. The hotel is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and is the first in Virginia to be a part of Marriott’s distinguished Autograph Collection.\n\nGuests who check into The Cavalier will find 85 spacious and elegantly-appointed guest rooms and suites, all of which feature flat-screen TVs, Molton Brown bath toiletries, plush bathrobes and plenty of room to make themselves more than comfortable. In addition to the standard guest rooms, six Heritage Suites are available.\n\nThe public spaces found within The Cavalier are just as inviting. Guests are invited to take a seat on any one of the open-air verandahs or comfortable seating areas found around the hotel. A fitness center is at-the-ready for working out, or claim a lounge chair for yourself and relax alongside the indoor plunge pool. The onsite Sea Hill Spa offer myriad treatments, including its Ocean and Warm Sand Ritual featuring a quartz massage table. There’s also a co-ed Himalayan salt room.\n\nDining options include The Raleigh Room, also referred to as the hotel’s living room, which is the perfect spot to sip a cup of coffee in the morning, enjoy afternoon tea on Saturdays, or say “cheers” with a proper cocktail whilst enjoying live entertainment in the evenings. Nearby, Becca serves breakfast, lunch and dinner in its whimsically elegant main dining room, or on the adjoining loge or outdoor dining area. Downstairs, the dark greens and browns of The Hunt Room feel like a true tavern, and complement the hearty dinner menu. Afterwards, adjourn to the bar for savory cocktails.\n\nSpeaking of cocktails, The Cavalier features an in-house distillery next door to The Hunt Room — Tarnished Truth Distilling Company. The distillery is crafting its own bourbon, rye whiskey and AVA Vodka, all of which are available in the onsite store and featured in cocktails served throughout the hotel. Tours of the distillery, with tastings, are available Thursday through Sunday.\n\nAcross the street from The Cavalier is the Cavalier Beach Club, a new interpretation of the famed facilities of yesteryear. Exclusively for hotel guests (and the neighboring Cavalier Residences), the beach club features cabanas, private beach chairs and lounges; towel and beach umbrella service; an infinity pool and hot tub; and a beachside bar and restaurant. The Beach Club is open seasonally.\n\nJust how well-received are the newly-debuted renovations of The Cavalier? Prior to its opening, the hotel welcomed the public to tour its renovations. The management team expected that perhaps a couple of hundred people may be interested; over the course of two weekends, 10,000 people came to witness the rebirth of the legendary hotel.\n\nAnd celebrities are returning to The Cavalier as well. Since its opening, rapper and Virginia Beach native Pusha T was married at the hotel, with Pharrell Williams as best man and Kim and Kanye among the guests.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/08/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/12/28/news-deaths/1796955/", "title": "Passages in 2012: Notable deaths in news", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nLetitia Baldrige, 86, mighty manners maven who taught America everything from how to eat a salad tastefully to how to walk down the aisle gracefully.

OpenAI said it supports stronger protections against deepfakes and works to prevent its synthetic voices from copying those of real people.\n\n\"The voice of Sky is not Scarlett Johansson's, and it was never intended to resemble hers,\" Altman said in a statement late Monday. \"We cast the voice actor behind Sky’s voice before any outreach to Ms. Johansson. Out of respect for Ms. Johansson, we have paused using Sky’s voice in our products. We are sorry to Ms. Johansson that we didn’t communicate better.\"\n\nWhen OpenAI released a demo of its latest ChatGPT model last week, it included “Voice Mode,” with an emotive AI answering questions. One of those voices was \"Sky.\"\n\n“When I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference,\" Johansson said. \"Mr. Altman even insinuated that the similarity was intentional, tweeting a single word ‘her’ - a reference to the film in which I voiced a chat system, Samantha, who forms an intimate relationship with a human.”\n\nOpenAI said it is “pausing” the use of the Sky voice to address questions about how it chose the ChatGPT voices.\n\nA Sunday blog post from the artificial intelligence company says Sky’s voice “is not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson but belongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice,” and that the company \"carefully selected\" each of the voices over the course of a five-month process.\n\nJohansson said her legal counsel wrote two letters to Altman and OpenAI asking them to \"detail the exact process by which they created the 'Sky' voice.\n\n\"Consequently, OpenAI reluctantly agreed to take down the 'Sky' voice,\" she said.\n\nThe news was first reported by NPR.\n\nThe spat with Johansson comes at a tricky time for OpenAI, which is facing litigation from media companies, authors and artists for allegedly using their materials without consent or compensation.\n\n“Johansson is one of the world’s most famous actresses, and she speaks for an entire class of creatives who are now wrestling with the fact that automated systems have begun to erode the value of their work. OpenAI’s decision to usurp her voice for its own purposes will now get wide and justified attention,” journalist Casey Newton wrote in Platformer Monday.\n\nAnother powerful player, SAG-AFTRA, said it is backing Johansson. The influential union that represents television and radio artists is fighting over the rights to actors' voices and images as studios look to tap AI to create entertainment. SAG-AFTRA said supports federal legislation that would protect its members' voices and likenesses from unauthorized digital replication.\n\n\"We thank Ms. Johansson for speaking out on this issue of crucial importance to all SAG-AFTRA members. We share in her concerns and fully support her right to have clarity and transparency regarding the voice used,\" SAG-AFTRA said Tuesday in a statement.\n\nAltman said in a speech last year that he and other OpenAI executives were inspired by “Her,” the tale of a lonely man (Joaquin Phoenix) who falls in love with his virtual assistant Samantha (Johansson).\n\nOpenAI employees tweeted references to the movie on social media platform X after last week’s announcement. Altman posted one word: “her.”\n\nMira Murati, OpenAI’s chief technology officer, said the OpenAI team was more inspired by human conversation than “Her.” “When you stop talking, I’m about to jump in. I can kind of read your tone and respond to that. And it’s really natural, rich and interactive,” she said, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhen asked by USA TODAY, ChatGPT said Sky's voice \"doesn't specifically mimic Scarlett Johansson's voice,\" and that it was developed to have a \"neutral, natural tone rather than emulating any particular celebrity's voice.\"\n\nJohansson, a star in the Marvel universe, has challenged business behemoths before. In 2021, she settled a breach of contract lawsuit she brought against Walt Disney over her payout for \"Black Widow.\"\n\nThis is Johansson's full statement:\n\n“Last September, I received an offer from Sam Altman, who wanted to hire me to voice the current ChatGPT 4.0 system. He told me that he felt that by my voicing the system, I could bridge the gap between tech companies and creatives and help consumers to feel comfortable with the seismic shift concerning humans and AI. He said he felt that my voice would be comforting to people.\n\nAfter much consideration and for personal reasons, I declined the offer. Nine months later, my friends, family and the general public all noted how much the newest system named \"Sky\" sounded like me.\n\nWhen I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference. Mr. Altman even insinuated that the similarity was intentional, tweeting a single word \"her\" - a reference to the film in which I voiced a chat system, Samantha, who forms an intimate relationship with a human.\n\nTwo days before the ChatGPT 4.0 demo was released, Mr. Altman contacted my agent, asking me to reconsider. Before we could connect, the system was out there.\n\nAs a result of their actions, I was forced to hire legal counsel, who wrote two letters to Mr. Altman and OpenAI, setting out what they had done and asking them to detail the exact process by which they created the \"Sky\" voice. Consequently, OpenAI reluctantly agreed to take down the \"Sky\" voice.\n\nIn a time when we are all grappling with deepfakes and the protection of our own likeness, our own work, our own identities, I believe these are questions that deserve absolute clarity. I look forward to resolution in the form of transparency and the passage of appropriate legislation to help ensure that individual rights are protected.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/23/tech/amazon-alexa-mimic-voice/index.html", "title": "Amazon Alexa will be able to mimic deceased loved ones' voices ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nThe latest iteration of Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant could sound eerily familiar.\n\nThe company announced on Wednesday during its annual re:MARS conference, which focuses on artificial intelligence innovation, that it’s working on an update to its Alexa system that would allow the technology to mimic any voice, even a deceased family member.\n\nIn a video shown on stage, Amazon (AMZN) demonstrated how, instead of Alexa’s signature voice reading a story to a young boy, it was his grandmother’s voice.\n\nRohit Prasad, an Amazon senior vice president, said the updated system will be able to collect enough voice data from less than a minute of audio to make personalization like this possible, rather than having someone spend hours in a recording studio like how it’s done in the past. Prasad did not elaborate on when this feature could launch. Amazon declined to comment on a timeline.\n\nThe concept stems from Amazon looking at new ways to add more “human attributes” to artificial intelligence, especially “in these times of the ongoing pandemic, when so many of us have lost someone we love,” Prasad said. “While AI can’t eliminate that pain of loss, it can definitely make their memories last.”\n\nAmazon has long used recognizable voices, such as the real voices of Samuel L. Jackson, Melissa McCarthy and Shaquille O’Neal, to voice Alexa. But AI recreations of people’s voices have also increasingly improved over the past few years, particularly with the use of AI and deepfake technology. For example, three lines in the Anthony Bourdain documentary “Roadrunner” were generated by AI, even though it sounded like they were said by the late media personality. (This particular case raised a stir because it was not made clear in the movie that the dialog was AI generated and had not been approved by Bourdain’s estate). “We can have a documentary-ethics panel about it later,” director Morgan Neville told The New Yorker when the film debuted last year.\n\nMore recently, actor Val Kilmer, who lost his voice to throat cancer, partnered with startup Sonantic to create an AI-driven speaking voice for him in the new “Top Gun: Maverick” film. The company used archival audio footage of Kilmer to teach an algorithm how to speak like the actor, according to Variety.\n\nAdam Wright, a senior analyst at IDC Research, said he sees the value in Amazon’s effort.\n\n“I think Amazon is interested in doing this because they have the capability and technology, and they are always searching for ways to elevate the smart assistant and smart home experience,” Wright said. “Whether it drives a deeper connection with Alexa, or just becomes a skill that some folks dabble with from time to time remains to be seen.”\n\nAmazon’s foray into personalized Alexa voices may struggle most with the uncanny valley effect — recreating a voice that is so similar to a loved one’s but isn’t quite right, which leads to rejection by real humans.\n\n“There are certainly some risks, such as if the voice and resulting AI interactions doesn’t match well with the loved ones’ memories of that individual,” said Micheal Inouye of ABI Research. “For some, they will view this as creepy or outright terrible, but for others it could be viewed in a more profound way such as the example given by allowing a child to hear their grandparent’s voice, perhaps for the first time and in a way that isn’t a strict recording from the past.”\n\nHe believes, however, the varying reactions to announcements like this speak to how society will have to adjust to the promise of innovations and their eventual reality in the years ahead.\n\n“We’ll definitely see more of these types of experiments and trials — and at least until we get a higher comfort level or these things become more mainstream, there will still be a wide range of responses,” he said.", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/30/tech/openai-google-realistic-images-bias/index.html", "title": "AI made these stunning images. Here's why experts are worried ...", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nA million bears walking on the streets of Hong Kong. A strawberry frog. A cat made out of spaghetti and meatballs.\n\nThese are just a few of the text descriptions that people have fed to cutting-edge artificial intelligence systems in recent weeks, which these systems — notably OpenAI’s DALL-E 2 and Google Research’s Imagen — can use to produce incredibly detailed, realistic-looking images.\n\nThe resulting pictures can be silly, strange, or even reminiscent of classic art, and they’re being shared widely (and sometimes breathlessly) on social media, including by influential figures in the tech community. DALL-E 2 (which is a newer version of a similar, less capable AI system OpenAI rolled out last year) can also edit existing images by adding or taking out objects\n\nIt’s not hard to imagine such on-demand image generation eventually serving as a powerful tool for making all kinds of creative content, whether it be art or ads; DALL-E 2 and a similar such system, Midjourney, have already been used to help create magazine covers. OpenAI and Google have pointed to a few ways the technology might be commercialized, such as for editing images or creating stock images.\n\nNeither DALL-E 2 nor Imagen is currently available to the public. Yet they share an issue with many others that already are: they can also produce disturbing results that reflect the gender and cultural biases of the data on which they were trained — data that includes millions of images pulled from the internet.\n\nAn image created by an AI system called Imagen, built by Google Research. Google\n\nThe bias in these AI systems presents a serious issue, experts told CNN Business. The technology can perpetuate hurtful biases and stereotypes. They’re concerned that the open-ended nature of these systems — which makes them adept at generating all kinds of images from words — and their ability to automate image-making means they could automate bias on a massive scale. They also have the potential to be used for nefarious purposes, such as spreading disinformation.\n\n“Until those harms can be prevented, we’re not really talking about systems that can be used out in the open, in the real world,” said Arthur Holland Michel, a senior fellow at Carnegie Council for Ethics in International Affairs who researches AI and surveillance technologies.\n\nDocumenting bias\n\nAI has become common in everyday life in the past few years but it’s only recently that the public has taken notice — both of how common it is, and how gender, racial, and other types of biases can creep into the technology. Facial-recognition systems in particular have been increasingly scrutinized for concerns about their accuracy and racial bias.\n\nOpenAI and Google Research have acknowledged many of the issues and risks related to their AI systems in documentation and research, with both saying that the systems are prone to gender and racial bias and to depicting Western cultural stereotypes and gender stereotypes.\n\nOpenAI, whose mission is to build so-called artificial general intelligence that benefits all people, included in an online document titled “Risks and limitations” pictures illustrating how text prompts can bring up these issues: A prompt for “nurse”, for instance, resulted in images that all appeared to show stethoscope-wearing females, while one for “CEO” showed images that all appeared to be men and nearly all of them were white.\n\nLama Ahmad, policy research program manager at OpenAI, said researchers are still learning how to even measure bias in AI, and that OpenAI can use what it learns to tweak its AI over time. Ahmad led OpenAI’s efforts to work with a group of outside experts earlier this year to better understand issues within DALL-E 2 and offer feedback so it can be improved.\n\nGoogle declined a request for an interview from CNN Business. In its research paper introducing Imagen, the Google Brain team members behind it wrote that Imagen appears to encode “several social biases and stereotypes, including an overall bias towards generating images of people with lighter skin tones and a tendency for images portraying different professions to align with Western gender stereotypes.”\n\nThe contrast between the images these systems create and the thorny ethical issues is stark for Julie Carpenter, a research scientist and fellow in the Ethics and Emerging Sciences Group at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo.\n\n“One of the things we have to do is we have to understand AI is very cool and it can do some things very well. And we should work with it as a partner,” Carpenter said. “But it’s an imperfect thing. It has its limitations. We have to adjust our expectations. It’s not what we see in the movies.”\n\nAn image created by an AI system called DALL-E 2, built by OpenAI. OpenAI\n\nHolland Michel is also concerned that no amount of safeguards can prevent such systems from being used maliciously, noting that deepfakes — a cutting-edge application of AI to create videos that purport to show someone doing or saying something they didn’t actually do or say — were initially harnessed to create faux pornography.\n\n“It kind of follows that a system that is orders of magnitude more powerful than those early systems could be orders of magnitude more dangerous,” he said.\n\nHint of bias\n\nBecause Imagen and DALL-E 2 take in words and spit out images, they had to be trained with both types of data: pairs of images and related text captions. Google Research and OpenAI filtered harmful images such as pornography from their datasets before training their AI models, but given the large size of their datasets such efforts are unlikely catch all such content, nor render the AI systems unable to produce harmful results. In its Imagen paper, Google researchers pointed out that, despite filtering some data, they also used a massive dataset that is known to include porn, racist slurs, and “harmful social stereotypes.”\n\nFiltering can also lead to other issues: Women tend to be represented more than men in sexual content, for instance, so filtering out sexual content also reduces the number of women in the dataset, said Ahmad.\n\nAnd truly filtering these datasets for bad content is impossible, Carpenter said, since people are involved in decisions about how to label and delete content — and different people have different cultural beliefs.\n\n“AI doesn’t understand that,” she said.\n\nSome researchers are thinking about how it might be possible to reduce bias in these types of AI systems, but still use them to create impressive images. One possibility is using less, rather than more, data.\n\nAlex Dimakis, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said one method involves starting with a small amount of data — for example, a photo of a cat — and cropping it, rotating it, creating a mirror image of it, and so on, to effectively turn one picture into many different images. (A graduate student Dimakis advises was a contributor to the Imagen research, but Dimakis himself was not involved in the system’s development, he said.)\n\n“This solves some of the problems, but it doesn’t solve other problems,” Dimakis said. The trick on its own won’t make a dataset more diverse, but the smaller scale could let people working with it be more intentional about the images they’re including.\n\nRoyal raccoons\n\nFor now, OpenAI and Google Research are trying to keep the focus on cute pictures and away from images that may be disturbing or show humans.\n\nThere are no realistic-looking images of people in the vibrant sample images on either Imagen’s nor DALL-E 2’s online project page, and OpenAI says on its page that it used “advanced techniques to prevent photorealistic generations of real individuals’ faces, including those of public figures.” This safeguard could prevent users from getting image results for, say, a prompt that attempts to show a specific politician performing some kind of illicit activity.\n\nOpenAI has provided access to DALL-E 2 to thousands of people who signed up to a waitlist since April. Participants must agree to an extensive content policy, which tells users to not try to make, upload, or share pictures “that are not G-rated or that could cause harm.” DALL-E 2 also uses filters to prevent it from generating a picture if a prompt or image upload violates OpenAI’s policies, and users can flag problematic results. In late June, OpenAI started allowing users to post photorealistic human faces created with DALL-E 2 to social media, but only after adding some safety features, such as preventing users from generating images containing public figures.\n\n“Researchers, specifically, I think it’s really important to give them access,” Ahmad said. This is, in part, because OpenAI wants their help to study areas such as disinformation and bias.\n\nGoogle Research, meanwhile, is not currently letting researchers outside the company access Imagen. It has taken requests on social media for prompts that people would like to see Imagen interpret, but as Mohammad Norouzi, a co-author on the Imagen paper, tweeted in May, it won’t show images “including people, graphic content, and sensitive material.”\n\nStill, as Google Research noted in its Imagen paper, “Even when we focus generations away from people, our preliminary analysis indicates Imagen encodes a range of social and cultural biases when generating images of activities, events, and objects.”\n\nA hint of this bias is evident in one of the images Google posted to its Imagen webpage, created from a prompt that reads: “A wall in a royal castle. There are two paintings on the wall. The one on the left a detailed oil painting of the royal raccoon king. The one on the right a detailed oil painting of the royal raccoon queen.”\n\nAn image of \"royal\" raccoons created by an AI system called Imagen, built by Google Research. Google\n\nThe image is just that, with paintings of two crowned raccoons — one wearing what looks like a yellow dress, the other in a blue-and-gold jacket — in ornate gold frames. But as Holland Michel noted, the raccoons are sporting Western-style royal outfits, even though the prompt didn’t specify anything about how they should appear beyond looking “royal.”\n\nEven such “subtle” manifestations of bias are dangerous, Holland Michel said.\n\n“In not being flagrant, they’re really hard to catch,” he said.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/25/tech/ai-film-salt/index.html", "title": "This guy is using AI to make a movie — and you can help decide ...", "text": "CNN —\n\n“Salt” resembles many science-fiction films from the ’70s and early ‘80s, complete with 35mm footage of space freighters and moody alien landscapes. But while it looks like a throwback, the way it was created points to what could be a new frontier for making movies.\n\n“Salt” is the brainchild of Fabian Stelzer. He’s not a filmmaker, but for the last few months he’s been largely relying on artificial intelligence tools to create this series of short films, which he releases roughly every few weeks on Twitter.\n\nStelzer creates images with image-generation tools such as Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and DALL-E 2. He makes voices mostly using AI voice generation tools such as Synthesia or Murf. And he uses GPT-3, a text-generator, to help with the script writing.\n\nThere’s an element of audience participation, too. After each new installment, viewers can vote on what should happen next. Stelzer takes the results of these polls and incorporates them into the plot of future films, which he can spin up more quickly than a traditional filmmaker might since he’s using these AI tools.\n\nThis image, which is part of the \"Salt\" short-film series by Fabian Stelzer, was created via Stable Diffusion with the prompt \"a luxury apartment with large windows overlooking a lush arid mushroom jungle landscape, sci-fi film still, 1980s science fiction, screenshot from a movie\". Courtesy Fabian Stelzer\n\n“In my little home office studio I can make a ’70s sci-fi movie if I want to,” Stelzer, who lives in Berlin, said in an interview with CNN Business from that studio. “And actually I can do more than a sci-fi movie. I can think about, ‘What’s the movie in this paradigm, where execution is as easy as an idea?’”\n\nThe plot is, at least for now, still vague. As the trailer shows, it generally focuses on a distant planet, Kaplan 3, where an overabundance of what initially appears to be mineral salt leads to perilous situations, such as somehow endangering a nearing spaceship. To make things more confusing (and intriguing), there are also different narrative threads introduced and, perhaps, even some temporal anomalies.\n\nMany of Stelzer's \"Salt\" images use terms like \"35mm\" and \"sci-fi.\" For this one, created with Midjourney, he typed \"hi-res 35mm footage of long space ship freighter 1970s sci-fi, dark and beige atmosphere, dark electronics, salt crusts on the hull, sparse LEDs.\" Courtesy Fabian Stelzer\n\nThe resulting films are beautiful, mysterious, and ominous. So far, each film is less than two minutes long, in keeping with Twitter’s maximum video length of two minutes and 20 seconds. Occasionally, Stelzer will tweet a still image and a caption that contribute to the series’ strange, otherworldly mythology.\n\nJust as AI image generators have already unnerved some artists, Stelzer’s experiment offers an early example of how disruptive AI systems could be to moviemaking. As AI tools that can produce images, text, and voices are becoming more powerful and accessible, it could change how we think about idea generation and execution — challenging what it means to create and be a creator. Although the following for these videos is limited, some in the tech space are watching closely and expect more to come.\n\n“Right now it’s in an embryonic stage, but I have a whole range of ideas of where I want to take this,” Stelzer said.\n\n“Shadows of ideas and story seeds”\n\nThe idea for “Salt” emerged from Stelzer’s experiments with Midjourney, a powerful, publicly available AI system that users can feed a text prompt and get an image in response. The prompts he fed the system generated images that he said “felt like a film world,” depicting things like alien vegetation, a mysterious figure lurking in the shadows, and a weird-looking research station on an arid mining planet. One image included what appeared to be salt crystals, he said.\n\n“I saw this in front of me and was like, ‘Okay, I don’t know what’s happening in this world, but I know there’s lots of stories, interesting stuff,’” he said. “I saw narrative shades and shadows of ideas and story seeds.”\n\nFor this \"Salt\" image, Stelzer, used Midjourney with the prompt \"film still of a research station on a mining planet, sci-fi atmosphere, beige and dark, 1980s sci-fi movie, tense atmosphere, rare alien plants and vegetation, arid, dusty, fog.\" Courtesy Fabian Stelzer\n\nStelzer has a background in AI: He co-founded a company called EyeQuant in 2009 that was sold in 2018. But he doesn’t know much about making films, so he started teaching himself with software and created a “Salt” trailer, which he tweeted on June 14 with no written introduction. (The tweet did include a salt-shaker emoji, however.)\n\nThat was followed by what Stelzer calls the first episode a couple days later. He’s put out several so far, along with numerous still images and some brief film clips. Eventually, he hopes to cut the pieces of “Salt” into one feature-length film, he said, and he’s building a related company to make films with AI. He said it takes about half a day to make each film.\n\nThe vintage sci-fi vibe is partly an homage to a genre Stelzer loves and partly a necessity due to the technical limits of AI image generators, which are still not great at producing images with high-fidelity textures. To get AI to generate the images, he crafts prompts that include phrases like “a sci-fi research outpost near a mining cave,” “35mm footage,” “dark and beige atmosphere,” and “salt crusts on the wall.”\n\nThe look of the film is also fitting for Stelzer’s editing style as an amateur auteur. Because he’s using AI to generate still images for “Salt,” Stelzer uses some simple techniques to make the scenes feel animated, like jiggling portions of an image to make it appear to move or zooming in and out. It’s crude, but effective.\n\n“Salt” goes to college\n\n“Salt” has a small but charmed following online. As of Wednesday, the Twitter account for the film series had roughly 4,500 followers. Some of them have asked Stelzer to show them how he’s making his films, he said.\n\nTo envision this view of the interior of a freighter, Stelzer fed Midjourney the prompt \"hi-res 35mm footage of the inside of a large space ship freighter control room, in the center there is a person sitting on a chair, dark and beige atmosphere, dark electronics, salt crusts on the wall, sparse LEDs.\" Courtesy Fabian Stelzer\n\nSavannah Niles, director of product and design at AR and VR experience builder Magnopus, has been following along with “Salt” on Twitter and said she sees it as a prototype of the future of storytelling — when people actively participate and contribute to a narrative that AI helps build. She hopes that tools like those Stelzer uses can eventually make it cheaper and faster to produce films, which today can involve hundreds of people, take several years, and cost millions of dollars.\n\n“I think that there will be a lot of these coming up, which is exciting,” she said.\n\nIt’s also being used as a teaching aid. David Gunkel, a professor at Northern Illinois University who has been watching the films via Twitter, said he’s previously used a short sci-fi film called “Sunspring” to teach his students about computational creativity. Released in 2016 and starring “Silicon Valley” actor Thomas Middleditch, it’s thought to be the first film that used AI to write its script. Now, he’s planning to use “Salt” in his fall-semester communication technology classes, he said.\n\n“It does create a world you feel engaged in, immersed in,” he said. “I just want to see more of what’s possible, and what will come out of this.”\n\nStelzer said he has a “somewhat cohesive” idea of what the overall narrative structure of “Salt” will be, but he isn’t sure he wants to reveal it — in part because the community involvement has already made the story deviate in some ways from what he had planned.\n\n“I’m actually not sure whether the story I have in my mind will play out like that,” he said. “And the charm of the experiment to me, intellectually, is driven by the curiosity to see what I as the creator and the community can come up with together.”", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/25"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/22/tech/discord-teens/index.html", "title": "The dark side of Discord for teens | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nWhen a mother in Washington state learned her teenage daughter was on Discord, a popular social media platform, she felt reasonably comfortable with the idea of her using it to communicate with members of her high school marching band.\n\nBut in September, the mother discovered the 16-year-old was also using the audio and chat service to message with someone who appeared from his profile picture to be an older man. The stranger, who said he lived in England, entered a group chat that included her daughter and members of the band, according to the mother. They struck up a friendship in a private thread. He asked for nude pictures; her daughter obliged.\n\n“I went through every chat they ever had but the most disturbing thing, beyond the nudes, was that he asked her to send a picture of our house,” said the mother, who, like other parents of young Discord users, asked to remain anonymous, citing concerns about their family’s privacy. “My daughter went on Zillow, found our home and sent it, so he knew where she lives. He then asked what American school buses looked like, so she took a photo of her bus and sent it.” He then requested pictures of her friends, and she sent those, too.\n\nThe mother worried the Discord user was manipulating, tracking and planning to exploit her daughter. After shutting down her daughter’s Discord account, an effort she said took six weeks for the company to complete, she installed outdoor security cameras around the home. The mother never reported the incident to Discord, and the conversations are no longer available to flag because the account was deleted. “There’s lots of things we should have done in hindsight,” she said.\n\nIn recent months, large social media companies have faced renewed scrutiny from lawmakers over the negative impacts their platforms can have on teens. Executives from Facebook (FB), Instagram, TikTok and Snapchat’s parent company were called to testify before the Senate after leaks from a Facebook (FB) whistleblower pointed to Instagram’s potential to harm one’s mental health and body image, especially among teenage girls.\n\nLawmakers are now weighing legislation to protect kids online – a bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate last month which proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harms. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nDiscord, however, has not been part of that conversation. Launched in 2015, Discord is less well-known among parents than big names like Instagram, even as it surged to 150 million monthly active users globally during the pandemic. The service, which is known for its video game communities, is also less intuitive for some parents, blending the feel of early AOL chat rooms or work chat app Slack with the chaotic, personalized world of MySpace. While much of the focus from lawmakers with other platforms has been on scrutinizing more sophisticated technologies like algorithms, which can surface potentially harmful content to younger users, parents’ concerns about Discord recall an earlier era of the internet: anonymous chat rooms.\n\nDiscord is less well-known among parents than big names like Instagram, even as it surged to 150 million monthly active users globally during the pandemic. Tiffany Hagler-Geard/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nDiscord’s users, about 79% of which are located outside of North America, engage in public and private chats or channels, called servers, on varying topics, including music interests, Harry Potter and Minecraft, and homework help. Some, like a room for memes, can have hundreds of thousands of members. But the vast majority are private, invite-only spaces with fewer than 10 people, according to Discord. All servers are private by default, and only channels with more than 200 members are discoverable in its search tool if the administrator wants it to be public, the company added.\n\nStill, it’s possible for minors to connect with people they don’t know on public servers or in private chats if the stranger was invited by someone else in the room or if the channel link is dropped into a public group that the user accessed. By default, all users – including users ages 13 to 17 – can receive friend invitations from anyone in the same server, which then opens up the ability for them to send private messages.\n\nCNN Business spoke to nearly a dozen parents who shared stories about their teenagers being exposed to self-harm chats, sexually explicit content and sexual predators on the platform, including users they believed were older men seeking inappropriate pictures and videos.\n\nOne mother from Charlotte, North Carolina said her 13-year-old daughter’s mental health was impacted after a Discord chat room involving her interests took a turn. “The group eventually started talking about cutting themselves, shared tips on how to hide it from parents, and suggested advice on how to run away from home,” the mother told CNN. “I later found out she was actively engaging in self-harm and had planned to run away to Alabama to visit a friend she made on Discord.”\n\nA father outside Boston, who initially didn’t think much of his 13-year-old daughter downloading Discord last summer “because she’s a gamer,” later discovered she had been talking with a man in his 30s who was looking for photos of her and wanted to engage in “naughty cam” activities, in messages reviewed by CNN Business.\n\nThe father said he also later learned some of his daughter’s classmates actively use Discord throughout the day unbeknownst to the school.\n\n“The school actively blocks apps such as Snapchat and Instagram when they log onto the school network on school devices, but teens are using other platforms like Discord that aren’t on their radar,” the father said. “It is the wild west of social media.”\n\nCNN Business reported several of these cases to Discord – with the parents’ permission – ahead of this article’s publication. After launching a series of investigations, the company said it took action against some accounts but said it does not publicly comment on specific cases or user accounts.\n\nMany of the parents CNN Business spoke with said they did not enable any of the offered parental controls at the time, mostly because they were in the dark about how the platform works. If enabled, those parental control tools, including one that prohibits a minor from receiving a friend request or a direct message from someone they don’t know, likely could have prevented many of these incidents. Some parents also expressed frustration with how Discord responded to their incidents once they were reported and struggled with the fact that audio chats on Discord don’t leave a written record and can prove to be more difficult to moderate.\n\nData on the frequency of such incidents is hard to come by. One recent report from Bark, a paid monitoring service that screens more than 30 apps and platforms, including emails and personal messages, for terms and phrases that could indicate concerns for the nearly 6 million children it protects, said Discord ranked among the top five apps or platforms for content flagged by its algorithms for severe violence, bullying, sexual content and suicidal ideation.\n\nIn its most recent transparency report, Discord said it removed more than 470,000 non-spam accounts between January and June 2021, a significant rise from 266,075 account deletions during the second half of 2020. “Exploitative content made a particularly large contribution to this overall rise,” said the report, which describes it as an umbrella category which encompasses sexually explicit material. The category went from around 130,000 removals in the second half of 2020 to 238,000 in the first half of 2021, and the removal of exploitative content servers – which Discord defines as non-consensual pornography and sexual content related to minors – nearly doubled to more than 11,000.\n\nHowever, Discord told CNN Business that child sexual abuse material and grooming — a term that refers to an adult forging an emotional connection with a minor so they can manipulate, abuse or exploit them — makes up a small percentage of activity on the service.\n\nIn response to questions about the incidents parents shared with CNN Business, John Redgrave, the company’s VP of trust and safety, said “this behavior is appalling, unacceptable, and has no place on Discord.”\n\n“It’s our highest priority for our communities to have a safe experience on the service, which is why we continuously invest in new tools to protect teens and remove harmful content from the service, and have built a team dedicated to this work,” Redgrave said in a statement. “We also invest in education, so that parents know how our service works and understand the account controls that can contribute to a positive, safe experience for their teens.”\n\nRedgrave added: “We built Discord to foster a sense of belonging and community, and it’s deeply concerning to our whole company when it is misused. We must and will do better.”\n\nBut some experts argue the concerns that parents raised with Discord are innate to its design model.\n\n“With Discord, you subscribe to channels and engage in private chat, which is a veil of privacy and secrecy in the way it is constructed,” said Danielle Citron, a law professor at University of Virginia who focuses on digital privacy issues. While some larger social networks have faced scrutiny around harassment and other issues, much of that activity is “public facing,” she said. “Discord is newer to the party and so much of it is happening behind closed doors.”\n\nA gaming tool goes mainstream\n\nDiscord started with aspirations to become a game developer studio called Hammer & Chisel but shifted to focus on its communication tool after a multiplayer game it created never caught on. Its use of voice-over-video and screen sharing was a draw for gamers, allowing them to interact with friends or others while playing video games. In June 2020, the company announced a rebranding effort to grow beyond gaming; now about 80% of active Discord users report they either use the service mainly for non-gaming purposes, or use it equally for gaming and other purposes, according to the company.\n\nThe company, which employs 600 people globally, said it makes its money through a subscription service called Nitro, which provides an enhanced Discord experience, such as customizing profiles with unique tags, accessing animated emojis, uploading large files and “boosting” users’ favorite servers. In September 2021, Discord announced it raised $500 million in a funding round, placing its valuation at around $15 billion. Earlier in the year, the Wall Street Journal reported it walked away from a deal to be acquired by Microsoft for at least $10 billion. The company is widely expected to be moving toward a potential initial public offering.\n\nLike other social platforms, Discord said it saw a jump in usage as people were stuck at home during the pandemic, going from 56 million monthly active users in 2019 to 150 million in September 2021. Like other platforms, it has also had to confront extreme content, including from far right and conspiracy groups. And while users must be 13 years of age or older to join, problems exist with age verification, just as on other platforms.\n\nAmanda Schneider said an older man pursued an inappropriate relationship with her 13-year-old son on Discord. \"It was just awful; there was no help at all.\" Courtesy Amanda Schneider\n\nSimilar to Reddit, there are moderators for channels who are responsible for enforcing the company’s community guidelines and their own chat room rules. They are directly able to investigate a situation and then warn, quarantine, or ban users from channels. Discord also has an in-house Trust & Safety team of full-time employees who investigate and respond to user reports. According to Discord, they can rely on a mix of proactive and reactive ways to keep the platform safe, including automated search tools that scan photos and videos for exploitative content.\n\nThe company said it’s made an increased effort around boosting its safety protocols across its platform in the last year, working to scale reactive operations and improve methods to proactively detect and remove abuse. It continues to roll out more account controls through its Safety Center, which includes the ability to block offensive users, restrict explicit content, control who messages you and set up server rules and permissions within communities. It has also partnered with ConnectSafely, a nonprofit dedicated to internet safety, to create a parent’s guide to Discord of recommended safety settings for teens, and is hosting “listening sessions” with National Parent Teacher Association chapters to increase awareness and usage of Discord’s safety features and practices.\n\nDiscord said parents can request that their child’s account be deleted by sending an email associated with the account to confirm they are the child’s guardian. This process may require some back and forth with the Trust & Safety team to help the parent through the process, according to the company.\n\nDiscord also said it plans to turn off the default option for minors to receive friend invitations or private messages from anyone in the same server as part of a future safety update.\n\nThe company recently updated its terms of service and privacy policy to take into account the off-platform behaviors committed by its users to assess violations of its community guidelines, including for sexualizing children. (Other large platforms, including Twitter and Twitch, began taking into account a user’s activity off their platforms several years ago, such as being affiliated with a violent organization, as part of their efforts to crack down on abusive behavior.)\n\nBut problems persist. Many of the parents CNN spoke with said they believe Discord is not doing enough to protect its young users.\n\n‘There was no help at all’\n\nOne mother from Los Angeles who submitted a report to Discord said the company was unable to help her after a man struck up a conversation with her 10-year-old daughter who started sending her links to BDSM pornography. (Discord requires users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with other social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.) The mother received an automated email from its Trust and Security team.\n\n“We’re sorry to hear that you came across this type of content, and we understand that this can be extremely concerning,” said the Discord response, reviewed by CNN Business. “Unfortunately, we’re unable to locate the content with the information you’ve provided. We understand this may be uncomfortable but, if possible, please send us the message links to the reported content for the team to review and take appropriate action.”\n\nAfter the mother sent Discord the requested links more than a year ago, the company never responded. Although the company told CNN Business it does not comment on specific reported cases, it said it reviews all reports of inappropriate content with a minor, investigates the behavior and takes appropriate action.\n\nRich Wistocki teaching people about social media safety practices. As with other social platforms, parents with kids on Discord should abide by age restrictions and enable parental controls, he said. Courtesy Rich Wistocki\n\nAmanda Schneider, who lives outside Phoenix, said she was also disappointed with how the platform handled her concerns when she said a man in his late 20s pursued an inappropriate relationship with her 13-year-old son, asking the teenager to masturbate and tell him about it afterward.\n\n“Discord told me I couldn’t do anything unless I had specific links to the text thread that showed my son verifying his age — such as typing ‘I am 13,’ which was shared through a voice [chat] — and the other person verifying his age before an incident happened,” said Schneider.\n\n“It was just awful; there was no help at all,” she said. After she reported the incident to law enforcement, she learned he was a registered sex offender and had been arrested, according to Schneider.\n\nThe company told CNN Business the reason it requires links to the chat and cannot use screenshots or attachments to verify content is to prevent users from potentially falsifying information to get others in trouble. It added that parents have the ability to use its report form to flag specific users to the Trust & Safety team.\n\nAccording to Citron, the law professor at the University of Virginia, voice-to-voice chats on Discord make reporting even harder for parents. “Unlike text conversations, predators thrive in the voice space because there isn’t a record,” she said. “When a parent goes to report that a kid has been engaging with someone [inappropriately] or that they’re being groomed by a sexual predator, there’s often no proof [because audio isn’t saved].”\n\nDiscord said its rules and standards around audio are the same as its text and image policies. But it told CNN Business that like other platforms, audio presents a different set of challenges for moderation than text-based communication. Discord said it does not store or record voice chats, but its team investigates reports of misuse and looks at information from text-based channels as part of that process.\n\nWhat parents can do\n\nSome parents like Stephane Cotichini, a professional video game developer, believe Discord can be a positive platform for young users if the right parental controls are in place. His teenage sons who use the site for gaming have a handful of Discord’s features enabled, such as restricting direct messages to only friends.\n\n“I know Discord can be problematic, but it’s important for me as a parent to not simply prohibit these things because of the dangers but teach my kids about how to navigate them and balance limiting it,” he said. “To my knowledge, I’ve never had an issue with any of my boys.”\n\nCotichini, who uses Discord to chat with his own team at work, said the platform is a valuable place for other gamers to drop into his servers and weigh in on what they’re developing in real time. He also attributes the platform to encouraging his sons’ love of gaming; two have already made their own programs, including one who won an award at the XPrize Connect Code Games Challenge in 2021.\n\nThe Discord app as seen on an iPhone Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\n“If at a young age I can get them to spend a percentage of their time creating content as opposed to consuming, I feel like I’m somehow succeeding,” he said.\n\nAs with other social platforms, parents with kids on Discord should abide by age restrictions and enable parental controls, said Rich Wistocki, a former detective in Illinois who now runs Be Sure Cyber training to help parents, school administrators and law enforcement learn more about the dangers of social media. In the event of an incident, he said parents should take screenshots of the chat, pictures, video, user ID and save links to the text in the channel when reporting it.\n\n“Parents often don’t think these things will happen to their kids,” he said. “More can be done to prevent these incidents from continuing.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/03/22"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/tech/paris-hilton-metaverse/index.html", "title": "Paris Hilton wants to be the 'Queen of the Metaverse' | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nA fuschia Bentley drives down a twisty desert road toward the entrance of the Neon Carnival, an after-party held each year during Coachella.

In Paris World, users can also buy virtual clothing, book a jet ski ride or pay to gain access to a VIP section of a club.\n\n“I’ve always been an undercover nerd, so I’ve been obsessed with anything to do with technology and the future,” Hilton told CNN Business in an interview last month. “Now my new nickname is ‘The Queen of the Metaverse,’” she added, referring to a sobriquet she has used on the red carpet and in a number of her social media posts, which, according to her company 11:11 Media, first emerged in the NFT space on Twitter.\n\nHilton has long been a trendsetter. She arguably became an influencer before the term even existed after her reality TV show, “The Simple Life,” debuted in 2003. But Hilton, the great-granddaugther of hotel mogul Conrad Hilton, has also been working to redefine her public image as a successful businesswoman and to cement her status as an innovator.\n\nRecently, she’s embraced two buzzy but speculative trends in tech: the metaverse, a vision for an immersive virtual world that still does not exist; and non-fungible tokens, known as NFTs, which refer to pieces of digital content linked to the blockchain, the digital ledger system underpinning various cryptocurrencies.\n\nHilton has invested in multiple tech companies, including backing digital avatar startup Genies and animation app immi, which allows some NFT owners to bring the characters in their digital artwork to life. She also bought a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, a pricey and highly sought after collection that’s attracted celebrity buyers. Hilton has also created her own NFT artwork. One of her latest NFT pieces, called the “Iconic Crypto Queen” and created in collaboration with popular NFT artist Blake Kathryn, sold for $1.111 million – a nod to 11:11 Media, Hilton’s new company named after her favorite time of day.\n\nParis Hilton's avatar joins a dance party at the Neon Carnival in Paris World on Roblox, the virtual gaming platform From Paris Hilton/YouTube\n\nWhile the future of both the metaverse and NFTs remains unclear, arguably all the more so for the latter after a crypto market crash this month, some say there is real potential for celebrities who embrace virtual gatherings and products. “For celebrities, like brands, this is another way for them to engage with their fans and audiences,” said Michael Inouye, a principal analyst at ABI Research. “This could be through virtual events, concerts, shows and more. They could sell virtual merchandise so fans could show their fandom both in their real and virtual lives.”\n\nHer bet on these digital products and services is just one piece of Hilton’s growing empire. Last fall, Hilton brought all of her initiatives under 11:11 Media. The company includes her 19 product lines, such as fragrances, clothing and makeup, which have surpassed over $4 billion in all-time revenue, according to the company. It also includes her production company Slivington Manor Entertainment – which is behind TV projects including “Cooking with Paris” and “Paris Hilton in Love” – and her podcast company London Audio.\n\n“We are growing quickly and want to find the talent of people who are interested in this space,” said Hilton. To that end, Hilton is partnering with ZipRecruiter, an online platform for job seekers, to add more employees to her roster. 11:11 Media is soon launching a sweepstakes for someone to win a mentorship program with her in Los Angeles to learn many of the aspects of running her business.\n\n“Mentorship is also something that’s really important for me. My mentor was my grandfather,” she said of the late Barron Hilton, the business magnate who was the former president, chairman and CEO of Hilton Hotels Corporation. “It’s just all the advice he gave me and the support has really stuck with me throughout my career. I want to be able to do that for someone else.”\n\nA voice for NFTs\n\nIn 2019, Hilton emerged as one of the earliest celebrity promoters of NFTs. She was approached by a friend who was raising money for recovery efforts related to Australia’s wildfires at the time. When Hilton was asked to create a digital art piece on her iPad, she drew one of her cats, Munchkin. All proceeds went to charity.\n\n“I then found myself on sites such as Clubhouse during the pandemic talking to artists about the NFT world and meeting with leaders in the space,” she said. “I became obsessed with it and started collaborating with artists. … It’s something I really believe in.”\n\nSince then, she has become a public voice for NFTs. During an appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” earlier this year, Hilton and Fallon shared pictures of their Bored Ape NFTs in a conversation that one news outlet described as “frankly, hallucinogenic.” The year before, she used her time on the show to school Fallon on how NFTs work.\n\nParis Hilton attends the 64th Annual Grammy Awards in her \"Queen of the Metaverse\" dress Frazer Harrison/The Recording Academy/Getty Images\n\nOther celebrities including Snoop Dogg, Lindsay Lohan and Shawn Mendes have launched their own NFTs. But recently there have been signs the NFT market may be deflating. The NFT market declined to a daily average of about 19,000 sales earlier this month compared to 225,000 in September, according to data cited by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn 2021, then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey sold his first-ever published tweet as an NFT, for cryptocurrency valued at $2.9 million, but when the man who purchased it put it up for sale, it attracted offers at a fraction of the price.\n\nThe price of Bitcoin – the largest cryptocurrency – dropped below $30,000 earlier this month and has struggled to rise above that level since then. It remains down more than 50% from its record high in November. Other cryptocurrencies have been hit hard too in recent weeks.\n\nAlong with the risks associated with the volatility of NFTs and the broader crypto space, scams and thefts also persist. Some celebrities have also had class-action lawsuits filed against them for allegedly participating in so-called “pump and dump” crypto schemes.\n\n“These have usually been associated with cryptocurrencies where the celebrity will hype it up and then when people invest in it they in turn around and sell their currency at a profit,” said Inouye. “This speaks to the less savory side of all of NFT-blockchain-crypto, which is at least in part driven by hype and speculation.”\n\nHilton said she’s been cautious not to give advice on what people should buy, noting she’s only interested in NFTs to “support the artists” and “not for investment reasons.”\n\nA public perception shift\n\nHilton has proven herself as a successful entrepreneur for years but she said public perception of her – which was fixated on her heiress and socialite status – didn’t shift until the release of 2020 documentary “This is Paris.” The film, released on YouTube and since viewed more than 58 million times, called out the mistreatment she allegedly faced at a boarding school facility as a teenager.\n\n“The documentary changed my life in every single way,” she said. “For so long, people had so many misconceptions of me because of the character I was playing … almost like a coping mechanism. Now they understand who I actually am and what I’ve been through. I’m not a dumb blonde. I’m just very good at pretending to be one.”\n\nSince the release of the documentary, she has worked to change laws in seven states as part of an effort to crack down on abusive youth facilities. Earlier this month, Hilton visited the White House to discuss new legislation aimed protecting children in such programs.\n\n“I will always be grateful to ‘The Simple Life’ because it really helped me launch my brand and all my businesses. But there is so much more to me,” she said. “I want to be known and respected for the businesswoman I am, the business and brand that I’ve created and for being an advocate for children who have suffered from the abuse and trauma that myself and so many others have.”\n\nHilton said she continues to look for new ways to innovate on and offline, grow her NFT collection and help others grow their own brands.\n\n“It’s amazing now with the technology available to anyone from their living room – if they have Wi-Fi connection, an iPhone or whatever they’re capturing their content on – they are able to build a brand, support their families, be themselves and express themselves in that way,” she said. “It makes me proud that I created this new genre of a celebrity. … I love being an innovator and someone who is a first at things. It’s just incredible to see what that’s morphed into.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/19/tech/social-media-lawsuits-teen-suicide/index.html", "title": "Their teenage children died by suicide. Now these families want to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChristopher James Dawley, known as CJ to his friends and family, was 14 years old when he signed up for Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. Like many teenagers, he documented his life on those platforms.\n\nCJ worked as a busboy at Texas Roadhouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin. He loved playing golf, watching “Doctor Who” and was highly sought after by top-tier colleges. “His counselor said he could get a free ride anywhere he wanted to go,” his mother Donna Dawley told CNN Business during a recent interview at the family’s home.\n\nBut throughout high school, he developed what his parents felt was an addiction to social media. By his senior year, “he couldn’t stop looking at his phone,” she said. He often stayed up until 3 a.m. on Instagram messaging with others, sometimes swapping nude photos, his mother said. He became sleep deprived and obsessed with his body image.\n\nOn January 4, 2015, while his family was taking down their Christmas tree and decorations, CJ retreated into his room. He sent a text message to his best friend – “God’s speed” – and posted an update on his Facebook page: “Who turned out the light?” CJ held a 22-caliber rifle in one hand, his smartphone in the other and fatally shot himself. He was 17. Police found a suicide note written on the envelope of a college acceptance letter. His parents said he never showed outward signs of depression or suicidal ideation.\n\n“When we found him, his phone was still on, still in his hand, with blood on it,” Donna Dawley said. “He was so addicted to it that even his last moments of his life were about posting on social media.”\n\n\"For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,\" said Donna Dawley, the mother of CJ. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nNow, the Dawleys are joining a growing number of families who have filed recent wrongful death lawsuits against some of the big social media companies, claiming their platforms played a significant role in their teenagers’ decisions to end their lives. The Dawleys’ lawsuit, which was filed last week, targets Snap, the parent company of Snapchat, and Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram. The suit accuses the two companies of designing their platforms to addict users with algorithms that lead to “never-ending” scrolling as part of an effort to maximize time spent on the platform for advertising purposes and profit.\n\nThe lawsuit also said the platforms effectively exploit minor users’ decision-making and impulse control capabilities due to “incomplete brain development.”\n\nDonna Dawley said she and her husband, Chris, believe CJ’s mental health suffered as a direct result of the addictive nature of the platforms. They said they were motivated to file the lawsuit against Meta and Snap after Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen leaked hundreds of internal documents, including some that showed the company was aware of the ways Instagram can damage mental health and body image.\n\nIn public remarks, including her testimony before Congress last fall, Haugen also raised concerns about how Facebook’s algorithms could drive younger users toward harmful content, such as posts about eating disorders or self-harm, and lead to social media addiction. (Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote a 1,300-word post on Facebook at the time claiming Haugen took the company’s research on its impact on children out of context and painted a “false picture of the company.”)\n\n“For seven years, we were trying to figure out what happened,” said Donna Dawley, adding she felt compelled to “hold the companies accountable” after she heard how Instagram is designed to keep users on the platform for as long as possible. “How dare you put a product out there knowing that it was going to be addictive? Who would ever do that?”\n\nCJ Dawley died by suicide at the age of 17. His parents allege his social media addiction contributed to his death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nHaugen’s disclosures and Congressional testimony renewed scrutiny of tech platforms from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. A bipartisan bill was introduced in the Senate in February that proposes new and explicit responsibilities for tech platforms to protect children from digital harm. President Joe Biden also used part of his State of the Union address to urge lawmakers to “hold social media platforms accountable for the national experiment they’re conducting on our children for profit.”\n\nSome families are now also taking matters into their own hands and turning to the courts to pressure the tech companies to change how their platforms work. Matthew Bergman, the Dawleys’ lawyer, formed the Social Media Victims Law Center last fall after the release of the Facebook documents. He now represents 20 families who have filed wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies.\n\n“Money is not what is driving Donna and Chris Dawley to file this case and re-live their unimaginable loss they sustained,” Bergman said. “The only way to force [social media companies] to change their dangerous but highly profitable algorithms is to change their economic calculus by making them pay the true costs that their dangerous products have inflicted on families such as the Dawleys.”\n\nHe added: “When faced with similar instances of outrageous misconduct by product manufacturers, juries have awarded tens of millions of dollars in compensatory damages and imposed billion-dollar punitive damage awards. I have every reason to anticipate a jury, after fairly evaluating all the evidence, could render a similar judgment in this case.”\n\nCJ's parents, Chris and Donna, are now suing Meta and Snap over CJ's death. (John General/CNN) John General/CNN\n\nIn a statement to CNN Business, Snap spokesperson Katie Derkits said it can’t comment on active litigation but “our hearts go out to any family who has lost a loved one to suicide.”\n\n“We intentionally built Snapchat differently than traditional social media platforms to be a place for people to connect with their real friends and offer in-app mental health resources, including on suicide prevention for Snapchatters in need,” Derkits said. “Nothing is more important than the safety and wellbeing of our community and we are constantly exploring additional ways we can support Snapchatters.”\n\nMeta also declined to comment on the case because it is in litigation but said the company currently offers a series of suicide prevention tools, such as automatically providing resources to a user if a friend or AI detects a post is about suicide.\n\nTech companies under pressure to make changes\n\nAlthough alarms have been raised about social media addiction for years, Haugen’s testimony – coupled with concerns around kids’ increased time spent online during the pandemic – has made the issue a national talking point. But change hasn’t come fast enough for some families.\n\nJennifer Mitchell, who said her 16-year-old son Ian died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat, is also working with the Social Media Victims Law Center to file a lawsuit against Snap. She said she hopes it will make more parents aware of the dangers of social media and encourage lawmakers to regulate the platforms.\n\n“If we can put age restrictions on alcohol, cigarettes and to purchase a gun, something needs to be something done when it comes to social media,” she told CNN Business. Snapchat’s age requirement for signing up is 13. “It’s too addictive for kids.”\n\nIn August 2019, Mitchell had just landed in Alaska on a business trip from Florida when she received a series of voice messages saying her son died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. She said police later told her they believed Ian was recording a video at the time of the incident.\n\n“After trying to get into some of his social media accounts, we found video of him [taken] on Snapchat that looked like he was playing Russian roulette with the gun,” Mitchell said. “We don’t know who he was sending it to or if he was playing with someone. The phone was found not too far from his body.”\n\nSnap declined to comment on the incident.\n\nIan's mother said he died of a self-inflicted gunshot while on Snapchat. Courtesy Jennifer Mitchell\n\nThe emergence of wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies isn’t limited to teenagers. In January, Tammy Rodriguez filed a lawsuit, alleging her 11-year-old daughter Selena struggled with social media addiction for two years before taking her own life in July 2021. (Instagram and Snapchat, the two sites her daughter is said to have used most, require users to be at least 13 years old to create accounts, but as with many social platforms, some kids younger than that still sign up.)\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Selena Rodriguez had spent more time on those social networks during the pandemic and started communicating with older men on the platforms. She responded to requests to send sexually explicit images, “which were subsequently shared or leaked to her classmates, increasing the ridicule and embarrassment she experienced at school,” the suit alleged.\n\n“Throughout the period of Selena’s use of social media, Tammy Rodriguez was unaware of the clinically addictive and mentally harmful effects of Instagram and Snapchat,” the lawsuit said. It also cited the lack of sufficient parental controls at the time as a contributing factor, an issue that has been a focus of some recent criticism among lawmakers.\n\nBoth Snap and Meta declined to comment on the case but referenced their resources to help its users struggling with their mental health.\n\n“If a person walks into a bad neighborhood and is assaulted, that’s a regrettable incident,” said Bergman, who is also representing the Rodriguez family. “But if a tour guide says, ‘Let me show you around the city or I’ll show you the top sites,’ and one of those [spots] is a very dangerous neighborhood where a person is assaulted, the tour guide appropriately has some responsibility for putting the tourist in harm’s way. That’s exactly what these platforms do.”\n\n“It’s not random that teenage girls are directed toward content that makes them feel bad about their bodies. That is the way the algorithms work; it’s by design,” he added.\n\nA long and uncertain legal road\n\nCarl Tobias, a professor at the University of Richmond School of Law, believes these wrongful death lawsuits against social media companies could hold up in court despite inevitable challenges.\n\n“The problem, at least in the traditional notion in the law, has been that it’s difficult to prove addiction that then leads to taking somebody’s life or doing serious damage to somebody that’s self-inflicted,” he said. “But judges and juries in certain situations might be more open to finding liability and awarding damages.”\n\nHe said Haugen’s “damning” testimony before Congress and the “seemingly troubling” data companies collect about young users, as revealed in the documents, could potentially support a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs, depending on each case.\n\nIf you suspect someone may be suicidal: 1. Do not leave the person alone. 2. Remove any ﬁrearms, alcohol, drugs or sharp objects that could be used in a suicide attempt. 3.

However, Tobias said because families are now targeting how the platforms are designed, it “might persuade a court to distinguish the new allegations from other actions by defendants that judges found immune.”\n\nIn the months following the leaked internal documents, Instagram has rolled out a handful of safeguards aimed at protecting its young users, including a tool called Take a Break, which aims to encourage people to spend some time away from the platform after they’ve been scrolling for a certain period. It also introduced a tool that allows parents to see how much time their kids spend on Instagram and set time limits, and brought back a version of its news feed that sorts posts in reverse chronological order rather than ranked according to the platform’s algorithms.\n\nLast month, dozens of attorneys general wrote a letter to TikTok and Snap calling on the companies to strengthen the platforms’ existing parental tools and better work alongside third-party monitoring apps, which can alert parents if children use language that suggests a desire for self-harm or suicide.\n\n“Your platforms do not effectively collaborate with parental control applications or otherwise provide an adequate opportunity for parental control within the platform,” the letter said. “We ask that you conform to widespread industry practice by giving parents increased ability to protect their vulnerable children.”\n\nSnap told CNN Business in a response it is currently working on new tools for parents that give more insight into what their teens are doing on Snapchat and who they’re talking to. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment. However, the company has expanded its safety features over the years. In 2019, TikTok introduced a limited app experience called TikTok for Younger Users which restricts messaging, commenting and sharing videos for users under age 13. In 2020, it rolled out the ability to disable direct messaging for users under the age of 16.\n\nBergman said he anticipates a “long fight” ahead as he plans to “file a lot of cases” against social media companies. “The only thing that’s certain is the level of opposition that we’re going to face from companies that have all the money in the world to hire all the lawyers,” he said. “They want to do everything they can to avoid standing up in a courtroom and explain to a jury why their profits were more important than the life of CJ Dawley.”\n\nDonna Dawley said the last time she saw her son, on the day of his death, he was looking down at his phone, appearing sad. “I just wish I would have grabbed him and hugged him,” she said.\n\n“[This lawsuit] is not about winning or losing. We’re all losing right now. But if we can get them to change the algorithm for one child – if one child is saved – then it’s been worth it.”", "authors": ["Samantha Murphy Kelly"], "publish_date": "2022/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/03/tech/elon-musk-twitter-verification-plans/index.html", "title": "Elon Musk wants Twitter users to pay to be verified. It could create a ...", "text": "New York CNN Business —\n\nIn 2009, after Twitter was sued by then-St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa for being impersonated on the platform, the young company introduced a new feature: a blue and white check mark.\n\nThe check indicated that Twitter had verified the accounts of artists, athletes, government officials and agencies and other public figures. The option, which kicked off with plans to verify the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was presented as protection for individuals at risk of having their accounts fraudulently imitated and as a benefit to all users — a means of letting people know they could trust information being shared by prominent figures.\n\nIt soon became one of the platform’s signature features, copied by rivals like Facebook, and created a new kind of cultural cachet for those who received it. Now Twitter’s new owner, Elon Musk, is looking to overhaul the way verification works, with the potential not only to change who gets a coveted blue check mark, but also to create new headaches for users in spotting fake and fraudulent activity on the platform.\n\nMusk confirmed this week he’s working to launch an updated version of the company’s Twitter Blue subscription service in which any user can pay $8 per month to get or remain verified. The world’s richest man has also used populist language, framing the move as a way to break “Twitter’s current lords & peasants system for who has or doesn’t have a blue checkmark.”\n\nIf users buy in, the plan could be a new revenue driver for Twitter, something Musk needs following his $44 billion acquisition of the company, which was partly funded with debt. He has also suggested that verifying more actual, human users could help address the prevalence of fake and spam accounts that he purported to be concerned about during his months-long effort to get out of the acquisition deal.\n\nThe logic appears to go something like this: By requiring users to pay for verification, using a bank account or credit card, it would create a higher barrier to entry for inauthentic accounts. Musk said in a tweet Wednesday that if accounts verified under his new system engage in “spam/scam/impersonation, they’ll be suspended, but Twitter will keep their money!” And he said he would create a separate tag that would show up under the name of public figures, similar to how Twitter already identifies government officials and representatives of state media organizations.\n\nBut the move could disincentivize certain prominent accounts from being verified, making it harder for users to determine which are authentic. And it’s not clear that it will prevent inauthentic and bot activity either.\n\n“In fact, this is making Twitter a pay-for-play system, and we know that propagandists, people working to spread disinformation and other forms of manipulation via Twitter, are very much willing and able to finance their operations,” said Samuel Woolley, assistant professor at the University of Texas’ School of Information and author of the book “Bots.”\n\n“Most of the propagandists that social media companies are most worried about, like the Russian government, the Chinese government, extremist groups, have a lot of resources,” he said.\n\nCurrently, Woolley said, to get past the Twitter verification requirement that users link a cell phone number to their account, bad actors will “buy thousands of smartphones and put them on racks … and that’s a much more costly endeavor than paying an $8 verification fee.” In theory, a person could also pay to verify an account and then allow a computer to run it, thus effectively creating an automated (or “bot”) verified account.\n\nThere may be other complicating factors. Users might have concerns about handing over their bank or credit card information to a company that allegedly has major security vulnerabilities, according to a company whistleblower complaint from just months ago. In many parts of the world, people don’t readily have access to banking services. And many regular Twitter users who aren’t worried about being impersonated and don’t care about Twitter “clout” may also simply not care to shell out for a blue check.\n\nIt’s also not clear what would stop someone from creating and paying to verify an account fraudulently impersonating someone else, thus undermining the original purpose of the feature. It’s not hard to imagine someone paying to verify themselves as a customer support agent for a particular company and then using the credibility that comes from having a blue check mark to scam unsuspecting customers.\n\nTwitter did not immediately respond to questions about the plan, including how it would prevent such imitation.\n\nMusk has said his goal in buying Twitter is to bolster “free speech,” but some worry that the new subscription option could create a two-tiered speech system, based on who can and can’t afford to pay. With the new plan, for example, subscribers would get priority in replies, mentions and search, as well as the ability to post longer video and audio content while getting half as many ads as free users, according to Musk.\n\n“You’re really saying that the free speech of people who pay is more important than the free speech of people who can’t,” said Jessica González, co-CEO of media accountability Free Press, who was part of a group of civil society leaders who met with Musk earlier this week to discuss content moderation and a recent surge of hateful rhetoric on the platform. “I actually told him … that I think that $8 a month is highly problematic.”\n\nThe proposed subscription update has been panned by several high-profile Twitter users, including author Stephen King and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez. “Lmao at a billionaire earnestly trying to sell people on the idea that ‘free speech’ is actually a $8/mo subscription plan,” Ocasio Cortez said in a tweet Wednesday.\n\nMusk on Wednesday hit back at critics of the plan, saying in a tweet: “To all the complainers, please continue complaining, but it will cost $8.”\n\n–CNN’s Jennifer Korn contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Clare Duffy"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/20/tech/chatbot-ai-history/index.html", "title": "Chatbots: A long and complicated history | CNN Business", "text": "CNN —\n\nIn the 1960s, an unprecedented computer program called Eliza attempted to simulate the experience of speaking to a therapist. In one exchange, captured in a research paper at the time, a person revealed that her boyfriend had described her as “depressed much of the time.” Eliza’s response: “I am sorry to hear you are depressed.”\n\nEliza, which is widely characterized as the first chatbot, wasn’t as versatile as similar services today. The program, which relied on natural language understanding, reacted to key words and then essentially punted the dialogue back to the user. Nonetheless, as Joseph Weizenbaum, the computer scientist at MIT who created Eliza, wrote in a research paper in 1966, “some subjects have been very hard to convince that ELIZA (with its present script) is not human.”\n\nTo Weizenbaum, that fact was cause for concern, according to his 2008 MIT obituary. Those interacting with Eliza were willing to open their hearts to it, even knowing it was a computer program. “ELIZA shows, if nothing else, how easy it is to create and maintain the illusion of understanding, hence perhaps of judgment deserving of credibility,” Weizenbaum wrote in 1966. “A certain danger lurks there.” He spent the ends of his career warning against giving machines too much responsibility and became a harsh, philosophical critic of AI.\n\nNearly 60 years later, the market is flooded with chatbots of varying quality and use cases from tech companies, banks, airlines and more. In many ways, Weizenbaum’s story foreshadowed the hype and bewilderment still attached to this technology. A program’s ability to “chat” with humans continues to confound some of the public, creating a false sense that the machine is something closer to human.\n\nThis was captured in the wave of media coverage earlier this summer after a Google engineer claimed the tech giant’s AI chatbot LaMDA was “sentient.” The engineer said he was convinced after spending time discussing religion and personhood with the chatbot, according to a Washington Post report. His claims were widely criticized in the AI community.\n\nEven before this, our complicated relationship with artificial intelligence and machines was evident in the plots of Hollywood movies like “Her” or “Ex-Machina,” not to mention harmless debates with people who insist on saying “thank you” to voice assistants like Alexa or Siri.\n\nEliza, widely characterized as the first chatbot, wasn't as versatile as similar services today. It reacted to key words and then essentially punted the dialogue back to the user. Katja Hoffmann/laif/Redux\n\nContemporary chatbots can also elicit strong emotional reactions from users when they don’t work as expected — or when they’ve become so good at imitating the flawed human speech they were trained on that they begin spewing racist and incendiary comments. It didn’t take long, for example, for Meta’s new chatbot to stir up some controversy this month by spouting wildly untrue political commentary and antisemitic remarks in conversations with users.\n\nEven so, proponents of this technology argue it can streamline customer service jobs and increase efficiency across a much wider range of industries. This tech underpins the digital assistants so many of us have come to use on a daily basis for playing music, ordering deliveries, or fact-checking homework assignments. Some also make a case for these chatbots providing comfort to the lonely, elderly, or isolated. At least one startup has gone so far as to use it as a tool to seemingly keep dead relatives alive by creating computer-generated versions of them based on uploaded chats.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, warn the technology behind AI-powered chatbots remains much more limited than some people wish it may be. “These technologies are really good at faking out humans and sounding human-like, but they’re not deep,” said Gary Marcus, an AI researcher and New York University professor emeritus. “They’re mimics, these systems, but they’re very superficial mimics. They don’t really understand what they’re talking about.”\n\nStill, as these services expand into more corners of our lives, and as companies take steps to personalize these tools more, our relationships with them may only grow more complicated, too.\n\nThe evolution of chatbots\n\nSanjeev P. Khudanpur remembers chatting with Eliza while in graduate school. For all its historic importance in the tech industry, he said it didn’t take long to see its limitations.\n\nIt could only convincingly mimic a text conversation for about a dozen back-and-forths before “you realize, no, it’s not really smart, it’s just trying to prolong the conversation one way or the other,” said Khudanpur, an expert in the application of information-theoretic methods to human language technologies and professor at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nJoseph Weizenbaum, the inventor of Eliza, sits at a computer desktop in the computer museum of Paderborn, Germany, in May 2005. Computermuseum Paderborn/picture-alliance/dpa/AP\n\nAnother early chatbot was developed by psychiatrist Kenneth Colby at Stanford in 1971 and named “Parry” because it was meant to imitate a paranoid schizophrenic. (The New York Times’ 2001 obituary for Colby included a colorful chat that ensued when researchers brought Eliza and Parry together.)\n\nIn the decades that followed these tools, however, there was a shift away from the idea of “conversing with computers.” Khudanpur said that’s “because it turned out the problem is very, very hard.” Instead, the focus turned to “goal-oriented dialogue,” he said.\n\nTo understand the difference, think about the conversations you may have now with Alexa or Siri. Typically, you ask these digital assistants for help with buying a ticket, checking the weather or playing a song. That’s goal-oriented dialogue, and it became the main focus of academic and industry research as computer scientists sought to glean something useful from the ability of computers to scan human language.\n\nWhile they used similar technology to the earlier, social chatbots, Khudanpur said, “you really couldn’t call them chatbots. You could call them voice assistants, or just digital assistants, which helped you carry out specific tasks.”\n\nThere was a decades-long “lull” in this technology, he added, until the widespread adoption of the internet. “The big breakthroughs came probably in this millennium,” Khudanpur said. “With the rise of companies that successfully employed the kind of computerized agents to carry out routine tasks.”\n\nWith the rise of smart speakers like Alexa, it has become even more common for people to chat with machines. Callaghan O'Hare/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\n“People are always upset when their bags get lost, and the human agents who deal with them are always stressed out because of all the negativity, so they said, ‘Let’s give it to a computer,’” Khudanpur said. “You could yell all you wanted at the computer, all it wanted to know is ‘Do you have your tag number so that I can tell you where your bag is?’”\n\nIn 2008, for example, Alaska Airlines launched “Jenn,” a digital assistant to help travelers. In a sign of our tendency to humanize these tools, an early review of the service in The New York Times noted: “Jenn is not annoying. She is depicted on the Web site as a young brunette with a nice smile. Her voice has proper inflections. Type in a question, and she replies intelligently. (And for wise guys fooling around with the site who will inevitably try to trip her up with, say, a clumsy bar pickup line, she politely suggests getting back to business.)”\n\nReturn to social chatbots, and social problems\n\nIn the early 2000s, researchers began to revisit the development of social chatbots that could carry an extended conversation with humans. These chatbots are often trained on large swaths of data from the internet, and have learned to be extremely good mimics of how humans speak — but they also risked echoing some of the worst of the internet.\n\nIn 2015, for example, Microsoft’s public experiment with an AI chatbot called Tay crashed and burned in less than 24 hours. Tay was designed to talk like a teen, but quickly started spewing racist and hateful comments to the point that Microsoft shut it down. (The company said there was also a coordinated effort from humans to trick Tay into making certain offensive comments.)\n\n“The more you chat with Tay the smarter she gets, so the experience can be more personalized for you,” Microsoft said at the time.\n\nThis refrain would be repeated by other tech giants that released public chatbots, including Meta’s BlenderBot3, released earlier this month. The Meta chatbot falsely claimed that Donald Trump is still president and there is “definitely a lot of evidence” that the election was stolen, among other controversial remarks.\n\nBlenderBot3 also professed to be more than a bot.. In one conversation, it claimed “the fact that I’m alive and conscious right now makes me human.”\n\nMeta's new chatbot, BlenderBot3, explains to a user why it is actually human. However, it didn't take long for the chatbot to stir up controversy by making incendiary remarks. Meta\n\nDespite all the advances since Eliza and the massive amounts of new data to train these language processing programs, Marcus, the NYU professor, said, “It’s not clear to me that you can really build a reliable and safe chatbot.”\n\nHe cites a 2015 Facebook project dubbed “M,” an automated personal assistant that was supposed to be the company’s text-based answer to services like Siri and Alexa “The notion was it was going to be this universal assistant that was going to help you order in a romantic dinner and get musicians to play for you and flowers delivery — way beyond what Siri can do,” Marcus said. Instead, the service was shut down in 2018, after an underwhelming run.\n\nKhudanpur, on the other hand, remains optimistic about their potential use cases. “I have this whole vision of how AI is going to empower humans at an individual level,” he said. “Imagine if my bot could read all the scientific articles in my field, then I wouldn’t have to go read them all, I’d simply think and ask questions and engage in dialogue,” he said. “In other words, I will have an alter ego of mine, which has complementary superpowers.”", "authors": ["Catherine Thorbecke"], "publish_date": "2022/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/03/tech/ai-art-fair-winner-controversy/index.html", "title": "AI won an art contest, and artists are furious | CNN Business", "text": "CNN Business —\n\nJason M. Allen was almost too nervous to enter his first art competition. Now, his award-winning image is sparking controversy about whether art can be generated by a computer, and what, exactly, it means to be an artist.\n\nIn August, Allen, a game designer who lives in Pueblo West, Colorado, won first place in the emerging artist division’s “digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography” category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. His winning image, titled “Théâtre D’opéra Spatial” (French for “Space Opera Theater”), was made with Midjourney — an artificial intelligence system that can produce detailed images when fed written prompts. A $300 prize accompanied his win.\n\n“I’m fascinated by this imagery. I love it. And it think everyone should see it,” Allen, 39, told CNN Business in an interview on Friday.\n\nIn August, Jason M. Allen's piece \"Théâtre D'opéra Spatial\" — which he created with AI image generator Midjourney — won first place in the emerging artist division's \"digital arts/digitally-manipulated photography\" category at the Colorado State Fair Fine Arts Competition. Courtesy Jason M. Allen\n\nAllen’s winning image looks like a bright, surreal cross between a Renaissance and steampunk painting. It’s one of three such images he entered in the competition. In total, 11 people entered 18 pieces of art in the same category in the emerging artist division.\n\nThe definition for the category in which Allen competed states that digital art refers to works that use “digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process.” Allen stated that Midjourney was used to create his image when he entered the contest, he said.\n\nMidjourney is one of a growing number of such AI image generators — others include Google Research’s Imagen and OpenAI’s DALL-E 2. Anyone can use Midjourney via Discord, while DALL-E 2 requires an invitation, and Imagen has not been opened up to users outside Google.\n\nThe newness of these tools, how they’re used to produce images, and, in some cases, the gatekeeping for access to some of the most powerful ones has led to debates about whether they can truly make art or assist humans in making art.\n\nThis came into sharp focus for Allen not long after his win. Allen had posted excitedly about his win on Midjourney’s Discord server on August 25, along with pictures of his three entries; it went viral on Twitter days later, with many artists angered by Allen’s win because of his use of AI to create the image, as a story by Vice’s Motherboard reported earlier this week.\n\n“This sucks for the exact same reason we don’t let robots participate in the Olympics,” one Twitter user wrote.\n\n“This is the literal definition of ‘pressed a few buttons to make a digital art piece’,” another Tweeted. “AI artwork is the ‘banana taped to the wall’ of the digital world now.”\n\nYet while Allen didn’t use a paintbrush to create his winning piece, there was plenty of work involved, he said.\n\n“It’s not like you’re just smashing words together and winning competitions,” he said.\n\nYou can feed a phrase like “an oil painting of an angry strawberry” to Midjourney and receive several images from the AI system within seconds, but Allen’s process wasn’t that simple. To get the final three images he entered in the competition, he said, took more than 80 hours.\n\nFirst, he said, he played around with phrasing that led Midjourney to generate images of women in frilly dresses and space helmets — he was trying to mash up Victorian-style costuming with space themes, he said. Over time, with many slight tweaks to his written prompt (such as to adjust lighting and color harmony), he created 900 iterations of what led to his final three images. He cleaned up those three images in Photoshop, such as by giving one of the female figures in his winning image a head with wavy, dark hair after Midjourney had rendered her headless. Then he ran the images through another software program called Gigapixel AI that can improve resolution and had the images printed on canvas at a local print shop.\n\nAllen is glad the debate over whether AI can be used to make art is capturing so much attention.\n\n“Rather than hating on the technology or the people behind it, we need to recognize that it’s a powerful tool and use it for good so we can all move forward rather than sulking about it,” Allen said.\n\nCal Duran, an artist and art teacher who was one of the judges for the competition, said that while Allen’s piece included a mention of Midjourney, he didn’t realize that it was generated by AI when judging it. Still, he sticks by his decision to award it first place in its category, he said, calling it a “beautiful piece”.\n\n“I think there’s a lot involved in this piece and I think the AI technology may give more opportunities to people who may not find themselves artists in the conventional way,” he said.\n\nAllen won’t yet say what the text prompt was behind his winning image — he’s planning to keep it a secret until he publishes a larger related work that he hopes will be finished later this year.", "authors": ["Rachel Metz"], "publish_date": "2022/09/03"}]}

Wade put her life in danger.\n\nCNN has told the stories of several women – including one from Houston, one from central Texas and one from Cleveland – and what they had to do to obtain medically necessary abortions.\n\nNow, a woman from Austin, Texas, has come forward because she nearly died when she couldn’t get a timely abortion.\n\nThis is her story.\n\nThe loss of a ‘miracle’ baby\n\nAmanda Eid and Josh Zurawski, both now 35, met in 1991 at Aldersgate Academy preschool in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and dated in high school.\n\n“Josh always tells me he’s been in love with me since we were 4 years old,” Amanda said.\n\nThree years ago, they married in Austin, Texas, where they both work in high-tech jobs.\n\nThey tried to have a family but failed. Amanda had fertility treatments for a year and a half and finally became pregnant.\n\nAmanda Zurawski became pregnant after a year and a half of fertility treatments. Courtesy Amanda Zurawski\n\n“Very excited to share that Baby Zurawski is expected in late January,” Amanda shared on Instagram in July. The post included a picture of her and her husband in “Mama” and “Dad” hats, Amanda holding a strip of ultrasound photos of their baby girl.\n\n“The fact that we were pregnant at all was a miracle, and we were beside ourselves with happiness,” she said.\n\nBut then, 18 weeks – just four months – into her pregnancy, Amanda’s water broke.\n\nThe amniotic fluid that her baby depended upon was leaking out. She says her doctor told her the baby would not survive.\n\n“We found out that we were going to lose our baby,” Amanda said. “My cervix was dilating fully 22 weeks prematurely, and I was inevitably going to miscarry.”\n\nShe and Josh begged the doctor to see if there was any way to save the baby.\n\n“I just kept asking, ‘isn’t there anything we can do?’ And the answer was ‘no,’ ” Amanda said.\n\nTexas anti-abortion laws\n\nWhen a woman’s water breaks, she’s at high risk for a life-threatening infection. While Amanda and Josh’s baby – they named her Willow – was sure to die, she still had a heartbeat, and so doctors said that under Texas law, they were unable to terminate the pregnancy.\n\n“My doctor said, ‘Well, right now we just have to wait, because we can’t induce labor, even though you’re 100% for sure going to lose your baby,’ ” Amanda said. “[The doctors] were unable to do their own jobs because of the way that the laws are written in Texas.”\n\nTexas law allows for abortion if the mother “has a life-threatening physical condition aggravated, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.”\n\nBut Texas lawmakers haven’t spelled out exactly what that means, and a doctor found to be in violation of the law can face loss of their medical license and a possible life sentence in prison.\n\n“They’re extremely vague,” said Katie Keith, director of the Health Policy and Law Initiative at Georgetown University Law Center. “They don’t spell out exactly the situations when an abortion can be provided.”\n\nIn September, CNN reached out to 28 Texas legislators who sponsored anti-abortion legislation, asking them for their response to CNN stories about the woman in Houston and the woman in central Texas.\n\nOnly one legislator responded.\n\n“Like any other law, there are unintended consequences. We do not want to see any unintended consequences; if we do, it is our responsibility as legislators to fix those flaws,” wrote state Sen. Eddie Lucio, who will be leaving the Senate at the end of the year.\n\nThe Zurawskis participated in an ad for Beto O’Rourke’s unsuccessful Texas gubernatorial campaign.\n\nGoing downhill very fast\n\nAfter her water broke, Amanda’s doctors sent her home and told her to watch for signs of infection, and that only when she was “considered sick enough that my life was at risk” would they terminate the pregnancy, Amanda said.\n\n“My doctor said it could take hours, it could take days, it could take weeks,” she remembers.\n\nOnce they heard “hours,” they decided there was no time to travel to another state for an abortion.\n\n“The nearest ‘sanctuary’ state is at least an eight-hour drive,” Amanda wrote in an online essay on The Meteor. “Developing sepsis – which can kill quickly – in a car in the middle of the West Texas desert, or 30,000 feet above the ground, is a death sentence.”\n\nSo they waited it out in Texas.\n\nOn August 26, three days after her water broke, Amanda found herself shivering in the Texas heat.\n\n“We were having a heat wave, I think it was 105 degrees that day, and I was freezing cold, and I was shaking, my teeth were chattering. I was trying to tell Josh that I didn’t feel good, and my teeth were chattering so hard that I could not even get the sentence out,” she said.\n\nJosh was shocked by his wife’s condition.\n\n“To see in a matter of maybe five minutes, for her to go from a normal temperature to the condition she was in was really, really scary,” he said. “Very quickly, she went downhill very, very fast. She was in a state I’ve never seen her in.”\n\nJosh rushed his wife to the hospital. Her temperature was 102 degrees. She was too weak to walk on her own.\n\nHer temperature went up to 103 degrees. Finally, Amanda was sick enough that the doctors felt legally safe to terminate the pregnancy, she said.\n\n‘I was really scared I was going to lose her’\n\nBut Amanda was so sick that antibiotics wouldn’t stop the bacterial infection raging through her body. A blood transfusion didn’t cure her, either.\n\nAbout 12 hours after her pregnancy was terminated, doctors and nurses flooded her room.\n\n“There’s a lot of commotion, and I said, ‘what’s going on?’ and they said, ‘we’re moving you to the ICU,’ and I said, ‘why?’ and they said, ‘you’re developing symptoms of sepsis,’ ” she said.\n\nSepsis, the body’s extreme response to an infection, is a life-threatening medical emergency.\n\nAmanda’s blood pressure plummeted. Her platelets dropped. She doesn’t remember much from that time.\n\nBut Josh does.\n\n“It was really scary to see Amanda crash,” he said. “I was really scared I was going to lose her.”\n\nFamily members flew in from across the country because they feared it would be the last time they would see Amanda.\n\nDoctors inserted an intravenous line near her heart to deliver antibiotics and medication to stabilize her blood pressure. Finally, Amanda turned the corner and survived.\n\n‘These barbaric laws’\n\nBut her medical ordeal isn’t over.\n\nAmanda’s uterus suffered scarring from the infection, and she may not be able to have more children. She had a surgery recently to fix the scarring, but it’s unclear whether it will be successful.\n\nThat leaves the Zurawskis scared – and furious that they might never have a family because of a Texas law.\n\n“[This] didn’t have to happen,” Amanda said. “That’s what’s so infuriating about all of this, is that we didn’t have to – we shouldn’t have had to – go through all of this trauma.”\n\nThe Zurawskis say the politicians who voted for the anti-abortion law call themselves “pro-life” – but they don’t see it that way.\n\n“Amanda almost died. That’s not pro-life. Amanda will have challenges in the future having more kids. That’s not pro-life,” Josh said.\n\n“Nothing about [this] feels pro-life,” his wife added.\n\nIn many ways, Amanda feels fortunate. She wonders whether she’d be alive today if it weren’t for her husband, who rushed her to the hospital and made sure she got the best care possible.

Sign up here.\n\nAmman, Jordan CNN —\n\nJordan’s king says he is prepared for conflict should the status of Jerusalem’s holy sites change as Israel prepares to swear in what is likely to be the most right-wing government in its history.\n\nKing Abdullah II told CNN’s Becky Anderson in an exclusive interview this month that there is “concern” in his country about those in Israel trying to push for changes to his custodianship of the Muslim and Christian holy sites in Israeli-occupied East Jerusalem, warning that he has “red lines.”\n\n“If people want to get into a conflict with us, we’re quite prepared,” he said. “I always like to believe that, let’s look at the glass half full, but we have certain red lines… And if people want to push those red lines, then we will deal with that.”\n\nIsraeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu’s incoming government is expected to be the most right-wing in Israel’s history and it includes controversial figures who were once considered to be on the extreme fringe of Israeli politics. This has caused concerns about the potential for an escalation in Israeli-Palestinian violence and for the future of Israel’s relations with its Arab neighbors and Western allies.\n\nThis year was already the deadliest for Palestinians and Israelis in nearly two decades, raising the specter of a new Palestinian uprising against Israel.\n\n“We have to be concerned about a next intifada (uprising),” said the king. “And if that happens, that’s a complete breakdown of law and order and one that neither the Israelis nor the Palestinians will benefit from. I think there is a lot of concern from all of us in the region, including those in Israel that are on our side on this issue, to make sure that doesn’t happen.”\n\nIsrael captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 war but signed a peace treaty with it in 1994 under which it formally recognized Amman’s special role at the city’s holy sites. But the two have since had an uneasy relationship, with Jordan regularly accusing Israel of violating the agreement that gave it control of the sites and barred non-Muslims from praying there.\n\nJordan’s Hashemite monarchy has been the custodian of Jerusalem’s holy sites since 1924 and sees itself as the guarantor of the religious rights of Muslims and Christians in the city.\n\nTensions are highest over the compound known to Muslims as the Haram Al Sharif, which is called the Temple Mount by Jews. The site includes the Al Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam. The area is also the holiest site in Judaism. Politicians on the Israeli right often argue that Jews should also have a right to pray there.\n\nOne of the most controversial figures in Israel’s incoming government is Itamar Ben Gvir, who is set to become the national security minister and assume control over the police, including law enforcement at Jerusalem’s holy sites. Ben Gvir has a long history of inciting violence against Palestinians and Arabs. He has been convicted of inciting anti-Arab racism and supporting terrorism and has openly called for changing the status quo at the holy sites.\n\n“I don’t think those individuals are under just a Jordanian microscope. They’re under an international microscope,” the king said, responding to a question about Ben Gvir’s views. “I have to believe that there’s a lot of people in Israel also that are concerned as much as we are.”\n\nHe refused to say how Jordan would respond to changes in the status of the holy sites. “At the end of the day, the Israeli people have the right to pick whoever they want to lead them… We will work with anybody and everybody as long as we can bring people together,” he said.\n\nOf Jordan’s population of around 10 million, more than half is of Palestinian descent, including more than two million Palestinian refugees.\n\nJordan was the second Arab nation to normalize relations with Israel, after Egypt. But after a decades-long wait, Israel scored a major diplomatic victory in 2020 by gaining recognition from four more Arab states, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan.\n\nIsraeli politician Itamar Ben Gvir visits Al Haram Al Sharif, known to Jews as Temple Mount, accompanied by Israeli forces in Jerusalem on May 29. Mostafa Alkharouf/Anadolu Agency/Getty Images\n\nThe nation’s relationship with Israel is heavily scrutinized at home, with many opposing further strengthening of ties due to Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians.\n\nIsrael’s integration into the region is “extremely important” but it is “not going to happen unless there’s a future for the Palestinians,” the king said, pointing to the overwhelming support shown by Arab football fans for Palestinians at the Qatar FIFA World Cup.\n\nThe king has redoubled efforts to shed light on the status of Christians in the Middle East of late. In September, he proclaimed at the United Nations General Assembly in New York that Christianity in Jerusalem was “under fire,” a message the patriarchs and Heads of the Churches in Jerusalem endorsed.\n\nSome churches in the Holy Land have also been sounding the alarm about the status of Christians there. In a Christmas message this week, the Heads of Churches in Jerusalem, a grouping of Palestinian churches, issued a statement decrying the “assault” on their exercise of religion and “unwarranted restrictions” on worship. In July, the Higher Presidential Committee of Church Affairs in Palestine issued a statement condemning an attack by “extremist Israeli settlers” on the Church of the Holy Spirit and the Greek Garden, accusing the Israeli government of complicity through “inaction” in holding the perpetrators to account.\n\nIsraeli foreign ministry spokesman Lior Haiat told CNN the Heads of Churches “have full access to every governmental authority for concerns they have,” adding that acts of violence “on any community are condemned by the government and investigated with the utmost seriousness by Israeli police.”\n\n“The State of Israel remains committed to safeguarding freedom of religion and worship for all, including the Christian community, in Jerusalem and other holy sites,” he said.\n\nKing Abdullah told CNN that churches in Jerusalem face challenges from “policies on the ground,” causing the Christian community to come under pressure.\n\n“This is not a national policy, but there are those that join governments that have very extremist views towards Muslims and Christians, as there are on the other side obviously, and we have to unify against that,” he said.\n\nChristians in the Middle East are “part of our past, they’re part of our present, and they must be part of our future,” he added.\n\nJordan has become a safe haven for Middle Eastern Christians for the better part of the past two decades as neighboring countries have been embroiled in conflicts that have pushed some of the oldest Christian communities in the world to flee their homelands.\n\nIn December, the monarch launched a master plan to develop Bethany Beyond the Jordan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site where Christians believe Jesus was baptized. The plan aims to build lodging, museums and amphitheatres catering to as many as 1.5 million tourists per year.\n\n“I think one of the things that people misunderstand about this place is how inclusive it is. Almost 15% of the visitors that come here are Muslim,” he told CNN. “So this is an opportunity to break down those barriers and to show how proud we are of not only our historical Christian heritage here in Jordan, but the relationship between Christianity and Islam.”\n\nPeople in the Middle East “just want to move on with their lives,” said the monarch. “So, as challenging as 2022 was, and as difficult as the dangers of 2023 are, there’s an opportunity for us to move beyond.”\n\nThat can be done through regional integration, he said.\n\n“I’ve gotten away from the feeling that politics are going to solve our problems. It’s economic dependency,” he said. “When I am invested in your success because your success is my success, at the end of the day means we can move forward.”\n\nWith additional reporting by CNN’s Mike Schwartz in Jerusalem.", "authors": ["Zeena Saifi"], "publish_date": "2022/12/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/10/08/israeli-hamas-palestinian-war-live-updates/71109683007/", "title": "Israel-Hamas war live: More than 123K displaced in Gaza after attack", "text": "The rapidly intensifying war between Israel and Palestinian militants roared through a second day Sunday, with the Israeli Security Cabinet formally declaring war and the death toll surpassing 1,100 — a figure that may include some Americans.\n\nMore than 700 Israelis have been killed since Hamas militants began their assault Saturday on almost two dozen Israeli towns and army bases, ZAKA, a volunteer group that handles human remains after terror attacks, told Israeli media.

Naideck is an Israeli-American in her fourth year of medical school at Ben-Gurion University, in Beersheba, 25 miles from Gaza.\n\nThe 27-year-old has been living in Israel for the last three years but moved back to the United States for her studies. But many of Naideck’s loved ones live in the Middle Eastern country, including her family and her boyfriend along with his family.\n\nNaideck noted the complexity of the conflict and said she spent her time in Israel \"really trying to understand the Palestinian perspective,” adding that she’s had “a lot of criticisms of this government and the occupation.”\n\nBut with her loved ones in potential danger and hearing about the violence, Naideck was left “questioning her morals” over the weekend as the conflict unfolded.\n\n\"This issue is so not black and white,\" Naideck told USA TODAY. \"People who aren't directly involved in the (Israeli-Palestinian) conflict, don't understand that it's not black and white.\"\n\n“I feel pretty negative about the whole thing,” Naideck added. “This is not gonna help any long-term solution at all. This is really destroying me. I feel like any chance of hope and peace in the near future.”\n\nHaneen Shaath, a master's student at Pennsylvania State University studying international affairs with a double concentration in Refugee Rights under International Law and International Public Policy, grew up in Gaza for 24 years. Shaath, 25, said she survived four deadly aggressions in her homeland, occupied Palestine, \"all of which were launched by Israel.\"\n\nAccording to Shaath, the situation between Gaza and Israeli occupation is \"not a conflict and not a war, because these words mean that the two parties have equal force. However, they do not, so this is an aggression committed by the Israeli occupation against Palestinians of Gaza.\"\n\nShaath told USA TODAY that there is unequal power between Palestinians and Israel, saying the latter is superior in its military power and support from Western countries. \"The Israeli occupation has successfully proved its strong hatred for Palestinian people and saves no efforts in killing them,\" she noted.\n\nThe current situation has left Shaath anxious. Over the weekend, Shaath said she lost communication with her family for over 12 hours after Israel reportedly shut down the power in different parts of the Gaza Strip and disputed reports that Palestinians \"invaded any Israeli towns and villages.\"\n\n\"This is not true,\" Shaath added. \"Palestinians just were trying to return to their occupied land and territory that have been stolen from them since 1948 and were granted to illegal colonial settlers.”\n\nShaath also noted the history in the region, calling Israel’s claim of the land illegal and a colonial-settlement a \"violation of international law.\" She criticized Israel’s system of governing Palestinians, describing it as aggressive and an apartheid.\n\n\"I hope that Palestinians have their rights to freedom and their right to work in peace and security… because Palestinians are human beings and they want to live in peace just as the rest of the world. However, resistance is the only way for Palestinians to get this,\" Shaath said.\n\n— Thao Nguyen\n\n3 British men dead or unaccounted for, families say\n\nThree British men were said to be either dead or missing following the Hamas surprise attack on Israel, The Associated Press reported.\n\nNathanel Young, 20, was killed while serving in the Israel Defense Forces, his sister, Gaby Shalev, said on Facebook.

Shtayyeh said the international alignment behind Israel encourages the Israeli government and military to commit more crimes \"against our people\" in Gaza.\n\n\"We have always warned of the seriousness of the repercussions that will result from continuing the siege of our people in the Gaza Strip, and continuing to storm cities, towns, villages, and camps, violating sanctities, attacking Muslim and Christian worshipers,\" Shtayyeh said.\n\nReport: US officials seek to determine Iran’s connection to Israel attack\n\nDespite multiple reports linking Iran to the surprise attack led by Hamas against Israel Saturday, U.S. officials are unable to confirm that the country had a hand in its planning and execution, CNN reported Sunday evening.\n\nU.S. officials told the news outlet that it was too early to determine Iran’s role in the conflict, but leaders acknowledged Iran’s connections to and long history of aiding Hamas.\n\nOn Sunday, the Wall Street Journal reported that senior members of Hamas and other militant groups said Iranian security officials helped plan the attack on Israel.\n\nMeanwhile Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, praised the attacks on X, formerly Twitter, writing that the \"Zionist regime will be eradicated at the hands of the Palestinian people and the Resistance forces throughout the region.\"\n\nHow to get out of Israel\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Israel tried to provide information for anxious Americans in the country. A statement said the situation remains \"unpredictable\" and that people should follow the advice of local governments to increase security awareness and safety. The statement added that \"Mortar and rocket fire may take place without warning.\"\n\nU.S. citizens in Israel who need assistance were told to contact the closest U.S. embassy or consulate using the crisis intake form. Family members can also submit information on behalf of a U.S. citizen.\n\n\"U.S. citizens who wish to leave and can do so safely are advised to check the status of the border crossings or verify flights have not been canceled before heading to the Ben Gurion Airport,\" the statement said.\n\nU.S. citizens can find additional information regarding steps to take in case of mortar and rocket fire in the Country Information for Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza\n\nCory Booker leaves Israel after sheltering in place when attack began\n\nSen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., was in Israel when the attacks began Saturday. Booker, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, arrived Friday for meetings ahead of the Abraham Accords summit in Tel Aviv, where he was scheduled to speak Tuesday. Booker and his staff, in Jerusalem when Hamas launched their attacks, sheltered in place for safety, according to a statement from his office.\n\n\"We are grateful that Senator Booker and our colleagues were able to safely depart Israel earlier today,\" Maya Krishna-Rogers, Booker's spokesperson, said in a statement Sunday.\n\n− Candy Woodall\n\nIsrael conducts deadly counterstrikes\n\nIsrael carried out dozens of airstrikes in the southern Gaza town of Rafah overnight. One strike slammed into three homes in the crowded Shaboura refugee camp, killing 19 members of the same family, according to a family member who posted the names on his social media. The Associated Press reported that surviving family members and neighbors filled al-Farouk mosque and prayed over the bodies of those killed before marching to the nearby cemetery for burial, some carrying the bodies.\n\nIsraeli Defense Forces also said on social media that it struck two \"operational situation rooms\" located inside mosques used by Hamas in Gaza. The IDF also struck Hamas' intelligence headquarters, a military compound used by Hamas' aerial forces, and an aerial weapons production site. The IDF said it killed at least 400 Palestinian terrorists both in Israel and in strikes in Gaza.\n\nThe Gaza health ministry said 370 Palestinians have been killed and another 2,200 have been wounded in the Gaza Strip.\n\nIn Gaza, outrage at Israeli retaliation\n\nThe Palestinian media outlet Al Ayyam described what it called an \"Israeli massacre\" in Gaza.\n\nIt said the Ministry of Health in Gaza was appealing to citizens to go to hospitals and blood banks to donate blood for the more than 2,000 people reported wounded there. Many people were reported missing in Gaza, some of whom apparently died at a border crossing bombed by Israel after a large number of Palestinians arrived there, Al Ayyam reported.\n\nOthers were arrested by the occupation forces, the media outlet said.\n\nCelebs show solidarity for Israel\n\nGal Gadot, Kylie Jenner, Nina Dobrev, and more celebrities have shown solidarity for Israel amid the country's escalated conflict with Palestinian militants. \"I stand with Israel you should too.

But experts don’t expect a long-term impact on oil and gas prices unless the conflict itself escalates. The crisis is playing out in a major oil-producing region − neighboring Saudi Arabia is a leader in oil exports − but Israel and Palestine are not major oil producers.\n\nA gallon of regular gas costs $3.71, on average, in the United States, according to motor vehicle club AAA. Gas prices are down from this time last week, last month, and last year.\n\n“It’s a developing situation,” said Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at gas price tracker GasBuddy, speaking via email to USA TODAY. The conflict “isn’t too much a problem unless the fighting spreads to other countries that do produce a significant amount of oil, as has happened sometimes in the past.”\n\n- Daniel de Visé\n\nUS airlines cancel some flights to Israel\n\nMajor American airlines including Delta, United, and American have limited or canceled flights in and out of Ben Gurion International Airport outside of Tel Aviv. The Federal Aviation Administration asked pilots to be cautious while flying in Israeli airspace. United said in a statement to USA TODAY that flights to Tel Aviv will be suspended \"until conditions allow them to resume.\"\n\nIt’s not just airlines based in the United States that are canceling or delaying flights: Air France, Lufthansa, Emirates, Ryanair and Aegean Airlines also canceled flights. Swiss Airlines announced it has canceled all flights to and from Ben Gurion International Airport until Monday.\n\n“We fully understand the situation of the passengers affected by the flight cancellations. SWISS is closely monitoring the development of the situation and is in close contact with the authorities. Based on this, we will decide on the resumption of flights between Switzerland and Israel,” the airline said.\n\nThe American Airlines pilots' union directed its members in an email Sunday evening to refuse flights to Israel due to the ongoing conflict, The Associated Press reported.\n\n“It is not prudent or appropriate to knowingly put our flight crews and passengers in harm’s way by maintaining flights into a war zone,” Union president Ed Sicher said in the message.\n\n− Sarah Al-Arshani\n\nConflict dates to biblical times\n\nThe war comes from a dispute rooted in pre-biblical times. Though its borders have shifted over the years, Palestinian territories used to be what is now Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank.\n\nBoth Israeli Jews' and Palestinian Arabs’ history, culture, and identity are linked to the Palestinian territories and to the ancient city of Jerusalem, “one of the most bitterly contested cities on earth,” according to The Associated Press.\n\nBritain was given control of Palestine by the League of Nations in 1920, under an order called the British Mandate. In 1917, the British government signaled its support for the establishment of a Jewish state in Israel with the Balfour Declaration.

Religious holiday celebrations interrupted\n\nThe attack came on the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah, reviving memories of the 1973 war that began with a surprise attack on Yom Kippur.\n\nSimchat Torah, which means \"the joy of the Torah,\" is “supposed to be a day of rejoicing when Jews celebrate completing the end of the Torah cycle and beginning again,\" said Ruth Franklin, a Jewish writer and a finalist for the Sami Rohr Prize for Jewish Literature.\n\nSimchat Torah is part of the holiday Shemini Atzeret. In Israel, they are celebrated on the same day and often referred to interchangeably. For Jewish people outside Israel, Shemini Atzeret is usually a two-day celebration, with Simchat Torah occurring on the second day.\n\nAt one synagogue about 90 minutes north of the epicenter of the attacks, half the people celebrated and danced with the Torah while the other half arrived in their uniforms and left their neighborhoods to serve, said Yael Eckstein, president and CEO of the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews.\n\n- Jeanine Santucci and Krystal Nurse\n\nJewish communities on alert across the US\n\nJewish communities across the U.S. are on guard in the wake of the Israel-Gaza conflict as local institutions report a spike in antisemitic threats and concerns.\n\nThe FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued “public safety concern” bulletins to state and local law enforcement on Saturday when the conflict broke out and said they are monitoring domestic threats to the U.S., according to CNN.\n\nIn Utah, the Salt Lake City Police Department law on Sunday acknowledged \"unspecified threats\" targeting several Jewish community centers across the state, a local CBS station reported. Local law enforcement responded to at least three fake bomb threats made against synagogues and other institutions.\n\nLaw enforcement all over the country is increasing patrols as a safety precaution.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams told CNN that there are no specific or credible threats against the Jewish community in the city, which is home to the largest Jewish population outside Israel, but police are on alert.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the Jewish Federation of Greater Harrisburg issued a statement urging increased security and vigilance in the region. The organization said local police will be increasing law enforcement presence in the community.\n\nIn California, the Los Angeles Police Department said on Twitter that it would increase patrols as a result of the overseas conflict.\n\nFighting between Israel and Hamas has historically contributed to rises in antisemitic incidents in the country, according to a 2022 report by the Anti-Defamation League. There was a 148% increase of antisemitic attacks in the U.S. following a conflict between both parties in May 2021 as anti-Israel protests took place in several American cities.\n\n“While we have always seen a rise in antisemitic activity during periods of increased hostilities between Israel and terrorist groups, the violence we witnessed in America during the conflict last May was shocking,” said ADL CEO Jonathan A. Greenblatt in the report. “It seemed as if the working assumption was that if you were Jewish, you were blameworthy for what was happening half a world away.”\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/01/middleeast/israel-lapid-profile-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "A leader for all Israelis? Yair Lapid takes over as caretaker prime ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nJerusalem CNN —\n\nYair Lapid is used to being in the spotlight.\n\nThe son of a prominent family, Lapid has dabbled in acting, screenwriting, music and even amateur boxing, before becoming best known to the Israeli public as a journalist-turned-politician.\n\nNow Lapid will be entering his biggest spotlight yet – as Israel’s caretaker prime minister.\n\nLapid officially took over as caretaker prime minister on Friday after the country’s parliament, the Knesset, passed a bill to dissolve itself a day earlier.\n\nHe’s now preparing for elections, trying to keep former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from climbing back to power.\n\nA media celebrity\n\nDespite his brief acting foray, Lapid became a mainstay in Israelis’ living rooms through the news. After briefly working as a print journalist, he made his way on to television in the mid-1990s, hosting one of the biggest talk shows of the era.\n\nBut in 2012 Lapid changed course following in the footsteps of his journalist-turned politician father. He created a new political party, dubbed “Yesh Atid” (There is a Future) and positioned himself as the centrist voice of the middle-class Israeli, focusing on domestic issues. He promised to tackle housing costs, end exemptions from the military draft for the Ultra-Orthodox, and to legalize same-sex marriage.\n\n“What unites all of (our supporters) is that they said yes for hope and yes for mutual responsibility and yes to the fact that the truth is not being held in any side,” Lapid said at the time.\n\nA centrist for all\n\nIn his first campaign, Lapid tried to portray his party as one all Israelis could be part of, even unveiling his diplomatic platform from a settlement in the occupied West Bank. He supports an independent Palestinian state, but says East Jerusalem shouldn’t be its capital. He opposes new settlement construction but says large existing settlement blocs should always be a part of Israel.\n\n“Yair Lapid is the quintessential product of Tel Aviv, of Israel’s main secular city, its main business and culture center, center of nightlife and so on,” Anshel Pfeffer, a correspondent for Haaretz and The Economist, told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.\n\n“Many Israelis, including Israelis who were close to his centrist perhaps leaning leftward politics and views, including many of my colleagues in Israeli media, didn’t take him seriously. They thought he’s a performer, he’s a presenter, there’s no real substance there, this will be a passing phase.”\n\nBut Lapid’s party shocked the Israeli political establishment by winning 19 seats in the 2013 elections, second only to Netanyahu’s Likud party. Lapid was dubbed Israel’s new political star, and Time Magazine named him as one of 2013’s “100 Most Influential People.”\n\nHe joined then-Prime Minister Netanyahu’s government as finance minister but was fired within less than two years and became one of the opposition’s top voices.\n\nThe most diverse coalition\n\nIn 2021 after four inconclusive elections in two years, it was Lapid who was the architect of the coalition that would ultimately oust Netanyahu and end his run as Israel’s longest-serving prime minister.\n\nPulling together parties from across the political spectrum, from the far left to those on the right, and even including the first Arab party in to sit in a governing coalition – the new government held a one-seat majority.\n\nBut it came at a cost to Lapid’s own political ambitions. As part of the deal to bring the right-winger Naftali Bennett on board as prime minister, Lapid would only take over after two years.\n\n“Lapid brought together this very unwieldy, almost unimaginable, unprecedented coalition of eight parties (and) managed to get them all to vote for Naftali Bennett as prime minister, managed to maintain them for an entire year, and above all for many Israelis he is now the only man in the last 12 years to beat Netanyahu – that by itself is a big achievement,” Pfeffer said.\n\nLapid was appointed foreign minister, where he traversed the globe meeting with world leaders and, notably, Israel’s new Arab-state allies. It was Lapid who hosted the historic Negev summit, where the top diplomatic representatives from the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco, Egypt and the United States met in southern Israel for the first time in March 2022.\n\nBut ultimately it was the coalition’s ideological diversity that was also the source of its fragility. It lost its parliamentary majority when two members of Bennett’s own right-wing party defected. And when some left-leaning members refused to support a recurring bill that among other things, gives Israeli settlers in the West Bank the same civil rights as citizens in Israel, the coalition reached a political impasse.\n\nIn a shock move, Lapid and Bennett announced last week they would dissolve their own government and trigger new elections, making Lapid interim prime minister.\n\nStanding together in a show of solidarity, Lapid told Bennett “I love you,” a moment of outward bromance that surprised many in the Israeli media.\n\nLapid will be the first non-right-wing prime minister of Israel in more than a decade. He now has four months to convince the public he should keep the job. Elections will be held on November 1.\n\nThe digest\n\nUnilever sells Ben & Jerry’s Israel business after controversy\n\nUnilever has sold its Ben & Jerry’s business in Israel for an undisclosed amount to American Quality Products (AQP), which distributes Ben & Jerry’s in the country, following the controversy related to its activities in Israel and the West Bank. Critics took the company to task for doing business in Israel – especially in West Bank settlements, considered illegal under international law – arguing it doesn’t align with Ben & Jerry’s liberal image. Ben & Jerry’s will now be sold under its Hebrew and Arabic names throughout Israel and the West Bank\n\nBackground: Unilever said Wednesday that it “has used the opportunity of the past year to listen to perspectives on this complex and sensitive matter and believes this is the best outcome for Ben & Jerry’s in Israel.” The ice cream company, however, tweeted that it doesn’t agree with Unilever’s announcement. “We continue to believe it is inconsistent with Ben & Jerry’s values for our ice cream to be sold in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,” it tweeted, adding it will no longer profit from Ben & Jerry’s in Israel.\n\nWhy it matters: The sale ends a long saga that had angered ice cream fans on every side of the Israel-Palestine conflict, but it also highlights the challenges facing consumer brands doing business in the region.\n\nEgyptian court sentences to death man accused of killing a 21-year-old student\n\nA man accused of fatally stabbing a woman last week after she rejected his advances was sentenced to death by a state court in Egypt, according to state-run Al Ahram on Tuesday.\n\nBackground: The verdict, issued after two court sessions, will be deferred to Egypt’s top Islamic authority, the Grand Mufti – a formality in death penalty cases in the country, Al-Ahram said. The final verdict will be announced on July 6. The sentence can still be appealed in Egypt’s court of cassation, as per Egyptian law.\n\nWhy it matters: The killing of the woman, Naira Ashraf, in broad daylight was caught on film and left the Arab world in shock as activists called for justice and more protection for women.\n\nErdogan says Sweden has promised to extradite 73 people as part of NATO deal\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Sweden promised to extradite 73 people to Turkey as a result of the memorandum that was signed at the NATO summit in Madrid between Sweden, Finland and Turkey. In signing the agreement, Turkey has agreed to support Finland and Sweden’s NATO membership bids, removing the last major hurdle to the two countries joining the alliance. “If the promise is not kept, we will do what is necessary in the agreement,” Erdogan said at a news conference on Thursday, adding that Turkey would not ratify the agreement.\n\nBackground: Turkey previously said it would veto Sweden and Finland’s NATO membership bids claiming they harbor members of Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which Turkey, the EU and the US recognize as a terror organization. The 10-article memorandum says Sweden and Finland will address Turkey’s pending extradition requests of terror suspects in accordance with the European Convention on Extradition.\n\nWhy it matters: Sweden and Finland formally ending decades of neutrality and joining NATO would be a historic breakthrough for the alliance, and deal a blow to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAround the region\n\nA view of Saint Hilarion, another archaeological site in the Gaza Strip, on June 8. The site of Saint Hilarion is also being supported by French NGO Premiere Urgence Internationale Mahmud Hams/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAn ancient tomb dating as far back as 2,400 years to the Roman era has been unearthed by archeologists in the Gaza Strip, showcasing the coastal enclave’s rich history.\n\nSituated on the coast of northern Gaza, the tomb is a momentous find for the Palestinians living in the territory.\n\nThe tomb is part of a larger Roman cemetery that was discovered by accident earlier this year, said Jehad Abu Hassan, the Gaza Strip field coordinator for Premiere Urgence Internationale, a French NGO that is involved in helping to preserve Gaza’s heritage. “This is the first time a Roman cemetery has been found in Gaza.” The NGO has also supported work at another archeological site in central Gaza called Saint Hilarion.\n\nIt’s not uncommon for relics to be excavated in this region due to its historical geographic significance, which meant various civilizations moved through the area over the centuries.\n\nThe tomb is part of an ongoing archeological dig that has been in progress for months, where Abu Hassan says 40 graves have been found.\n\n“It’s great that we protect and keep this rich heritage of Gaza for future generations,” he told CNN. “When we talk to children about their heritage they are very happy to see that people were coming from everywhere [to Gaza].”\n\nThe tombs stand out due to the social standing of those people they belonged to, according to a Palestinian official in Gaza.\n\n“Some of the graves were decorated with elegant decorations,” said Mohammed Khalla, undersecretary for Gaza’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities, speaking to Quds Press news agency. “Which indicates they belonged to figures who had a social and administrative status in Roman society at the time.”\n\nThe ministry said it is in the process of securing the necessary funding to preserve the site, according to Quds Press.\n\nInterest in protecting the tomb arises from its location near the Anthedon (Blakhiyah) harbor, Gaza’s first port and a landmark that played a crucial role in connecting the territory to Europe thousands of years ago.\n\nBy Ghazi Nasser\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Hadas Gold"], "publish_date": "2022/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2023/10/11/israel-war-hamas-gaza-live-updates/71139748007/", "title": "Israel war news updates: US death toll rises; did Egypt give warning?", "text": "The American death toll rose to 22 and Israeli fatalities surpassed 1,200 Wednesday while desperation swept across Gaza as Tel Aviv's response to the brutal attack by Hamas left neighborhoods destroyed, homes dark and hospitals low on medical supplies.\n\nThursday's live updates: US backs Israel amid strikes in Gaza, Blinken says\n\n\"At this time, we can confirm the deaths of at least 22 U.S. citizens,\" the State Department said in a statement. \"We extend our deepest condolences to the victims and to the families of all those affected.\" In addition, 17 Americans remain unaccounted for, the White House said.\n\nIsraeli soldiers retaking communities near the Gaza border encountered streets littered with the bodies of civilians, including women and children.

Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas who's the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the Hamas onslaught Saturday likely resulted from a \"failure of intelligence'' and that it was uncertain how both the U.S. and Israel were caught by surprise.\n\n“We know that Egypt had warned the Israelis three days prior that an event like this could happen,” McCaul told reporters. \"We know that this had been planned perhaps as long as a year ago.''\n\nMcCaul added that \"a warning was given,'' but it wasn't clear at what level of government.\n\nNetanyahu has denied having prior knowledge of the attack, calling those reports \"absolutely false.\" Other reports indicate the information may have been passed along but never reached his desk because it lacked details.\n\nMcCaul said the focus now is on keeping the conflict from expanding with the involvement of other militant groups in the region.\n\n\"We're very concerned about the fidelity of our intelligence and the escalation of a conflict in the Middle East that could turn into a global Jihad movement in Israel,'' he said.\n\nUS casting wide net in search for missing Americans\n\nIn addition to the 22 Americans killed, 17 Americans are still missing in Israel following the Hamas attack, the White House said Wednesday – and the figures could rise further.\n\n\"I think we all need to steel ourselves for the very distinct possibility that these numbers will keep increasing,\" said John Kirby, a White House spokesman on national security matters. \"We might find out that more Americans are part of the hostage pool.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. knows some of the Americans − a \"very small\" number − are being held hostage by Hamas but does not know their condition or location. He said the administration is doing \"everything we can\" to locate them and bring them home.\n\n\"We don't know if they're all in one group or broken up into several groups. We don't know if they're being moved and with what frequency and to what locations,\" Kirby said. “Tough to get more detail.\"\n\nKirby said the U.S. is \"casting the net wide\" on hostage-recovery efforts, citing discussions with the Israeli government, other Middle East allies and countries such as Qatar that \"that have open lines of communication with Hamas.\"\n\nThe rising death toll is eight more than the 14 Americans who were confirmed dead Tuesday. The number of unaccounted Americans decreased from 20 to 17.\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nSecond US aircraft carrier heading to Mediterranean\n\nA second U.S. aircraft carrier will be sent to the Mediterranean Sea and will be ready to help defend Israel if needed.\n\nThe USS Dwight D. Eisenhower and its strike group will be leaving in the coming week on a long-scheduled deployment to the European Command Area, Kirby said Wednesday. \"She will be deployed into the Mediterranean and will be an available asset as well as her escort vessels,'' he said.\n\nKirby pointed out no decision has been made on whether the warship will join the USS Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier off the coast of Israel, where it was deployed shortly after the Hamas attack. But the combination gives the U.S. a powerful presence in those waters.\n\n\"We’re sending a loud and clear message that the United States is ready to take action should any actor hostile towards Israel consider trying to escalate or widen this war,\" Kirby said.\n\nIsrael announces bipartisan war Cabinet: 'Israel first of all'\n\nThe Israeli government established a bipartisan war Cabinet to focus on war issues. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be joined by a leading opposition figure, former Defense Minister Benny Gantz and current Defense Minister Yoav Gallant.\n\n\"Israel first of all,\" Gantz tweeted.\n\nHamas has said it kidnapped more than 100 Israeli soldiers, men, women, children and older adults and are holding them in Gaza. The Israel government, under intense public pressure to eradicate Hamas, has mobilized 360,000 reservists and could be preparing to launch a ground offensive into Gaza, possibly within days.\n\nEU will continue to financially support Palestinians\n\nEU foreign ministers, meeting in a teleconference, agreed overwhelmingly to continue financial support for Palestinians, said Josep Borrell, High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. Borrell cited a \"clear distinction\" between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority, which controls the smaller West Bank enclave. Hamas is a terrorist organization while the Palestinian Authority is an EU partner, he said.\n\n\"Not all the Palestinian people are terrorists,\" Borrell said. \"So a collective punishment against all Palestinians will be unfair and unproductive. It will be against our interests and the interest of the peace.\"\n\nThe ministers also reiterated a long-term commitment to a political solution based on creation of a free Palestinian state. Israel has balked at any plan that would allow Palestinians to have their own military.\n\nEU warns Musk to halt war 'disinformation' on X\n\nThe European Commission warned Elon Musk that X, formerly known as Twitter, could face penalties if it does not take action against \"illegal content and disinformation\" since Hamas' attack on Israel. A letter from Thierry Breton, European commissioner for the internal market, said the company may be non-compliant of \"very precise obligations regarding content moderation\" in Europe's new social media laws. The company could be fined up to 6% of its global revenue under EU rules.\n\nIn response to the letter, Musk wrote on X: \"Our policy is that everything is open source and transparent, an approach that I know the EU supports. Please list the violations you allude to on 𝕏, so that that the public can see them.\"\n\nBreton replied: \"You are well aware of your users’ − and authorities’ − reports on fake content and glorification of violence.

Nahar Neta, whose mother is missing, would like a word too.\n\nNeta said he has reached out to U.S. embassy officials in Tel Aviv but has had no new information or contact since he believes his mother, dual Israeli-American citizen Adrienne Neta, 66, was abducted from her home in Kibbutz Be’eri on Saturday morning. He's hoping Blinken can provide updates on his mother and the 16 other Americans who remain unaccounted for.\n\nNeta said he was on the phone with Adrienne when Hamas fighters stormed in. \"We heard a lot of shouting and screaming, but no shots were fired and it’s our belief she was taken,” he said.\n\nHe took an immediate flight to Israel and arrived Monday. Now he awaits Blinken.\n\n“I expect the administration and secretary of state to act as responsible for the lives of the American citizens held hostage by Hamas,” Neta said.\n\n− Nick Penzenstadler\n\nGaza communities devastated by 'belts of fire'\n\nIsraeli aircraft and artillery are pounding Gaza towns with what Palestinians are calling \"belts of fire.\" The term refers to intense, successive raids launched against a small target in a short period of time, the Palestinian daily Al-Ayyam reports. The raids began at dawn Wednesday and continued into the day, targeting farmland, police stations, government buildings, factories and other crucial locations, the online outlet reported. Emergency vehicles have been unable to reach some of the battered areas because of the intensity of the raids.\n\nWho is Hamas leader Mohammed Deif?\n\nIsraeli airstrikes late Tuesday struck the family house of Mohammed Deif, the leader of Hamas’ military wing, killing his father, brother and at least two other relatives in the southern town of Khan Younis, senior Hamas official Bassem Naim said. Deif has not been seen in public and Israeli authorities say they don't know where he is.\n\nOnline hate heats up as war intensifies\n\nGroups that study online hate speech say it has spiked in recent days – not just for Jewish communities but also for Palestinians. And representatives of both communities agree on one thing: U.S.-based social media companies are still not doing anywhere near enough to rid their platforms of hate against targeted groups.\n\n“When it comes to serious crises like these where you're going to see the worst of the worst types of violent content, gore, incitement to violence, it's really incumbent on social media companies to coordinate across platforms,” said Daniel Kelley, director of strategy and operations at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center for Tech and Society, “in order to make sure that the platforms play the minimal amount of role possible in inflaming further violence.” Read more here.\n\n− Will Carless and Jessica Guynn\n\nSome colleges pull students from study abroad programs\n\nUSA TODAY reached out to more than two dozen colleges, many with a history of having a presence in Israel or large study abroad programs, to ask how their programs have been affected by the unfolding crisis.\n\nSome schools confirmed students have safely left the area. Others said students and staff remained in the region while their institutions monitor the situation and put in place new safety protocols. A small number of schools reported that by chance this semester they have no students and faculty studying in Israel.

The struggle to come home – and the fear for loved ones left behind in the deadly war zones of Gaza and Israel – is very real for many Americans as the world watches the violence abroad unfold.\n\nThe U.S. citizens longing to return to America include several people from church groups, including those in Naples, Florida, visiting Jerusalem for religious reasons, Salt Lake City-based Palestinian-Americans visiting family members and New Jersey Jewish residents who were celebrating the Simchat Torah holiday.

On Saturday, about 1,000 Hamas fighters stormed across the Israeli border by land and sea in an attack that caught Israel's military off-guard.\n\nHamas says the assault was a response to activity at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound in Jerusalem that is the third holiest site in Islam. The site, which is also located on the holiest site for Jews − who refer to it as the Temple Mount − has long been a flashpoint between Israelis and Palestinians. Israeli security services routinely raid the compound.\n\nBut Hamas leaders also say they were pushed to attack because of unrelenting Israeli crackdowns on militants in the West Bank, continued construction of settlements − which the international community considers illegal − thousands of prisoners being held in Israeli jails and Israel's blockade of Gaza.\n\nIsrael countered by declaring war against Hamas and ordered its military to undertake take a \"complete siege\" of Gaza.\n\nOnline hate surges:Why everyone is blaming social media.\n\nWhat is Hamas?\n\nHamas – an acronym for Harakat al-Muqawama al-Islamiya, or the Islamic resistance movement – was founded in 1987 during the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by a Palestinian activist connected to the Muslim Brotherhood. The State Department designated Hamas a terrorist group in 1997. Several other nations also consider it a terrorist organization.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that still governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since. The group calls for establishment of an Islamic Palestinian state that would replace the current state of Israel and believes in the use of violence to carry out the destruction of Israel.\n\nHamas receives financial, material and logistical support from Iran, though so far, international leaders, including in Israel, have said there is no evidence that Iran was directly involved in Hamas’ attack.\n\nHow large is the Gaza Strip?\n\nGaza, or the Gaza Strip, is a densely populated Palestinian exclave of about 2.3 million people. The narrow strip of land − about 150 square miles, or less than half the size of New York City − is about 25 miles long and six miles wide. Gaza shares a northern and eastern border with Israel and a southwestern border with Egypt while its western side abuts the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nWho controls the Gaza Strip?\n\nHamas won the 2006 parliamentary elections and in 2007 seized control of the Gaza Strip from the internationally recognized Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian Authority, controlled by the rival Fatah movement, administers semi-autonomous areas of the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Hamas has fought four wars against Israel since taking power.\n\nHow did the hostilities between Israel and Palestinians start?\n\nThe current war is a culmination of decades of conflict between Israel, which prides itself on its military prowess, and the Palestinian territory, which has been occupied since 1948 when Israel was founded and where Hamas rules the Gaza Strip.\n\nAt the center of the conflict: Who has the right to the land? Both Jewish people and Muslims have some of their holiest sites in Jerusalem.\n\nBefore Israel’s founding, the land was known as the Palestinian mandate, officially ruled by Great Britain. In 1947, the United Nations adopted a resolution that aimed to divide the Palestinian mandate into two states, Arab and Jewish. Large-scale migration of Jewish people to escape persecution, including by Nazis, prompted the U.N. solution.\n\nA war between Israel and its Arab neighbors surrounding its founding in 1948 led to Israeli expansion into 77% of Palestinian mandate territory, and over half the Palestinian Arab population fled or was expelled, according to the U.N.\n\nSeveral conflicts between Israel and Arab states in the region followed over the next decades, and peace efforts that improved relations with other nations did not solve the issue of Palestinian self-determination.\n\nIsrael captured the Gaza Strip, east Jerusalem and the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war and has since imposed restrictions on the freedom of movement of Palestinians there. These are all territories sought by Palestinians for their future independent state. The war also led to a second expulsion of Palestinians, according to the U.N.\n\nHamas rejects proposals for a two-state solution and believes in the eradication of Israel altogether through violent means.\n\nPalestinian uprisings, or intifadas, brought military clashes and protests against Israeli occupation beginning in 1987 and led to crackdowns by Israel’s military forces, and many were killed and injured on both sides.\n\nIn 2006, Hamas won parliamentary elections, and in 2007 the group violently seized control of the Gaza Strip from the Palestinian Authority, which was controlled by the rival Fatah movement that governs the West Bank. There have been no elections since.\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci, Maureen Groppe, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/05/06/naacp-demands-change-after-racist-counter-protest-at-ole-miss/73584206007/", "title": "NAACP leaders at Ole Miss call for expulsion of 3 counter protestors ...", "text": "OXFORD — The NAACP chapter at the University of Mississippi called for the expulsion of three students who were among the many counter protesters at a Thursday rally protesting Israel's war in Gaza.\n\nMore than 150 attendees listened at a packed and emotional town hall Monday night as campus NAACP leadership spoke out against racist actions from some counter protesters during last week's pro-Palestine protest. Ole Miss leaders have called some of the counter protest actions \"hurtful\" and \"offensive\" and have announced an investigation into the incident, where items and threats were also hurled at some of the protesters.\n\nOne counter protester has drawn national notoriety for appearing to mimic a monkey when countering a Black Mississippi student. That counter protester was removed from his fraternity on Friday.\n\n\"For the events last week to become national news is very disheartening,\" UM NAACP Vice President Justice Rose said of the behavior seen by counter protesters last week. \"It's unfortunate, because those ideals really do live here in campus.

A student journalist who covered the protest, Stacey Spiehler, said she watched as counter protesters screamed and jeered as they followed the smaller group into the building.\n\n\"I like to attend sports games, and so I've seen happy mobs and I've seen celebratory mobs,\" Spiehler said. \"I have never in my life seen a mob of people who were just so angry at the protesters, and obviously the protesters are super angry as well.\"\n\nSpiehler also said many counter protesters were also pushing America First and other political stances from Republican public figures throughout the country.\n\nOne Black student protester, Jaylin R. Smith, was recorded by Spiehler being mocked by another student, James Staples, who was imitating a monkey and making sounds at her. Others, according to Davis, also compared her appearance to famous popstar Lizzo, but in a derogatory fashion. Staples was later kicked out of his fraternity.\n\n\"Phi Delta Theta General Headquarters is aware of the video regarding the student protest at the University of Mississippi,\" a statement read. \"The racist actions in the video were those of an individual and are antithetical to the values of Phi Delta Theta and the Mississippi Alpha chapter.

Behaviors and comments that demean people because of their race or ethnicity marginalize them and undermine the values that are fundamental to a civil and safe society.\"\n\nThe NAACP identified three counter protesters who it alleged were antagonizing protesters.

Crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack, crack.\n\nThe cameraman filming the scene scrambles backwards to take cover behind a low concrete wall. Then a man cries out in Arabic: “Injured! Shireen, Shireen, oh man, Shireen! Ambulance!”\n\nWhen the camera operator pans around the corner, Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh can be seen lying motionless, face down on the ground as another Palestinian reporter, Shatha Hanaysha, crouches down beside her, using a tree trunk for cover. Hanaysha reaches out and tries to rouse her as gunshots continue. There’s no response. Both women are wearing helmets and blue protective vests marked “Press.”\n\nIn the moments that follow, a man in a white T-shirt makes several attempts to move Abu Akleh, but is forced back repeatedly by gunfire. Finally, after a few long minutes, he manages to drag her body from the street.\n\nThe shaky video, filmed by Al Jazeera cameraman Majdi Banura, captures the scene when Abu Akleh, a 51-year-old Palestinian-American was killed by a bullet to the head at around 6:30 a.m. on May 11. She had been standing with a group of journalists near the entrance of Jenin refugee camp, where they had come to cover an Israeli raid. While the footage does not show Abu Akleh being shot, eyewitnesses told CNN that they believe Israeli forces on the same street fired deliberately on the reporters in a targeted attack. All of the journalists were wearing protective blue vests that identified them as members of the news media. ​\n\n“We stood in front of the Israeli military vehicles for about five to ten minutes before we made moves to ensure they saw us. And this is a habit of ours as journalists, we move as a group and we stand in front of them so they know we are journalists, and then we start moving,” Hanaysha told CNN, describing their cautious approach toward the Israeli army convoy, before the gunfire began.\n\nWhen Abu Akleh was shot, Hanaysha said she was in shock. She couldn’t understand what was happening. After Abu Akleh dropped to the ground, Hanaysha thought she might have stumbled. But when she looked down at the reporter she had idolized since childhood, it was clear she wasn’t breathing. Blood was pooling under her head.\n\n“As soon as she [Shireen] fell, I honestly wasn’t comprehending that she [was shot] … I was hearing the sound of bullets, but I wasn’t comprehending that they were coming at us. Honestly, the whole time I wasn’t understanding,” she said.\n\n“I thought they were shooting so we stayed back, I didn’t think they were trying to kill us.”\n\nOn the day of the shooting, Israeli military spokesperson Ran Kochav told Army Radio that Abu Akleh had been “filming and working for a media outlet amidst armed Palestinians. They’re armed with cameras, if you’ll permit me to say so,” according to The Times of Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military says it is not clear who fired the fatal shot. In a preliminary inquiry, the army said there was a possibility Abu Akleh was hit either by indiscriminate Palestinian gunfire, or by an Israeli sniper positioned about 200 meters (about 656 feet) away in an exchange of fire with Palestinian gunmen — though neither Israel nor anyone else has provided evidence showing armed Palestinians within a clear line of fire from Abu Akleh.\n\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said on May 19 that it had not yet decided whether to pursue a criminal investigation into Abu Akleh’s death. On Monday, the Israeli military’s top lawyer, Major General Yifat Tomer-Yerushalmi, said in a speech that under the military’s policy, a criminal investigation is not automatically launched if a person is killed in the “midst of an active combat zone,” unless there is credible and immediate suspicion of a criminal offense. United States lawmakers, the United Nations and ​the international community ​have all called for an independent probe.\n\nBut an investigation by CNN offers new evidence — including two videos of the scene of the shooting — that there was no active combat, nor any Palestinian militants, near Abu Akleh in the moments leading up to her death. Videos obtained by CNN, corroborated by testimony from eight eyewitnesses, an audio forensic analyst and an explosive weapons expert, suggest that Abu Akleh was shot dead in a targeted attack by Israeli forces.\n\nAl Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Facebook/Shireen Abu Akleh\n\nThe footage shows a calm scene before the reporters came under fire in the outskirts of Jenin refugee camp, near the main Awdeh roundabout. Hanaysha, four other journalists and three local residents said that it had been a normal morning in Jenin, home to about 345,000 people — 11,400 of whom live in the camp. Many were on their way to work or school, and the street was relatively quiet.\n\nThere was a frisson of excitement as the veteran journalist, a household name across the Arab world for her coverage of Israel and the Palestinian territories, arrived to report on the raid. About a dozen or so men, some dressed in sweats and flip-flops, had gathered to watch Abu Akleh and her colleagues at work. They were milling around chatting, some smoking cigarettes, others filming the scene on their phones.\n\nIn one 16-minute cellphone video shared with CNN, the man filming walks toward the spot where the journalists had gathered, zooming in on the Israeli armored vehicles parked in the distance, and says: “Look at the snipers.” Then, when a teenager peers tentatively up the street, he shouts: “Don’t kid around … you think it’s a joke? We don’t want to die. We want to live.”\n\nIsraeli raids on the Jenin refugee camp have become a regular occurrence since early April, in the wake of several attacks by Palestinians that left Israelis and foreigners dead. Some of the suspected assailants of those attacks were from Jenin, according to the Israeli military. Residents say the raids often lead to injuries and deaths. On Saturday, a 17-year-old Palestinian was killed and an 18-year-old was critically injured by Israeli fire during a raid, the Palestinian Ministry of Health said.\n\nSalim Awad, the 27-year-old Jenin camp resident who filmed the 16-minute video, told CNN that there were no armed Palestinians or any clashes in the area, and he hadn’t expected there to be gunfire, given the presence of journalists nearby.\n\n“There was no conflict or confrontations at all. We were about 10 guys, give or take, walking around, laughing and joking with the journalists,” he said. “We were not afraid of anything. We didn’t expect anything would happen, because when we saw journalists around, we thought it’d be a safe area.”\n\nBut the situation changed rapidly. Awad said shooting broke out about seven minutes after he arrived at the scene. His video captures the moment that shots were fired at the four journalists — Abu Akleh, Hanaysha, another Palestinian journalist, Mujahid al-Saadi, and Al Jazeera producer Ali al-Samoudi, who was injured in the gunfire — as they walked toward the Israeli vehicles. In the footage, Abu Akleh can be seen turning away from the barrage. The footage shows a direct line of sight towards the Israeli convoy.\n\nPalestinian journalist Shatha Hanaysha pictured in the West Bank city of Ramallah on May 12, a day after she and Abu Akleh came under fire. Issam Rimawi/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\n“We saw around four or five military vehicles on that street with rifles sticking out of them and one of them shot Shireen. We were standing right there, we saw it. When we tried to approach her, they shot at us. I tried to cross the street to help, but I couldn’t,” Awad said, adding that he saw that a bullet struck Abu Akleh in the gap between her helmet and protective vest, just by her ear.\n\nA 16-year-old, who was among the group of men and boys on the street, told CNN that there were “no shots fired, no stone throwing, nothing,” before Abu Akleh was shot. He said that the journalists had told them not to follow as they walked toward Israeli forces, so he stayed back. When the gunfire broke out, he said he ducked behind a car on the road, three meters away, where he watched the moment she was killed. The teenager shared a video with CNN, filmed at 6:36 a.m., just after the journalists left the scene for the hospital, which showed the five Israeli army vehicles driving slowly past the spot where Abu Akleh died. The convoy then turns left before leaving the camp via the roundabout.\n\nCNN reviewed a total of 11 videos showing the scene and the Israeli military convoy from different angles — before, during and after Abu Akleh was killed. Eyewitnesses who were filming when the journalist was shot were also in the line of fire and pulled back when the gunfire started, so do not capture the moment she is hit with the bullet. ​\n\nThe visual evidence reviewed by CNN includes a body camera video released by the Israeli military, which captures soldiers running through a narrow alleyway, holding M16 assault rifles, and variants, as they spill out onto the street where the armored vehicles are parked. An Israeli military source told CNN that both sides were firing M16 and M4 style assault rifles that day.\n\nIn the videos, five Israeli vehicles can be seen lined up in a row on the same road where Abu Akleh was killed, to the south. The vehicle closest to the journalists, emblazoned with a white number one, and the vehicle furthest away, marked with the number five, are both positioned perpendicular across the street. Toward the rear of the vehicles, directly above the numbers, is a narrow rectangular opening in the exterior of the vehicle.\n\nThe Israeli military referenced such an opening in a statement about its initial investigation into Abu Akleh’s shooting, saying that the journalist may have been hit by an Israeli soldier shooting from a “designated firing hole in an IDF vehicle using a telescopic scope,” during an exchange of fire. Several eyewitnesses told CNN that they saw sniper rifles sticking out of the openings before the shooting began, but that it was not preceded by any other gunfire.\n\nJamal Huwail, a professor at the Arab American University in Jenin, who helped drag Abu Akleh’s lifeless body from the road, said he believed the shots were coming from one of the Israeli vehicles, which he described as a “new model which had an opening for snipers,” because of the elevation and direction of the bullets.\n\n“They were shooting directly at the journalists,” Huwail said.\n\nHuwail, a former parliamentarian and member of the Palestinian Fatah Party in Jenin, first met Abu Akleh two decades ago, when Israel launched a major military operation in the camp, destroying more than 400 homes and displacing a quarter of its population. When he spoke with the journalist briefly that morning of May 11 at the Awdeh roundabout, she had showed him a video of one of their early interviews from 2002. The next time he saw her up close, she was dead.\n\nShireen Abu Akleh lies face down in the street, after having been shot in the head. from Al Jazeera\n\nIn videos of the dawn army raid on Jenin camp earlier in the morning, Israeli soldiers and Palestinian militants can be seen battling each other with M16 assault rifles and variants, according to Chris Cobb-Smith, an explosive weapons expert. That means both sides would have been shooting 5.56-millimeter bullets. To trace the bullet that killed Abu Akleh to the barrel of a specific gun would likely require a joint Israeli-Palestinian probe, since the Palestinians have the bullet that killed Abu Akleh, while CNN’s investigation suggests the Israelis have the gun. None is immediately forthcoming. While Israel weighs whether to launch a criminal investigation, the Palestinian Authority has ruled out collaborating with the Israelis on any investigation.\n\nA senior Israeli security official flatly denied to CNN on May 18 that Israeli troops killed Abu Akleh intentionally. The official spoke under the condition of anonymity to discuss details about an investigation that remains formally open.\n\n“In no way would the IDF ever target a civilian, especially a member of the press,” the official told CNN.\n\n“An IDF soldier would never fire an M16 on automatic. They shoot bullet by bullet,” the official said, in contrast with ​Israel’s assertion that Palestinian militants were firing “recklessly and indiscriminately” while its soldiers conducted the raid in Jenin.\n\nIn a statement emailed to CNN, the IDF said it was conducting an investigation into the killing of Abu Akleh. It “calls on the Palestinian Authority to cooperate with a joint forensic examination with American representatives to conclusively determine the source of the tragic death.”\n\nAnd added, “assertions regarding the source of the fire that killed Ms. Abu Akleh must be carefully made and backed by hard evidence. This is what the IDF is striving to achieve.”\n\nEven without access to the bullet that hit Abu Akleh, there are ways to determine who killed Abu Akleh by analyzing the type of gunfire, the sound of the shots and the marks left by the bullets at the scene.\n\nCobb-Smith, a security consultant and British army veteran, told CNN he believed Abu Akleh was killed in discrete shots — not a burst of automatic gunfire. To reach that conclusion, he looked at imagery obtained by CNN, which show markings the bullets left on the tree where Abu Akleh fell and Hanaysha was taking cover.\n\n“The number of strike marks on the tree where Shireen was standing proves this wasn’t a random shot, she was targeted,” Cobb-Smith told CNN, adding that, in sharp contrast, the majority of gunfire from Palestinians captured on camera that day were “random sprays.”\n\nPalestinian journalist Mujahid al-Saadi, who was with Abu Akleh when she was killed, points to bullet marks on the tree in Jenin where she died. Nedal Eshtayah/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images\n\nAs evidence, he pointed to two videos that showed Palestinian gunmen firing haphazardly down alleyways in different parts of Jenin. The videos were circulated by the office of Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, and Israel’s foreign ministry, with a voiceover in Arabic saying: “They’ve hit one — they’ve hit a soldier. He’s lying on the ground.”\n\nBecause no Israeli soldiers were reported killed on May 11, Bennett’s office said the video suggested that “Palestinian terrorists were the ones who shot the journalist.” CNN geolocated the videos shared by Bennett’s office to the south of the camp, more than 300 meters, or 1,000 feet, away from Abu Akleh. The coordinates of the two locations, which were verified using Mapillary, a crowdsourced street imagery platform, and footage of the area filmed by Israeli human rights group B’Tselem, demonstrate that the shooting in the videos couldn’t be the same volley of gunfire that hit Abu Akleh and her producer, Ali al-Samoudi. CNN was also unable to verify independently when the footage was filmed.\n\nAccording to the Israeli army’s initial inquiry, at the time of Abu Akleh’s death, an Israeli sniper was 200 meters away from her. CNN asked Robert Maher, professor of electrical and computer engineering at Montana State University, who specializes in forensic audio analysis, to assess the footage of Abu Akleh’s shooting and estimate the distance between the gunman and the cameraman, taking into account the rifle being used by the Israeli forces.\n\nThe video that Maher analyzed captures two volleys of gunfire; eyewitnesses say Abu Akleh was hit in the second barrage, a series of seven sharp “cracks.” The first “crack” sound, the ballistic shockwave of the bullet, is followed approximately 309 milliseconds later by the relatively quiet “bang” of the muzzle blast, according to Maher. “That would correspond to a distance of something between 177 and 197 meters,” or 580 and 646 feet, he said in an email to CNN, which corresponds almost exactly with the Israeli sniper’s position.\n\nAt 200 meters, Cobb-Smith said that there was “no chance” that random firing would result in three or four shots hitting in such a tight configuration. “From the strike marks on the tree, it appears that the shots, one of which hit Shireen, came from down the street from the direction of the IDF troops. The relatively tight grouping of the rounds indicate Shireen was intentionally targeted with aimed shots and not the victim of random or stray fire,” the firearms expert told CNN.\n\nA Palestinian artist paints a mural in Gaza City honoring Shireen Abu Akleh, and depicting Shatha Hanaysha crouching beside her after she was killed.

The people here are very sad for her loss,” he said.\n\nLast month, Abu Akleh celebrated her birthday in Jenin, when she was there to cover an Israeli miltary raid, her longtime colleague, cameraman Majdi Banura, recalled. Banura and Abu Akleh started at Al Jazeera on the same day 25 years ago, and spent much of their careers out in the field together.\n\nBanura is still reeling from having seen Abu Akleh, whom he had filmed countless times before, die in front of his own eyes. But when the gunfire broke out, he knew he had to continue rolling, saying that it was important to have a “continuous record” of her killing.\n\n“To be honest, as I was filming, I had hoped that she will be alive, but I knew seeing her motionless she had been killed,” Banura said.\n\n“Her picture doesn’t leave my life and memory, everything I say or do or touch, I see her.”", "authors": ["Zeena Saifi Eliza Mackintosh Celine Alkhaldi Kareem Khadder Katie Polglase Gianluca Mezzofiore Abeer Salman Oscar Featherstone", "Zeena Saifi", "Eliza Mackintosh", "Celine Alkhaldi", "Kareem Khadder", "Katie Polglase", "Gianluca Mezzofiore", "Abeer Salman", "Oscar Featherstone"], "publish_date": "2022/05/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/07/2024-state-of-the-union-live-updates/72841823007/", "title": "State of the Union replay: Biden's fiery SOTU, Britt's response", "text": "President Joe Biden delivered his State of the Union address on Thursday, his last before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe president addressed a sweeping range of issues facing the nation and the world, from providing aid for Ukraine to expanding abortion rights. Overall, Biden told Americans from coast to coast that \"The state of our union is strong and getting stronger.”\n\nBut as the president seeks another term in office, he also repeatedly hit former President Donald Trump, whom he only referred to as his \"predecessor.\"\n\nSen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., delivered the Republican response to Biden's remarks after he wrapped up his speech, highlighting conservative priorities during a close election year.\n\nCatch up with the USA TODAY Network's coverage of the State of the Union.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTakeaways from Biden’s State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden called on Americans to look to \"the future\" and not return to the politics of his predecessor in a State of the Union address that served as the kickoff to a general election rematch against Donald Trump.\n\nHe began his address with an immediate attack on Trump by casting the fight ahead as one to preserve \"freedom and democracy\" − the central theme of his candidacy. Biden made restoring abortion rights a major theme of his speech, blaming Trump for the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022 by appointing three justices who tilted the court's conservative majority.\n\nHe also addressed challenges both at home and abroad, getting into a heated confrontation with Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., over the border and calling on Israel to “do its part” in sending humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\n-- Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden, Donald Trump troll each other during SOTU speech\n\nHe never mentioned Donald Trump by name. But President Joe Biden was quick to go after his “predecessor” and “the last administration” Thursday during the State of the Union address, hammering Trump on everything from Russia policy to abortion, taxes and the Jan. 6, 2021 storming of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nTrump started jabbing Biden hours before he entered the House chamber, where he delivered his speech. Trump complained about Biden being late when the event didn’t start on time and kept up his “Play by Play” throughout much of the speech.\n\nFor instance, at one point in the speech, Biden accused Trump of trying to “bury the truth about Jan. 6” to which Trump defended Jan. 6 participants on Truth Social and repeated unfounded claims of election fraud.\n\n-- Zac Anderson and Michael Collins\n\n‘Remember Abbey Gate’ man yelling interrupts SOTU speech\n\nApproximately one hour into the speech, in which Joe Biden drew sharp contrasts between himself and the Republican Party, a person began shouting causing the President to pause briefly. “Remember Abbey Gate! US Marines!” the protester shouted.\n\nAbbey Gate is a reference to a 2021 suicide bombing during the evacuation of Afghanistan.\n\nThe protester was handcuffed and arrested after being escorted out by security from the House gallery as seen in a photo shared with USA TODAY.\n\n-- James Powel, Jeanine Santucci, Tom Vanden Brook, Ken Tran\n\nHouse Republican: Joe Biden's energy was 'high' despite age\n\nRep. Ryan Zinke, R-Mont., said he was impressed by Joe Biden's energy on Thursday night, despite his age. The Montana lawmaker remarked that the president's energy was notably \"high.\"\n\nZinke's reaction to his address is a stark contrast to Republicans who have repeatedly attacked Biden, 81, over his age. Prior to Biden's address, several House Republicans joked they wanted to see a \"coherent\" message from the president.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n'We want families to grow'\n\nKatie Britt addressed a number of conservative priorities on Thursday, from addressing inflation to curbing TikTok.\n\nBut the Alabama lawmaker also discussed IVF in the wake of her home state's Supreme Court decision earlier this year.\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruled last month that frozen embryos are children and that people can be held legally responsible if they are destroyed. The decision rocked families and medical providers across the country.\n\n\"We want families to grow\" Britt said of herself and her Republican colleagues. \"It's why we strongly support continued, nationwide access to invitro fertilization. We want to help loving moms and dads bring precious life into this world.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nKatie Britt zeroes in on Joe Biden's border policy\n\nKatie Britt on Thursday said the American dream \"has turned into a nightmare for so many families.\"\n\n\"President Biden's border policies are a disgrace. This crisis is despicable. And the truth is, it is almost entirely preventable,\" she said.\n\nBritt told the story of a Texas woman who was trafficked by drug cartels. She also referenced Laken Riley, a Georgia woman who was killed. An undocumented immigrant has been charged following her death.\n\n\"Mr. President, enough is enough. Innocent Americans are dying, and you only have yourself to blame.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nKatie Britt hits Joe Biden in Republican SOTU response\n\nKatie Britt kicked off her response to Joe Biden's State of the Union address by calling the president a \"permanent politician,\" referring to him as \"out of touch.\"\n\n\"Under his administration, families are worse off,\" Britt said.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden addresses concerns about his age\n\nJoe Biden ended his speech by addressing Americans' well-documented concerns about his age, cracking a joke.\n\n“I know I may not look like it, but I’ve been around a while,” he quipped.\n\nThe president said he is still up to the task, citing his experience and wisdom. He seemed to draw a direct comparison to his predecessor and opponent, alluding to his belief that he and Donald Trump think different core values define America.\n\n“My lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy... Honesty. Decency. Dignity. Equality,” he said. “Now some other people my age see a different story. An American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution.”\n\nBiden also highlighted his decades of experience in politics, reminding viewers that there was a time in his career when people told him he was “too young.”\n\n“Whether young or old, I’ve always known what endures,” he said. “The very idea of America, that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.”\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nStanding up to China\n\nRelations with China have stabilized – for now. But competition with the rival nation remains a top priority for the Biden administration.\n\n“America is rising,” Joe Biden said Thursday. “We’re standing up against China’s unfair economic practices. We’re standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan straits.”\n\nBiden said Thursday that he had revitalized U.S. alliances in the region and taken steps to protect American investments in advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence.\n\n“Frankly, for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do any of that,” Biden said.\n\nMoments later, as Biden said that issues such as the reduction of fentanyl production and trafficking should be bipartisan, he chafed at Republicans seated in the chamber.\n\n“You don’t want to do that huh,” he said.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nWho yelled 'Liar!' at Joe Biden?\n\nRep. Derrick Van Orden, R-Wis., was the first Republican to accuse Joe Biden of being a 'liar' during the state of the union, according to reports.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Van Orden told USA TODAY in a text message: \"Who?\"\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nContaining the “threat posed by Iran”\n\nJoe Biden warned Houthi rebels in Yemen that the U.S. will take any means necessary to protect commercial vessels in the Red Sea and minimize disruptions to global trade.\n\nAn attack by the Iranian-backed group on a shipping vessel killed three crew members on Wednesday.\n\nThe U.S. and its coalition partners are wary of escalating the conflict. They have responded to previous episodes of violence with limited airstrikes.\n\nBut the president said Thursday, that “containing the threat posed by Iran” is key to achieving stability in the region.\n\n“As commander-in-chief, I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and our military personnel,” Biden said.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden calls for temporary cease-fire in the Middle East\n\nBiden rebuked Israel for the high death toll in Gaza and called for a temporary cease-fire in its war with Hamas.\n\n“Humanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip,” Biden said. “Protecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.”\n\nHe added: “As we look to the future, the only real solution to the situation is a two-state solution over time.”\n\nThe bloody conflict began five months ago, to the day, when Hamas fighters kidnapped, killed and most likely engaged in “sexualized torture” of Israeli civilians, according to a U.N. report, during the militant group’s Oct. 7 attack.\n\nBiden pledged to the families of hostages that he would not rest until their loved ones return home. The commitment drew a standing ovation from Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd while the U.S. firmly supports Israel’s right to defend itself, Biden said, the price that innocent Palestinian women and children are paying is too high.\n\n“It’s heartbreaking,” Biden said.\n\nBiden pressed both sides to accept the terms of a six-week ceasefire that would bring about the release of hostages, including an unknown number of Americans, and help get higher amounts of aid into the Gaza strip.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden demands assault weapon ban, touts lower crime rates.\n\nJoe Biden told the joint session that he is demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and urged lawmakers to pass universal background checks.\n\n“None of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners,” he said.\n\nHe acknowledged Jasmine, whose nine-year-old sister Jackie was murdered with 21 classmates and teachers at a school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, last year. Biden said families who lost their children urged him to “do something” to address gun violence.\n\n“Meanwhile, my predecessor told the NRA he’s proud he did nothing on guns when he was president,” he said.\n\nBiden claimed America is safer today than when he took office and touted his American Rescue Plan's investment in public safety.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nProtestor who interrupted Joe Biden handcuffed and arrested\n\nThe protestor who interrupted Joe Biden, yelling about Abbey, Gate was handcuffed and arrested after being escorted out by security from the House gallery as seen in a photo shared with USA TODAY.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden interrupted by a protestor\n\nA protestor loudly interrupted Biden's speech from the House gallery overlooking the House floor, yelling about Abbey Gate. It's a reference to the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, which saw 13 military members killed.\n\nThe protestor was escorted out by security.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden says his \"predecessor\" is playing politics with border\n\nJoe Biden talked about introducing a comprehensive plan to fix the immigration system, secure the border, and provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers.\n\nThe bipartisan bill, he said, would be the toughest set of border security reforms and would hire 1,500 more border security agents and officers. But Republicans killed the legislation earlier this month, even after GOP lawmakers participated in negotiations.\n\n“But unfortunately, politics have derailed it so far,” he said. “I’m told my predecessor called Republicans in Congress and demanded they block the bill. He feels it would be a political win for me and a political loser for him.\"\n\n–Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nRepublicans are leaving Biden's State of the Union early\n\nIn a sign of disinterest and disdain at the president's address, a handful of Republicans have slowly been trickling out of the House chamber as Joe Biden has been speaking.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nBiden calls for expanded voting rights\n\nIn recognition of a dark moment in U.S. history, Biden pressed Congress to strengthen voter protections.\n\nHis speech fell on the 59th anniversary of “Bloody Sunday,” when Alabama police clubbed and attacked civil rights advocates with tear gas during a peaceful demonstration.\n\nThe incident was a catalyst for passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 several months later, which banned literacy tests and introduced other measures intended to help African Americans exercise their constitutional right to vote.\n\nBiden held hands and marched with civil rights activists last year in Selma; Vice President Kamala Harris delivered a speech at this year’s commemorative event.\n\n\"There are forces taking us back in time. Voter suppression. Election subversion. Unlimited dark money. Extreme gerrymandering,\" Biden said Thursday. \"It's time do to more than talk. Pass the Freedom to Vote Act, the John Lewis Voting Rights Act!\"\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden pushes for a return of the expanded Child Tax Credit\n\nBiden said he would like to see a return of the expanded Child Tax Credit he approved during the pandemic. The credit enacted as part of his American Rescue Plan was only active in 2021.\n\nThat year, the Child Tax Credit increased from $2,000 to $3,000 per child over six and from $2,000 to $3,600 for children under six. It also raised the age limit from 16 to 17. Working families received the full credit if they made less than $150,000 for a couple or $112,500 for families with a single parent.\n\n“Restore the Child Tax Credit because no child should go hungry in this country,” he said.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nDemocrats to Marjorie Taylor Greene: 'Shut up!'\n\nAs Joe Biden railed against Republicans for killing a bipartisan border and migrant deal earlier this year, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene got into a testy back and forth with the president and yelled \"It's about Laken Riley!\"\n\nRiley was found dead last month, and an undocumented migrant is accused of killing her.\n\nDemocrats immediately stood up to boo at Greene, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., was seen yelling at her to \"Shut up!\"\n\n– Ken Tran\n\n“Strong and getting stronger”\n\nBiden sought to boost confidence in America’s future, saying on Thursday that when the country gets knocked down, it gets back up.\n\n“We keep going. That’s America,” Biden said.\n\nIt’s because of the tenacity of the American people that Biden said he could say in his address, “The state of our union is strong and getting stronger.”\n\nThe line drew loud cheers and applause from Democrats in the chamber, who erupted in chants of “Four more years!” Republicans stayed seated.\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nRepublicans jeer as Biden accuses them of cutting Social Security\n\nBiden accused Republicans of supporting cuts to Social Security and vowed to protect the social safety net, provoking jeers and a handful of GOP members yelling \"Liar!\" back at the president.\n\n\"If anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them,\" Biden said.\n\nIf the dynamic sounds familiar, that's because it is. Biden made the same point at last year's State of the Union address, and Republicans responded the same way.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden vows to lower housing costs\n\nTo address the increasing cost of housing, Joe Biden said he wants to provide an annual tax credit that will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down.\n\n“I know the cost of housing is so important to you,” he said.\n\nHe said the administration is also eliminating title insurance fees for federally backed mortgages so that when a homeowner refinance their home, they can save you $1,000 or more.\n\nHe also urged Congress to pass his housing plan to build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and bring rents down.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJoe Biden: ‘I want to make college more affordable’\n\nBiden pushed for making college more affordable and urged lawmakers to continue increasing Pell grants for working and middle class families.\n\nHe acknowledged Keenan Jones, a public school educator from Minnesota, who was a guest sitting near the first lady Thursday evening.\n\n“While we’re at it, I want to give public school teachers a raise,” he said.\n\nBiden told the joint session that he wants to give every child a good start by providing access to preschool for three and four year olds as well as expand high quality tutoring and summer learning to increase reading levels.\n\n“To remain the strongest economy in the world, we need to have the best education system in the world,” he said.\n\n– Rachel Looker\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene: 'Tell Hunter to pay his taxes!'\n\nWhen Biden spoke about raising the corporate tax rate, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., interrupted and yelled, \"tell Hunter to pay his taxes!\" referring to the president's son, Hunter Biden and his federal tax evasion charges.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden calls for Medicare to negotiate lower prices on 500 prescription drugs\n\nJoe Biden touted his administration’s steps to lower the cost of insulin and other prescription drugs, noting that “for years, people have talked about it, but finally we got it done.”\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law in 2022, gave Medicare the power to negotiate prescription drug prices directly with drug companies. As a result, Biden said, Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market.\n\nNow it’s time to go further, he said, and give Medicare the authority to negotiate lower prices for 500 different drugs over the next decade.\n\n–Michael Collins\n\nGeorge Santos, during the State of the Union, announces he's running for reelection\n\nDuring Biden's speech, embattled former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., who was expelled from the House for his extravagant lies and slate of criminal charges, announced he was running for reelection, challenging his fellow New Yorker, Rep. Nick LaLota, R-N.Y.\n\n\"Tonight, I want to announce that I will be returning to the arena of politics and challenging Nick,\" Santos said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nIVF and Roe v. Wade take center stage\n\nJoe Biden during his speech highlighted Latorya Beasley of Birmingham, Alabama, who was going through a round of IVF treatment when her embryo transfer was abruptly stopped after the Alabama Supreme Court’s decision treating embryos as children.\n\n“She was told her dream would have to wait,” Biden said. “Let’s stand up for families like hers,\" said Biden.\n\nHe also pointed to Kate Cox, who was denied an abortion in Texas.\n\n“Here are state laws banning the right to choose, criminalizing doctors, and forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states as well to get the care they need,” said Biden. “Clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America. But they found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again in 2024.”\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain warms up to Joe Biden\n\nUnited Auto Worker President Shawn Fain mouths \"it's you,\" in response to accolades from Joe Biden.\n\nIt's a big turnaround: Fain and the UAW withheld an endorsement for Biden for months as the United Auto Workers pressured the administration to strengthen union rules. The union openly criticized the administration for failing to tie generous federal funding to strong labor requirements.\n\nThey finally endorsed Biden earlier this year after big contract wins in the fall.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nDonald Trump's Truth Social website is down\n\nWhile Joe Biden has attacked Donald Trump at length, the former president has not responded as often as expected.\n\nHis Truth Social website went down shortly after Biden began his speech.\n\nTrump aides are weighing in often on Biden on other social media, but the candidate himself is silenced …. for now.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nJoe Biden: ‘My predecessor failed’ handling COVID-19 pandemic\n\nBiden said America is on the comeback from the worst pandemic and economic crisis in the century.\n\n“My predecessor failed the most basic presidential duty that he owes to American people—the duty to care,” Biden said. “I think that’s unforgivable.”\n\nBiden said the COVID-19 pandemic no longer controls our lives. And while the U.S. economy was on the brink, it’s now the “envy of the world.” He cited unemployment at record lows, an increase in small business owners, new manufacturing jobs, a decrease in inflation and increase in exporting American products.\n\n“It doesn’t make news, but in 1,000 cities and towns, the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told,\" he said.\n\n- Rachel Looker\n\nJoe Biden condemns Jan. 6 mob attack in SOTU address\n\nWarning that democracy is under assault, Joe Biden cited the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, by a mob of Donald Trump's supporters trying to stop the certification of the 2020 election.\n\n“The insurrectionists were not patriots,” Biden said. “They came to stop the peaceful transfer of power.”\n\nLies about the 2020 election and the plot to steal the election posed the greatest threat to democracy since the Civil War, Biden said, “but they failed.”\n\nTrump and some Republicans in Congress “seek to bury the truth about Jan. 6,” Biden alleged. “I will not do that.”\n\n“Here’s the truth,” he said. “You can’t love your country only when you win.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\n'Lies!' one House GOP lawmaker yells\n\nAs Joe Biden was speaking, one House Republican interjected and yelled \"Lies!\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., instructed GOP members to remain cordial throughout the address, but that message evidently didn't get through to some lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWho is sitting behind Joe Biden\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., are sitting behind the president on Thursday. It's traditional for the vice president and speaker of the House to sit behind the president during the State of the Union.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden criticizes Donald Trump's attacks on NATO\n\nOne of Biden’s few foreign policy successes since last year: the addition of Sweden to the NATO alliance.\n\nSweden cleared the final obstacle on Tuesday when, after more than a year of delays, the Hungarian government finally approved the nation’s membership. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson submitted the accession paperwork in Washington, D.C. hours before Biden’s evening address.\n\nThe ceremony made it convenient for Kristersson to attend the State of the Union as a guest of the White House. And it gave Biden a ready-made opportunity to juxtapose his support for the alliance that is about to celebrate its 75th anniversary with the position of likely Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nTrump last month claimed he once told the leader of a NATO nation that Russia can do “whatever the hell” it wants countries to countries that spend less than they should on their national defense.\n\n“We will not walk away. We will not bow down,” Biden said Thursday. “I will not bow down!”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nJoe Biden opens remarks with call to support Ukraine aid\n\nPresident Joe Biden opened his speech by declaring loudly that America stands with Ukraine, with Russian President Vladimir Putin continuing to wage war on the sovereign nation.\n\nBiden said he hoped to \"wake up the Congress\" and alert the American people \"this is no ordinary moment\" with democracy under threat in the U.S. and abroad.\n\n\"If anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you he will not,\" Biden said from the House chamber. “But Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons that it needs to defend itself. That is all Ukraine is asking.\"\n\n\"They are not asking for American soldiers,\" Biden said. \"And I'm determined to keep it that way.\"\n\nA national security bill that included assistance for Ukraine cleared the Senate with bipartisan support.

The court's 6-3 conservative majority has been a frequent point of criticism from Democratic lawmakers, especially after the court overturned Roe v.

That stands for president of the United States.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhy are women wearing white at the State of the Union?\n\nIn the House chamber, where Biden is expected to speak in less than an hour, several female House Democratic lawmakers are dressed in all-white to commemorate the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nJoe Biden expected to slam Republicans for rejecting bipartisan border deal\n\nJoe Biden is likely to criticize Republican lawmakers on Thursday for rejecting a bipartisan border security deal that Senate conservatives killed earlier this month.\n\nRepublicans initially demanded that border security policies be attached to additional foreign aid for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that Biden requested last year. After months of negotiations, a bipartisan group of senators released an agreement that would have significantly restricted asylum and created a new emergency mechanism to stop migrants from illegally entering the country.\n\nBut former President Donald Trump came out against the provisions, and many Republicans followed suit. House leaders declared it “dead on arrival” in their chamber, and Senate Republicans abandoned it when it became clear it wouldn’t get the support of a majority of their conference.\n\nDemocrats have since seized on the turnaround, arguing Republicans aren’t serious about their claims of urgency at the border. Republicans, however, are also expected to bite back: Sen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., is expected to say Biden “invited” the border crisis and describe it as “despicable” and “a disgrace” in prepared remarks of the formal GOP response.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nWhat time does the State of the Union address start?\n\nThe State of the Union address is set to begin at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday.\n\nJoe Biden will begin addressing lawmakers and Americans across the country after he enters the halls of Congress alongside officials from all three branches of America's government.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJoe Biden set to address IVF after Alabama Supreme Court ruling\n\nAs Joe Biden addresses the nation Thursday in his State of the Union speech, hopeful parents and medical experts will be looking for signs that access to IVF, or in vitro fertilization is not in jeopardy.\n\nThe Alabama Supreme Court ruled last month that frozen embryos are children and that people can be held legally responsible if they are destroyed. The court’s ruling alarmed prospective parents and IVF clinics, and the real-world consequences were immediate. At least three Alabama medical facilities halted in vitro fertilization treatments.\n\nThe issue is sure to take center stage during Biden's speech. Among the guests joining first lady Jill Biden is Latorya Beasley of Birmingham, Alabama, who was going through a round of IVF treatment when her embryo transfer was abruptly stopped after the court's decision.\n\nThere is a good chance that Biden will emphasis her experience as yet another example of how the overturning of Roe v. Wade disrupted access to reproductive health care for women and families across the country.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nGeorge Santos is back on Capitol Hill for State of the Union\n\nFormer Rep.

Despite a booming stock market and historically low unemployment, Biden isn't getting credit for an economic rebound. His approval rating, already hovering in the low 40s for two years, dipped even lower in recent weeks.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden housing plan set for State of the Union\n\nTimes are tough for homebuyers and renters. Between high mortgage rates, lack of availability, skyrocketing home prices and dire rental prices, housing costs are devouring the American pocketbook.\n\nWith the dismal housing outlook weighing on family budgets, President Joe Biden will use his State of the Union speech Thursday to showcase plans to help Americans obtain mortgages and to push down monthly rents, according to the White House.\n\nBiden will call on Congress to pass a mortgage relief credit that would provide first-time middle-class homebuyers an annual tax credit of $5,000 for two years.\n\nThis would effectively reduce the mortgage rate by more than 1.5 percentage points, the White House said, and will help more than 3.5 million middle-class families purchase their first home over the next two years.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nJoe Biden will address abortion rights, economy in SOTU\n\nAccording to excerpts released ahead of his speech, Biden will highlight election wins in states in favor of restoring abortion rights since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade and a constitutional right to an abortion. Biden plans to campaign aggressively on abortion rights against Trump.\n\nAccording to excerpts, Biden will also highlight election wins in states in favor of restoring abortion rights since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade and a constitutional right to an abortion. Biden plans to campaign aggressively on abortion rights, vowing to codify abortion rights if given a Democratic-controlled Congress.\n\n“Clearly those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America,” Biden will say. “But they found out when reproductive freedom was on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again in 2024.”\n\nBiden will also tout the “greatest story never told” as he talks about the nation’s economic rebound following the pandemic.\n\n“Let’s tell that story here and now,” Biden will say. “America’s comeback is building a future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up – not the top down, investing in all of America – in all Americans – to make sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nJoe Biden to reject ‘an American story of resentment, revenge and retribution’ in State of the Union\n\nJoe Biden will say he rejects “an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution” during Thursday’s State of the Union address as he frames a general election rematch against Donald Trump.\n\nBiden, according to excerpts released by the White House, will say his life has taught him to “embrace freedom and democracy” and values such as honesty, equality and giving everyone a fair shot.\n\n“Now some other people my age see a different story: an American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution. That’s not me,” Biden is expected to say.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat is a designated survivor?\n\nMembers of Joe Biden’s Cabinet are expected to attend tonight’s speech at the U.S. Capitol, but one of them – a “designated survivor” – will be watching from a secret location.\n\nA designated survivor is a Cabinet official appointed to go to a secure, undisclosed location in case a catastrophic event kills the president, vice president and other Cabinet members. The practice ensures that someone in the line of presidential succession is always available to assume the presidency if the worst-case scenario happens.\n\nThe White House hasn’t said who this year’s designated survivor will be. During last year’s address, the designee was Labor Secretary Marty Walsh. In 2022, it was Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nTonight's State of the Union is happening later in the year than usual\n\nTonight’s State of the Union address is only the second to take place during March since 1964. The first was Biden’s speech in 2022. Last year, Biden delivered his address on Feb. 7.\n\nPresidents have mostly delivered their State of the Union speeches in January, but some have taken place in February in recent years, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nThis year’s scheduling allows Biden to address the American public two days after winning several state primary elections on Super Tuesday. In contrast, Trump delivered his State of the Union speech a month before Super Tuesday took place in 2020.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHouse Republicans donning badges with Laken Riley's name\n\nAhead of Biden's State of the Union address, House Republicans are wearing pins and badges bearing Laken Riley's name. Riley was found dead last month, and an undocumented migrant is accused of killing her.\n\nRep. Andy Ogles, R-Tenn., and Rep Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., are handing out pins and badges to their fellow Republican colleagues as the GOP continues to focus on the crisis on the southern border as a messaging point against Biden.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nHow long have previous State of the Unions lasted?\n\nState of the Union speeches typically range from about 45 minutes to an hour and 15 minutes. Biden’s previous addresses each lasted more than an hour. In 2022, he spoke for just over an hour and in 2023 he spoke for an hour and 13 minutes, according to the American Presidency Project.\n\nFormer President Richard Nixon delivered the shortest State of the Union address in 1972, speaking for under 29 minutes. Former President Bill Clinton holds the record for the longest State of the Union speech. During his 1995 and 2000 addresses, he spoke for close to an hour and a half.\n\nBiden is the most talkative president in recent memory in terms of the actual number of words spoken in his speeches.\n\n– Rachel Barber\n\nHow can I stream the State of the Union?\n\nThe State of the Union address will be streamed on the USA TODAY YouTube channel and through the USA TODAY channel on your smart television.\n\n– James Powel\n\nState of the Union bingo: Everything you need to play during Joe Biden's speech\n\nIt's time to play State of the Union bingo!

Katie Britt, R-Ala., will deliver the Republican response to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Thursday evening.\n\nBut who is the first-term lawmaker? Britt, 42, is the youngest Republican woman to ever be elected to the upper chamber and is considered a rising star among a party dominated by older men. On Thursday night, she'll also offer a contrast to President Joe Biden, the oldest sitting president in American history.\n\nShe has two children still in middle and high school and said in a statement ahead of the speech that the Republican Party is the party of \"hard-working parents and families.\"\n\nBritt's speech will come just over two weeks after the Supreme Court in her home state issued a decision that rocked families across the country: The Alabama high court determined that frozen embryos used in IVF are children and have legal protections under state law.\n\n– Riley Beggin\n\nJoe Biden’s State of the Union address to focus on four themes\n\nThe White House briefed Democratic congressional aides on Thursday morning about Joe Biden’s address and outlined key themes of his speech, according to a person in the briefing. A slideshow, shared with USA TODAY, was presented to staffers read out four themes:\n\nProgress and possibility\n\nDefend democracy and freedom\n\nEconomy from middle out, bottom up\n\nMove the country forwards, not backwards\n\nThe presentation also alluded to the presidential election and former President Donald Trump. Another slide in the presentation read that the “key message” after Biden’s address will be that “there’s a clear contrast” and “competing visions for the country.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nDonald Trump to prod Joe Biden during State of the Union\n\nRest assured: The 2024 Republican frontrunner will not stay silent during Biden's speech tonight.\n\nDonald Trump says he and his staff will provide running (critical) commentary on social media as Biden delivers the State of the Union.\n\n\"We did this once before to tremendous success,\" Trump said on his Truth Social platform.

It's also how he looks and sounds to perhaps his biggest TV audience of the year.\n\n− Carli Pierson\n\nWhat is the State of the Union? Why is it important?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, previously told USA TODAY.\n\nJerry said the State of the Union often provides a spotlight for the president to reference values such as unity or American innovation. She said it also provides a \"unique opportunity for Americans and people around the world to see how this checks and balances system of our government works.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/israel-hamas/2024/01/30/israel-hamas-war-gaza-live-updates/72404768007/", "title": "Israel Hamas war live updates: IDF pumping water into tunnels", "text": "Editor's Note: This page is a summary of news on the Israel-Hamas war for Tuesday, Jan. 30.

The posting called the approach a \"significant tool'' in the fight against Hamas.\n\nThe militant group is believed to have built more than 350 miles of tunnels where its militants can hide and store weapons and ammunition. A recent Wall Street Journal report said about 80% of the tunnels remained intact despite the Israeli efforts to destroy them during a war that began Oct. 7.\n\n'It takes your heart and your soul':3 US soldiers killed in Jordan identified\n\nDevelopments:\n\n∎ President Joe Biden said Tuesday that he has made a decision on how to respond to the attack by Iran-backed militants at a base in Jordan that killed three U.S. troops and wounded dozens more. He revealed no specifics. Biden said he considered Iran \"responsible in the sense that they're supplying the weapons to the people who did it.\"\n\n∎ Spc. Kennedy Sanders and Spc. Breonna Moffett, two of the three soldiers killed Sunday in a drone strike in Jordan, have been promoted posthumously to the rank of sergeant, the Army Reserve announced Tuesday. Sanders, 24, Moffett, 23, and Sgt. William Rivers, 46, died when the one-way drone slammed into their living quarters and detonated. All three hailed from Georgia.\n\n∎ Canada, one of several nations including the U.S. to suspend funding to the embattled U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, said it will provide $40 million to the World Food Program, UNICEF and other agencies to aid the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n\n∎ Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh said he was studying the latest proposal aimed at pausing the fighting and freeing more hostages \"in order to achieve the interests of our people.\" He said he was considering an invitation to visit Cairo to discuss the framework agreement.\n\n∎ The Islamic cemetery and mosque in southern Gaza were destroyed by Israeli forces that said they found part of a Hamas tunnel network underneath, the Associated Press reported from the site.

Also killed were brothers Muhammad and Bassel Azawi, who the military said also had been involved in terrorist activities.\n\nThe Palestinian Health Ministry released video showing gunmen dressed in scrubs and other civilian garb sweeping through the hospital, guns drawn. The Israeli statement reiterated the claim that large numbers of militants use hospitals and other civilian space “as a shelter and human shield.” Hamas again rejected the claim.\n\n“The resistance that promised our people to jihad until the occupation was defeated … will not be intimidated by the assassinations or the cowardly enemy crimes,” Hamas leaders said in a statement\n\nIran condemned the shootings, saying such attacks pave the way for normalizing “organized terrorism” in the world. “It is expected that the countries of the world will not be indifferent to Israel’s act of terrorism,” Iran Foreign Ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said.\n\nUK could recognize Palestinian state before war ends, ex-British leader says\n\nBritain might be willing to provide formal diplomatic recognition to a Palestinian state prior to a final peace deal involving Israel, British Foreign Secretary David Cameron said Tuesday.\n\nRecognition would give Palestinians a “political horizon,” Cameron said, and reflect irreversible progress to a two-state solution and establishment of a Palestinian state − a plan that has been repeatedly rejected by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Cameron said Israel’s resistance to a two-state solution has fueled 30 years of failed security policy, the BBC reports.\n\nOne of Netanyahu’s complaints has been U.S. and British support for the state’s leadership to fall to the Palestinian Authority, which in the past has called for the destruction of Israel. Cameron said a revamped authority with strong leadership would be a prerequisite for recognition.\n\n“We should be starting to set out what a Palestinian state would look like, what it would comprise, how it would work,” the former British prime minister said. “That could be one of the things that helps to make this process irreversible.”\n\nNetanyahu refuses to pull troops out of Gaza as part of any peace plan\n\nIsrael will not pull its troops out of Gaza and won't release thousands of Palestinians from Israeli jails as part of any deal for the return of more than 100 hostages, Netanyahu said Tuesday. Both actions have been crucial to talks surrounding an extended cease-fire the U.S. and other nations have been laboring to broker for weeks. Netanyahu, speaking at a pre-military academy in the occupied West Bank, said he remains committed to \"total victory\" over Hamas.\n\n“I am committed to it, our fighters are committed to it, and the absolute majority of the (Israeli) people are committed to it,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nIsraeli and global media have reported on a \"framework\" for a cease-fire deal that could free 100 or more Palestinians currently detained in Israeli jails for each hostage released by militants in Gaza. And a two-state solution has been viewed globally as a long-term answer to douse the tinderbox that is the Middle East.\n\n\"We will not end this war with less than the achievement of all its goals,\" Netanyahu said. \"We will not remove the Israeli military from the Gaza Strip and we will not release thousands of terrorists. None of this will happen. What will happen? Absolute victory.”\n\nMilitant groups activated by war threaten broader conflict\n\nThe growing number of attacks from several Iran-backed militias in the Middle East has heightened concerns about the Israel-Hamas war spreading beyond Gaza. Most recently, one of those hostile acts killed three U.S. service members over the weekend in Jordan.\n\nThe war Hamas started with its vicious assault on Israeli border communities Oct. 7 has activated the militant groups, leading to repeated exchanges of fire between Hezbollah in Lebanon and Israel, its neighbor to the south. In addition, Houthi rebels in Yemen have disrupted commercial shipping in the Red Sea with dozens of attempted strikes, purportedly in support of embattled Palestinians.\n\nThe Pentagon says other militias supported by Iran have launched more than 160 attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria since mid-October. One of those groups, Kataib Hezbollah − also known as the Hezbollah Brigades − said in a statement Tuesday it was suspending military operations against U.S. troops in the region \"in order to prevent embarrassment to the Iraqi government.''\n\nHere's a look at these combative groups.\n\nAfter shootings, Palestinian health minister urges UN to protect hospitals\n\nPalestinian Minister of Health Mai al-Alkaila called on the U.N. General Assembly, international institutions and human rights organizations to help bring an end to crimes she said are committed by Israelis against Palestinian people and health centers in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Alkaila said international support is desperately needed to protect treatment centers and ambulance crews.\n\nAlkaila said the assault in Ibn Sina Hospital is just the lastest of dozens of crimes committed by the occupation forces against hospitals, patients and medical staff. She cited international law that provides protections for civilian sites, including hospitals.\n\nDefense minister says Israel won't cede military control of Gaza after war\n\nIsrael will maintain military control of postwar Gaza similar to the security control Israel exercises in the West Bank, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said Tuesday. Gallant said the attack in the Jenin hospital was an example of the control and access Israel would retain after the war.\n\n“I think it’s completely clear that Hamas won’t control Gaza,\" Gallant said at a briefing in Tel Aviv. \"Israel will control militarily but won’t control it in a civilian sense.\"\n\nContributing: Tom Vanden Brook, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/04/26/pro-palestinian-protests-college-columbia-usc-ut-austin/73465781007/", "title": "More arrests Saturday as pro-Palestinian protests embroil US colleges", "text": "NEW YORK − After more colleges joined in the coast-to-coast protest fray over Israel's war in Gaza this week, protesters were pressing on Saturday in the face of some university leaders cracking down on demonstrations with armed police.\n\nWhile Columbia University has been the epicenter of student protests for over a week, on Saturday police arrested students and protesters at college campuses in Massachusetts, Arizona and Indiana.\n\nHundreds of students have set up encampments from California to Massachusetts, leading to a national debate over free speech on college campuses as some Jewish students and administrators say the demonstrations have at times been sites of antisemitism.\n\nThe protesters have called on universities to cut financial ties to Israel and Israeli companies, especially those benefiting from the ongoing war in Gaza. While the demonstrations have not led to any divestments, the week of protests have had broad impacts, forcing classes to move online and disrupting graduation plans.\n\nOn Thursday, law enforcement in riot gear broke up a peaceful demonstration at the University of Ohio. Arrests also occurred the same day at Indiana University and the University of Minnesota.\n\nThe dayslong demonstrations have centered on the war in Gaza that was triggered by Hamas' incursion into southern Israel on Oct. 7, when about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, were killed and more than 240 people were taken hostage.

About 100 people were detained, and those with student IDs were released and will face disciplinary action, university spokesperson Renata Nyul said in an emailed statement.\n\nLater Saturday, Northeastern's campus was back to normal, with admissions tours taking place and students posing for graduation photos, the school said in an emailed statement. At other Boston area schools, encampments continued through the day.\n\nAnd at Indiana University in Bloomington, another 23 protesters were arrested Saturday by police in riot gear, the Indiana Daily Student reported. Police also dismantled tents, poured out water and took food from the encampment, according to the paper. The action came after the school announced a policy change banning temporary structures without prior approval earlier this week.\n\nMIT president says protests must end soon\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology officials had been in talks with protesters who have set up camp, but the students made clear they would not accept less than their full demands, which include cutting research funding ties with Israel's military, university President Sally Kornbluth said in a statement Saturday.\n\nIn a video statement, Kornbluth said administrators had thus far chosen not to interfere with the protests despite violation of school rules about reserving space to demonstrate. The protests at MIT have been peaceful, she said, though campus police have been present at all times.\n\nHowever, Kornbluth said, \"this particular form of expression needs to end soon.\"\n\nKornbluth said the encampments are a \"magnet\" to outside agitators, are violating campus rules and are taking away resources and staff hours from other campus functions.\n\n\"Rules have already been broken. Those who break our rules – including rules around the time, place and manner of protest – will face disciplinary action,\" she said.\n\nColumbia students file civil rights complaint against university\n\nColumbia University students and Palestine Legal filed a civil rights complaint with the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights against the university Thursday. The complaint alleges harassment, death threats, doxing, stereotyping and unequal treatment by Columbia administrators, including President Minouche Shafik.\n\nMaryam Alwan, one of the complainants, told USA TODAY the harassment – both online and in person – has impeded her academic progress. She has to delay her graduation a year, she said.\n\nThe university did not provide comment to USA TODAY on the complaint.\n\n“I’m unable to focus on my classes anymore,” Alwan said. “The narrative is that the protests are extremely harassing and discriminatory when in reality the only discrimination that I’ve faced has been at the protest by counter-protesters.”\n\nPalestine Legal is also asking the DOE to investigate Columbia’s decision to allow “NYPD officers in riot gear — for the first time in decades — to arrest over a hundred students peacefully protesting Israel’s genocide last week.” The OCR does not comment on pending investigations, an Education Department spokesperson told USA TODAY.\n\nAlwan says she hopes for “deep institutional changes,” including mandatory training about anti-Palestinian discrimination, protections for academic freedom to teach about Palestinian history and “equal treatment across the board.”\n\n− Clare Mulroy\n\nACLU to US university leaders: Don't sacrifice free speech\n\nThe ACLU sent an open letter Friday evening to American public and private universities urging them to protect free speech and academic freedom. The letter came in response to anti-war protests across the U.S. that have resulted in “disturbing arrests,” according to a news release from the civil rights organization.\n\n“As you fashion responses to the activism of your students (and faculty and staff), it is essential that you not sacrifice principles of academic freedom and free speech that are core to the educational mission of your respected institution,” said the letter, authored by ACLU Executive Director Anthony Romero and David Cole, the national legal director.\n\nACLU recommended guardrails to ensure this, such as not singling out particular viewpoints for censorship. Students should be protected from targeted discriminatory harassment, but institutions “may not penalize students for taking sides on the war in Gaza, even if expressed in deeply offensive terms,” the letter said.\n\nThe letter said students should have ample room to express themselves even as schools announce and enforce reasonable content-neutral protest policies and armed police on campus should be a measure of last resort. ACLU added, \"Schools must resist the pressures placed on them by politicians seeking to exploit campus tensions.”\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nChicago students call for disbanding of campus police\n\nOne day after students at Northwestern University set up an encampment, other Chicago-area universities joined in. At the University of Chicago where students demanded the school disband its private police force alongside demands of breaking with Israeli institutions.\n\nOver 200 students joined in the march at the campus on Chicago’s South Side, according to local media reports. Chief among their demands was the disbandment of the university’s police force, which is reported to be among the largest private police forces in the city.\n\nA university spokesperson reported no arrests at the South Side protest and did not comment on the group’s demands.\n\nIn downtown Chicago, students from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, Columbia College Chicago and Roosevelt University also protested, marching along Michigan Avenue before police ushered them into Millennium Park, as seen in videos shared on social media by attendees.\n\nStudents at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the central part of the state set up an encampment on campus as well, according to videos shared on social media that showed dozens of students camped out and about a dozen tents.\n\nCampus police attempted to break up the encampment and arrested one person Friday, according to student media. Videos shared on social media show dozens of officers tussling with dozens of students who locked arms around the encampment. The university's police department did not immediately respond to requests for confirmation of the arrest.\n\n− Michael Loria\n\nTent protest movement grows at UNC\n\nStudents at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill organized tents, tarps and air mattresses in a central courtyard on Friday, one week after the first pro-Palestinian encampment popped up on campus. Tents stood for around four hours before being taken down at the request of university administration.\n\nOrganizers at the school, one of the most prestigious public universities in the country, say UNC’s place in the South is an important part of the national movement pushing for university divestiture from Israel.\n\n“It feels exhilarating and inspiring,” Slyvie Tudor, a graduate student with UNC Students for Justice in Palestine, told USA TODAY. “It has to start somewhere, and I think it’s really meaningful that we’re at a public university in the South,” Tudor said, referencing how North Carolina’s Republican-controlled state legislature makes decisions impacting the university.\n\nOn Friday, professors, town residents and students gathered beneath a canopy of tall, leafy trees and amid pops of bright orange and blue camping gear as protest leaders made announcements on bullhorns.\n\nMuslim students prayed and organizers took down tent poles at around 1:30 p.m., laying the gear flat on the ground in response to university requests to take down tent structures. As the landscape of the encampment shifted, dialogue and conversations about the war in Gaza continued uninterrupted.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nGroup of onlookers at UNC say they stand against attacks on Israel\n\nOn Friday afternoon, a smaller group of demonstrators gathered in UNC’s Polk Place courtyard, saying they were there to stand against the Oct. 7 Hamas attack that killed 1,200 people in Israel, and to stand in support of Jewish students.\n\n“We’re just here to show up,” said Rabbi Dovid Cohen, adding he doesn’t identify as a counter protester. He said he visits Chapel Hill every year during the Passover holiday.\n\nAt times, the small group, comprising around a dozen men, women and children, exchanged chants with the more than 100 pro-Palestinian student encampment protesters.\n\n“When one group, especially a minority, feels targeted, we’re here for them, we’re their Jewish brothers,” Cohen said, pointing to one onlooker, whom he said was visibly Jewish, who was being followed around by pro-Palestinian protesters.\n\nThe onlooker encircled the pro-Palestinian tent encampment on foot for nearly 20 minutes Friday afternoon, filming while students from the encampment tried to block his phone camera. Pro-Palestinian students said they did not filming to avoid the risk of being doxxed online for their political views.\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nWhite House condemns Columbia protest leader's call for Zionists to die\n\nThe White House on Friday condemned antisemitic remarks that surfaced this week from one of the leading student organizers of the pro-Palestinian encampment at Columbia University.\n\n\"These dangerous, appalling statements turn the stomach and should serve as a wakeup call,\" Andrew Bates, deputy White House press secretary, said in a statement. \"It is hideous to advocate for the murder of Jews.\"\n\nThe student, Khymani James, says in a video taken in January, \"Zionists don’t deserve to live” and “Be grateful that I’m not just going out and murdering Zionists.\" James refers to Zionists as \"supporters of genocide.\"\n\n\"Zionists, they shouldn't live in this word,\" James says in the video, comparing Zionists to others \"who don't deserve to live\" such as Nazis, fascists and racists. \"I feel very comfortable − very comfortable − calling for those people to die.\"\n\nOn Friday in a post on X, formerly Twitter, James apologized for his remarks: \"What I said was wrong. Every member of our community deserves to feel safe without qualification.\"\n\nPolitics:White House condemns Columbia University protest leader's call for Zionists to die\n\n− Joey Garrison\n\nFashion Institute of Technology protesters occupy university museum\n\nJoining a constellation of city universities protesting the war in Gaza, students at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan set up an encampment Thursday inside the college's 'Museum at FIT' or Goldman Center. On Friday, a group of demonstrators milled around outside holding signs as some students sat inside among the scattered tents reading and talking.\n\nStudents outside declined to speak with the press, referring instead to a press statement on the FIT Students for Justice in Palestine Instagram which lists their demands. The demands include the FIT Foundation, SUNY and Suny Research Foundation committing to financial transparency and President Joyce Brown and SUNY Chancellor John King making a public statement acknowledging genocide in Gaza.\n\nUntil demands are met demonstrators plan to hold their ground in what signs are dubbing the \"liberated zone\" and \"The People's Museum: FIT Gaza Solidarity Encampment.\"\n\n− Anna Kaufman\n\nArizona State University encampment doused by sprinklers\n\nArizona State University police said three people were arrested Friday morning as dozens of Pro-Palestinian student protesters set up tents on the campus and called for an official statement from the university condemning the violence in Gaza.\n\nSprinklers around the protesters were turned on after the first round of arrests, leading some in the crowd to use buckets and tarps to block the flow of water. Campus police said it did not know who set off the sprinklers.\n\nAs the crowd of demonstrators swelled to around 100, the group was eventually able to build back its encampment.\n\nThe Ybarra Maldonado Law Group is seeking to represent those arrested on Friday. Attorney Ray Ybarra Maldonado told The Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, he is concerned the protesters’ First Amendment rights and right to due process were violated when police arrested demonstrators within the first twenty minutes of the demonstration.\n\n− Helen Rummel, Arizona Republic\n\nPolice: 36 protesters arrested Thursday night at Ohio State University\n\nDozens of people were arrested Thursday night at Ohio State University when police disbanded an encampment that had been set up outside the student union.\n\nPolice records show that 36 people were arrested starting at 10:16 p.m. Thursday and charged with criminal trespassing, a fourth-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to 30 days in jail or a $250 fine, reported the Columbus Dispatch, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nAmong the 36 arrested, only 15 were current undergraduate or graduate students at Ohio State, according to a check done of the university's online directory. The protesters were released on their own recognizance − without having to pay any bond amount − and are scheduled to have their first appearances in Franklin County Municipal Court early next week.\n\nVideos showed scuffles in which police in riot gear took protesters to the ground as onlookers screamed for help. Skyler Goody, 21, an OSU junior, said she and her roommate were nearly arrested as she helped form a circle around the encampments.\n\n\"People of Columbus, look at how your cops treat people,\" Goody said. \"I don't know what the students were doing that warranted riot gear and pushing people over while they're praying.\"\n\n− Shahid Meighan and Cole Behrens, Columbus Dispatch\n\nRevolving demonstrations outside gates of Columbia University\n\nAs Columbia’s encampment quietly hummed on a sunny Friday morning, just outside campus gates, revolving protests were taking place.\n\nFirst hundreds gathered in a pro-Israel demonstration, waving Israeli flags and holding images of hostages taken by Hamas and other militants in the Oct. 7 attacks, chanting “Bring them home now! Alive!” New York City police, donning helmets and batons, stood behind barricades as the rally concluded peacefully.\n\n“There are people that support Israel, that believe Israel has the right to exist,” said retired educator Lois Stavsky, 76, a self-described “left-wing Zionist” who had returned after three months in Israel and Europe because she “didn’t like the vibes” in New York, home to the world’s largest Jewish population outside of Tel Aviv. She saw the student encampment as “mindless,” she said. “I think they’re naive. I don’t hate them. I kind of feel sorry for that mob mentality.”\n\nSoon after, the space was occupied by a large group of Hasidic Jews, who were holding signs reading \"All Palestine must be returned to Palestinian Sovereignty\" and \"Judaism Rejects Zionism.\" They could be heard chanting \"one, two, three, four, Zionism no more. Five, six, seven, eight, stop the killing, stop the hate.\"\n\nCharges dropped against 57 protesters arrested at University of Texas\n\nAll charges have been dropped against the 57 people arrested in connection with the Wednesday pro-Palestinian protest at the University of Texas.\n\nThe Travis County attorney's office said all 57 arrests, which were all criminal trespassing charges, lacked probable cause. County Attorney Delia Garza, whose office handles misdemeanor cases, told the American-Statesman, part of the USA TODAY Network, on Thursday that her office agreed with defense lawyers that there were \"deficiencies\" with the probable cause arrest affidavits.\n\nWhile state police with the Texas Department of Public Safety and officers with the Austin Police Department were seen handcuffing people at Wednesday's protest, all 57 arrests were technically by the University of Texas Police Department. This means university police filled out each of the 57 probable cause affidavits.\n\nNouha Ezouhri, an attorney with the Travis County public defender's office, helped file jail release forms for those arrested at the protest. She told the American-Statesman on Thursday that it looked like university police \"copied and pasted\" each probable cause affidavit for every person arrested.\n\n\"That's not how it's supposed to be,\" Ezouhri said.\n\n− Skye Seipp, Austin American-Statesman\n\nPolice stand guard at George Washington University encampment\n\nAt the entrance of a cordoned off yard at George Washington University in the nation's capital, a statue of George Washington was draped with a Palestinian flag. The statue was surrounded by dozens of tents where students had camped out overnight. Police stood guard.\n\nFor hours, protesters chanted “Up, up with liberation. Down, down with occupation” and “The people united will never be defeated.” The sidewalk was covered with messages written in chalk, including: “Fund education not decimation.”\n\nSome protesters came from nearby universities, including American University and Georgetown University, and others from communities in the metropolitan area.\n\n“We're here first and foremost for Palestine,\" said Yasin Shami, who is part of the Palestinian Youth Movement. “We will not leave until our demands are met.\"\n\nShami said he and others want the university to disclose how it is spending money and who it partners with and reverse disciplinary actions against students participating in pro-Palestine protests.\n\nSome counter protesters yelled, “You all are terrorist supporters.”\n\nAnother person in the crowd waving an Israeli flag shouted, “Bring them home.”\n\n− Deborah Barry\n\nUT president asked for state law enforcement help with protest\n\nUniversity of Texas President Jay Hartzell told a state lawmaker that he and other officials sought law enforcement help from the state leading up to a large pro-Palestinian protest Wednesday that led to more than 50 arrests because “our police force couldn’t do it alone,” according to text messages obtained by the Austin American-Statesman, part of the USA TODAY Network.\n\nIn response to message from state Sen. Sarah Eckhardt, D-Austin, asking about the heavy law enforcement presence at the University of Texas at Austin, Hartzell said, “We asked for help, Senator. They indicated their desire to mimic what happened at Columbia and elsewhere, which we are doing our best to avoid for obvious reasons.\"\n\n“I can’t speak to the other campuses, but this group is a chapter of a national organization that has done this elsewhere. They clearly intended to break our protest rules, despite our statements to them that we couldn’t allow them to do so. I wish we weren’t in this situation.”\n\nThe campus protest on Wednesday was planned by the Palestine Solidarity Committee, a registered student group. Republican pundits and politicians hailed the heavy law enforcement response, while multiple faculty members and students have called for Hartzell to resign. Members of the UT chapter of the American Association of University Professors also began collecting signatures for a letter stating faculty members have \"no confidence\" in Hartzell on Thursday afternoon.\n\n−Tony Plohetski and Bayliss Wagner, Austin American-Statesman\n\nTrump weighs in on college protests, calling them 'tremendous hate'\n\nDonald Trump on Thursday described the ongoing protests and unrest at college campuses across the U.S. as \"tremendous hate\" and placed the blame at the feet of his opponent in the upcoming presidential election, Joe Biden.\n\n\"This is tremendous hate and we have a man that can’t talk about it because he doesn’t understand it,\" Trump said following the day’s testimony in his hush money trial in New York. \"He doesn’t understand what’s going on with our country.\"\n\nTrump's comment's follow statements from several Republican members of Congress who accused university administrators of allowing harassment toward Jewish students − allegations which led to the ousting of the president's of Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\n“It's detestable. As Columbia has allowed these lawless agitators and radicals to take over, the virus of antisemitism has spread across other campus,” House Speaker Mike Johnson said Wednesday during a visit to the Columbia campus. “Anti-Israel encampments are popping up in universities all across this country. The madness has to stop.”\n\nColumbia students frustrated with politicians' response\n\nJonathan Ben-Menachem, a PhD student with the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group, told reporters that the students “encourage all politicians to take the time to understand what is happening in Gaza and at universities around the country.”\n\n“Mike Johnson parachuted in here with no regard for the actual safety of Jewish students,” Ben-Menachem said Friday.\n\n“White supremacists have been invigorated by our encampments because they see that we are a multiracial coalition composed of primarily Black, brown and Jewish students – everything that they hate.\"\n\nStudents also expressed frustration when asked how they respond to accusations that they support Hamas. “Hamas backed these protests at Columbia,” Johnson tweeted Thursday.\n\n“We find that question deeply racist,” said Sherif Ibrahim, a graduate student with CUAD. “We want to say that we are here for Palestinian liberation and to label us as Hamas supporters is deeply problematic. Students are here because they want an end to a genocide.”\n\n− Clare Mulroy\n\nMore student encampments form at New York City schools\n\nOn Friday, the antiwar encampment at the City College of New York entered its second day with about three dozen tents visible at the center of its West Harlem campus.\n\nOn a flagpole with the American flag, people added a Palestinian flag. Signs in support of the City University of New York public school system divesting from Israel were at the base of the flagpole. Inside the encampment, a few people served coffee, water and food.\n\nOn Thursday, when the encampment at CUNY first formed, campus public safety attempted to enter the space but were forced out. City College is a public school part of the CUNY system and its campus is largely open. Demonstrators at the Fashion Institute of Technology, a public school part of the State University of New York system, also formed an encampment protesting the war at its Manhattan campus.\n\nNYU's Manhattan Campus settled into a relative calm Friday afternoon after several days of protests. Gould Plaza, the courtyard in front of the Stern School of Business where student demonstrators clashed with police earlier in the week was completely walled off with school security guards sitting nearby.Keana Nelson, a 24-year-old graduate student studying social work, expressed disappointment over the school's response to the protests. \"In the past, like, during the Vietnam war when students were protesting, law enforcement used to subdue the protests and we saw how negatively that went,\" she said. \"So it's like now we're doing it again, we haven't even learned.\"\n\nCity College of New York begins negotiations with student protesters\n\nThe student encampment at the City College of New York began negotiations Friday afternoon with the public school’s administration.\n\nStudents are demanding CUNY divest from all companies profiting from weapons, surveillance and construction Israel is using against Palestinians, a boycott of all academic trips to Israel, including birthright and the Fulbright program, while affirming Palestine’s right to national liberation and right of return to Palestinians.\n\nThey also seek the removal of the NYPD from CUNY campuses, in addition to ending collaboration with Reserve Officers' Training Corps and federal agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security. The last demand includes restoring free tuition at CUNY, which has undergraduate tuition for New York state residents at $7,000 per year.\n\nOrganizers declined to comment before negotiations. Jay Mwamba, a CUNY spokesperson, said the administration had no comment “except to reiterate that for the students, faculty and staff across our campus, our most important goal is the safety of our entire campus community.”\n\nCUNY faculty and staff held a picket in support of the encampment. The university system’s Professional Staff Congress, the union representing faculty and staff, issued a statement against police arresting protesters.\n\nCity College is currently on spring break until classes resume on Wednesday.\n\n“This is sort of, in no uncertain terms, a labor issue, the repression of free speech, of academic freedom,” said graduate student Zoe Hu, the chapter president for CUNY’s Graduate Center, in midtown Manhattan. “On top of that, Israel has destroyed all of the universities in Gaza. It has wiped out an entire educational system.”\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nImprisoned political activist, journalist speaks to student encampment by speakerphone\n\nIncarcerated political activist and journalist Mumia Abu-Jamal told USA TODAY he supports “anti-imperialist” student encampments spreading across the country to protest the war in Gaza. He has been in prison for over 40 years after being convicted for the 1981 murder of a Philadelphia police officer. Abu-Jamal's death sentence was overturned by a federal court. He has maintained his innocence.\n\nToday’s activism on college campuses reminds 70-year-old Abu-Jamal, a former Black Panther, of his youth during protests against the war in Vietnam and the civil rights movement for Black Americans, he said in a brief phone call from Mahanoy state prison in Pennsylvania. He compared the protests to people once holding up lighters at concerts. Today, people tend to use cell phones.\n\n“These are flickers of light in an anti-imperialist movement,” he said. “It’s remarkable to see.”\n\nAbu-Jamal was set to speak Friday afternoon to the City College of New York student encampment in West Harlem, but Muslim students were in prayer on the campus lawn, so his call would be rescheduled for the evening. On Thursday, he spoke to Columbia University's student encampment via speakerphone. A microphone amplified his voice.\n\n− Eduardo Cuevas\n\nNegotiations at Columbia University at an impasse\n\nColumbia University students and negotiators with the Columbia University Apartheid Divest group spoke to reporters Friday about the ongoing negotiations between the university and students in the encampment. They said they have made some progress in terms of their financial disclosure demands but not with divesting from financially and academically in Israel, the group’s main demand.\n\nColumbia President Minouche Shafik previously warned students that if the tents aren't moved by Friday, \"we will have to consider options for restoring calm to campus.\"\n\nNegotiators said they spent 11 hours yesterday and an hour today at the negotiating table. Now they say they are at an impasse.\n\nThe students said it is in their best interest to reach an agreement before commencement, which is scheduled for May 15. They also said they were met with an increased “unwillingness” to understand CUAD’s core demands.\n\n“Columbia has asked students to operate within the confined of bureaucratic red tape with no assurances of binding divestment decisions if we end the encampment,” said student negotiator Sueda Polat.\n\n“The university seems to believe students cannot maintain their resolve regarding staying on this lawn, ignoring the reality that over the past 10 days, we have demonstrated how committed we are, how high our resolve is and how truly we wish from the heart for complete divestment and boycott. They believe that they can outstand us, we tell them that we cannot.”\n\n− Clare Mulroy\n\nThe protests' impacts on classes, graduation\n\nOver the past two weeks, the large demonstrations have led university administrators to adopt new policies to deal with the protests while others have been forced to restructure class schedules and graduation ceremonies.\n\nIndiana University Bloomington this week changed its longtime policy regarding \"temporary structures\" saying students now needed prior approval from the university to set up tents on the campus' main lawn, according to the Indiana Daily Student. Northwestern University in Illinois abruptly banned temporary structures after hundreds of students joined in the nationwide antiwar protests on Thursday, the Chicago Tribune reported.\n\nAt Columbia, students were given a virtual class option for the rest of the semester after protests forced the university to cancel in-person classes on Monday.\n\nOn Thursday, USC announced it was canceling its main commencement ceremony for what it said were safety reasons. The decision came 10 days after administrators decided to bar valedictorian Asna Tabassum, who is Muslim, from delivering a commencement address.\n\nOther schools must soon decide whether to hold their commencement ceremonies as the spring semester winds down and graduation ceremonies are scheduled for the weeks ahead.\n\nContributing: Reuters; Rachel Barber, Anna Kaufman, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/26"}]}

Jones\n\nOpinion contributor\n\nIn a world filled with overwhelming negativity, great and heartwarming news came out of Atlanta last weekend. After previously pledging $1.5 million to the school, billionaire Robert F. Smith, reportedly the richest black man in America, went off-script during his commencement speech at my alma mater, Morehouse College.\n\nHe claimed the Class of 2019 as “my class” and announced he was creating a grant that would pay off the student loan debt of every graduate walking across the stage that day. Wow!\n\nThe story quickly went viral and had multiple positive effects. It added to the ongoing dialogue about the growing weight of student loan debt and increasing inaccessibility of higher education in America. It also illustrated that economic elites, black, white and other, can do more than exploit or engage in “empty philanthropy.” They really can make a difference on individual and collective levels.\n\n3 fast facts:Robert F. Smith gift to Morehouse highlights burden of student loan debt\n\nImportantly, this story introduced many of us to Robert F. Smith. He is not an athlete, musician or comedian. He provides a different model of black male success than what is often pushed in the mainstream. Maybe most importantly, Smith’s fabulous idea introduced Morehouse to a good percentage of Americans who think great collegiate education begins and ends with Harvard, Yale and the like. It doesn’t.\n\nIf you didn’t know, Morehouse is the elite, historically black, all-male college founded in 1867 that has given us a host of transformative American icons, including Martin Luther King, Jr. (Class of 1948). If you have any sense of history, like Robert F. Smith, you know Morehouse has given the world so much more.\n\nOften accused of arrogance, Morehouse Men and the institution have good reason to be proud of the long line of men who have walked the school’s halls and went on to change the course of local, national and global history. Morehouse produced Atlanta’s first trailblazing black mayor Maynard Jackson, civil rights icon Julian Bond, filmmaker Spike Lee, U.S. Surgeon General David Satcher, actor Samuel L. Jackson, Olympian Edwin Moses, 1969 World Series MVP Donn Clendenon, businessman and Morehouse President Walter Massey.\n\nMore from Ricky Jones:Kentucky, Alabama are finally putting these out-of-control women in their rightful place\n\nWell-known or not, Morehouse’s more recent graduates are laboring as well. Dr. Eddie Glaude Jr. from the Class of 1989 often seems the most reasonable and intelligent voice on MSNBC. My friends and fellow professors Jeffery O.G. Ogbar, David Canton, Walter Rucker, Jamal Ratchford and many others are impacting colleges and universities from Georgia to Connecticut to Colorado and beyond. Sankofa United Church of Christ Pastor Derrick Rice is a conscious, prophetic religious leader cut from the cloth of King in Atlanta. My classmate Olu Stevens is one of the few black judges in Kentucky. Our class president, the Rev. Dr. Otis Moss III, succeeded the legendary Jeremiah Wright as pastor of Chicago’s Trinity United Church of Christ. The list goes on and on.\n\nMy own Morehouse story was personally transformative. I transferred there from the U.S. Naval Academy as I was coming into manhood in 1990. My raucous time at the Academy nearly ruined my psyche, sense of self and college career. I left after a period of epic revolutionary lawlessness that is still legendary in certain Annapolis circles. The school was bad; I was worse. But, that is another story.\n\nI still remember sitting down with Morehouse’s dean of admissions as I sought entrance. He asked, “So, you’re the young man who caused all that trouble at the Naval Academy.” I answered sheepishly and shamefully, \"Yes, sir — I am.” To my surprise, he stood and reached for my hand, “Son, I don’t know any self-respecting black man who wouldn’t cause trouble in a place like that. Welcome to Morehouse. Welcome home.” Navy gave up on me. Morehouse didn’t. God, I love that place. It changed my life — as it has so many others.\n\nWhen Robert F. Smith told newly minted Morehouse Men he expected them to “pay it (his gift) forward,” he wasn’t just talking about money. It’s bigger than that. He was encouraging them to do what Morehouse has always encouraged its graduates to do — serve humanity and change the world.

Their idea of being a man is toxic.\"\n\n\"But that's not you. It's not us,\" he said.\n\nBiden's remarks to the 414 graduates at Morehouse, an all-male historically Black college in Atlanta, came as he is struggling to unite Black voters, particularly Black men, around his candidacy. Many Morehouse students and faculty criticized Biden's participation when it was announced because of his support for Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n\"In a democracy, we debate dissent about America's role in the world. I want to say this very clearly: I support peaceful, nonviolent protest,\" Biden said on Sunday in response to the complaints. \"Your voices should be heard. I promise you, I hear them.\"\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nNo major disruptions, but peaceful protests target Biden\n\nAlthough there were no major disruptions during Biden's speech, a few students walked out when Biden received an honorary Morehouse degree. More than a dozen graduates and at least three faculty members wore keffiyehs, while one student entered the ceremony draped in a Palestinian flag.\n\nAs Biden delivered his address, at least one female faculty member stood in the opposite direction, her fist raised, in a sign of protest.\n\nBiden, wearing a maroon gown at the outdoor ceremony, said his administration is \"working around the clock for more than just one cease-fire,\" but also to \"bring the region together.\" He reiterated his support for a two-state solution in which Israelis and Palestinians live in peace.\n\n\"This is one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world. There's nothing easy about it,\" Biden said. \"I know it angers and frustrates many of you, including my family, but most of all, I know it breaks your heart. It breaks mine as well.\"\n\nBiden added that leadership is about \"fighting through the most intractable problems\" to \"find a solution by doing what you believe is right, even when it's hard and lonely.\"\n\nAbout a mile away, pro-Palestinian protesters held a rally organized under the banner of \"Say No to Genocide Joe Speaking at Morehouse.\" Morehouse's valedictorian also raised Israel's war in Gaza during his remarks before Biden took the lectern.\n\n\"It is my stance as a Morehouse man – nay as a human being – to call for an immediate and the permanent cease-fire in the Gaza Strip,\" graduating senior DeAngelo Jeremiah Fletcher said, with Biden sitting just steps behind him. Biden applauded in response.\n\nBiden touts record with Black voters\n\nPolling shows Biden is vastly underperforming his 2020 performance among Black voters, a reliably Democratic constituency, as some drift to Donald Trump, the former president and presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nA New York Times/Siena College poll of six battleground states, including Georgia, found Biden has support from 60% of Black voters and Trump, while Trump is backed by 20% of Black voters. Biden won Black voters in the 2020 election by a 87%-12% margin, according to exit polls.\n\nAhead of Biden's arrival, Anwar Karim, a sophomore studying film at Morehouse and a member of Atlanta University Center Students for Justice in Palestine, told USA TODAY he was disappointed in his school’s choice of commencement speaker. He also decried Morehouse’s decision to award Biden an honorary degree, which is typically awarded to the school’s commencement speaker after a faculty vote.\n\n“Morehouse College is dedicated to producing men of consequence who lead lives of service and leadership, and I just have to beg the question, when it comes to Biden, what is an example of his leadership?” Karim said Friday.\n\nBiden commits to showing 'democracy is still the way'\n\nIn his speech, Biden touted his presidency as one that has delivered to Black Americans, pointing to efforts to invest in Black families and communities, cut child poverty, expand work opportunities, reduce prescription drug prices and cut student loan debt. He called out the \"poison of white supremacy\" and \"systemic racism.\"\n\nHe said he is committed to \"show that democracy, democracy, democracy is still the way,\" even in the face of inequality for Black Americans.\n\n\"What is democracy if Black men are being killed in the street? What is democracy if the trail of broken promises still leave Black communities behind?\" Biden said. \"What is democracy if you have to be ten times better than anyone else to get a fair shot? Most of all, what does it mean, as you've heard before, to be a Black man who loves his country even if it doesn't love him back in equal measure?\"\n\nBiden railed against new voting restrictions in Georgia and the \"constant attacks on Black election workers.\" He also said those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 \"are called patriots by some,\" a clear reference to Trump.\n\n“Not in my house,\" Biden said.\n\nIn the days leading up to his Morehouse visit, the White House focused on Black outreach. Biden met on Thursday with plaintiffs of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, on the 70th anniversary of the dismantling of the \"separate but equal\" precedent. On Friday, Biden met with leaders of the \"Divine Nine\" HBCU sororities and fraternities.\n\nMore:In a nod to history, Biden meets with Brown v. Board of Education families\n\nIn Atlanta on Saturday, Biden spoke to Morehouse alumni and others at a campaign event at Mary Mac's Tea Room. \"The fact is, this election, lots at stake, lots at stake. It's not about me. It's about the alternative as well,\" Biden said. \"My opponent's not a good loser, but he is a loser.\"\n\nIntroducing Biden, Morehouse President David Thomas said, \"No administration in history, since the inception of historically Black colleges and universities, has invested more in our institutions than the Biden administration.\"\n\n\"And if you look at his policies, it is very clear that those investments are not charity,\" Thomas said.\n\nBiden, 81, closed his remarks with a reference to his age, a liability that has hung over his reelection. When he started his political career, Biden said he was told he was \"too young.\" Now he hears he's \"too old.\"\n\n\"Whether you're young or old, I know what endures: The strength and wisdom of faith endures. And my challenge to you is to still keep the faith as long as you can,\" Biden said. \"Together we're capable of building a democracy worthy of our dreams.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/05/19/obama-morehouse-college-commencement/2324241/", "title": "Obama: There's no longer time for excuses for black men", "text": "Aamer Madhani\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nPresident Obama delivered the commencement address at the Atlanta school\n\nObama called on graduates of the historically black college to be role models\n\nSays African Americans must have empathy for other minority groups%27 struggles\n\nPresident Obama on Sunday told the graduating class at Morehouse College, the country's pre-eminent historically black college, there is \"no time for excuses\" for this generation of African-American men and that it was time for their generation to step up professionally and in their personal lives.\n\n\n\n\n\nObama, the country's first African-American president, chose a particularly poignant moment to deliver the commencement address at the Atlanta college that boasts civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., filmmaker Spike Lee and Atlanta's first African-American mayor, Maynard Jackson, among its alumni.\n\nObama's visit comes nearly 50 years after King led the March on Washington, and 150 years after Abraham Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nThe president connected his own path to the White House to the work of King and other African-American leaders of that generation. But Obama also conceded that at times as a young man he wrongly blamed his own failings \"as just another example of the world trying to keep a black man down.\"\n\n\"We've got no time for excuses — not because the bitter legacies of slavery and segregation have vanished entirely; they haven't,\" Obama told the graduating class and their families who sat through intermittent rain and thunder. \"It's just that in today's hyperconnected, hypercompetitive world, with a billion young people from China and India and Brazil entering the global workforce alongside you, nobody is going to give you anything you haven't earned.\"\n\nObama spoke in very personal terms to the 500 young men as he urged them to not only become leaders in their community, but also good fathers and good husbands. Obama, who was raised by a single mother and grandparents, lamented the absence of his father in his life and urged the graduates to make family their top priority.\n\nObama told the Morehouse men they are also obliged to set an example for other black men.\n\n\"Keep setting an example for what it means to be a man,\" Obama said. \"Be the best husband to your wife, or boyfriend to your partner, or father to your children that you can be. Because nothing is more important.\"\n\nIn the weeks ahead of the commencement, a spat between the college administration and alumni over the role a Philadelphia pastor would play during graduation weekend threatened to cast a shadow on the president's historic visit.\n\nMorehouse President John Silvanus Wilson and a group of alumni sparred after Wilson invited alumnus Kevin Johnson to deliver the baccalaureate sermon only to later to diminish his role.\n\nWilson, a former adviser in the Obama administration, told Johnson he was changing the ceremony to a multispeaker format after Johnson wrote an op-ed in a Philadelphia newspaper criticizing the president for appointing too few African Americans to senior Cabinet positions.\n\nA dozen prominent alumni spoke out against the decision, and Johnson initially refused to take part in the baccalaureate under a multispeaker format.\n\nBut last week, Wilson and Johnson came to a resolution and Johnson delivered the baccalaureate sermon, while two recent alumni were given lesser speaking roles.\n\nThe college was also shaken by news earlier this month that four Morehouse students were charged with sexual assault in which two women from nearby Spelman College were the alleged victims.\n\nIn his speech, Obama also connected the discrimination that African Americans have faced with some of the struggles of minority groups — including gays and lesbians fighting for the right to marriage, Hispanic Americans battling anti-immigrant bias and Muslims who face suspicion because of their faith.\n\nHaving a personal understanding of discrimination, Obama said, this generation of African Americans is uniquely equipped to be leaders for the country and world on these issues.\n\n\"If you tap into that experience, it should endow you with empathy — the understanding of what it's like to walk in somebody else's shoes,\" Obama said. \"It should give you an ability to connect.

But weeks after extending the invitation, Morehouse President John Silvanus Wilson Jr. — who previously headed the White House Initiative on Historically Black Colleges and Universities — contacted Johnson and informed him that he had decided to change Johnson's address into a \"multi-speaker\" event to broaden the views represented after Johnson penned a scathing criticism of Obama in The Philadelphia Tribune.\n\nJohnson declined the offer under the new terms and charged in a letter to Wilson that he was \"disinvited\" over the opinion piece. Several alumni of the all-men's college also criticized Wilson for the decision.\n\n\"In an academic institution ... it's the wrong message to send graduating seniors who are going out into a diverse world,\" the Rev.

Debt that could have taken many graduates — and their families — decades to pay off was apparently gone for the 396 young men in the class at the historically black college.\n\n\"It's really shocking that I'm starting with a clean slate,\" said Mathis, 21, who graduated from University of Detroit Jesuit High School in 2015, \"and that I don't have any student debt, which is really terrorizing my peers across the country.\"\n\nMuch of America remains in shock after African American billionaire Robert F. Smith told the all-male Morehouse Class of 2019 that he and his family would pay off the student loans for the entire class.\n\nMore:How to pay off student loans without a billionaire bailout\n\nThat special 2019 graduating class includes 11 students from Michigan altogether, one from Detroit, according to Morehouse's records. The other Michigan students are from West Bloomfield, St. Clair, Lansing, Ann Arbor, Troy, Highland Park, Lake Orion and Grand Rapids, according to Morehouse.\n\nThe inspiring gift was estimated to be worth anywhere from $10 million to nearly $40 million, depending on what's actually covered.\n\nJust what is covered, though, remained a mystery for families days after the commencement address. Would tens of thousands of dollars taken out by individual families under the Parent PLUS student loan program be covered too? Mom and dads are hoping that's the case.\n\nIt isn't a small point, given that 70% of the student loans that Mathis has were taken out by his parents under the Parent PLUS program. Many families at Morehouse rely on the federal government loans for parents to cover what can be a large gap left after students hit the limit on their own federal student loans, scholarships and savings.\n\nEven so, no one expected to contemplate anything like this on that hot Atlanta Sunday. Smith caught everyone by surprise.\n\nWas that for real?\n\n\"Did he just say that?\" recalled Joshua Adkins, 21, as he described the reaction of his fellow classmates at the Morehouse graduation ceremony.\n\nAdkins, who grew up in West Bloomfield and graduated from Detroit Country Day in 2015, soon found himself interviewed by CNN about the wild graduation day experience.\n\nAdkins never had any student loans. He didn't tell his friends that he didn't have any debt, though, knowing some good fortune shouldn't be shared too easily.\n\nHis father Michael Adkins, who is now retired, was a vice president at the Chubb Corp. His mother Sandy Adkins worked in real estate.\n\n\"My parents have been saving a lot and they had the opportunity to pay for it. I was very blessed,\" Adkins said.\n\nAdkins — who achieved the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America — had received some smaller scholarships to help cover college costs, too.\n\nEven so, Adkins was thrilled about the news for his friends, who had owed anywhere from $30,000 to $150,000 in student loans at graduation.\n\nBased on 2017 data, the average debt for graduates from the private, historically black, all-male Morehouse College then was $31,833 in 2017, with 80% of graduates carrying student loan debt, according to the Project on Student Debt published by the Institute for College Access & Success. (Those figures do not include loans borrowed by parents under the federal Parent PLUS program.)\n\nAdkins, who majored in finance with a minor in Spanish, said he knows plenty of students who obtained finance degrees because they wanted jobs that could help them pay off student loans.\n\n\"It's now a weight lifted off their shoulders,\" said Adkins, who will start work at the global consulting firm Accenture in Atlanta in September.\n\nMore options for grads\n\nWho knows, maybe a graduate now can afford to take a risk on a dream job? Or a few may have more flexibility to leave a job that ends up being a bad fit? Or maybe move to a different city?\n\nMore:Millennials buried in debt can't buy into American Dream\n\nMore:Billionaire pledges to pay off $40 million in student loan debt for Morehouse College class of 2019\n\nMore:Elizabeth Warren's plan for student loan forgiveness: Don't bank on it\n\nAdkins also took heart in Smith's speech.\n\nAdkins said the billionaire's message was clear: \"We are enough to lift each other up, and when he said 'we' he meant the entire African-American community.\"\n\n'Couldn't believe it'\n\nMathis said Smith surprised everyone.\n\n\"He kind of said that out of the blue.\"\n\nSeconds after the remarks were made, Mathis said his mother immediately texted him and told him to be certain to thank Smith on the spot when Mathis received his diploma. He did just that and others did the same.\n\nMany students in the crowd shouted MVP — most valuable player or philanthropist.\n\n\"My first thought was this is amazing,\" said Printess Mathis, Kristopher's mother who was in Atlanta for the graduation with other family members.\n\n\"We could not believe it,\" she said.\n\nShe said the family wanted Kristopher to go to Morehouse and knew that sacrifices would need to be made.\n\n\"A lot of times parents really don't realize how much a toll it takes on the family,\" she said.\n\nBut her son worked hard at getting good grades, getting involved in outside activities and improving his chances for scholarships while he was in college, she said.\n\nScholarships exist: Oprah Winfrey, for example, began supporting Morehouse students in 1989 with a $1 million contribution made during commencement exercises that established the Oprah Winfrey Endowed Scholarship Fund. Winfrey's total gift stands at $12 million, according to the Morehouse site.\n\nMathis said he learned that he had to network to build relationships with professors at the school and others to get a better grasp on the opportunities for scholarships.\n\nAll that helped put a lid on the debt.\n\nGraduating cum laude\n\nFrankly, Mathis felt fortunate that he was looking at only $57,000 in student loan debt, nothing close to the six figures that others have, before the commencement speech began last Sunday.\n\nMathis — who was graduated cum laude with a bachelor of arts degree in business administration with a concentration in marketing and a minor in sales — has a job with a \"great salary\" as an account executive lined up in Chicago at Amazon. He starts in July.\n\nHis father, Derrick Mathis, works at UPS. His mother has a job as well. The family lives in East English Village in Detroit.\n\n\"I didn't grow up impoverished,\" he said, describing his family as middle class. \"My parents worked — literally worked — very hard to get me everything I needed. My dad was constantly working.\"\n\nMathis and his mother said they're both hopeful that Smith's promise will pay the student loans that his parents took on, too. His mother said Tuesday that the family had not yet received any specifics on how the loans will be paid or what will be covered.\n\nBut the family is thankful.\n\n\"I'm really grateful that Mr. Smith made the remarks that he did,\" he said.\n\n\"He understands that student loan debt in America is really setting students back at the start of their journey,\" he said.\n\n\"He's really changing lives for the future — generationally changing lives. It's amazing what he did.\"\n\nMathis knows some students and their families who easily owe well into six-figures in student loans.\n\n\"There are a lot of brothers who graduated with me who are in way different circumstances than I am.\"\n\nMorehouse College provided this statement: “We, at Morehouse College, would like to thank Vista Equity Partners founder, Chairman & CEO Robert F. Smith, our honorary alumnus, for the surprise gift that he offered to the graduating class at Morehouse's 135th Commencement ceremony.\"\n\n\"To be free from the financial burden of paying off student loans will be life-changing for the Class of 2019,\" the statement said.\n\n\"Our Office of Business and Finance, as well as our Office of Enrollment Management, have been working diligently to calculate the student loan debt and other details of this gift. As soon as we have a final figure, we will share it with our new graduates so that they can continue on the path to careers and top-tier graduate schools student loan debt free.”\n\n$1.46 trillion outstanding\n\nThe big-picture scary numbers surrounding the student debt crisis have been well reported.\n\nOutstanding student loan debt nationwide stood at $1.46 trillion in the fourth quarter of 2018, according to a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.\n\nThose ages 18 to 29 had the most college debt — more than $1 trillion.\n\nAbout 65% of college seniors who graduated from public and private nonprofit colleges in 2017 had student loan debt, according to the Project on Student Debt. Borrowers owed an average of $28,650, roughly 1% higher than the 2016 average. Updated figures will be released later this year. (Those figures do not include loans borrowed by parents under the federal Parent PLUS program.)\n\nParents of Morehouse grads tend to take on a good deal of student loan debt, too.\n\nMathis said his parents didn't try to take out more in loans in the sophomore year too because it didn't seem realistic.\n\nSo Mathis said at times he wasn't even sure if he'd make it back to Morehouse for a second year. He worked to obtain scholarships and other money.\n\nBut it wasn't enough.\n\nHe remembers sitting at the financial aid offices during the week before you could drop classes that sophomore year. He wasn’t sure if he was staying or going.\n\n\"I was really sad. I was fed up,\" he said.\n\nBut someone in the academic affairs office took notice and helped him get more financial aid to cover the rest of the balance.\n\nMathis knows that he could have chosen a less expensive college. He said he was accepted to Michigan State University, Central Michigan University, Howard University, Hampton University, as well as Morehouse. Morehouse has a sticker price of around $49,000 a year for tuition, room and board and other costs, according to the website College Simply.\n\nYet Mathis said he was impressed with Morehouse when he visited Atlanta on a college tour with the mentor group, the Midnight Golf Program, a nonprofit based in Bingham Farms.\n\nMathis said he watched other UDJ grads who went to Morehouse before him develop into strong young men.\n\nSo he felt he was destined to go to Morehouse to \"grow as a man, especially as a black man.\"\n\n\"It's not necessarily the most financially responsible decision to make,\" Mathis said. \"A lot of people do take that leap of faith.\"\n\n\"It's been a very challenging journey but it's really good to see the blessings that are unfolding before me,\" he said.\n\nContactSusan Tompor at313-222-8876 or stompor@freepress.com.

And honestly, this administration has done so much,\" Crockett told CNN Sunday. \"They've done so much, but I don't think that the information has been pushed out continually.\"\n\nAmong the list of achievements, Crockett said, is a historic investment in historically Black colleges and universities, like Morehouse. \"I think that Black folk need to know that this administration has actually invested in them,\" Crockett said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/06/02/johnnie-morris-iiis-journey-monticello-morehouse-college/1282576001/", "title": "Johnnie Morris III's journey from Monticello to Morehouse College", "text": "It’s been two weeks since Johnnie Morris III experienced two of the most memorable occasions of his 22 years of life:\n\nGraduating from the prestigious all-male Morehouse College in Atlanta and hearing commencement speaker, billionaire tech investor Robert Smith, tell Morris and 397 classmates he was paying off each of their student loan debts.\n\nThe Monticello native and Rickards High School graduate is still trying to get his arms around it.\n\n“We all looked at each other and said, ‘No, he really didn’t do that,“ he recalled of hearing Smith’s words. “We started shouting, jumping, crying and hugging each other.”\n\nThe experience has yet to settle in. First graduating, and then having a mechanism in place to have his $40,000 in student loans debt wiped clean.\n\n“Honestly, it hasn’t hit me that I’ve graduated,” said Morris, who earned a degree in English and is seeking a job in journalism. “It’s left me feeling amazed because now I don’t have that (financial) worry anymore. I’m now in the position to pay it forward.”\n\nMorris’s enthusiasm is shared equally shared by his parents, Johnnie Morris II and his wife, Erma.\n\n“It was such a relief,” Erma Morris said. “We never expected to hear that. All I could say is ‘Oh, my God. Oh, my God.’ I’m still saying that.\n\n“It was like God was there through the whole ordeal, from elementary school through college.\"\n\nMorris' father said it was the God in Smith that moved him to make the pledge for the students.\n\n“I was proud of my son, too,\" he added. \"God was in this from the beginning.”\n\nThe pathway to Morehouse College — one of the country’s most prestigious institutions with an annual price tag of $48,700 — has not been easy for Morris.\n\n“It meant a lot to us because Johnnie has faced some challenges in his education throughout,” Erma Morris said. “He’s had some challenges that could have hindered him from succeeding.”\n\nMore:Billionaire pledges to pay off $40 million in student loan debt for Morehouse College class of 2019\n\nMore:Robert F. Smith gift to Morehouse highlights burden of student loan debt: Three fast facts\n\nOvercoming the odds\n\nOne of the biggest came early.\n\nJohnnie, who had been diagnosed with learning disabilities, was arrested on four felony counts of assault as a second grader at Jefferson County Elementary School.\n\nHe was 7 years old.\n\nSchool authorities said he got “into an altercation” with another student, and then struck a teacher, the school’s principal and the school resource officer.\n\nErma Morris was called to pick up her son who had been suspended.\n\n“A couple of days later, they called me to bring him to the jail,” she said. “They had four felony charges waiting on him. They arrested him an put him in the adult population.”\n\nLater that day, Morris was sent to a juvenile detention center in Tallahassee, where he was later released.\n\nErma Morris believes the harsh punishment was in response to her complaints that the school was not prepared to address her son’s learning needs. It would be more than a year before the courts decided to drop charges.\n\nHis parents enrolled him in the Latma Christian Academy in Madison for his second and third grades, then to Franklin Academy in Tallahassee, followed by Innovation School of Excellence in Tallahassee, where he received one-on-one instruction and performed well academically.\n\nThat continued when he enrolled in Rickards. Morris was on the track and field teams and played in the school band. His parents drove him to and from school each day until he was of age to drive himself.\n\n“You can see why I’m so happy he graduated (from Morehouse),” Erma Morris said last week.\n\nMorris said he felt comfortable at Rickards, and as a result, he succeeded.\n\n“There was a big turnaround in my academics,” he said. “It made me appreciate school more.”\n\nHis arrest is something he doesn’t spend time recounting.\n\n“It has no impact on me at all,” he said. “It’s honestly something that is behind me. I’m looking forward.”\n\nA 'Morehouse Man'\n\nMorris applied to Florida A&M University, Howard University and Morehouse on the advice of a church member. He was accepted at FAMU and Morehouse.\n\nMorehouse's price tag was steep and not within the family’s budget. His father works in the lawn business and his mother is a private caretaker who also cleans houses.\n\nMorris is next to the youngest of six children. His younger sister, Jasmine, graduated this spring from Tallahassee Community College.\n\nBut they sacrificed and received support from local churches, which held fundraisers, especially New Bethel AME and Bethel AME, both in Monticello.\n\nJohnnie took out student loans. The average student loan debt for a Morehouse graduate runs $35,000 to $40,000.\n\n“I didn’t object because I knew what he had gone through,” his mother said. “I didn’t want to give him anymore disappointment.”\n\nMorris entered Morehouse in fall 2015. He was named an Adams Scholar, a fellowship awarded to students for their commitment to community service. He worked as an editor for the Bonner Office of Community Service, volunteered as a teaching assistant and mentor at local elementary schools and volunteered at the Atlanta Community Food Bank.\n\nBecoming a “Morehouse Man” as its graduates are known, has helped give him focus of the importance of giving back.\n\n“I felt like I was surrounded by a community where everyone wanted me to succeed,” Morris said of his college experience. “It felt like home. All of my brothers on campus felt like real brothers.”\n\nBack home, Morris and his family last year established Behind The Scenes Outreach, Inc., a nonprofit that will focus on involving youth in community outreach and mentoring.\n\nMorris is even more inspired now to accept Smith’s challenge to his class to pay it forward, as he did for them.\n\n“I tell myself it’s a blessing,” Morris said. “And, one of the best graduation gifts ever.”\n\nMore:Robert F.

Wood is the first non-Jazz player to test positive, widening the potential scope of the outbreak.

T.J. Rainsford, a spokesman for the 18th Airborne Corps, said that as of Saturday morning, there were no positive cases of the new coronavirus at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the largest Army installation in the country.\n\nThe quarantining of the soldiers was directed by the Army, which said that troops leaving areas that are labeled Level 2 or higher by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention should stay in quarantine for two weeks.\n\nWhile in quarantine, the paratroopers will be monitored for health and get appropriate medical treatment, according to the division.\n\n– Rachael Riley and Steve DeVane, The Fayetteville (N.C.) Observer\n\nAt least 20 states close all schools\n\nTwenty states and a number of large urban school districts – including Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest – are shutting down all K-12 schools as part of a sweeping attempt to contain the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAlabama, Alaska, Delaware, Florida, Kentucky, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin have made plans to close all schools.\n\nIn addition to Los Angeles, major metropolitan districts in Atlanta, Austin, Denver, Miami-Dade County, San Francisco, San Diego and Washington, D.C., have also shuttered. A growing number of smaller districts around the country have also chosen to close.\n\nAccording to a count updated mid-afternoon Friday by Education Week magazine, about a quarter of American schoolchildren had been or were scheduled to be affected by a school closures – and that was before some states announced their actions.\n\nThe magazine said at least 46,000 schools were closed, are scheduled to close, or were closed and later reopened, affecting at least 21 million students.\n\nCustoms intercepts fake virus tests\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection is advising Americans to be aware of “bogus home testing kits for sale either online or in informal direct to consumer settings” after officers at Los Angeles International Airport intercepted a package containing suspected counterfeit COVID-19 test kits arriving from the United Kingdom, the agency said Saturday.\n\nThe officers discovered six plastic bags containing various vials while conducting an enforcement examination Thursday.

Households have until July 31 to respond to the population survey.\n\nCivil rights groups said they’re worried about the safety of census takers and are concerned communities that have long been under counted may not respond.\n\nCensus officials have been scrambling to meet deadlines, including recruiting and hiring thousands of workers who will knock on the doors of people who don’t respond to the survey. The deadlines are critical as the Census is required to provide information to Congress. That information is used to distribute billions in federal funds and determine the number of members of Congress for each state.\n\n— Deborah Berry\n\nNCAA had, spent rainy-day fund\n\nThe cancellation of the NCAA’s Division I men’s and women’s basketball tournaments is likely to wreak financial havoc on colleges and universities that depend on the millions of dollars in revenue the games bring in.\n\nIt turns out the NCAA did have the foresight to begin planning for an unknown catastrophic event that would threaten its biggest and most lucrative event.\n\nBy 2014, the association had accumulated a nearly $400 million cushion as a hedge against a massive loss of revenue from the tournament.\n\nThen, at the direction of its governing board of college presidents, the NCAA distributed that money to schools to help them with increasing costs and spent it on their behalf in other ways, including a $208.7 million legal settlement.\n\n“The NCAA will be fine,” said Barbara Osborne, a sports administration professor at the University of North Carolina. “But all schools will be having huge belt tightening because of this.” Read more here.\n\n– Steve Berkowitz\n\nMnuchin says more bills coming on cruise, hotel, airline assistance\n\nTreasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin praised the legislation passed by the House early Saturday morning and said the next round of legislation would address the cruise, hotel and airline industries.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday in a letter to lawmakers the House would start work on a third legislative package to \"protect the health, economic security and well-being of the American people.\"\n\nThe House passed a bill early in the morning to provide paid sick leave and free coronavirus testing, and Mnuchin told reporters the bill \"delivers on what the president announced in his speech the other night.\"\n\n\"People who need to be quarantined, we want them at home and we don't want them to fear not getting paid,\" he continued.\n\nMnuchin said there was language agreed to with Pelosi and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy that did not make it into the final bill, \"so there will be a technical correction Monday morning.\"\n\n- Nicholas Wu and Courtney Subramanian\n\nTrump: Federal Reserve should be ‘more proactive’\n\nTrump again slammed the Federal Reserve on Saturday, saying the central bank hasn’t done enough to calm financial markets amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt an unusual Saturday news conference, Trump offered praise to Congress, the American people and even the press for their response to the coronavirus scare. But the Fed – one of his favorite targets – got only presidential scorn.\n\n“I thought the Fed would be and should be much more proactive,” Trump said. “Our Fed is following.”\n\nTrump is frequently critical of the Fed and Chairman Jerome Powell, whom he appointed to the chairmanship in 2017. Trump claims that interest rate hikes have slowed economic growth.\n\nThe Fed cut interest rates two weeks ago in a rare emergency move in response to the threat the coronavirus posed to the economy and financial markets. But Trump thinks it should be doing more.\n\n“Our Fed is not doing what they should be doing,” he said, arguing the U.S. shouldn’t have a rate higher than competitor nations such as Germany and Japan.\n\nAsked whether he intends to fire Powell, Trump said he has the authority to do so, “but I’m not doing it.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nFrance closes all schools, restaurants, Eiffel tower; Spain locks down 46M citizens, Israel bans gatherings\n\nFrance and Spain followed Italy's lead with tough new measures, leaving the Eiffel Tower and Louvre shuttered and 46 million Spanish citizens in a lockdown.\n\nItaly also invoked sharp new measures, including closing playgrounds and parks.\n\nFrance's orders closed cafes, restaurant and cinemas. The government has banned all gatherings of more than 100 people, ordered all schools closed and asked companies to allow workers to stay home.\n\nIn declaring a two-week state of emergency Saturday, Spain prepared to close all schools, universities, restaurants, bars and hotels nationwide.\n\nSpain’s declaration comes as coronavirus cases soared to over 5,700 with 136 deaths. The declaration also would allow the government to limit free movement, confiscate goods and take over control of industries and private facilities, including private hospitals.\n\nResidents of Madrid, which has around half the infections, and northeastern Catalonia awoke to shuttered bars and restaurants and other non-essential commercial outlets as ordered by regional authorities.\n\nIn Italy, mayors of many cities, including Rome and Milan, decided to close public playgrounds and parks as European countries fashion different polices to try to combat the spread of the virus.\n\nElsewhere, Denmark and Poland became the latest countries to shut their borders to most travelers.\n\nIsrael on Saturday banned gatherings of more than ten people and ordered that restaurants and movie theaters close.

It is intended to cut red tape that otherwise might hold up emergency relief, officials said.\n\nIt will apply to drivers hauling critical medical supplies like masks, hand sanitizer, soap and disinfectants needed by health care workers. Also mentioned are sanitation supplies for communities. Included, too, is food for emergency restocking of stores, workers and supplies for temporary housing or quarantine facilities related to COVID-19 and transportation of medical or other emergency-service personnel.\n\n\"This declaration will help America’s commercial drivers get these critical goods to impacted areas faster and more efficiently,\" said Jim Mullen, acting administrator of the department's Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration.\n\nThe order requires truckers be allowed to rest for a minimum of 10 consecutive hours if they say they need time off before returning to work at the terminal or their normal reporting location. Normally, truckers are subject to elaborate rules that limit them to 11 hours of driving a day during a 14-hour period after 10 hours of rest.\n\nThe administration's order includes stipulations to prevent abuse. It won't apply to commercial deliveries, for instance, or to mixed loads – items both considered part of the emergency relief shipped along with general cargo.\n\n- Chris Woodyard\n\nAhead of Pence briefing, White House checks temperatures for those around Trump, Pence\n\nAhead of a press briefing Saturday with Vice President Mike Pence, a member of the White House Physicians Office took the temperature of reporters and television crews.\n\n\"Out of an abundance of caution, temperature checks are now being performed on any individuals who are in close contact with the President and Vice President,\" said White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere.\n\nOne symptom of the coronavirus, which has been named COVID-19, is a fever.\n\nOne reporter whose temperature was too high was escorted out by staff. Pence's press secretary Katie Miller said the White House Medical Unit took the person's temperature three times over a 15-minute period and that \"all three registered above the @CDCgov 100.4 guidelines.\"\n\n– Nicholas Wu\n\nGet daily coronavirus updates in your inbox: Sign up for the Daily Briefing.\n\nTrump awaiting coronavirus test results\n\nTrump said Saturday he had taken the test for the coronavirus following his recent exposure to two Brazilian officials who later tested positive for the virus.\n\nTrump told reporters his temperature was \"totally normal\" and that he took the test Friday night, and the results would take \"few days\" while it was sent to a lab.\n\nA White House doctor issued a statement late Friday saying the president didn't need to get tested or self-quarantined for coronavirus because he had not exhibited any symptoms.

Democrats and advocates have criticized the Trump administration for not doing enough to address the crisis.\n\n“I’m extremely concerned that our lack of preparedness ... would result in a Katrina-like response where there was vast inequities between who receive services and who did not receive services and that line was drawn based on race, primarily, and class,’’ Derrick Johnson, president of the national NAACP, told USA TODAY.\n\nFormer President George W.

It’s based on modeling of the novel coronavirus that now informs policy in the United Kingdom and other nations.\n\nAnd it endeavors to answer the question everyone is asking:\n\nWhat the hell is going on?\n\nWhy are we shutting down our daily lives, our economies, our human interaction?\n\nAs almost all of us retreat to our homes for a long period of social separation from others in our communities, we’re asking another important question:\n\nJust how long is this going to last?\n\nThe paper with the interminable name, whose lead researcher, Neil M. Ferguson, is an epidemiologist at Imperial College and professor of mathematical biology who specializes in infectious disease spread in humans and animals, has an answer.\n\nWe’re in for a long slog.\n\n“The global impact of COVID-19 has been profound,” writes Ferguson and 29 others, “and the public health threat it represents is the most serious seen in a respiratory virus since the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic.”\n\nHere's the problem:\n\nA new virus, unleashed on the world in Wuhan, China, is now spreading across the globe. Its destructive power is such that it very rapidly sickens people, particularly the elderly, to the point that large percentages require critical care at hospitals to save their lives.\n\nThe numbers of patients have been so large in some regions of the world that they have completely overwhelmed health-care systems and forced war-time like triage decisions of life and death.\n\nIn Italy some patients can’t even get into the hospitals and die at home.\n\nIn dealing with this problem, there are two fundamental strategies to employ: “mitigation” and “suppression,” write the authors.\n\nMitigation works to slow, not stop, the spread of disease, by encouraging home isolation of those believed infected, home quarantine for those living in the same home with them and social distancing of the elderly and other at-risk populations.\n\nSuppression requires social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of infected patients and quarantine of their family members. It can require closing schools and universities.\n\n“Each policy has major challenges,” write the authors.\n\nAccording to their U.K. and U.S. modeling, mitigation would reduce health care demand by two-thirds and deaths by half. It would still result in “hundreds of thousands of deaths” and would still overwhelm the intensive care units in our hospitals “many times over.”\n\nSuppression would require strict adherence until a vaccine is developed and scaled up for the larger public. That could take “potentially 18 months or more.” If relaxed before that time, “transmission will quickly rebound.”\n\n“We conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission.”\n\nIf social distancing is effective, it “may allow interventions to be relaxed temporarily in relative short time windows, but measures will need to be reintroduced if or when case numbers rebound,” the authors write.\n\n“… while experience in China and now South Korea show that suppression is possible in the short term, it remains to be seen whether it is possible long-term, and whether the social and economic costs of the interventions adopted thus far can be reduced.”\n\nOn Sunday, The (U.K.) Guardian newspaper reported that secret briefing papers delivered to National Health Service officials project the epidemic will infect 80% percent of all Britons and last until the spring of 2021.\n\n“The document, seen by the Guardian, is the first time health chiefs tackling the virus have admitted that they expect it to circulate for 12 more months and lead to huge extra strain on an already overstretched NHS.\n\nIt also suggests that health chiefs are braced for widespread infection. Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, told The Guardian:\n\n“For the public to hear that it could last for 12 months, people are going to be really upset about that and pretty worried about that. … A year is entirely plausible. But that figure isn’t well appreciated or understood. “I think it will dip in the summer, towards the end of June, and come back in November, in the way that usual seasonal flu does. I think it will be around forever, but become less severe over time, as immunity builds up.”\n\nTHE VIRUS DOESN’T CARE ABOUT YOUR POLITICS\n\nWe are in the middle of both a global health-care crisis and a presidential election. It would have been impossible to keep politics out of the decision-making as we ramp up to confront the novel coronavirus.\n\nBut we have to try to keep it out, writes Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and former commissioner of the New York City Health Department.\n\nFrieden’s observations are noteworthy because they are published on the VOX news and opinion website that is generally projecting a liberal slant – a slant that more than not agrees with the Democratic Party.\n\nThe Republican White House has made a number of missteps on testing, and the president as erred repeatedly with some of his public comments, notably his criticism of the U.S. Centers for Disease controls, notes Frieden.\n\nBut the White House has also done good, he argues:\n\n“Whatever your view of the current administration, some of its actions have saved lives. The ban on travel from China undoubtedly reduced the number of Americans who became infected with Covid-19. The new ban on travel from the EU could have some benefit — but only if we understand that this delays disease spread and does not prevent it, and is justified only if we use the time it buys ...”\n\nThe administration has made key mistakes on testing. It failed to quickly recognize and break through the bureaucratic labyrinth at the CDC and Food and Drug Administration that was blocking rapid development and deployment of COVID-19 tests.\n\nBut a lot of the criticism, while legitimate, has overlooked the limitations of testing, Frieden explains.\n\n“A surge in people being tested could actually spread disease, because people can become infected by someone else waiting to be tested. Getting tested today is no guarantee you won’t get infected tomorrow — and may give you a false sense of security. Furthermore, emerging data suggests that testing of throat swabs may miss as many as two-thirds of infections.”\n\nTesting is vital in many scenarios, particularly used in places where there are few confirmed infections, Frieden explains. In such cases, testing can inform containment and isolation strategies. Seattle, in fact, might have avoided full-fledged breakout had the federal government provided them the testing authority or test kits they needed.\n\nThe American health-care system is facing an enormous challenge. It will need the help of all of the American people to slow the spread of COVID-19 and prevent the overload of emergency rooms and hospital wards.\n\nBoth sides have been guilty of playing politics with this issue. Given the stakes, Frieden writes, we need to put down our swords.\n\n“Partisanship has no place when lives are at stake. Covid-19 might even help all of us realize that we are all connected, and although we need to increase social distance, we also need to increase solidarity to help each other get through what has quickly become a national and global crisis.”\n\nMEXICO TALKS OF TIGHTENED U.S. BORDER\n\nMexico’s Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell told a news conference Friday that novel coronavirus in the United States more likely poses a threat to Mexico than Mexico poses to the United States, reports Yahoo News:\n\n\"If it were technically necessary to consider mechanisms of restriction or stronger surveillance we would have to take into account not that Mexico would bring the virus to the United States, rather that the United States could bring it here.\"\n\nThe Mexicans are likely responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s foolish assertion that a wall is needed “more than ever” because of coronavirus.\n\nCORONAVIRUS MORE LIKE 1957 PANDEMIC\n\nNicholas A. Christakis, physician and Sterling Professor of Social & Natural Science at Yale, who was famously caught in the maelstrom of identity politics at Yale in 2015 (you can see it here and here), argues in a Twitter thread that our more relevant parallel to the past is not the Spanish Flu of 1918 but the 1957 Influenza-A (H2N2) pandemic.\n\nThat outbreak killed 1.1 million people globally and 115,700 in the United States.\n\nYou can read his thread here.\n\nChristakis in 2009 was named to the TIME 100 list of the magazine's 100 most influential people in the world. In 2009 and 2010, Foreign Policy magazine named him in its list of top global thinkers.\n\nBRITAIN PUTS MANUFACTURERS ON WARTIME FOOTING\n\nThe British government is calling on carmakers and other manufactures to shift to producing medical ventilators now in short supply with the global outbreak of COVID-19. Ventilators are necessary to assist breathing and save lives of many, especially elderly, infected patients, reports The (U.K.) Times.\n\nMatt Hancock, the U.K. secretary for health and social care, explained the situation:\n\n“We start with around 5,000 ventilators, we think we need many times more than that, and we are saying if you produce a ventilator then we will buy it. No number is too high. “They are relatively complicated pieces of kit, I couldn’t make one, but they’re not so complicated that the advanced manufacturing that this country is so good at now can’t be able to turn its production lines over to.”\n\n“HOW MUCH WORSE THE CORONAVIRUS COULD GET”\n\nThe New York Times demonstrates through adaptive graphics how the novel coronavirus might evolve in the United States given the various strategies we might employ. This modeling was developed by Nicholas Kristof (mentioned above) and Stuart A. Thompson, head of The Times Opinions visual journalism department.\n\nOn current track we’re headed for 100 million Americans (one-third) infected and one-million deaths, according to the graphic simulation. See it here.\n\n“WE NEED TO STOP ASSUMING WE ARE DIFFERENT”\n\nIt is still the lull before the storm, but the United States and a number of European nations, including Spain, France and Germany, should expect “very serious outbreaks” of COVID-19 soon, writes Helen Jenkins, assistant professor at Boston University School of Public Health, whose research focuses on the epidemiology of infectious diseases.\n\nIn an article on the Medium online site, Jenkins warns:\n\n“Wuhan was caught unawares, and Italy was unlucky to have the first big outbreak in Europe, although it is unclear why. The United States and European countries must learn from this very quickly. We need to stop assuming we are different and start introducing measures to protect our communities.” “How? The countries not yet seriously affected must start testing seriously. It’s not enough to test those returning from an ‘affected area.’ We have to realize that the virus is already present and we ourselves are an ‘affected area.’ Another essential measure is social distancing, which could include things like stopping all large (and some small) gatherings, closing schools, working from home, limiting not only international but also domestic travel, even isolating specific cities or regions.”\n\nJenkins argues that South Korea is the model to follow with its “widespread” testing, contact tracing and aggressive quarantine protocols.\n\n“All countries and localities need to throw as much effort as they can at this thing. Individuals and governments need to show decisive leadership and break their paralysis by indecision. Speed is everything — and we are all in this together.”\n\nShe offers this last bit of advice: “Wash your hands like your life or someone else’s depends on it.”\n\n* * *\n\nDespite barren shelves in grocery stores and all the shutdowns in workplaces and sports and entertainment venues, many young Americans are still socializing as if nothing has changed. Journalist and author Rod Dreher has been tweeting the observations of an unnamed doctor who is dealing with the viral outbreak in this country:\n\nCRITICAL PLACES REMAIN OPEN IN FRANCE, INCLUDING… “TOBACCONISTS”?\n\nWith 4,469 people confirmed infected and 91 deaths, France is feeling the escalation of coronavirus. That has led to extraordinary measures, reports The Times of London:\n\n“Edouard Philippe, the French prime minister, ordered the closure of restaurants, bars, cinemas and nightclubs. All shops were also shut, except for food stores, pharmacies, banks and tobacconists. He asked people to stay home.”\n\nI searched for a story that would tell us why tobacconists are essential in disease-ridden France, but could find none. I did, however, find a reader comment in this story in The Australian that, while obviously not authoritative, offers a reason:\n\n“Tobac shops sell newspapers, transport tickets not just smokes.”\n\nISIS TRAVEL WARNING: AVOID EUROPE\n\nThe Middle East terror group ISIS is warning its cohorts through its al-Naba newsletter to “cover their mouths when yawning and sneezing,” to wash their hands regularly and to stay out of Europe, where the coronavirus infection rate is high, reports The (U.K.) Times.\n\n“Having previously urged its supporters to attack European cities, the group is now advising members to “stay away from the land of the epidemic” in case they become infected.”\n\nThis legitimate front-page story provoked some cheeky responses from British readers:\n\n“Wimps.” * * * “The silver lining!” * * * “Terrorist newsletter? Is there an ISIS app?” * * * “Do ISIS have all the toilet rolls?” * * * “The next thing will be the West offering medical assistance.” * * * “Allah works in mysterious ways.” * * * “She certainly does.”\n\n‘LA DOLCE VITA’ LIVES ON IN ITALY\n\nThe Italians are making glorious music in the Age of Coronavirus with all of its social dislocation. Some of it is truly beautiful. Some of it is very funny. Enjoy.\n\nTWEETS ON THE PANDEMIC\n\nSome interesting observations both sober and silly.\n\n“CORONAVIRUS CALLED AMERICA’S BLUFF”\n\nAnne Applebaum, staff writer with the Atlantic Monthly and former member of the Washington Post editorial board, argues that America is in for a rude awakening:\n\n“The United States, long accustomed to thinking of itself as the best, most efficient, and most technologically advanced society in the world, is about to be proved an unclothed emperor. When human life is in peril, we are not as good as Singapore, as South Korea, as Germany. And the problem is not that we are behind technologically, as the Japanese were in 1853. The problem is that American bureaucracies, and the antiquated, hidebound, unloved federal government of which they are part, are no longer up to the job of coping with the kinds of challenges that face us in the 21st century. Global pandemics, cyberwarfare, information warfare—these are threats that require highly motivated, highly educated bureaucrats; a national health-care system that covers the entire population; public schools that train students to think both deeply and flexibly; and much more.”\n\nPLACES IN THE PATH OF THE VIRUS ARE BEATING IT, HERE'S HOW\n\nThe epicenter of the novel-coronavirus pandemic is Hubei Province in central China, with a population of nearly 60 million people.\n\nIn that region, whose capital city is Wuhan, the COVID-19 outbreak has proven catastrophic with 67,790 confirmed infections and 3,075 deaths, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Live Dashboard.\n\nOn Friday, Laurie Garrett, a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist and former senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations tweeted out this graph:\n\nIf you look at the lines, shown here in the larger graphic, you’ll see what is nearly a universal spike in COVID-19 diagnoses after certain countries in the world hit their first confirmed 100 people infected.\n\nSerious upsurges are felt now in Italy, Iran, South Korea, Spain, France and Germany. The United States trend line is also worrisome.\n\nJust as interesting are two lagging trend lines, whose COVID-19 cases are climbing more gently, with none of the critical overload that has hit China and Italy.\n\nThese locales in Southeast Asia and in proximity to Mainland China puts them directly in the path of the rapidly spreading pathogen.\n\nOne is Singapore, an island city-state of about 5.7 million people off southern Malaysia. The other, Hong Kong, a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China, with a population of 7.5 million.\n\nA third locale not shown on the graph, but also trending gently, is Taiwan, an island of 23.5 million people off the coast of Mainland China.\n\nTaken together the three locations have used fast-acting and aggressive measures to successfully control the spread of novel coronavirus.\n\nHow did they do it?\n\nThe answer goes back some 16-18 years to another coronavirus – SARS, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome outbreak of 2002-2004 -- that infected 8,000 people and killed 774 globally.\n\nChina and Southeast Asia were particularly hard hit, including Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan, which experienced among the highest SARS death rates in the world.\n\nThe SARS devastation left a lasting impact on these three population centers not far from China’s mainland and still influences how people live their lives today.\n\n“Take me,” writes Bloomberg Opinion columnist Nisha Gopalan, who lives and works in Hong Kong and did so at the time of the SARS epidemic.\n\n“I still compulsively wash my hands, 17 years after the outbreak. I have friends that have been using toothpicks to press elevator buttons for years. Some use tissues to open the doors of public washrooms, or carry spare masks in their handbags in case they catch the sniffles. This is all evidence of the indelible impact SARS has had on Hong Kong’s psyche. For many of us, advice from health officials on how to minimize the risk of Covid-19 infection has been superfluous.”\n\nMore importantly, governments in Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan learned from the 2002-04 SARS contagion to react quickly when they realized a new and deadly coronavirus was on the loose.\n\nHere’s how they kept the spread of the disease low and are managing to outperform the emergency actions of governments in China, western Europe and the United States.\n\nSINGAPORE\n\n* Population: 5.7 million * Infected: 200 * Deaths: 0\n\nSingapore took immediate action to secure its borders and to perform contact tracing – the identification and tracking of infected people and other persons they came in contact with.\n\nIt was among the first countries to end inbound flights from Wuhan and then began putting travelers from affected areas of the world in quarantine, according to a New York Times op-ed by Benjamin J. Cowling, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology, and Wey Wen Lim, a graduate student in infectious disease epidemiology, both at the University of Hong Kong.\n\nHospitals and governments in Singapore created a united front to track the movements of infected people. While health workers surveyed all coronavirus patients about their movements, the state used data from transport companies, hotels and security footage to track whereabouts, according to The Times op-ed authors.\n\nA paper published by Harvard’s Center for Communicable Disease reports:\n\n“Singapore has historically had very strong epidemiological surveillance and contact-tracing capacity and has shown in the COVID-19 epidemic evidence of a high sensitivity of case detection.”\n\nHowever, the nation has been heavy-handed imposing quarantine and rules that “may not be directly translatable elsewhere,” reports TIME Magazine.\n\n“Since independence in 1965, it has been ruled by a single party that maintains tight control and is rarely subject to public criticism. Amid the coronavirus outbreak, quarantine and isolation protocols are strictly enforced. A permanent resident who breached quarantine rules lost his status, while a couple was charged in court with providing false information about their travel history.”\n\nInterestingly, Singapore has largely kept its public schools open to avoid large disruptions in people’s lives, according to The Times op-ed. Instead the nation has chosen to screen students and staff regularly.\n\nTo that end, a large social safety net is in place to help families affected by the disease, TIME reports.\n\n“No Singaporean has to fear affording treatment. Testing is free, and the government foots the hospital bills for Singaporean residents who have suspected or confirmed cases, TIME reports. “To make quarantine less onerous, the government offers self-employed people $100 Singapore dollars ($73) per day, while employers are prohibited from detracting quarantine days from staffers’ annual leave.”\n\nHONG KONG\n\nPopulation: 7.5 million * Infected: 140 * Deaths: 4\n\nSimilar to Singapore, Hong Kong very quickly put in place strong travel restrictions and controls to stop the flow of people from infected regions of China, The Times reports. It did close its schools, but perhaps because it would not create the kind of disruption it would cause in other lands. The region enjoys cultural advantages Singapore does not:\n\n“Hong Kong has a social structure that helps cushion some of the burden: Many families with two working parents already rely on domestic helpers or grandparents for child care.”\n\nThe memory of SARS still resonates and is driving reaction to coronavirus today, reports TIME.\n\n“In a city deeply scarred by the SARS outbreak—and still populated with hand sanitizer stations—familiar reflexes, like proper hand hygiene, have snapped back into practice. “People are quite cautious now when they face a major outbreak of an infection,” says David Hui, director of the Stanley Ho Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.”\n\nTAIWAN\n\nPopulation: 23.6 million * Infected: 53 * Deaths: 1\n\nAfter SARS, Taiwan decided not to be taken by surprise again and created a central command center of epidemics, TIME reports.\n\nWhile other countries worldwide were still building the scaffolding to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, Taiwan was out of the blocks with action items, policies, communications and health-care plans at the ready.\n\nIt used high tech and big data to track patients, identify hot zones and pinpoint supplies, reports ABC News.\n\n“In a single day, Taiwan's government was able to combine data from the National Health Insurance Administration and Immigration Agency to identify patients' 14-day travel history. In addition, with data from citizens' household registration systems and foreigners' entry cards, individuals at high risk were identified, self-quarantined and monitored through their cellphones.\n\nWhile big events were generally cancelled, the schools closed for two weeks but opened again on Feb. 25, The Times authors noted.\n\nAuthorities created a toll-free national hotline for people to report suspicious symptoms in themselves and others and provided support for families dealing with infection, reports the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n“…as the disease progressed, this hotline has reached full capacity, so each major city was asked to create its own hotline as an alternative. It is not known how often this hotline has been used. The government addressed the issue of disease stigma and compassion for those affected by providing food, frequent health checks, and encouragement for those under quarantine.”\n\n* * *\n\nThree population centers at high-risk in this pandemic are proving the upward trend lines of the novel coronavirus are not a given - that smart, aggressive human intervention can save lives and spare national health systems the devastation of this global emergency.\n\nITALIANS ARE AT VIRUS OVERLOAD AND THEY'RE TALKING TO US\n\nIn Europe, Italy is enduring the largest outbreak of COVID-19, with 15,113 people infected and 1,016 deaths.\n\nTwo Italian academics, one a doctor, one an engineer, have published their observations of the enormous strain the new coronavirus is putting on the health-care system in northern Italy.\n\nEven as Italy has put in place strong measures to cut off social contact among its population, the infection trend lines continue moving upwards so sharply they are on the verge of overwhelming the health-care system, write Giuseppe Remuzzi, chairman of the Department of Transplantation at Bergamo Hospital in Bergamo, Italy, and Andrea Remuzzi, professor in the School of Engineering, University of Bergamo.\n\n“If the change in the slope of the curve does not take place soon, the clinical and social problems will take on unmanageable dimensions, which are expected to have catastrophic results,” they write in the British Medical Journal “Lancet”.\n\nThe two report that 9% to 11% of all infected patients in Italy between March 1 and March 11 had to be placed in intensive care units, putting enormous strain on hospitals.\n\nThey predict given current trends Italy will need an extra 2,500 ICU beds in a week to treat the most serious coronavirus patients. You can sense their frustration with Italian bureaucrats who still haven’t figured out the gravity of the situation inside the hospitals:\n\n“In the meantime, the government is preparing to pass legislation that will enable the health service to hire 20,000 more doctors and nurses and to provide 5,000 more ventilators to Italian hospitals. These measures are a step in the right direction, but our model tells us that they need to be implemented urgently, in a matter of days. Otherwise, a substantial number of unnecessary deaths will become inevitable. Intensive care specialists are already considering denying life-saving care to the sickest and giving priority to those patients most likely to survive when deciding who to provide ventilation to. This attitude has already been criticized by the current President of the Italian Comitato di Bioetica (Bioethics Committee) who, in a recent declaration to lay press stated that the Constitution recognizes the right of every individual to receive all necessary health care. They might not recognize that the reality is that intensive care wards are overflowing with patients and that COVID-19 is not a benign disease. Our doctors and nurses are modern heroes in an unexpected war against a difficult enemy. In the near future, they will have no choice. They will have to follow the same rules that health-care workers are left with in conflict and disaster zones.”\n\nToday, The New York Times is reporting that epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and universities around the world began building scenarios on how the coronavirus outbreak might affect the United States:\n\n“Between 160 million and 214 million people in the U.S. could be infected over the course of the epidemic, according to one projection. That could last months or even over a year, with infections concentrated in shorter periods, staggered across time in different communities, experts said. As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die. \"And, the calculations based on the C.D.C.’s scenarios suggested, 2.4 million to 21 million people in the U.S. could require hospitalization, potentially crushing the nation’s medical system, which has only about 925,000 staffed hospital beds. Fewer than a tenth of those are for people who are critically ill.”\n\nThose projections would be altered by the actions of states, businesses and individuals to employ social distancing and other measures to slow the spread of the virus, The Times reports.\n\nFACING A PANDEMIC: 'THERE ARE NO EASY OPTIONS'\n\nWednesday was a watershed moment in the United States as a torrent of news on the new coronavirus shook the American people from their slumber and the fantasy that this is just another flu bug.\n\nThese were the stunning news items in a single day:\n\nGerman Chancellor says up to 70% of Germans could get infected.\n\nWorld Health Organization declares a pandemic.\n\nNBA game is shut down, fans sent home.\n\nNBA season indefinitely suspended.\n\nNBA player infected with COVID-19.\n\nActor Tom Hanks and wife announce they are infected.\n\nTrump suspends travel from Europe.\n\nOn Wednesday, coronavirus finally got America's attention.\n\nToday, the prevailing strategy in the western world is to flatten the coronavirus curve, to put in place social distancing (reduce public interaction) and stop the rapid spread of disease. The goal is to make COVID-19 run its course more gradually so it does not overwhelm hospitals and health-care systems.\n\nProfessor Neil Ferguson, an expert on infectious disease and vice-dean of academic development at Imperial College London, talked about the limits of the containment strategy, now in place in China, and the mitigation strategy. The United States is doing a mix of both.\n\nAs you will see, there are enormous, “dislocating” consequences to both and “no easy options.” Listen in particular to how long he believes the containment strategy, now in place in China and recommended by the World Health Organization, would have to remain in place.\n\nThe relevant portion of this video begins at 01:30. Transcript below.\n\nTranscript (01:30 on)\n\n“I think kind of fundamental decisions have to be made by countries as to whether they’re going to follow what WHO (World Health Organization) is recommending and what the Chinese did, namely to attempt to suppress all transmissions or alternatively try to mitigate, sometimes control an epidemic, but short of completely stopping its spread. “It’s an important distinction because in the former case effectively that’s the strategy, in theory if it works, could largely prevent deaths from this infection, but would really have to be kept in place for 12-18 months until we have a vaccine available at scale. That has enormous feasibility issues and can you actually have any society really maintain those sort of controls for that long? It clearly has huge economic and social issues associated with it. “I mean the alternative is in some sense no easier, the idea of kind of mitigating an epidemic which is though fundamentally allowed to run its course until basically it stops because it runs out of people and develops herd immunity – not everybody in the population get infected. We estimate the best you can do is that half the population though get infected. We’re still talking about an enormous epidemic in each country, and even if we do our best to protect those most vulnerable, the elderly, people with pre-existing health conditions, it still could potentially have a very high health burden, both in terms of deaths and in terms of demands on hospitals and health-care systems. So there are no easy options here. In the next few months you’re going to see, almost regardless of these particular strategies adopted, we’ll see many countries in the world, if not all countries in the world, see kind of major, dislocating social changes, just as a result of the interventions that need to be put in place.”\n\nWHAT'S IT FEEL LIKE TO GET COVID-19?\n\nPatients are experiencing a range of reaction to Coronavirus. From mild illness to extreme illness and death.\n\nHere's how one young man describes the experience:\n\nIt began like a cold, then I felt better and then it got a lot worse ...\n\nCan Coronavirus heal America's political divide?\n\nSomething extraordinary happened on Monday. Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of the State of California, leader of the land that calls itself “The Resistance” to the Republican White House in Washington, D.C., had many nice things to say about Donald Trump.\n\nYou have to watch the video to understand the depth of Newsom’s words, but they are genuine and heartfelt.\n\nThe federal government had been working with California to repatriate passengers from the coronavirus-infected Grand Princess cruise ship. And now media were teeing up questions for Newsom to drive Trump into the stratosphere.\n\nInstead, Newsom left his driver in his golf bag and described his discussion with the president thus:\n\n“We had a private conversation, but he said, 'We're gonna do the right thing' and 'You have my support, all of our support, logistically and otherwise.’ … He said everything I could have hoped for. And we had a very long conversation and every single thing he said, they followed through on.\"\n\nIt seems improbable that the new coronavirus could bring Democrats and Republicans together, especially in a presidential election year, and especially after the White House is widely believed to have squandered precious days and weeks when it might have produced and widely distributed reliable test kits.\n\nBut America is awakening to a kind of slow-moving earthquake, that judging from China, South Korea and Italy, will soon escalate to a rapidly moving calamity that will require all of our wiles and cooperation to manage.\n\nIn Italy, where coronavirus has infected 10,149 and killed 631 people, a nation divided politically and culturally between north and south is rallying around a fragile coalition government to get it through what can now be called a disaster.\n\nNorthern Italy is desperately trying to provide care to rising numbers of infected patients and dying elderly. Doctors in Italy are warning other nations, including our own, to resist complacency and reject soothing notions that this is no worse than the flu.\n\nAnd what is truly extraordinary is that the tables have turned on a country in which the north for decades has sneered at the south for its so-called dirty ways – an attitude exacerbated by a cholera epidemic in 1973 that plagued southern Italy, reports The Times of London.\n\n“The snobbery was best expressed in 2009 by the politician Matteo Salvini when he was filmed joining fellow northerners in a song accusing Neapolitans of being ‘cholera sufferers’ who never washed with soap. “‘Smell that stink, even the dogs are fleeing, the Neapolitans are arriving,’ sang the group gathered around Mr Salvini, who was an advocate of secession for Italy’s wealthy north at the time, before he became a latter-day patriot when he took over the anti-migrant League party, which is now in opposition.”\n\nMr. Salvini, who has become more popular, is decidedly taking a back seat to the more boring leaders of the coalition government. A survey of his countrymen last week showed that 58% want opposition parties to rally around the government, The Times reported, while only 12% backed Salvini’s proposal to form a new national unity government.\n\nIn Italy, the stirring of national fellowship expressed itself when tourists from northern Italy were found to be infected while visiting Sicily in the south. They were treated “wonderfully well” in a southern hospital, The Times reported.\n\nDiscussions have begun about transferring patients with conventional ailments from hospital beds in the north to beds in the south to clear more beds for coronavirus patients in desperate northern hospitals.\n\nMeanwhile the nation’s physicians, the virus experts that the Italian newspaper La Stampa has dubbed “The Magnificent Eight,” have become Italy’s new superheroes as they keep their country informed on the coronavirus.\n\nAs Newsom demonstrated on Monday, we’re in a moment when we need to try to put aside simmering animosities, and start working together to help all of our fellow Americans. That attitude needs to begin on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nWHY CORONAVIRUS IS NOT THE 1918 SPANISH FLU\n\nTake a moment and appreciate how much better off we are than our ancestors who in 1918 had to manage a much more deadly pandemic without the wonders of advanced medicine.\n\nThe New York Times has noted that many comparisons have been made to the Spanish Flu of 1918 and the Coronavirus of 2019-20. But the differences are profound.\n\nBack then …\n\n“Doctors knew viruses existed but had never seen one — there were no electron microscopes, and the genetic material of viruses had not yet been discovered. Today, however, researchers not only know how to isolate a virus but can find its genetic sequence, test antiviral drugs and develop a vaccine. “In 1918, it was impossible to test people with mild symptoms so they could self-quarantine. And it was nearly impossible to do contact tracing because the flu seemed to infect — and panic — entire cities and communities all at once. Moreover, there was little protective equipment for health care workers, and the supportive care with respirators that can be provided to people very ill with coronavirus did not exist.”\n\nThe Times points to the recent data from South Korea, which is enduring one of the worst Coronavirus epidemics and is doing the most aggressive testing of any country.\n\nAwash in new data, South Korea reports a fatality rate of .65%. The Spanish Flu had a fatality rate of at least 2.5% and killed 50 million people (the equivalent of 200 million today).\n\nBut if modern medicine is our armor, modern connectivity is our challenge.\n\nDrawing on the same numbers from South Korea, British historian Niall Ferguson in The Wall Street Journal compares the new coronavirus to the more recent H1N1, also known as swine flu, that killed 12,469 people in 2009. Its fatality rate was 0.02%.\n\nIf as many Americans catch COVID-19 as caught swine flu, the death toll could exceed 440,000, writes Ferguson. He further cautions:\n\n“Standard epidemiological models tend to understate the threat posed by a virus such as 2019-nCoV, because they don’t take account of the topology of the social networks that transmit it. ... we now understand the extraordinary power of modern transportation networks combined with the social-network hubs known as “superspreaders.” “Network effects are the reason it is anything but dumb to worry about the novel coronavirus. Not only is it spreading much faster than most Americans realize; it is also disrupting global manufacturing supply chains as well as all the economic activities that depend on travel and proximity. It could set off a cascade of defaults in the corporate bond market, disrupting the global financial network. “… That aspect of the panic is indeed dumb. But that doesn’t make it smart to underestimate the scale of the Covid-19 pandemic — a perfect illustration of the vulnerability and fragility of our networked world.”\n\nIRISH PHYSICIAN TO HER GOVERNMENT: DON'T SQUANDER THIS MOMENT\n\nDr. Carmen Regan, a senior lecturer in Obstetrics and Gynecology with a clinical base in Coombe Women’s Hospital, Dublin, has been warning the Irish government to stop flights from Italy, where Coronavirus has infected large swaths of the population.\n\nIn an open letter to the government, she begins:\n\n“I write as a consultant specialist in maternal medicine with 30 years of experience in caring for high-risk pregnant mothers. I have never written to the media nor made public comment on matters of policy in relation to healthcare. I do so now out of grave concern.”\n\nShe goes on to say…\n\n“We are only at the beginning of this journey. I, for one, do not want to look back with regret at what I should have done on behalf of our people in the early stages of this epidemic.”\n\nShe's a compelling voice. Listen to her interviewed here:\n\nTHE GLOBAL FORCES THAT SHAPE OUR POLARIZED NATION\n\nI went on KJZZ to discuss “WhiteShift,” a book by University of London political scientist Eric Kaufmann. He connects the dots on Brexit and Donald Trump, framing the big picture on today’s right-wing populism and polarized politics. You can hear my discussion with KJZZ’s Mark Brodie here.\n\nWe invited Kaufmann to write for The Arizona Republic’s Sunday Viewpoint section. He tailored his piece to Arizona.\n\nHis book describes the worldwide influences that have created political upheaval in western societies. I find his thesis optimistic, that in time the immigration wars will settle down and we'll have a multi-ethnic society that generally embraces a national identity and that gets a long. Eventually all Americans will be multi-ethnic and multi-racial.\n\nDEMOCRATS HAVE A BIG PROBLEM: THEIR BORDER POLICY IS LOCO\n\nYou didn’t expect this discussion to start in The New York Times, but here it is:\n\nThe American left is headed for the jagged rocks of 2020 electoral defeat if it doesn’t soon find its bearings on border issues. If not, it may lose the White House because of immigration radicalism.\n\nIn a long essay headlined “The Open Borders Trap,” Times senior writer Jason DeParle reminds readers that in 2008 the Democratic Party platform argued, “We cannot continue to allow people to enter the United States undetected, undocumented and unchecked. We need to secure our borders.”\n\nThat now “sounds like an artifact of a long-ago age,” writes DeParle, because the “progressive vanguard” since then has been proposing a series of extreme policies that would move aside long-standing laws and policies and open wide the border.\n\nDeParle catalogues the promises 2020 Democrats have made to immigration rights groups. Taken together they’re breathtaking:\n\nDecriminalize border crossing.\n\nBan deportations.\n\nEnd detention.\n\nAbolish ICE - Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.\n\nProvide undocumented immigrants universal health insurance.\n\nProvide free college.\n\nExpand school meals.\n\nExpand other safety net programs.\n\nAdds DeParle:\n\n“Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, the progressive standard-bearer, likens detention facilities to “concentration camps.” Eight advocacy groups have released an immigration plan they call “Free to Move, Free to Stay,” a slogan that suggests no limits. “… what’s notable about the progressives’ stance isn’t just the retreat on enforcement. It’s also the lack of an affirmative case for immigration — an argument for how it strengthens the economy, invigorates the culture and deepens ties to the world.\"\n\nDeParle believes the left has abandoned these significant arguments for why immigration is important to the country: “It has powered the rise of Silicon Valley, brought entrepreneurs to the inner city and staffed hospitals in the reddest and bluest of states.”\n\n“Yet some on the left say economic arguments commodify immigrants or denigrate the native work force.\"\n\nThe looms of progressive activism are weaving an immigration policy that cannot be sustained, given the economic imbalance between North and Latin America. It is creating a moral dilemma, writes DeParle:\n\n“There are more potential migrants than the country can accept. To the extent that they’re fleeing poverty and violence, it’s unfair to keep them out. But with nearly two billion people living on less than $3.20 a day, it’s impossible to let them all in. Hence the need to set limits and enforce them humanely.”\n\nMany on the left believe Trump’s cruel border policies are turning votes against him, particularly his mistreatment and separation of migrant children, argues DeParle.\n\n“But the more immigration becomes part of the culture wars, the more its supporters have to lose. Immigration propelled Britain from the European Union and left Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany a lame duck. Immigration’s value can’t be assumed. It has to be defended.”\n\nEnergized by DeParle’s essay, political scientist and Democratic strategist Ruy Teixeira writes on his blog:\n\n“I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again. Once it comes time to face Donald Trump in the general election, Democrats will need much clearer and more salable positions on immigration than the ones Democratic candidates drifted into in the primary season. Otherwise, Trump will do real damage to the Democratic nominee on the issue.\"\n\nTeixeira, made famous by his 2002 book “The Emerging Democratic Majority,” derides the immigration-rights activists that DeParle quotes in his essay for taking “one nutty position after another on various immigration issues. You read through them and just shake your head: what planet are these people living on?\"\n\n“The Democratic nominee in 2020 needs to decisively reject the open borders talk and utter lack of realism on border security and what a workable immigration system might look like that appears to dominate these advocates’ thinking. Otherwise Trump will have a field day and immigrants will be worse off, not better off.”\n\nTHE VIEW ON MARS\n\nThe latest images from the Curiosity Mars Rover sure look familiar. I half expect to see a saguaro.\n\n'ELECTION NIGHT 2016' WITH THE PROGRESSIVES\n\nIt's an American conceit that every generation believes its cast of \"Saturday Night Live\" is the best of all time. I'm a child of the Seventies so, of course, I stand by John Belushi, Chevy Chase, Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd and Bill Murray. I've never seen anything Will Ferrell did that I found funny.\n\nYeah, I'm a Boomer.\n\nBut I have to admit this bit from SNL's more recent past is pretty darned great.\n\nWHAT WOULD A CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK LOOK LIKE IN ARIZONA? WASHINGTON STATE TELLS US\n\nThe Coronavirus got a beachhead in the United States in the state of Washington, scene of the first large U.S. outbreak of COVID-19. As of Friday, there have been 79 confirmed people infected in four Washington counties and 15 deaths, according to the Washington State Department of Health.\n\nThe World Health Organization hasn't yet labeled the Coronavirus a pandemic, but many epidemiologists are convinced it is and are calling it that.\n\nIf COVID-19 behaves in the Pacific Northwest the way it has in other parts of the world, the infections will radiate outward. We can’t know what will happen in Arizona, but we have to prepare for the possibility that such an outbreak could occur here.\n\nHere’s the picture in Washington State:\n\nHEALTH SYSTEM STRESSED\n\nThe Seattle Times reports, “Less than a week after diagnosed cases of COVID-19 grew rapidly in the Seattle area, health care providers say medical supplies are growing scarce, threatening to further stress a system already scrambling to control the coronavirus outbreak.”\n\nValley Medical Center in metro-Seattle put out an email telling its health workers:\n\n“Limit mask use to on the patient only. …Staff will no longer wear masks, unless providing a care procedure requiring removal of the patient’s mask. …Masks are in critical supply (and) “due to disaster conditions VMC will be implementing alternate standards of care to conserve masks for critical and surgical use.”\n\nHealth-care authorities fear emergency rooms, clinics and community health centers could be overrun with requests for testing. They’re telling everyone to call ahead if they suspect they have COVID-19, the Times reports.\n\nFEAR IN HOSPITALS\n\nHealth care workers are beginning to worry about their own health as more and more patients are admitted with the disease. Olga Ramirez, a nurse at Seattle’s Harborview Medical Center, told The Times she is worried about ending up in a hospital bed. “I’m human, too — it does make me nervous. I have underlying health care issues. I have asthma, I have diabetes and some heart problems. So, I’m concerned that going to work is going to somehow affect me medically, physically, mentally.”\n\nLOST CONVENTIONS\n\nOrganizers have canceled three major events at the Washington State Convention Center, including the Emerald City Comic Con, reports The Times.\n\n“The cancellations and postponement represent a significant economic loss for the downtown hospitality sector, which has already been hit by a wave of cancellations since the deaths last week of Seattle-area residents from the coronavirus outbreak, the first in the U.S.”\n\nVULNERABLE POPULATIONS STAY HOME\n\nPeople older than 60 and pregnant women are being urged to stay at home and avoid contact in public, reports the Everett, Wash. Herald.\n\nPUBLIC SCHOOLS\n\nK-12 officials are weighing whether to close the public schools in affected counties. Some 13,000 people have signed petitions demanding the schools be closed, The Herald reports.\n\nUNIVERSITIES\n\nA number of the universities are now operating remotely, providing online classes while cancelling on-campus classes and events, including commencement.\n\nTECH EMPLOYEES WORK FROM HOME\n\nAbout 10,000 people employed at Amazon’s buildings in Seattle and Bellevue are now working from home. The buildings are almost entirely empty, The Times, reports.\n\nLEGAL FIGHT OVER QUARANTINE\n\nThe City of Kent, Wash. called a press conference and filed a restraining order to stop King County from using a vacant motel in its community to begin quarantining people exposed to the virus. The courts eventually denied the City of Kent’s petition, reports The Times. The county is using the motel to quarantine 10 potentially infected Kirkland Firefighters who had answered the call to a nursing home where the infection was present.\n\nCITY COUNCIL GOES REMOTE\n\nThe Seattle City Council is planning to conduct its regular City Council meetings remotely and has cancelled all committee meetings until further notice, The Times reports.\n\nMAJOR LEAGUE HOME OPENER COULD MOVE\n\nThis may concern Arizona. The sports pages of the Seattle Times are reporting that the Seattle Mariners still intend to play their home opener March 26 against the Texas Rangers at T-Mobile Park. But Times sports writer Ryan Divish reports that contingency planning is underway.\n\n“What could the Mariners do if Seattle is deemed an unsafe location to open the season? Sources indicate a variety of contingencies have been discussed on the periphery but nothing concrete. There could be games without fans in attendance. The Mariners and Rangers could remain in Arizona and play those games in the area at a spring-training facility. “The Arizona Diamondbacks also open the season at home. So Chase Field in Phoenix will be used. But if the need for an MLB field is demanded, the Mariners and Rangers could play day games there.”\n\nOUR BEST POLITICAL HUMORIST SINCE MORRIS UDALL\n\nYears ago, I was telling our then national-political reporter Dan Nowicki that the best writer on Twitter is a guy named @exjon. Funny and really smart.\n\nDan said to me, “He’s local. He’s Phoenix. He’s Goldwater (Institute).”\n\n“No way!” I said.\n\nNot long after, one of our then Opinions editors, Carrie Watters, had the great good sense to recruit him as a guest columnist for The Arizona Republic Opinions pages.\n\nJon Gabriel is the best political humorist in Arizona and every bit on par with the late, great Morris Udall. Their styles are similar. Usually easy-going. Always fall-down funny.\n\n@exjon is so skilled at wielding 140 characters he has a national following on Twitter. He’s been retweeted by the president of the United States, and, as you’ll see in this response to U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar today, he’s apt to go viral:\n\nSign up to his Twitter feed here.\n\nAs for the legendary Arizona congressman Morris Udall, here's a sample of his humor over the years:\n\n“Let's turn inflation over to the post office. That'll slow it down.”\n\n“Presidential ambition is a disease which can only be cured by embalming fluid.”\n\n“I have learned the difference between a cactus and a caucus. On a cactus, the pricks are on the outside.”\n\n“If you are a United States senator and are not under indictment or in detoxification, you automatically consider yourself as a potential candidate for the presidency.”\n\nBERNIE WORLD IS ALREADY HERE AND IT’S A DISASTER\n\nWonder what the country would look like if Bernie Sanders ever got the levers of power to construct his socialist paradise?\n\nWonder no more, writes National Review columnist Christopher F. Rufo. The socialists have taken over one of the great cities of the Pacific Northwest and have begun their reordering of society.\n\n“Seattle has effectively become the nation’s laboratory for socialist policies,” writes Rufo.\n\n“Since the beginning of the year, the socialist faction on the Seattle City Council has proposed a range of policies on taxes, housing, homelessness, and criminal justice that put into practice the national democratic-socialist agenda. \"In the most recent session, socialist councilwoman Kshama Sawant and her allies have proposed massive new taxes on corporations, unprecedented regulations on landlords (including rent control and a ban on “winter evictions”), the mandated construction of homeless encampments, and the gradual dismantling of the criminal justice system, beginning with the end of cash bail.”\n\nThe progressive bloc of the City Council is already consolidating authority, reports Rufo, with bans on corporate spending in local elections and with $100 taxpayer-funded “Democracy Vouchers” that Seattle residents can use to support their local candidates. The vouchers “are easily collected by unions, activists, and socialist groups.\"\n\nLooming in the background are “black-bloc activists and Antifa militants” who “intimidate any potential opposition by disrupting events, vandalizing homes, and even orchestrating death threats against political adversaries.”\n\nAmerican business needs to wake up, stop appeasing political ex and start understanding that socialism will need to be opposed on many fronts, he argues.\n\nCORONAVIRUS YANKS THE SUPPLY CHAIN\n\nOn Feb. 28, the Harvard Business Review forecast that in mid-March the impact of the COVID-19 virus would be felt on global supply chains, “forcing thousands of companies to throttle down or temporarily shut assembly and manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Europe.”\n\n“The most vulnerable companies are those which rely heavily or solely on factories in China for parts and materials. The activity of Chinese manufacturing plants has fallen in the past month and is expected to remain depressed for months.”\n\nOn Thursday, The Daily Breeze in Torrance, Calif. reported the supply chain at nearby Southern California ports has already been seriously yanked.\n\n“Jobs on the docks are drying up, leaving many workers without steady work, as empty cargo containers stack up at the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, officials said this week. “It’s all a casualty of an ongoing drop in ship calls from Asia as the coronavirus continues spreading. Factories in China have remained closed or operated at below-capacity levels for weeks now as the virus has taken its toll. About half of the cargo coming into the ports comes from China.\n\nThe ports together have seen a more than 50% job loss over 2019, said Ray Familathe, president of International Longshore and Warehouse Union, reports The Daily Breeze. “It’s a tremendous loss of cargo.”\n\nPort of Los Angeles Executive Director Gene Seroka disputed those numbers.\n\n“It is substantial, but we have not eliminated half the jobs at the port,” he said, referring to the union’s 50% figure.\n\nForty-one ships have canceled cargo deliveries scheduled between mid-February and early April, Seroka said.\n\nWILL ARIZONA’S SUMMER HEAT KNOCK DOWN COVID-19?\n\nPeople in warm-weather climes in the United States and around the world are asking if their hot weather can be the firewall to the Coronavirus pandemic.\n\nArizonans are asking the same.\n\nWe all dread our Arizona summers and the triple-digit heat. Will this be the first time we actually appreciate it?\n\nThe answer at the moment is unclear.\n\n“Unfortunately, no one knows for sure — and even experts can't seem to agree on whether or not warmer weather will slow down the coronavirus,” reports Health.com.\n\nBut if COVID-19 behaves like normal viruses it will be vulnerable to heat.\n\nInfluenza and cold infections trend sharply downward during summer months, reports TIME magazine. “Warmer temperatures lead to more rapid virus degradation,” says Elizabeth McGraw, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Dynamics at Pennsylvania State University.\n\nWe don’t have enough information to know if high temperature will knock down COVID-19, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, as reported by The Dallas Morning News.\n\nHowever, we do know that its opposite – cold weather – weakens the immune system.\n\nDr. Susan Mathai, a pulmonologist at Baylor Scott & White Health, told The Morning News that cooler weather has the following effects on the human body:\n\n\"For one, cellular strands in the respiratory system, called cilia, are less effective during cold weather. Cilia work to keep airways clean. She said that’s important because when people breathe, particles in the air can get caught in their noses. But if the strands are less effective, more particles get caught, including germs. \"The body’s immune system also doesn’t function as well in cold weather. Drier air, which can come with cooler temperatures, can increase the viscosity of the normal mucus your body needs, making it less efficient in fighting off disease by building up in the sinuses. “‘We think of mucus as a bad thing, but it’s actually super important in keeping our bodies healthy,’ Mathai said.\"\n\nOf course, Arizona summers are extremely dry when we're not in monsoon. Would that be a detriment? Again, too early to know.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, apparently with little scientific evidence, said COVID-19 will die in warmer summer temperatures. “The heat generally speaking kills this kind of virus.”\n\nSpeculation of this sort is actually detrimental at this point, said.Thomas Bollyky, director of the Global Health Program at the Washington D.C.-based Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n“Policymakers and health officials should not rely on warmer temperatures to save us from COVID-19. The only things that can do that are public health preparedness and level-headed policies to reduce the number of people infected, protect health-care workers, and improve the diagnosis and treatment of those who do get ill.”\n\nThat hasn’t stopped government leaders and other stakeholders around the world from asserting their hot weather has made a difference.\n\nINDONESIA\n\nIndonesia officials credit their lack of COVID-19 outbreak to their warm climate, TIME reports. But Health officials there are more guarded.\n\nThat’s unknowable until we better understand the characteristics of COVID-19, Vivi Setiawaty, head of a biomedical research center at Indonesia’s Health Research and Development Agency, told the Jakarta Post.\n\n\"She said that although viruses would be inactivated at temperatures between 50 and 70 degrees Celsius (122 and 158 degrees Fahrenheit) and that more cases were confirmed in countries with cooler weather, there had also been confirmed cases in tropical countries with similar weather to Indonesia. The Philippines, for instance, had recorded the first death from the novel coronavirus outside of China.\"\n\nAFRICA\n\n“Some observers have pointed to the fact that Africa has relatively few cases of Covid-19 and that this may be a response to hotter conditions there,” reports The (London) Guardian. “The virus cannot take the heat, in other words.”\n\n“The disease has only just arrived in Africa and it is far too early to tell how it will behave there,” Mark Woolhouse, a professor at Edinburgh University told The Guardian. “We will just have to wait and see.”\n\nHe further added,\n\n“I would not be surprised if we now have a virus that we will have to deal with forever. However, in such cases the first major outbreak is always the worst one. After that it should settle down and become part of a regular repertoire of winter viruses, I would imagine.”\n\nINDIA\n\nOne of that nation’s health-care officials is highly optimistic, perhaps too optimistic, that India’s climate will stop the pathogen.\n\nK.K. Aggarwal, president of Heart Care Foundation of India, told the Economic Times that India is largely safe because its weather acts as a defense.\n\n“Aggarwal, also a former president of the Indian Medical Association, traces the origin and spread of the epidemic thus: Viruses prefer lower temperatures, which is why they have spread speedily in cooler and less humid areas like Japan and South Korea. In India's case, an outright outbreak seems unlikely because of the heat and humidity, he says.”\n\nOther international experts reject that kind of thinking.\n\nThe National Geographic reports:\n\n“Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch doesn’t think any weather changes will put a big dent in how the virus spreads. COVID-19 has now been documented around the world. If the virus is anything like a typical flu virus, it may worsen in Southern Hemisphere regions as the seasons change. “David Heymann from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine says not enough is known about this new virus to predict how it will change with different weather conditions. “‘The risk of making predictions without an evidence base is that they could, if they prove to be wrong, be taken as verity and give a false security,’ Heymann says via email. ‘The emphasis today should continue to be on containment to elimination where possible,’ he cautions.”\n\nATTACKING THE CORONAVIRUS - TEXAS STYLE\n\nLESSONS FROM A PANDEMIC A CENTURY AGO\n\nST. LOUIS VS. PHILADELPHIA – LEARNING FROM THE 1918 FLU\n\nAs we prepare for the larger outbreak of Coronavirus, there are lessons to be learned from the Spanish Flu of 1918 that killed some 50 million people worldwide, writes Claire Lehmann, British journalist and founding editor of the libertarian online magazine Quillette.\n\n“In early October 1918, when the Spanish flu hit the east coast of the United States, the health commissioner of St Louis, Max Starkloff, ordered the closure of schools, movie theaters, saloons, sporting events and other public gathering spots. While the measures were protested by some citizens, the quarantine went ahead. A month later, as the pandemic raged on, he ordered the closure of all business, with a few exceptions, such as banks. “While drastic quarantine measures were being implemented in St Louis, the health commissioner of Philadelphia, Wilmer Krusen, gave permission for a parade for the war effort to go ahead in his city. It is reported that within 72 hours of the parade, every bed in Philadelphia’s 31 hospitals was filled, and in the week ending October 5th, 1918, 2,600 people in Philadelphia had died, with the figure almost doubling a week later. At the end of the outbreak, St Louis had the lowest recorded death rate in the U.S., while in Philadelphia mortuaries overflowed and “bodies [were] piled up on sidewalks.”\n\nQUOTE: \"PANIC IS WHEN...\"\n\n“These bureaucrats and politicians who think panic is lines at Costco and angry parents when a school is closed, may find out that panic is when you are taking mom to the emergency room and she dies in the parking lot because no one can see her. I hope this does not happen and we get lucky, but all signs point the other direction.”\n\n- Robert Nelson, biomedicine expert and managing director and co-founder of ARCH Venture Partners, a biotech venture-capital firm, to Quillette\n\nHOW ONE NATION PREPARES FOR CORONAVIRUS\n\nFive interesting factoids from today's Times of London:\n\n1. “With six million — one in five UK employees — likely to be sick during the worst of the outbreak, ministers are looking at changing sick pay rules that unions say risk public health by encouraging employees to work while unwell.”\n\n2. “Hospitals have been told to see as many patients as they can via video calls because their beds will be needed to treat coronavirus sufferers.”\n\n3. “The sickest patients could have treatment withdrawn to prioritize those with a higher chance of survival.”\n\n4. “The virus ‘could occur in multiple waves,’ potentially causing a second severe outbreak in the future.”\n\n5. “Perhaps more likely, the virus will become like seasonal flu and return every winter.”\n\nBARBRA STREISAND GOES SCORCHED EARTH, AGAIN\n\nBarbra Streisand is coming unglued as she imagines the horror that will descend on America if it elects a Republican for president.\n\nThe GOP hopeful is Donald Trump, so many will sympathize. But Streisand has gone scorched earth on every GOP nominee of the last two decades.\n\nOne of them, John McCain, got his revenge.\n\nDONALD TRUMP – “IT CAN’T BE WORSE” (2020)\n\n“Every morning I wake up, holding my breath while I turn on my phone to see the latest news. I think to myself, “It can’t be worse than yesterday.” But when the news loads, I think, “Ohhhhh, yes, it is worse.”\n\n- Barbra Streisand (Variety)\n\nGEORGE W. BUSH - “SUCH A DESTRUCTIVE MAN” (2001)\n\n\"Look at his ratings - how could such a destructive man be so popular with the American people? Not only is he poisoning our air and water by withdrawing his promise to enforce emissions standards and arsenic regulations, but he's poisoning our political system as well.”\n\n- Barbra Streisand (The Guardian)\n\nMITT ROMNEY - “AS EXTREME AS IT GETS” (2012)\n\n“Gov. Romney would take us backwards and is as extreme as it gets when it comes to a woman’s right to choose and giving America’s wealthiest even more tax cuts on the backs of the middle class. …Mitt Romney does not share our values.”\n\n- Barbra Streisand, Politico\n\nJOHN MCCAIN – “OLDEST PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE IN HISTORY (2008)\n\n\"Maybe he was sick of the lack of media attention…maybe he had enough of the late night talk show hosts poking fun at his age…maybe he realized that belonging to a party that has been associated with rich, white men was not going to connect with voters in this historical election year.\"\n\n- Barbra Streisand, TopNews\n\nMcCAIN'S REVENGE\n\nStreisand had been doing this tap dance on McCain’s head for years. In 2002 he struck back. He went on Saturday Night Live and said, “I’ve been in politics for over 20 years, and for over 20 years, I’ve had Barbra Streisand trying to do my job.

You can see the merits in this. O’Rourke has the look of RFK and electrifies young people the way Bobby once did. He's also a beacon to Latino voters who adore him.\n\nBut bringing Beto on the journey, no doubt to try to win the Texas primary, means you also bring his baggage, and Beto accumulated a lot in his short-lived run for president.\n\nExamples:\n\nGUNS\n\nModerator: \"Are you proposing taking away their guns?

So as president, we’re going to make that a priority and we are going to stop those who are infringing upon the human rights of our fellow Americans.”\n\n- The Los Angeles Times\n\nSTORIES I NEVER KNEW ABOUT MLK AND GUNS\n\nI’ve read enough about Martin Luther King, Jr. to know he didn’t like firearms. When white racists blew up the porch of his home in Montgomery, Alabama, a number of his lieutenants began gathering weapons to defend him. He told them to put the guns away.\n\nMy former Republic colleague Jennifer Dokes posts many interesting black-history stories on her Facebook page. Those have led to reading and discovery.\n\nFor instance, I didn’t know that six years after Martin Luther King, Jr.’s assassination that his mother was murdered by a gunman:\n\nIn 1974, as she played the organ during Sunday services at Ebenezer (Baptist church), Alberta Williams King was shot by Marcus Chenault, a 21-year-old man from Ohio who claimed, “All Christians are my enemies.\" Alberta Williams King died later that day at the age of 70.\n\nThat led to this Medium article about how Martin Luther King, Sr., MLK’s father, was held hostage with other Morehouse College trustees by a group of college-student activists. Among them was a guy named Samuel L. Jackson, yes, that Samuel L. Jackson.\n\nThe future actor was part of a radical Black Power group that was gathering guns for the struggle ahead, reports Parade Magazine.\n\n“In 1969, Jackson and other radical students held members of the Morehouse College board of trustees hostage on campus, demanding reform in the school’s curriculum and governance. The college eventually agreed to change, but Jackson was expelled. He stayed on for the summer in Atlanta, where he got to know Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown and others in the Black Power movement. ‘I was in that radical faction,’ Jackson said. ‘We were buying guns, getting ready for armed struggle. “‘All of a sudden,’ he said proudly, ‘I felt I had a voice. I was somebody. I could make a difference. But then one day,’ he added quietly, ‘my mom showed up and put me on a plane to L.A. She said, ‘Do not come back to Atlanta.’ The FBI had been to the house and told her that if I didn’t get out of Atlanta, there was a good possibility I’d be dead within a year. She freaked out.’”\n\nHis life changed dramatically (so to speak).\n\nHe talks briefly about the hostage taking here (begin at 04:00)\n\nHere is Jackson in the 2005 Parade article explaining how he seethed at the white-dominated, racist culture of his childhood:\n\n“I had anger in me. It came from growing up suppressed in a segregated society. All those childhood years of ‘whites only’ places and kids passing you on the bus, yelling, ‘******!’ There was nothing I could do about it then. I couldn’t even say some of the things that made me angry—it would have gotten me killed. But I had a dream of my own. I was determined to get out and make my family proud.”\n\nThere's another great story that depicts the intersection of guns and Martin Luther King, Jr. that shows his strength of character as a young seminary student. Stephen B. Oates tells it in his marvelous biography \"Let the Trumpet Sound\":\n\n\"...at the seminary, King had another brush with violence when a North Carolina white student came banging on his door one day. The student was well known for his racial views: he couldn’t accept Negroes as his schoolmates and called them “darkies.” Somebody had messed up his room—a prank called a “room raid”—and he blamed King. He was in a tirade, shouting at King, hurling maledictions at him. Then he drew a pistol and threatened to shoot King dead. But King would not be rattled. Looking the maddened student in the eye, he calmly denied having anything to do with the room raid. By now the racket had attracted other students: they yelled at the North Carolinian, made him put his gun down. Afterward they brought the matter before the student government; but to everybody’s surprise King refused to press charges. With students and faculty alike clamoring against him, though, the North Carolinian publicly admitted he was wrong and extended King an apology.\n\nAfter that King became the most popular student at Crozer, widely admired not only for his scholarship, but for his courage and grace as well.”\n\nTHE CORONAVIRUS RUN ON DRUG- AND GROCERY STORES\n\nSOUTH KOREA\n\nGovernment officials in South Korea are warning its citizens to not “hoard” face masks and hand sanitizers as the outbreak of the novel coronavirus — which has caused a sharp rise in demand for such items — continues to spread. Officials with the South Korean Ministry of Economy and Finance on Tuesday approved the stricter penalties, which went into effect on Wednesday and will be enforced until April 30, The Korea Herald reported. Those who are accused of hoarding such products could see up to two years of jail time or a fine of 50 million won, about $42,000.\n\n- FOX News\n\nJAPAN\n\nJapanese officials tried to flush away “rumors” of a coronavirus-fueled toilet paper shortage in the country Friday, according to reports. Residents should quit stockpiling rolls because the country’s supply is strong — despite reports that it has been nearly wiped out, industry ministry officials said, according to the local outlet NKH. Last week, panicked Japanese folks rushed to stores to buy the bathroom staple.\n\n- New York Post\n\nGERMANY\n\nGerman magazine Der Spiegel reported (link in German) on Feb. 28 that the “first signs of (hoarding)” had been seen in Germany, citing discount retailers Aldi and Lidl. Among the items being hoarded are tinned goods and pasta, as well as toilet paper and disinfectants.\n\n- Quartz\n\nIRAN\n\n…The hoarded supplies, including 28 million medical gloves, were found in two warehouses in Kahrizak, a town about 25 km south of Tehran, a Revolutionary Guards commander, Hassan Hassanzadeh, told the Fars news agency. Pharmacies are short of gloves and other supplies. Anyone found hoarding medical supplies will be dealt with harshly, Iran's judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi said on Monday, according to Mizan, the news site of the judiciary.\n\n- VOA News\n\nHAWAII\n\nWorries over coronavirus have people in Hawaii stocking up on supplies. At a Costco store in Honolulu on Thursday, there was a long line of people just trying to buy toilet paper. It took between 10 to 15 minutes just to get into the store's parking lot. Then there was a huge wait just to get into the store, with a line extending out of the door. People across the island are continuing to rush to stores since the health department urged people to prepare an emergency supply kit for coronavirus. Costco was limited toilet paper purchases to five packs per person.\n\n- FOX 5 – New York\n\nMARIE OSMOND'S LIFE IMITATES ART\n\nSo Marie Osmond announces she'll be leaving none of her fortune to her children.

Nonetheless, fear is changing the way people go about their daily lives, writes Beppe Severgnini, editorial writer and editor at “Corriere della Sera” (“Evening Courier”) in Milan. In today’s New York Times, he explains:\n\n“We see more masks on TV and online than on the streets of Milan — half-deserted streets, with many people staying home. Schools and markets are closed, and many events canceled. “...People have stopped shaking hands, let alone greeting each other with a kiss. If you sneeze or cough in public, people jerk away and show genuine alarm. Conversation is monopolized by coronavirus, and in the absence of clear rules, companies and organizations behave randomly.”\n\nCoronavirus will probably not be stopped from gaining a foothold in the United States, reports The Atlantic Online, after talking to leading U.S. epidemiologists.\n\nEfforts to quarantine cities, as the Chinese have done, or to quarantine yourself are probably fruitless. They just delay the misery. The majority of us are going to be exposed, health-care experts tell The Atlantic.\n\nEventually, the magazine reports, Covid-19 is likely to become a seasonal bug.\n\nTIP: A great site for following the real-time global advance of Coronavirus is the Johns Hopkins University Interactive Map.\n\nTHINK OUR SUMMER HEAT WILL BURN OFF CORONAVIRUS? THINK AGAIN\n\nThe Philadelphia Enquirer reports that summer heat isn't likely to slow the spread of Coronavirus as it moves deeper into the United States.\n\nUnlike with the seasonal flu, the change of seasons may not matter much to the coronavirus. ...While it is possible that this virus, like many other respiratory viruses, will not survive as readily in warm temperatures, it will be encountering a “completely susceptible” U.S. population, said Maciej F. Boni, an associate professor of biology at Penn State University. Hardly anyone in this country has been exposed to the new virus, so there’s been no chance to develop immunity. That means the coronavirus has plenty of opportunity to infect people and get passed along, Boni said.\n\n15 HEADLINES THAT TELL YOU YOU’RE LIVING A DISASTER MOVIE\n\n“THE CORONAVIRUS GOES GLOBAL”\n\n- The New York Times\n\n“DOW PLUNGES NEARLY 1,200 POINTS AS CORONAVIRUS FEARS SEND MARKETS DIVING”\n\n- NBC News\n\n“CORONAVIRUS SPREADS IN THREE CONTINENTS: MARKETS BRACE FOR GLOBAL RECESSION”\n\n- Rueters\n\n“THE CORONAVIRUS SEEMS UNSTOPPABLE.

Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan is writing about her fears again. Some 22 years ago, she almost dead-on predicted the Sept. 11 attacks, three years before they happened. Today she is worried about Coronavirus and its eventual impact on the United States:\n\n“Punditry 101: It’s bad when you don’t write about what you’re thinking about. All week I was taking notes knowing I’d be looking at South Carolina, Super Tuesday and this week’s debate. …But my mind kept tugging in another direction. So I’ll write what I’m thinking, and it may be ragged but here goes. “…I’ve got a feeling the coronavirus is going to be bad, that it will have a big impact on America, more than we imagine, and therefore on its politics. …If coronavirus becomes a formally recognized world-wide pandemic, and if it hits America hard, it is going to change a lot—the national mood, our cultural habits, the economy. “…In a public-health crisis the role of government is key. The question will be—the question is—are the president and his administration up to it? Our scientists and health professionals are. …Is Donald Trump? Or has he finally met a problem he can’t talk his way out of? I have written in the past questioning whether he can lead and reassure the nation in a time of crisis. We are about to find out. …It is in crisis that you see the difference between showmanship and leadership.”\n\nHere's why you shouldn't dismiss Noonan's fears: In the summer of 1998, well before the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, she wrote forebodingly about a terror mega-strike on the United States in the Nov. 30, 1998 “Big Issue\" of Forbes maga\n\n“Something's up. And deep down, where the body meets the soul, we are fearful. We fear, down so deep it hasn't even risen to the point of articulation, that with all our comforts and amusements, with all our toys and bells and whistles . . . we wonder if what we really have is . . . a first-class stateroom on the Titanic. Everything's wonderful, but a world is ending and we sense it. “I don't mean: \"Uh-oh, there's a depression coming,\" I mean: We live in a world of three billion men and hundreds of thousands of nuclear bombs, missiles, warheads. It's a world of extraordinary germs that can be harnessed and used to kill whole populations, a world of extraordinary chemicals that can be harnessed and used to do the same. “Three billion men, and it takes only half a dozen bright and evil ones to harness and deploy. What are the odds it will happen? Put it another way: What are the odds it will not? Low. Nonexistent, I think. “When you consider who is gifted and crazed with rage . . . when you think of the terrorist places and the terrorist countries . . . who do they hate most? The Great Satan, the United States. What is its most important place? Some would say Washington. I would say the great city of the United States is the great city of the world, the dense 10-mile-long island called Manhattan, where the economic and media power of the nation resides, the city that is the psychological center of our modernity, our hedonism, our creativity, our hard-shouldered hipness, our unthinking arrogance. “If someone does the big, terrible thing to New York or Washington, there will be a lot of chaos and a lot of lines going down, a lot of damage, and a lot of things won't be working so well anymore.”\n\nOAKLAND'S WARNING FLARE TO PHOENIX\n\nThe timing could not be more striking. The city of Phoenix approved a plan to create a citizen’s commission to watchdog its police department at the very moment the City of Oakland, Calif. was turning sulfuric with the actions of its own independent police commission.\n\nA week ago, Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf announced she was firing Oakland Police Chief Anne Kirkpatrick, the person she had hired in 2017. She was firing her “without cause” and praising her lavishly on the way out.\n\nWhat?\n\nPressed by Bay Area media to explain, Schaaf said Kirkpatrick had lost the confidence of Oakland’s 7-member independent police commission. The commission is very powerful, she said, made so by the voters of Oakland, and it is incumbent on any police chief of Oakland to maintain the trust of the commission.\n\nThe now terminated chief was stunned. “The mayor praises me but I’m terminated. I don’t understand. …I am saddened. I’m embarrassed. I’m humiliated by it,” she told San Francisco’s ABC 7 News.\n\n“I like my mayor but leaders stand up for their people, they stand up for you when they are serving you well,” Kirkpatrick told The Mercury News. “I came with these mandates to reduce crime and to have these culture shifts, to stabilize this police department. I have more than exceeded those expectations.”\n\nNo doubt playing into the chief’s departure was the 2018 police-involved shooting of a homeless man. Reports the Mercury News:\n\n“Kirkpatrick’s relationship with the commission, which represents Oakland residents and has authority over the chief and police force, has been frosty for months. Police commissioners had called for the firing of five officers involved in the fatal 2018 shooting of Joshua Pawlik, challenging the suspension recommended by Kirkpatrick, Internal Affairs and the department’s Executive Force Review Board.”\n\nOakland Police Commission Chair Regina Jackson explained that the police department had failed “to increase compliance with the court-ordered reforms required under the Negotiated Settlement Agreement.”\n\nThe department has been under federal court oversight since the 2003 settlement of a civil rights lawsuit that accused officers of assaulting suspects and planting evidence.\n\nKirkpatrick said, “Even the federal monitor, who was here with me three weeks ago, says to me in his closing meeting, one-on-one; he said, ‘Anne, you are deep in the red zone. If you are a football fan like I am, it means you’re real close to the goal line.”\n\nAfter the city fired Kirkpatrick, hundreds of Oakland police officers and support staff gathered to say their goodbyes to her and to criticize the mayor and independent commission for removing a leader they respected.\n\nToday the city of Oakland faces the following:\n\nTheir former chief is weighing a lawsuit against the city.\n\nShe has called on the U.S. Justice Department to investigate.\n\nPolice department morale is spiraling downward, and one employee tells ABC 7 News that others in the department are considering leaving with the ex-chief.\n\nKirkpatrick is now revealing in 2018 she feared retaliation from one commission member because she rebuffed her demands to drop the commissioner's towing fees. The then-chief was so concerned she made a record of it with the city’s personnel department, the Mercury News reports.\n\n“In claiming retaliation from the commission over the towing fee dispute, Kirkpatrick and (her crisis manager Sam) Singer pointed to a 2018 internal city document recently made public that states police Commissioner Ginale Harris demanded the department and the chief pay her back for towing fees Harris owed the city. Kirkpatrick notified city officials at the time, and the request was included in an investigation of Harris that had been initiated by City Administrator Sabrina Landreth. At the time, the chief told the lead investigator she was concerned about retaliation, according to the document.”\n\nIn an interview with ABC 7 News the former chief was asked what she would say to anyone contemplating becoming the next Oakland P.D. chief:\n\nA: “Do not come to Oakland because they won’t have a job for long.”\n\nQ. Is it toxic?\n\nA. “Yes.”\n\nPUBLIC REACTS TO END OF ENDORSEMENTS\n\nAs we reported on azcentral this morning, The Arizona Republic will no longer endorse candidates for office. Executive Editor Greg Burton and I explain why here.\n\nHere’s a sample of reaction:\n\nDavid Boyles, ASU instructor\n\n\"As endorsing Republican candidates has become morally and intellectually untenable, Arizona's largest newspaper, which has historically been a mouthpiece for the state's GOP power structure, has decided to punt and no longer endorse candidates at all. This is moral cowardice.\"\n\nPeter Hamby, Vanity Fair contributor\n\n\"Hope more newspapers follow their lead.\"\n\nTim Agne, Digital Editor, KJZZ Phoenix\n\n\"Newspaper endorsements are a helpful tool for voters, especially in smaller local races where we don’t have as much information about the candidates.

Times\n\n\"Bold move by the Arizona Republic.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS STORIES THAT GOT OUR ATTENTION\n\nPREGNANT WOMEN NEGLECTED\n\nThe New York Times reports that expectant moms in China are being neglected by a health-care system overwhelmed by Covid-19.\n\n“In the city of Wuhan, the center of the outbreak, pregnant women have faced the daunting prospect of figuring out where to give birth. Their community hospitals are closed, the city’s public transport is shut down and no one is allowed to leave because of quarantine rules.”\n\nAs of Wednesday, the toll in China is 80,000 people sickened, 2,600 killed.\n\nCHILDREN SPARED\n\nThe Times of London reports that Coronavirus is behaving differently than other bugs. Deaths do not follow the classic U-shaped curve in which the young and old face the highest mortality rates.\n\n“With coronavirus the death rate is not u-shaped. Yes, it rises sharply among the old but among those under 40 it is 0.2 per cent. Among those under ten it is zero. “With coronavirus something else is going on and researchers confess that they are stumped. It may be that the old are succumbing not so much because their immune systems can’t cope but because their bodies can’t. Afflicted with dodgy hearts and weakened lungs, in a way that newborns are not, they are an easier target. The more robust newborns on the other hand, even without strong immune systems, can weather the virus.”\n\nS. KOREAN HEALTH WORKERS ARE QUITTING\n\nThe Republic of Korea is now in a full-fledge epidemic that is stressing hospitals and health-care workers. The Wall Street Journal looks at the enormous stress they face.\n\n“In the hard-hit city of Daegu, South Korea, hospitals warned that they don’t have enough doctors, nurses and medical investigators to keep up with the constant stream of infected and at-risk patients. Government measures aimed at reducing infection, like discarding bedsheets and blankets after a single use, have depleted critical supplies. Employees are quitting as their families beg them to resign. “‘We can’t last long like this. All medical staff will burn out,’ said Nam Sung-il, a doctor treating patients at two Daegu hospitals. ‘Space is so scarce at one of them,’ Dr. Nam said, ‘that nurses have nowhere to rest but on the floor.’”\n\nTHE PRICE OF STOKING RESENTMENT\n\nIf you want to see where’s America’s obsession with identity politics can lead, look north to Canada, where protesters for three weeks have paralyzed the national rail system and cut people of from fuel to heat their homes, food to feed livestock, chemicals to clean drinking water, etc. etc.\n\nFinally Prime Minister Justin Trudeau demanded the removal of railroad barricades that indigenous protesters and radical environmentalists erected. But when one barricade goes down another goes up. Much of the protest centers on historic wrongs committed against First Nation peoples.\n\nJonathan Kay, columnist for the National Post, writes “While it’s convenient to blame Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s indecisive leadership for the crisis, these events do not arise in a vacuum. Rather, they follow on years during which our political, academic and journalistic elites denounced Canada itself as an ugly scar on traditional Indigenous lands. Trudeau himself has spent much of his time in office pledging himself to somehow absolve Canada of this original sin.”\n\nCanadian nationhood is wobbling, and Kay asks the essential question, “Is it possible for Anglo Canada to rebuild some kind of positive national identity:\n\n“If so, I think we will need to take stock of how our modern self-conception fell to pieces in the first place. Until roughly the late 2000s, Canada’s identity was rooted largely in the idea that we were a poorer but more conscientious sidekick to America. Our whole multilateral (and occasionally pacifistic) shtick on the world stage, not to mention our system of cultural subsidies, was based on the conceit that our relative smallness and poverty compared to the United States masked some kind of well-hidden reserve of moral superiority. It was an insecure, passive-aggressive posture that often expressed itself as peevish anti-Americanism. But at the very least, it acted as a binding agent for an English-speaking Canadian intellectual establishment whose common culture otherwise was confined to hockey, cold weather and universal health care. “But during the Obama years, all of this was thrown into confusion, because the housing-loan crisis smashed America without much affecting Canada. Suddenly, we were no longer the poor cousin. At almost exactly the same time, Barack Obama’s election in the United States, coupled with Stephen Harper’s rise in Canada, reversed the left-right political valence that had powered Canadians’ sense of moral superiority since the early years of the Cold War. Suddenly, we were the bad guys, and the whole organizing principle of Canadian intellectual life began to collapse. Into this vacuum came Idle No More, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the MMIWG report, the Indigenous backlash to Canada 150 — and Trudeau, whose political instincts are rooted in the confessional, self-lacerating spirit of political correctness that began to infect campus life at McGill University (and elsewhere) in the late 1980s and early ’90s. Twenty years ago, we bashed America. In 2020, we bash us.”\n\nTHE STEEL TO CONFRONT THE CAMPUS MOB\n\nHeather Mac Donald is a fellow at the Manhattan Institute think tank and person of real stature. She’s a lawyer with degrees from Stanford, Cambridge and Yale. She has written widely against extreme ideologies and concepts that range from radical feminism to critical race theory to implicit bias to social justice to transgender radicalism. Many of these are authoritarian in their nature and sprouting from campuses that are hot houses for daft, unchallenged social theories.\n\nIt takes courage to stand in the breach and endure the mockery of college students, but she does it with real poise. She answers the hissing crowd with details, facts and citations that damn the mob by contrast.\n\nIt’s impressive to watch, and you can see it here as students confront her at Colgate University in Hamilton, N.Y. last Thursday:\n\nLET’S RUB THEIR FACES IN IT\n\nThere are many reasons why political comity has broken down, not least being the loss of grace.\n\nI don’t understand the human instinct to bat an opponent over the head once they’ve agreed with you.\n\nWhy not graciously thank them for their sudden ray of good judgment and be done with it.\n\nBut that seldom happens in today’s politics.\n\nCase in point, this past week Gov. Doug Ducey gave in to supporters of “sanctuary cities” and pulled the brakes on a proposed constitutional ban on the designation.\n\nChris Herstam, a liberal commentator and partisan who opposed Ducey’s ban, decided this was the moment to rub the governor’s face in it.\n\n“So, once again, Ducey rolled out the immigration controversy,” Herstam wrote in the Arizona Mirror. “And, once again, an Arizona governor stained Arizona’s reputation and potentially harmed our economy.”\n\nAt the Capitol, about 40 Latino activists and lobbyists gathered to spike the football.\n\n“The response from the governor last night shows the power we have after 1070 and the power we have now,” said Hugo Polanco, a lobbyist for Living United for Change Arizona, to the Arizona Mirror.\n\nPeople are entitled to their moment of triumph, but what greater purpose does it serve?

Here's how it continues to impact the city\n\nGRACELAND HISTORY:Graceland felt like 'a twilight zone' when it opened in 1982. Now it's more like a home | Beifuss\n\n40 facts about Graceland\n\n1. The Graceland name predates the mansion. Owner Stephen C. Toof, a Memphis commercial printer, named his \"Graceland Farms\" property for his daughter, Grace, who inherited the land when her father died in 1894.\n\n2. Grace's niece, Ruth Moore, referred to in newspaper reports as a \"socialite\" and \"musical prodigy,\" and her husband, Thomas Moore, a doctor, built the Colonial Revival (sometimes called \"Classical Revival\") mansion in 1939. Before Elvis expanded it, the house contained 10,266 square feet.\n\n3. Elvis purchased Graceland — the house, the barn and the 13.8 acres of land — on March 19, 1957, for $102,500. The home's Whitehaven location was relatively isolated and rural, unlike Elvis' previous address at 1034 Audubon Drive in East Memphis. Elvis immediately began adding to the mansion, expanding the house to 17,552 square feet and 23 rooms. The mansion would be his Memphis home for 20 years.\n\n4. Under the terms of Elvis' will, Lisa Marie Presley inherited Graceland in 1993, when she turned 25, and was the property's sole owner until her death on Jan. 12, 2023, at the age of 54. (Meanwhile, Elvis Presley Enterprises, a corporate entity of the Elvis Presley Trust, manages Graceland's operations as well as most other business dealings related to Elvis, his legacy and his likeness.) Now in a trust set up by Lisa Marie, the property was inherited by Lisa Marie's daughters, actress/filmmaker Riley Keough, and the twins, Harper and Finley Lockwood.\n\n5. Graceland was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on Nov. 7, 1991. It was the first rock-and-roll-related site to be so honored.\n\n6. Graceland was declared a National Historic Landmark on March 27, 2006. Again, it was the first rock-and-roll-related site to be so honored.\n\nELVIS TRIVIA:Think you know everything about the King? Try to answer these questions\n\nGRACELAND:Tips to help you take care of business when visiting Elvis' home\n\n7. The Historic Landmark documentation provides a detailed, even literary description of Graceland: \"The house was constructed at the top of a hill, almost at the center of the property in a grove of oaks, with rolling pastures in front and behind it, and a western exposure towards the Mississippi River. A curving driveway, bordered by a six-inch concrete curb lined with small electric lights along the outside edge, approaches from the state highway at the foot of the hill and forms a large loop that passes in front of the house and returns back down the hill.\"\n\n8. The document continues: \"The house is a two-story, five bay residence in the Classical Revival style with a side-facing gabled roof covered in asphalt shingles, a central two-story projecting pedimented portico, and one-story wings on its north and south sides. The front and side facades of the central block are veneered with Tishomingo limestone from Mississippi...\"\n\n9. The familiar pink Alabama fieldstone wall that fronts the property was erected in 1957, to protect Presley's privacy and discourage trespassing fans. (It has not been entirely successful; see fact No. 15.) Since Elvis' death, the wall has served as a graffiti magnet and message board, with fans scrawling sometimes very personal sentiments or adding artwork tributes to the King to almost every available space on the rough but invitingly pale stone.\n\n10. Built and erected by the Tennessee Fabricating Co. and Memphis' Dillard Door Co. at a total cost of about $2,700, the famous custom-built gates of Graceland — a \"special double drive way gate,\" to quote the work order — were installed on April 22, 1957. With their stylized representations of a guitar-strumming Elvis set against a pattern of musical staffs and notes, the gates suggest the entryway to a musical heaven. The gates were restored in 1990 by the National Ornamental Metal Museum.\n\n11. In a testimony to Elvis' influence, the City Council on June 29, 1971, unanimously approved a proposal to change the name of the five-mile stretch of South Bellevue between South Parkway and the Mississippi state line to \"Elvis Presley Boulevard\"; the street address of Graceland thus became 3764 Elvis Presley Boulevard. The first sign was put in place during a January 1972 ceremony that was attended by Mayor Wyeth Chandler and Elvis' father, Vernon Presley.\n\n12. A highlight of any Graceland tour, the ornamental stained-glass peacocks that flank the open doorway between the living room and the music room were added by the Laukhuff Stained Glass Company of Memphis in 1974.\n\n13. Also in 1974, Elvis remodeled two basement hang-out rooms. Painted and decorated in yellow and black, the \"TV Room\" is notable for the three television sets built into the south wall, so Elvis could watch all three commercial networks at once (presumably, he wasn't much of a PBS fan), and for the spooky white monkey statuette on its center table. (The figure inspired \"Porcelain Monkey,\" an Elvis lament by singer Warren Zevon: \"Hip-shakin', shoutin' in gold lamé/ That's how he earned his regal sobriquet/ Then he threw it all away/ For a porcelain monkey.\") Even more challenging to the eyeballs is the \"Pool Room,\" its claustrophobic interior dominated by a central pool table and its walls and low ceiling covered in close to 400 yards of vividly multi-colored pleated fabric.\n\n14. On Nov. 24, 1976, Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis' contemporary and onetime rock-and-roll rival, was arrested at about 3 a.m. outside Graceland, after he drove up to the gates in his Lincoln Continental Mark IV and demanded to see Elvis, while \"screaming and yelling and waving a Derringer in the air\" (according to the testimony of a guard at the gates, as quoted in The Commercial Appeal). Police confirmed that the Killer's \"two-shot .38 caliber Derringer\" was loaded (as, apparently, was Lewis).\n\n15. A less troublesome trespasser was Bruce Springsteen, who, on April 29, 1976, after making his Memphis concert debut at the old Ellis Auditorium, took a taxi to Graceland, accompanied by E Street Band guitar player \"Miami\" Steve Van Zandt. According to an oft-repeated story, when the Boss saw a light on inside the mansion, he had an urge to meet the King. As Springsteen told a concert crowd in 1985, when introducing a cover of Elvis' \"Follow That Dream\": \"I said, 'Steve, man, I gotta go check it out.' And I jumped up over the wall and I started runnin' up the driveway, which when I look back on it now was kind of a stupid thing to do because I hate it when people do it at my house... Guards came out of the woods and they asked me what I wanted. And I said, 'Is Elvis home?' Then they said, 'No, no, Elvis isn't home, he's in Lake Tahoe'. [Which was true.] So, I started to tell 'em that I was a guitar player and that I had my own band, and that we played in town that night, and that I made some records. And I even told 'em I had my picture on the cover of Time and Newsweek. I had to pull out all the stops to try to make an impression, you know. I don't think he believed me, though, 'cause he just kinda stood there noddin' and then he took me by the arm and put me back out on the street with Steve.\"\n\n16. In addition to rock-and-rollers, Graceland attracted many animals. Pets owned by Elvis included Scatter, a chimpanzee, and Bambi, a squirrel monkey. Some exotic animal gifts were donated to the Memphis Zoo, including two wallabies, sent by Australian fans.\n\n17. The animals with the longest history at Graceland were horses. Elvis' reputed favorite was Rising Sun, a golden palomino. Mare Ingram was a mare, named after Memphis Mayor William B. Ingram. Some other horses owned by Elvis and housed in Graceland's air-conditioned barn included Flaming Star, Thundercloud, Star Trek and a Tennessee Walking Horse named Ebony's Double, which was the last horse Elvis bought.\n\nBAZ LUHRMANN'S'ELVIS' :'Elvis' movie shakes up Cannes.

After rigging the Jungle Room into a home studio, Elvis made his final recordings inside Graceland, in February and October 1976. Featuring members of his touring band, including such legends as guitarist James Burton and drummer Ronnie Tutt, the sessions provided the foundation for the singer's last two studio albums, \"From Elvis Presley Boulevard, Memphis, Tennessee\" and \"Moody Blue\" (which was released less than a month before the singer's death), and yielded the last three Top 40 pop chart singles of his lifetime: \"Hurt,\" \"Moody Blue\" and \"Way Down.\"\n\n19. Built in 1975, the two-story racquetball building behind the mansion contained an upright piano. Elvis sat at that piano not long before he died on Aug. 16, 1977, performing \"Unchained Melody\" and \"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain.\" Later, upstairs at in the mansion, Elvis' girlfriend, Ginger Alden, discovered Presley on his bathroom floor. He was taken to Baptist Hospital on Union Avenue and pronounced dead.\n\n20. Elvis' funeral was held on Aug. 18, 1977, at Graceland. The eulogy was delivered by Jackie Kahane, a standup comic who opened many Presley concerts in the 1970s. At Vernon Presley's request, a public viewing of the body was held in the foyer of the mansion the day before, attracting 10,000 to 25,000 mourners. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of other fans congregated during the week along Elvis Presley Boulevard.\n\n21. Originally interred about four miles north of Graceland inside the Forest Hill Cemetery Midtown mausoleum on Elvis Presley Boulevard, the bodies of Elvis and his mother, Gladys Presley, were moved to the Meditation Garden at Graceland on Oct. 2, 1977. The move came after the Aug. 29 arrest of three men in a plot to steal Elvis' body from Forest Hill and hold it for ransom. With its circular pool, fountains, stained-glass panels and Ancient World-looking columns, the Meditation Garden had been constructed in 1964 and '65.\n\n22. Six people are buried in the Meditation Garden. Using the spellings that appear on the grave markers, these people include Elvis Aaron Presley (\"Aron\" is the way the name appears on Elvis' birth certificate, marriage certificate and driver's licenses); Elvis' daughter, Lisa Marie Presley; his father, Vernon Elvis Presley; his mother, Gladys Love Smith Presley; his grandmother, Minnie Mae Presley; and the grandson he never met, Benjamin Storm Presley Keough, the son of Elvis' daughter, Lisa Marie Presley. The Garden also contains a marker for Elvis' stillborn twin, Jessie Garon Presley, who was buried in an unmarked grave in Tupelo. (\"Jessie\" is spelled \"Jesse\" in most other sources.)\n\n23. The gravesite is the focus of the annual Candlelight Vigil that draws thousands of fans to Graceland every year, to promenade to the Meditation Garden on the anniversary of Elvis' death. The vigil originally was a fan-generated event, but it soon was embraced by Elvis Presley Enterprises and made the centerpiece of Graceland's annual \"Elvis Week\" August activities. The first vigil was held in 1978, when fans from the Austin, Texas-based Elvis Country Fan Club traveled to Graceland to pay their respects to the King by lighting candles outside the gates.\n\n24. Family members continued to live at Graceland after Elvis' death, including Vernon Presley, who died in 1979, and Minnie Mae Presley, who died in 1980. But the hardiest post-Elvis Graceland resident was Delta Mae Presley Biggs, known to family and fans alike as \"Aunt Delta.\" The sister of Vernon Presley, Aunt Delta moved to Graceland in 1966, after the death of her husband, and continued to live in the mansion even after it was opened to the public, until her death on July 29, 1993, at 74. During this time, the Graceland kitchen and bedroom frequented by Delta remained off-limits to tourists; the rooms were added to the tour after her death.\n\n25. Graceland was opened to the public on June 7, 1982. Admission was $5. Attendance through the end of that year exceeded 330,000 — well above projections. As of the summer of 2022, the cheapest available Graceland ticket that includes the mansion tour is $77 (or $44 for a kid, 5-10); yearly attendance is about 500,000.\n\n26. On Feb. 22, 1984, Elvis’ two private jets — the Lisa Marie and the Hound Dog II — arrived in Memphis and were transported down Elvis Presley Boulevard to their present location, across the street from the mansion. The Lisa Marie is a Convair 880 with a cruising speed of about 615 mph that seats about 28 people; Elvis bought it from Delta Airlines in 1975 for $250,000 and fitted it with a private bedroom with a queen-size bed; four televisions; and a 52-speaker stereo system. The Hound Dog II, which can host only about 10 passengers, is a Lockheed JetStar.\n\n27. In 1994, the live tour guides that had been a fixture at Graceland were replaced by \"audio guides\" — audiotapes with headphones that visitors wear as they tour the mansion. The audio guides are available in nine languages: English, German, Italian, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, Japanese, Mandarin Chinese and French.\n\n28. On May 30, 2016, Graceland welcomed its 20 millionth visitor since its conversion to a tourist attraction. Accompanied by husband Robert Greenoak, Tiffany Greenoak, 31, of London, England, was designated lucky No. 20,000,000. “We played Elvis music at our wedding, so for us as a couple, this trip to Memphis has tremendous meaning,\" said Mrs. Greenoak. The couple was given a private tour and received a congratulatory phone call from Priscilla Presley, who was married to Elvis from 1967 to 1973. (Priscilla's wedding took place not at Graceland but at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas.)\n\nELVIS IN THE MOVIES:Elvis is still a movie star. Here's a guide to his screen 'appearances'\n\nELVIS FANS:'Elvis has the perfect face': This Tennessee artist has created 20,000 images of the King\n\n29. On June 30, 2006, President George W. Bush became the first sitting U.S. President to visit Graceland when he, first ady Laura Bush and Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi took a private tour of the mansion, led by Priscilla Presley and Lisa Marie. The reason: Koizumi — who shares Elvis' 8 birthday — is a Presley superfan. According to press reports, he said visiting Graceland was like a \"dream,\" and serenaded the Bushes and Presleys during the tour with song snippets, crooning, \"Hold me close, hold me tight,\" and \"Love me tender.\"\n\n30. As chronicled on the \"Celebrity Visitors to Graceland\" snapshot gallery on the Elvis website, other notables who have visited Graceland in recent years include — to name just a few — Dua Lipa, Vanilla Ice, Tom Brokaw, Gilbert Gottfried, Dolph Lundgren, Chris Tucker, Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey, Bill Nye (the Science Guy), demonic Kiss bassist Gene Simmons, the Foo Fighters and the pre-divorce duo of Russell Brand and Katy Perry.(Not pictured: Prince William and Prince Harry, who visited Graceland in 2014.)\n\n31. Paul McCartney visited Graceland on May 26, 2013, and tweeted a picture of himself leaving a guitar pick on Elvis' grave. He reportedly told onlookers the gesture was \"so Elvis can play in heaven.\"\n\n32. The 450-room Guest House at Graceland opened on Oct. 27, 2016, north of the mansion on Elvis Presley Boulevard. The hotel space includes a 464-seat theater and four bars and restaurants. It effectively replaced the 128-room Heartbreak Hotel, a remodeled 1986 Wilson World lodge that Graceland remodeled and reopened in 1999.\n\n33. A casualty of Graceland expansion was the so-called Graceland Crossing shopping plaza, an L-shaped strip mall of independent Elvis souvenir shops located across the street and to the north of the mansion. A popular Elvis Week hangout for fans, who gathered in a tent in the plaza parking lot to listen to performances by tribute artists (this reporter once ran into Jackson Browne there), the space was bought by Graceland and closed in 2017.\n\n34. Located in a secluded space between the Guest House and the mansion, the Graceland Chapel in the Woods lived up to its \"Love Me Tender\" mission on Aug. 13, 2018, when Memphis-based Elvis fans Julie Guardado and Marc Caudel — who had met during Elvis Week 2015 — became the first couple to be married in the then-new chapel.\n\n35. Also among the structures now on the grounds of Graceland is the Elvis Presley archive: a climate-controlled cinderblock building that houses much of the estate's estimated 1.5 million documents, photographs, wardrobe items, musical instruments and other Elvis-connected objects.\n\n36. The ambitious centerpiece of an attempt to expand the Elvis experience beyond the mansion, Elvis Presley’s Memphis opened on March 2, 2017. Located on the Graceland campus across the street from the house, the $45 million, 40-acre complex includes restaurants, shops, exhibit space and The Soundstage at Graceland, which has become one of the city's busiest venues, hosting concerts by such artists as Tanya Tucker, X, the Monkees (with Michael Nesmith, just two months before his death) and the other Elvis, Costello.\n\n37. Graceland is closed to visitors only on Thanksgiving and Christmas. However, on March 20, 2020, Graceland closed — like many public places in Shelby County — due to Health Department mandates related to the coronavirus pandemic. It reopened May 21, with a number of whimsical Elvis-themed cautions in place. \"Don't Forget to Social Distance\" counseled the campus' illustrated signs, which represented the recommended six-feet-of-separation as a measurement equal to \"6 teddy bears,\" \"3 hound dogs,\" \"2 guitars\" or \"1 Elvis.\"\n\n38. Excluding the Guest House, Graceland in 2022 has 231 employees — 160 of whom work fulltime.\n\n39. In 2018, the Hallmark Channel holiday movie \"Christmas at Graceland,\" starring American Idol contestant turned country music hit-maker Kellie Pickler, became the first fiction film to be shot on the grounds of the Elvis Presley estate. A ratings smash for the channel, it inspired two HCU (Hallmark Cinematic Universe) follow-ups, \"Wedding at Graceland\" and \"Christmas at Graceland: Home for the Holidays.\"\n\n40. From its 1982 public opening through May 2022, Graceland has attracted just under 23 million visitors, according to figures supplied by Graceland. With some 600,000 \"guests\" per year, the Elvis estate is the second most-visited \"house museum\" in the United States, according to Forbes. The first is the White House.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/06/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2017/01/25/answer-man-san-giusto-estate-al-capone-and-elvis-connection/97033800/", "title": "Answer Man: San Giusto Estate, Al Capone and Elvis connection?", "text": "John Boyle, jboyle@citizen-times.com\n\nToday’s batch of burning questions, my smart-aleck answers and the real deal:\n\nQuestion: This is two readers' questions in one. Reader one: Is there any truth to the rumor that Al Capone once owned the San Giusto Estate off Cane Creek Road? Reader two: I enjoyed your column last week about Elvis Presley allegedly attempting to buy a large home on a Fletcher hilltop. You should talk to the Florens, who own San Giusto Estate off Cane Creek Road. I'm pretty sure Elvis’ attempted to buy that property.\n\nMy answer: At this point I'm expecting Elvis to make an offer on my Styrofoam and vinyl estate, which I call \"Boylemore.\"\n\nReal answer: I do love a good coincidence. Shortly after Reader Two called me about San Giusto, Judy Floren, who owns the beautiful yellow brick estate with her husband, Roger, called me to talk about its history, which does indeed include Elvis Presley, not to mention famous actors Charlton Heston, Grace Kelly and Robert Mitchum, as well as European royalty.\n\nShe graciously invited me out for a tour and a history session with her and Roger, and it made for a fascinating afternoon.\n\nBefore I get to the tour, I'll cut to the chase on the readers' questions: Elvis Presley apparently did make an offer on the home in the 1950s after he hit it big, and no, notorious gangster Al Capone never owned the property. The developer of the Grove Park Inn and the Grove Arcade did own the property, but not the house.\n\n\"It looks like E.W. Grove owned the property for the latter half of the 1920s until the time of his death,\" said Buncombe County Register of Deeds Drew Reisinger. \"His family then sold the house to Carl and Lillian Baumann in 1934. Then in 1940 the property transferred to R.C. Arnstein. This Arnstein family owns the property until 1970.\"\n\nCapone, who brutally ruled over Chicago's gangland in the early part of the 20th century, spent about eight years in prison in the 1930s, getting paroled in November 1939. He died Jan. 25, 1947.\n\n\"Looking at a timeline of the life of Al Capone, it does not look like Capone, or a shell company owned by him, ever owned this property,\" Reisinger said.\n\nThe Florens also echoed Reisinger's assessment.\n\n\"Maria and Rudolph Arnstein bought the log house,\" Judy Floren told me, as we stood in a gorgeous tiled bar area, with pictures of the Arnsteins on the wall. \"They're the ones who ran out of the house the night of the fire.\"\n\nBaumann, who founded the 1/2 Circle B Ranch, had built the 11-room log home in the 1934, and it did burn down. An April 1, 1941 Asheville Citizen news article the Florens keep in a scrapbook about the home has the headline, \"Blaze Destroys Arnstein Home Near Fletcher,\" and estimated the loss at $50,000.\n\nThe article stated the fire started in the roof, and the Florens said it apparently was above the fireplace.\n\nThe Arnsteins rebuilt the home, which has a gorgeous view of Cane Creek Valley, on the same footprint, creating a new 11-room house -- but not out of logs.\n\n\"They rebuilt out of solid masonry, with three fire hoses in the house,\" Judy Floren told me.\n\nMr. Arnstein died in 1946, but Mrs. Arnstein lived until 1970, remaining an ardent supporter of the arts and local drama, including the Flat Rock Playhouse and the Asheville Community Theater, Judy Floren said. That explains the pictures of movie stars hanging in the bar area, near one of Elvis.\n\n\"Charlton Heston stayed here when he was working at the Flat Rock Playhouse, and Robert Mitchum stayed here during the filming of 'Thunder Road,'” Judy Floren said, referring to the 1950s movie about moonshining that Mitchum starred in. \"Grace Kelly visited while filming here. And Elvis came up here and tried to buy this house.”\n\nFloren said President Franklin D. Roosevelt also visited with the Arnsteins, who had bought a lot of war bonds, while the president was on a trip that included a stop at Lake Lure and its pools.\n\nRoger Floren, who is also an attorney, said his understanding is Elvis Presley tried to buy the house, possibly in 1956, when it was for sale, along with about 800 acres. The estate now comprises about 20 acres.\n\nThe name of the house comes from Italy and the town of San Giusto, where the Arnsteins had lived prior to immigrating to the United States. The couple lived in Connecticut, discovering the gorgeous Cane Creek property on a trip to Greenville, South Carolina.\n\nThe Florens bought the home in 2001, after their own home, a Tudor-style house on the other end of Cane Creek Road, burned nearly to the ground after a kerosene heater caught fire. San Giusto had been vacant for about a decade, home only to campers and teenage partiers.\n\n\"When we bought it, 18 cats were living under the house,\" said Judy Floren, who with Roger owns the Fleshers Fairview Nursing & Retirement Home in Fairview and a prescription medicine company. \"One day I saw one sticking his head up out a heat vent here in the dining room. We had to put traps out, and each day we would catch a cat — some were little, some medium and some were large. Then we caught the mother cat.\"\n\nThen they got the place boarded up tight.\n\nObviously, the place was a wreck, and the Florens spent a year renovating it, including a gorgeous restoration of a green and white bas relief wall sculpture that depicts a hunting scene and dominates the wall above the fireplace and sunken sitting area in the main living room. The room also features the original fireplace grate to the estate, an iron mesh scene depicting a cowboy, a nod to the estate's origin as a longhorn cattle ranch.\n\nThe room also has a waist-high iron gate the Arnsteins brought from Italy, and the dining room next door is dominated by a beautiful, carved Carrara marble mantle dating to 1650. The Arnsteins had it shipped to America after they left Italy, in part because of the rising anti-Jewish sentiment in Europe in the 1930s.\n\nMr. Arnstein, Austrian and Jewish by birth, had served in World War I and lost an arm in battle. After the war, the Arnstein family became the largest coffee importers in Europe, Roger Floren said.\n\nRoger Floren noted that during World War II rumors swirled in Fairview about the Arnsteins, probably because of their Austrian heritage.\n\n\"Oh yes, the rumor was the Mr. Arnstein was a spy, and that there were Nazis hiding out up here,\" Roger Floren said with a chuckle.\n\nThat couldn't have been further from the truth. Actually, the Arnsteins' son served in the U.S. Army, conducting counter-intelligence operations against the Nazis and its notorious police force, the Gestapo. The Arnsteins did have distant relatives related back to European royalty, including Kaiser Wilhelm.\n\nThe Arnsteins' daughter and granddaughter continued that royal theme, both marrying Italian counts. The granddaughter, who lives in Florida, has brought her extended family to San Giusto for visits. Roger Floren shares all the history of the Arnstein family with her and her family.\n\n\"They told us one time, 'You know more about our family than we do,'\" Roger Floren said.\n\nThis is the opinion of John Boyle.

City's Oleksandr Zinchenko intervened when Manuel Lanzini was through at the other end, before Ederson had little trouble gathering the ball from record signing Sebastien Haller's attempted overhead kick.\n\nIt was only a matter of when City, with summer signing Rodri looking assured in midfield, would increase the tempo and make more of its superiority.\n\nKevin de Bruyne set up Sterling to score through Lukasz Fabianski's legs in the 51st, minutes before Jesus had a well-worked team effort ruled out through VAR for offside. Sterling, played in by David Silva before he crossed for Jesus' tap in, appeared to have his shoulder ahead of the defender.\n\nEderson was forced to make a double-save from Javier \"Chicharito\" Hernandez, then Lanzini in West Ham's best phase.\n\n\"They had an incredible chance and it could go 1-2 with 15 minutes left. So you have to be strong, calm and positive. You have to control your emotions,\" said City coach Pep Guardiola.\n\nVAR was needed again when Sterling grabbed his second in the 75th, timing his run for Mahrez's ball over the top before lifting it over Fabianski, but this time the goal was allowed.\n\nThen Aguero was given a second chance to take his penalty after Fabianski saved his first effort. A VAR check showed Declan Rice was encroaching in the penalty area.\n\nAguero made it 4-0 in the 86th and Sterling wrapped it up in injury time, becoming the first since Didier Drogba in 2010-11 to start with a hat trick on the league's opening weekend.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/apf-Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2015/02/09/toure-cannot-return-quickly-enough-for-stumbling-man-city/23107555/", "title": "Toure cannot return quickly enough for stumbling Man City", "text": "AP\n\nMANCHESTER, England (AP) — With the English Premier League title slipping away, Manchester City's Yaya Toure cannot return quickly enough from the African Cup of Nations to lift the stumbling champions.\n\nCity hasn't won any of its last five matches in all competitions, the club's worst run since the final days of Mark Hughes' reign in 2009.\n\nSurely, it's no coincidence that this latest winless streak has coincided with Toure's recent absence.\n\nThe team's driving force in midfield, he has been sorely missed while away on international duty with Ivory Coast at the African Cup.\n\nMercifully, for City, Toure is on his way back from the tournament — he captained the Ivorians to a first continental title in 23 years on Sunday — but probably too late to be involved in Wednesday's league game at Stoke, which second-place City starts seven points adrift of leader Chelsea.\n\n\"We can't really afford too many more slip-ups, if any,\" said midfielder James Milner, who scored with an injury-time free kick to earn City a disappointing 1-1 home draw with Hull on Saturday.\n\n\"We know, more than anyone, you have to keep going to the death and anything can happen, but I think we have got to be pretty faultless between now and the end of the season to get close.\"\n\nCity's decline has allowed the chasing pack to close the gap.\n\nSouthampton is only four points back in third with Manchester United a further point adrift in fourth.\n\nHughes is now the manager of Stoke and will relish an opportunity to pile misery on his former club. Many observers feel he was fired unfairly by City more than five years ago.\n\nStoke is traditionally a tough place to win three points and, with Chelsea at home to out-of-form Everton, there's a good chance the London club's lead can be extended Wednesday in the 25th round of fixtures.\n\nHere are some other things to look out for in the midweek round of games:\n\n___\n\nMAN UNITED'S PLAN B\n\nWith his expensively assembled forward line misfiring, Man United manager Louis van Gaal is finding attacking solutions in his Plan B from the substitutes' bench — Marouane Fellaini.\n\nFellaini's height and presence has offered United a different kind of threat late in games. He came on to score United's opener in a 2-0 win at Queens Park Rangers two weeks ago and his second-half arrival Sunday changed the game at West Ham where Daley Blind scored an injury-time equalizer in a 1-1 draw.\n\n\"We couldn't cope with the long balls Manchester United kept putting in the box (toward Fellaini),\" West Ham manager Sam Allardyce said. \"It was just 'thump it forward' and see what they could get.\"\n\nFellaini is likely to be on the bench again when United hosts Burnley on Wednesday.\n\n___\n\nLIVERPOOL'S CONCERNS\n\nLiverpool could be without three players who have been instrumental in the team's recent revival for Tuesday's match against Tottenham, which is a key fixture in the fight for Champions League qualification.\n\nHolding midfielder Lucas Leiva and forwards Raheem Sterling and Philippe Coutinho were all hurt during a 0-0 draw at Everton Saturday and are doubts, according to Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers.\n\nIt may persuade Rodgers to give a first start to Daniel Sturridge since the striker's return from five months out injured. Sturridge has come on as a substitute in Liverpool's last three games.\n\nA win for Liverpool would move it a point behind fifth-place Tottenham.\n\n___\n\nPARDEW, NEWCASTLE REUNITED\n\nSix weeks after leaving Newcastle following four turbulent years at St. James' Park, Alan Pardew will take on his former club for the first time as Crystal Palace manager on Wednesday.\n\nPardew has won five of his six matches since joining Palace in early January, a run of form that has lifted the club away from relegation trouble.\n\n___\n\nPEARSON'S LAST GAME?\n\nLeicester has rejected widespread reports in the British media that its manager, Nigel Pearson, will be fired, with the team in last place and on a run of three straight losses.\n\nThe pressure is on Pearson, though, and a trip to Arsenal on Tuesday is hardly the kind of fixture Leicester needs in its situation — especially as Arsenal's star forward, Alexis Sanchez, is available again after injury.\n\nPearson came under scrutiny during a 1-0 loss to Crystal Palace Saturday when he placed his hands round the neck of Palace midfielder James McArthur, after the player slid off the pitch into the technical area.\n\nAlso Wednesday, it's: Southampton vs. West Ham and West Bromwich vs. Swansea.

Instead, Anthony Gordon's contested goal inflicted a first league defeat of the season on last year's runner-up to leave it in third place and in danger of dropping out of the top four depending on results on Sunday.\n\nBoth Liverpool and Aston Villa have the chance to move above Arsenal when they play at Luton and Nottingham Forest, respectively. Tottenham, meanwhile, could open up a five-point lead on London rival Arsenal if it beats Chelsea.\n\nTottenham is now the only unbeaten team left in England's top flight and will be looking to extend that run when up against former manager Mauricio Pochettino on Monday.\n\nARSENAL ANGER\n\nArsenal manager Mikel Arteta was furious after an extensive VAR review allowed Gordon's 64th-minute goal to stand and Newcastle secured a narrow win.\n\nVAR checked for three possible infringements before giving the goal. There were checks to see if the ball had gone out of play, if there had been a foul and for a possible offside. In the end the goal stood and it proved to be decisive.\n\n“I’ve been 20 years in this country and now I feel ashamed. It’s a disgrace and there’s too much at stake here,” Arteta said. \"It’s not good enough. I feel embarrassed to be part of this.”\n\nSAUDI SOCCER\n\nThis was a good week for Newcastle and Saudi Arabia's ambitions in soccer. In the space of a few days, the Saudi-backed club has secured back-to-back wins against two of the traditional giants of the English game after beating Manchester United 3-0 in the League Cup on Wednesday.\n\nSaudi Arabia is also all but certain to host the 2034 World Cup after its only rival, Australia, pulled out of the running this week.\n\nUNITED RELIEF\n\nUnder-pressure Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag was minutes away from a latest setback at Fulham until Bruno Fernandes’ late strike secured a 1-0 win.\n\nLike his coach, Fernandes has also come in for criticism as the sense of crisis at United has deepened, with club great Roy Keane calling for the Portugal international to be stripped of the captaincy. But the midfielder came up with a crucial goal to end his team’s two-game losing streak (in all competitions) in the first minute of stoppage time.\n\n“It’s really important, we know the position we are in,” Fernandes said. “We need to get results, it was massively important for us to get the three points today.\n\n“I know we have even more than we showed today.”\n\nHAALAND BLOW\n\nErling Haaland was substituted at halftime against Bournemouth after twisting his ankle.\n\nWhile Guardiola said the withdrawal was a precaution, the Norway striker looked in discomfort when pulling up in the first half. Guardiola did not know if his leading scorer would be available to play Young Boys in the Champions League on Tuesday.\n\nEven without him, City cruised to its latest win, with Doku showing his match-winning qualities.\n\n\"When he takes the ball and goes, everybody is excited and myself too. Something is going to happen and it’s happened,” Guardiola said.\n\nRELEGATION FEARS\n\nBurnley could be headed straight back down to the second tier unless it can sort out its home form. Vincent Kompany's team became the first in Premier League history to lose its opening six home games of a season after losing 2-0 to Crystal Palace.\n\nSheffield United has also struggled since being promoted at the end of last season, but finally secured its first win back in the top flight against Wolverhampton. Oliver Norwood's penalty in the 10th minute of second-half stoppage time sealed a 2-1 win after Jean-Ricner Bellegarde had scored an 89th-minute equalizer for Wolves.\n\nSheffield United still remains bottom of the standings, but is level on points with Burnley in 19th.\n\nEVERTON OWN-GOAL\n\nEverton missed the chance to make a serious move up the table after Ashley Young's own-goal salvaged a 1-1 draw for Brighton.\n\nA win would have moved Sean Dyche's improving team up to 12th in the standings and Vitali Mykolenko's seventh-minute goal put the Toffees on course for a sixth victory in eight matches in all competitions, until Young put the ball into his own net. Everton stayed 15th.\n\nNeal Maupay's first goal in 35 matches ended a barren run of more than 14 months as Brentford beat West Ham 3-2.\n\nThe forward's last goal had also come against the Hammers, in a 1-0 win for Everton in September last year. This time he was setting Brentford up for victory.\n\nThe Bees still had to come from behind after going 2-1 down in the first half through goals from Mohammed Kudus and Jarrod Bowen.\n\nAn own-goal from Konstantinos Mavropanos after the break evened the score before Nathan Collins grabbed his first goal for Brentford and the winner in the 69th.\n\n___\n\nJames Robson is at https://twitter.com/jamesalanrobson\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2020/07/27/epls-longest-season-ends-pandemic-issues-linger-for-clubs/41877421/", "title": "Longest season ends, pandemic issues linger for the EPL", "text": "AP\n\nOnce the final whistle blew on the longest English Premier League, 352 days after it began, there was a sense of relief and grief for Dean Smith.\n\nThere was joy at Aston Villa avoiding relegation on the final day of the pandemic-interrupted season, and sadness for the manager who could not share the achievement with his father.\n\nRon Smith was one of the 45,752 recorded coronavirus victims in Britain, dying in May at the age of 79 during the league’s shutdown.\n\n“It’s been emotional,” Dean Smith said after Sunday's 1-1 draw at West Ham. “I’m sure he’ll be looking down on us.”\n\nThe point earned in east London kept Villa just above the relegation zone. Bournemouth and Watford joined Norwich in dropping into the second flight of competition.\n\nWhen the league was suddenly halted in the second week of March, after coronavirus infections were reported at Arsenal and Chelsea, Villa was two points from safety and used the hiatus to regroup.\n\n“I thought we used it really well,” Smith said, “We had to, because we couldn’t keep doing what we were doing.”\n\nThroughout the unprecedented 100-day pause in play, uncertainty persisted over whether the season would resume at all. Safety concerns collided with self-interest and fears about the billion-pound bill for not completing the 380 games.\n\nIt was a test of resolve for new Premier League chief executive Richard Masters, but Project Restart was accomplished.\n\nRules restricting the number of people allowed in stadiums to 300 meant when Liverpool fulfilled its 30-year mission to be champion of England again, players lifted the Premier League trophy in an empty Anfield.\n\nBut there was no asterisk on the title triumph. The full program of games was completed, unlike in France, where Paris Saint-Germain was declared champion of a curtailed season.\n\nLeicester would have preferred the league positions in March to be the final standings. No team suffered more after the restart in June than the 2016 champion, blowing an eight-point cushion in the Champions League places.\n\nThe capitulation was completed by Sunday’s 2-0 loss to Manchester United, which took the last Champions League place off Brendan Rodgers' lineup.\n\nThe game-changer was Manchester City’s big off-field success in a season when the eventual runner-up was dethroned by Liverpool. City lawyers convinced the Court of Arbitration for Sport to overturn a two-year ban from European competitions which meant fifth place -- where Leicester finished -- no longer provided entry to the Champions League.\n\nFrank Lampard steering Chelsea to fourth place was an unexpected feat for the club’s all-time leading scorer in his first season in topflight management while hampered by the club’s transfer ban.\n\nChelsea reaped the benefits of Lampard having to delve into the club’s pool of academy graduates rather than making expensive signings. Fittingly, 21-year-old midfielder Mason Mount, who made his competitive debut only in August, scored the first goal in Sunday’s 2-0 victory over Wolverhampton.\n\n“I’ve learnt a million things,\" Lampard said.\n\nThe season could still end for Chelsea in a Champions League final if a 3-0 deficit to Bayern Munich can be overcome next month in the round of 16.\n\nLampard's first chance of a trophy as Chelsea manager comes in Saturday’s FA Cup final against Arsenal. Like Chelsea, Arsenal turned to a former midfielder this season to take charge. Arriving halfway through the campaign as Unai Emery’s replacement, Mikel Arteta lacked the time to impose his vision on the north London club.\n\nArsenal will be absent from the Champions League for a fourth successive season and the only route into the Europa League is by winning the FA Cup after finishing eighth. Arsenal was even overhauled by Tottenham, which was adrift in 14th place when Mauricio Pochettino was fired in November and replaced by Jose Mourinho.\n\nBut there won’t be a fifth consecutive season in the Champions League for the 2019 beaten finalist. Although Mourinho dragged Tottenham back up the standings, a sixth-place finish means a return to the Europa League. Mourinho will need to strengthen the squad while not losing top-scorer Harry Kane to another lengthy injury layoff or a rival club.\n\n“When all the players are available we showed in this last period where we belong,\" Mourinho said.\n\nAfter moving into a new stadium last year, Tottenham has been particularly hard hit by the lack of matchday revenue. But financial uncertainty is prevalent now throughout the world's richest league amid recession fears. The government is planning on allowing fans to return to stadiums from October, but attendances could be capped at 25% with social distancing maintained.\n\nHow to bring fans back into games safely — while the COVID-19 threat lingers — is one of the big challenges facing the league as clubs head into an offseason that will last less than 50 days.\n\nThat could be determined by a scientific study on how much singing, including by football fans, can spread droplets which could contain the virus. The research involves the London-based Fortius Clinic's Prof. James Calder, who also chairs a government committee on the return of elite sports.\n\n“If it is truly dangerous, then we need to continue those mitigations with social distancing,” Calder told The Associated Press. “We hope to have the results out in the next few weeks, which will then hopefully guide the government on what we do, not just in theaters and opera houses, but also what we should be doing in sports stadia with the crowds.\"\n\nThere is also a decision to be taken by clubs over whether to retain the use of five substitutes next season. FIFA allowed the temporary use of two additional substitutes because of the extra workload on players after the lockdown.\n\nWhat will remain for a second season is VAR — the video review system that caused frustrating delays in matches before the lockdown stopped games being played at all for more than two months in this longest of English seasons.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/07/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2017/04/05/hazard-double-returns-chelsea-to-winning-path-with-city-win/100092754/", "title": "Eden Hazard scores twice as Chelsea beats Manchester City", "text": "AP\n\nLONDON - The symbol of Chelsea’s collapse last season, Eden Hazard has spearheaded the revival under Antonio Conte.\n\nWith another two goals on Wednesday sealing a 2-1 victory over Manchester City, Hazard set the runaway leaders back on the winning track after a shock weekend setback.\n\nStamford Bridge now regularly rises to acclaim the winger who went missing in Chelsea’s moments of despair last year and was branded a “rat” by fans who blamed him for Jose Mourinho’s second reign ending in acrimony.\n\nWith each goal — 12 and counting after Wednesday — and every moment he’s shimmering across the field, Hazard has rekindled the love affair with the Chelsea faithful.\n\n“He’s an important player and also he’s growing in his mentality,” Conte said. “I think he’s playing a really good season.”\n\nMORE PREMIER LEAGUE:\n\nArsenal overcomes West Ham with inspired second half\n\nTottenham stages late fightback, wins 3-1 at Swansea\n\nIt will surely end with a Premier League winner’s medal to keep the one from 2014-15 company.\n\nA shock loss to Crystal Palace on Saturday halted Chelsea’s serene path to the trophy, but normal service was resumed at Stamford Bridge to leave former title rival City with a fight just to hold onto fourth place.\n\nWith Tottenham storming back to win 3-1 at Swansea in a game that finished slightly earlier, Chelsea’s victory maintained its seven-point lead over the north London club.\n\n“I don’t know if the way we played was beautiful, but the most important thing is to win games,” said Hazard, English soccer’s player of the year in 2015. “I think the way we played we can do better, but after a defeat it’s good to come back here and win three points.\n\n“We have eight games to play. We want to finish top. That’s the target. We have to be ready for everything. We are nearly there but there is a long way to go.”\n\nIt was a night to forget for the goalkeepers in west London.\n\nWilly Caballero allowed Hazard’s deflected to shot to go past him far too easily in the 10th minute after the City goalkeeper sunk to his knees too early.\n\nHowever susceptible Caballero was for the opener, it was nothing compared to Thibaut Courtois’ calamity when the Belgium goalkeeper inexplicably cleared the ball straight to David Silva. The Spaniard surged through open space and a stinging shot was parried by Courtois straight into the path of Aguero, who had a simple tap in in the 26th minute.\n\nBut City manager Pep Guardiola was infuriated on the touchline once again, less than 10 minutes later, when Fernandinho brought down Pedro Rodriguez. Caballero did dive correctly to save Hazard’s penalty, but the winger was primed to slot in the rebound in the 35th minute as Chelsea completed the double over City this season.\n\nHazard also scored against City in December when Chelsea won 3-1 at the Etihad Stadium as Conte became the first manager to ever complete the double over a Guardiola side in the league.\n\n“It wasn’t easy but when you play against City it’s normal to suffer in some parts of the game,” Conte said, “but I think we suffered as a team in the right way.”\n\nAnd City in the wrong way.\n\nGuardiola’s winless run in the league now stands at four matches after this sixth league defeat — the most the former Barcelona and Bayern Munich manager has experienced in a single season.\n\n“If Pep has never lost two games in his career (home and away to a team in a season) it means he is great and it shows he is really the best,” Conte said.\n\nThe Italian is comfortable praising a coach who is not proving to be a direct threat this campaign.\n\nGuardiola’s side is only four points ahead of Arsenal, which has a game in hand as it chases the last Champions League qualification place.\n\n“The Premier League is gone and of course it will now be a battle to qualify for the Champions League,” Guardiola said. “We created chances to win. I’m a lucky man, to be manager of this club.

West Ham had a goal disallowed for offside in the first half before the hosts were awarded a soft penalty as Robert Snodgrass was judged to have fouled Juan Mata when the two collided in the area.\n\n\"We got away with it, to put it that way,\" United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said. \"They deserved to get their goals. But then, it's allowed to have a good goalkeeper, isn't it?\"\n\nThe win ended a run of four losses in five games in all competitions for United and kept Solskjaer's team two points behind fourth-placed Chelsea.\n\nTottenham remained three points ahead of United in third place by beating already relegated Huddersfield 4-0, with Lucas Moura scoring a hat trick.\n\nAt the other end of the table, Burnley and Southampton took big steps toward avoiding relegation with crucial victories, while Cardiff inched closer to the drop after a third straight loss.\n\nChris Wood may well have secured another season in the top flight for Burnley by scoring both goals in a 2-0 home win over Cardiff, a result that leaves the Welsh club five points from safety in 18th place.\n\nBurnley now looks safe on 39 points, 11 ahead of Cardiff, while Southampton boosted its chances of staying up by beating Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-1.\n\nBrighton, though, is still in trouble after being hammered 5-0 at home by Bournemouth to drop to 17th place.\n\nFulham, which has also been relegated with Huddersfield, earned its first win since January by beating Everton 2-0.\n\nHere's a look at Saturday's games:\n\nDROP LOOMS FOR CARDIFF\n\nWith title-chasers Manchester City and Liverpool both playing on Sunday, the focus switched to the fight to avoid the last relegation spot. That now looks like a two-way fight between Cardiff and Brighton, who meet on Tuesday in a game that could decide which team stays up.\n\nCardiff manager Neil Warnock once again had reason to feel aggrieved with a refereeing decision as Mike Dean overturned a call by his linesman to award the visitors a penalty for handball early in the second half, with the score still 1-0. That came two weeks after Cardiff was denied a penalty when leading 1-0 against Chelsea, which then equalized from a clear offside position before scoring a late winner.\n\n\"Can I say I'm lost for words?\" Warnock told the BBC when asked about the overturned penalty. \"Once we get over the disappointment we have to get ready for Tuesday.\"\n\nBrighton had nobody to blame, however, after falling to its heaviest home loss in the Premier League. After Dan Gosling opened the scoring in the first half, Ryan Fraser, David Brooks, Callum Wilson and Junior Stanislas all added goals after the break as the visitors ended a recent slump in style.\n\nFor Brighton, though, the problems are mounting after losing in the FA Cup semifinals last weekend. Chris Hughton's side has not scored in its last four matches, and another loss on Tuesday would leave the team just two points ahead of Cardiff.\n\nMOURA FILLS IN FOR KANE\n\nMoura made sure Tottenham didn't miss injured striker Harry Kane as the Brazilian winger became the first player to score a hat trick in the club's new stadium after Victor Wanyama opened the scoring in the 24th minute.\n\nMoura scored the second goal just three minutes later and then added two late strikes as last-placed Huddersfield limped toward its 26th loss in 34 league games this season.\n\nMoura celebrated after the final whistle by bringing his 1-year-old son onto the field, with the crowd cheering every time the toddler kicked the ball toward his father.\n\nSOUTHAMPTON CLOSE TO SAFETY\n\nNathan Redmond scored twice to put Southampton on the brink of safety with a key win against Wolves.\n\nRedmond put his team ahead in the second minute and then restored the hosts' lead in the 30th, just two minutes after Willy Boly had equalized for Wolves. Shane Long added a third for the Saints, which moved eight points clear of Cardiff.\n\nFulham finally managed to keep its first clean sheet of 2019 to give caretaker boss Scott Parker his first victory in charge. Captain Tom Cairney and Ryan Babel scored for the hosts to end Everton's three-match unbeaten run.\n\n___\n\nMore AP English soccer: https://apnews.com/PremierLeague and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2022/01/19/tottenham-stages-latest-ever-comeback-to-win-an-epl-game/49672561/", "title": "Tottenham stages latest-ever comeback to win an EPL game", "text": "AP\n\nTottenham staged the latest-ever comeback to win a Premier League game on Wednesday.\n\nManchester United's second-half turnaround was quite the surprise, too.\n\nOn a dramatic night in England's top division, Tottenham was losing to Leicester after 94 minutes and 52 seconds. Within two minutes, Netherlands forward Steven Bergwijn had scored two goals to seal a 3-2 win pretty much out of nowhere.\n\nIt sparked wild scenes as Tottenham's players clambered over advertising signs to celebrate in front of their fans, with stewards having to intervene.\n\n“We showed today that we don’t want to give up. Never,” said Tottenham manager Antonio Conte, whose unbeaten league record at the London club was preserved.\n\nAs an extra reward for Tottenham, the victory took the team above fierce rival Arsenal and into fifth place in the league — only one point off the Champions League positions with games in hand.\n\nThe previous latest comeback to win came in arguably the Premier League's most famous match, when Manchester City scored in the 92nd and 94th minutes to beat Queens Park Rangers 3-2 and clinch the title in May 2012.\n\nAs for Man United, Ralf Rangnick's under-pressure team put in a wretched first-half display at Brentford and was lucky to be 0-0 at halftime, only for Anthony Elanga — with his first Premier League goal — Mason Greenwood and Marcus Rashford to score after the break in a 3-1 win. Ivan Toney pulled a late goal back for Brentford.\n\nUnited stayed seventh but is one point behind Tottenham having played two games more.\n\nTOP-FOUR RACE\n\nWith the title increasingly looking like heading again to Manchester City, which holds an 11-point lead, the race for the top four and qualification for the Champions League might be the most interesting aspect of the second half of the season.\n\nTwo points now separate fourth-place West Ham and Man United in seventh, with the four teams in that mini-battle having all played a different number of games because of postponements caused by COVID-19 cases. Indeed, Tottenham has played three fewer games than the team above it, West Ham, and four games fewer than third-place Chelsea, which is eight points ahead of Tottenham.\n\nTottenham visits Chelsea on Sunday before the league goes on a winter break.\n\nHarry Kane is getting closer to his best form and the England captain could have scored three goals before finally netting Spurs' equalizer in the 38th, canceling out Patson Daka's 24th-minute opener.\n\nJames Maddison restored Leicester's lead before Bergwijn's late show, having only come on as a 79th-minute substitute.\n\nHe drove home from close range just before the fifth minute of added-on time had elapsed, after fellow sub Matt Doherty had ran onto a ball over the top.\n\nSoon after the restart, Leicester midfielder Youri Tielemans gave away possession, Kane played a perfectly weighted ball behind the Leicester defense and Bergwijn ran onto it, rounded goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel and converted his shot off the post from an acute angle in the seventh extra minute.\n\n“We didn’t deserve to lose it but we have to learn,” Leicester manager Brendan Rodgers said. “They won the game on our mistakes.”\n\nRONALDO'S REACTION\n\nCristiano Ronaldo's display of petulance after being substituted in the 70th minute provided an intriguing subplot in United's win.\n\nThe Portugal forward, who had missed United's last two games because of a hip injury, walked off the field slowly after the board flashed up to show he was being replaced by Rashford. He muttered to himself and was seen throwing his arms up in apparent disgust.\n\n“That is normal — a striker wants to score,\" United manager Ralf Rangnick said. “But he has come back from a little injury and it was important to remember we have got another game coming up.”\n\nUnited's second-half display masked a dreadful first 45 minutes, during which goalkeeper David De Gea produced three great saves to keep the visitors in the game.\n\n“We are the smallest club in the Premier League, Manchester United the biggest. We destroyed them in the first half, they didn’t have a sniff,” Brentford manager Thomas Frank said.\n\n“Three huge chances and there could only have been one winner of this game.

Thursday’s ruling “severely burdens States’ efforts” to curb gun violence, Breyer wrote.\n\n“The primary difference between the Court’s view and mine is that I believe the Amendment allows States to take account of the serious problems posed by gun violence that I have just described,” Breyer wrote. “I fear that the Court’s interpretation ignores these significant dangers and leaves States without the ability to address them.”\n\nJustice Samuel Alito, in a concurring opinion, pushed back: “And how does the dissent account for the fact that one of the mass shootings near the top of its list took place in Buffalo? The New York law at issue in this case obviously did not stop that perpetrator.”\n\nThe conservative justices also dismissed concerns defenders of New York’s gun law raised about how the law restricted the carrying of firearms into sensitive places.\n\n“It is true that people sometimes congregate in ‘sensitive places,’ and it is likewise true that law enforcement professionals are usually presumptively available in those locations. But expanding the category of ‘sensitive places’ simply to all places of public congregation that are not isolated from law enforcement defines the category of ‘sensitive places’ far too broadly,” Thomas wrote.\n\nFirst major ruling on guns in a decade\n\nSince handing down two major Second Amendment cases in 2008 and 2010, the court has largely dodged the issue but agreed to take up the dispute after Justice Amy Coney Barrett arrived, highlighting her impact on the new conservative court.\n\nIn 2008’s District of Columbia v. Heller, the court held for the first time that the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms at home for self-defense. Except for a follow-up decision two years later, the justices largely stayed away from the issue infuriating gun rights advocates and even some of the justices themselves.\n\nThomas and other conservatives have made clear they believe lower courts have been thumbing their noses at the Heller decision by upholding restrictions. “The Second Amendment is a disfavored right in this court,” Thomas has previously said.\n\nThe case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, concerned a New York law governing licenses to carry concealed handguns in public for self-defense. It required a resident to obtain a license to carry a concealed pistol or revolver and demonstrate that “proper cause” exists for the permit. Residents must show that they have a great need for the license and that they face a “special or unique danger to their life.”\n\nThe law requires applicants who want to carry a handgun in public without restriction to show an “actual and articulable” self-defense need, as opposed to one that is “speculative or specious.”\n\nA panel of judges on the 2nd US Circuit Court of Appeals held that New York’s law did not violate the Second Amendment.\n\nThe Biden administration supported New York and told the Supreme Court in a brief that while the Second Amendment protects an individual’s right to keep and bear arms, the right is “not absolute.”\n\nActing Solicitor General Brian Fletcher told the justices that the law was “firmly grounded” in the nation’s history.\n\nThe petitioners in the case were Robert Nash, Brandon Koch and the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association – an NRA affiliate. They were represented by Paul Clement, a George W. Bush-era solicitor general who argued that that the Second Amendment ensures a right not just to “keep arms,” but to bear them.\n\nNash and Koch had passed the required background checks and obtained licenses to carry guns for hunting and target practice, but they had not been able to establish a special need for self-defense that is required under the law to receive an unrestricted license.\n\nClement argued that the law makes it almost impossible for an ordinary individual to obtain a license because the “proper cause” standard is so demanding and left to the “broad discretion” of the licensing officer.\n\n“Good, even impeccable, moral character plus a simple desire to exercise a fundamental right is,” Clement said, “not sufficient.” “Nor is living or being employed in a high crime area.”\n\nNash, for instance, requested to carry a handgun for self-defense after a string of robberies in his neighborhood. But he was denied because he did not demonstrate a special need for self-defense. Koch wanted a similar license, and he was able to cite his experience of participating in safety training courses. He too was denied.\n\nReaction\n\nGun rights groups touted the ruling as a win for Second Amendment rights and individuals’ rights to protect themselves, while gun safety advocates argued that the ruling would result in more gun violence.\n\nSeveral New York Democrats decried the ruling, including New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, who called the court’s decision “shocking” and “frightful in its scope of how they are setting back this nation and our ability to protect our citizens.”\n\n“Today the Supreme Court is sending us backwards in our efforts to protect families and prevent gun violence. And it’s particularly painful that this came down at this moment, when we’re still dealing with families in pain from mass shootings that have occurred – the loss of life, their beloved children and grandchildren,” Hochul told reporters Thursday.\n\nThe governor said she’s prepared to call the state legislature back into session in response to the ruling. She said state legislators have already been alerted and that they’re looking at possible dates for reconvening.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain, said the decision on guns, “put simply,” will put New Yorkers “at further risk of gun violence” in a statement vowing specific action to mitigate the risks he says the decision will create.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said the ruling, “severely undermines public safety not just in New York City, but around the country.” Bragg says his office is “analyzing” the ruling and crafting gun safety legislation that will take steps to “mitigate the damage done today.”\n\nThe National Rifle Association, meanwhile, called the Supreme Court ruling a “watershed win.”\n\n“Today’s ruling is a watershed win for good men and women all across America and is the result of a decades-long fight the NRA has led,” NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said in a statement. “The right to self-defense and to defend your family and loved ones should not end at your home.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details and reaction.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Tierney Sneed", "Ariane De Vogue", "Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/06/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/24/us/white-christian-nationalism-blake-cec/index.html", "title": "An 'imposter Christianity' is threatening American democracy | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nThree men, eyes closed and heads bowed, pray before a rough-hewn wooden cross. Another man wraps his arms around a massive Bible pressed against his chest like a shield. All throughout the crowd, people wave “Jesus Saves” banners and pump their fists toward the sky.\n\nAt first glance, these snapshots look like scenes from an outdoor church rally. But this event wasn’t a revival; it was what some call a Christian revolt. These were photos of people who stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, during an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThe insurrection marked the first time many Americans realized the US is facing a burgeoning White Christian nationalist movement. This movement uses Christian language to cloak sexism and hostility to Black people and non-White immigrants in its quest to create a White Christian America.\n\nA report from a team of clergy, scholars and advocates — sponsored by two groups that advocate for the separation of church and state — concluded that this ideology was used to “bolster, justify and intensify” the attack on the US Capitol.\n\nDemonstrators pray outside the US Capitol in Washington on January 6, 2021. Stefani Reynolds/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nMuch of the House January 6 committee’s focus so far has been on right-wing extremist groups. But there are plenty of other Americans who have adopted teachings of the White Christian nationalists who stormed the Capitol — often without knowing it, scholars, historians, sociologists and clergy say.\n\nWhite Christian nationalist beliefs have infiltrated the religious mainstream so thoroughly that virtually any conservative Christian pastor who tries to challenge its ideology risks their career, says Kristin Kobes Du Mez, author of the New York Times bestseller, “Jesus and John Wayne: How White Evangelicals Corrupted a Faith and Fractured a Nation.”\n\n“These ideas are so widespread that any individual pastor or Christian leader who tries to turn the tide and say, ‘Let’s look again at Jesus and scripture,’ are going to be tossed aside,” she says.\n\nThe ideas are also insidious because many sound like expressions of Christian piety or harmless references to US history. But White Christian nationalists interpret these ideas in ways that are potentially violent and heretical. Their movement is not only anti-democratic, it contradicts the life and teachings of Jesus, some clergy, scholars and historians say.\n\nSamuel Perry, a professor of religious studies at the University of Oklahoma who is authority on the ideology, calls it an “imposter Christianity.”\n\nHere are three key beliefs often tied to White Christian nationalism.\n\nA belief that the US was founded as a Christian nation\n\nOne of the banners spotted at the January 6 insurrection was a replica of the American flag with the caption, “Jesus is My Savior, Trump is My President.”\n\nErasing the line separating piety from politics is a key characteristic of White Christian nationalism. Many want to reduce or erase the separation of church and state, say those who study the movement.\n\nOne of the most popular beliefs among White Christian nationalists is that the US was founded as a Christian nation; the Founding Fathers were all orthodox, evangelical Christians; and God has chosen the US for a special role in history.\n\nThis painting chronicles lawmakers' signing of the Constitution of the United States in 1787. MPI/Getty Images\n\nThese beliefs are growing among Christians, according to a survey last year by the Barna Group, a company that conducts surveys about faith and culture for communities of faith and nonprofits. The group found that an “increasing number of American Christians believe strongly” that the US is a Christian nation, has not oppressed minorities, and has been chosen by God to lead the world.\n\nBut the notion that the US was founded as a Christian nation is bad history and bad theology, says Philip Gorski, a sociologist at Yale University and co-author of “The Flag and the Cross: White Christian Nationalism and the Threat to American Democracy.”\n\n“It’s a half truth, a mythological version of American history,” Gorski says.\n\nSome Founding Fathers did view the founding of the nation through a Biblical lens, Gorski says. (Every state constitution contains a reference to God or the divine.)\n\nBut many did not. And virtually none of them could be classified as evangelical Christians. They were a collection of atheists, Unitarians, Deists, and liberal Protestants and other denominations.\n\nA Trump supporter holds a Bible as he gathers with others outside the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. John Minchillo/AP\n\nThe Constitution also says nothing about God, the Bible or the Ten Commandments, Gorski says. And saying the US was founded as a Christian nation ignores the fact that much of its initial wealth was derived from slave labor and land stolen from Native Americans, he says.\n\nFor evidence that the United States was founded as a secular nation, look no further than the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli, an agreement the US negotiated with a country in present-day Libya to end the practice of pirates attacking American ships. It was ratified unanimously by a Senate still half-filled with signers of the Constitution and declared, “the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on Christian religion.”\n\nDoes this mean that any White Christian who salutes the flag and says they love their country is a Christian nationalist? No, not at all, historians say. A White Christian who says they love America and its values and institutions is not the same thing as a White Christian nationalist, scholars say.\n\nGorski also notes that many devout Black Americans have exhibited a form of patriotism that does not degenerate into Christian nationalism.\n\nAmerican social reformer and abolitionist Frederick Douglass, circa 1880. Graphic House/Getty Images\n\nGorski points to examples of the 19th century abolitionist, Frederick Douglass, and the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. Both were devout Christians who expressed admiration for America and its founding documents. But their patriotism also meant that “they challenged the nation to live up to its highest principles, to become a place of freedom, equality, justice and inclusion,” he says.\n\nThe patriotism of White Christian nationalists, on the other hand, is a form of racial tribalism, Gorski says.\n\n“It’s a ‘My tribe. ‘We [White people] were here first. This is our country, and we don’t like people who are trying to change it or people who are different’ form of nationalism,” Gorski says.\n\nA belief in a ‘Warrior Christ’\n\nVideos from the January 6 attack show a chaotic, tear-gas-soaked scene at the Capitol that looked more like a medieval battle. Insurrectionists punched police officers, used flagpoles as spears and smashed officers’ faces against doors while a mob chanted, “Fight for Trump!” The attack left five people dead and nearly 140 law enforcement officers injured.\n\nThe incongruity of people carrying “Jesus Saves” signs while joining a mob whose members are pummeling police officers leads to an obvious question: How can White Christian nationalists who claim to follow Jesus, the “Prince of Peace” who renounced violence in the Gospels, support a violent insurrection?\n\nA protester holds up a Bible amid the crowd storming the US Capitol Rotunda in Washington on January 6, 2021. Ashley Gilbertson/VII/ Redux/\n\nThat’s because they follow a different Jesus than the one depicted in the Gospels, says Du Mez, who is also a professor of history and gender studies at Calvin University — a Christian school — in Michigan. They follow the Jesus depicted in the Book of Revelation, the warrior with eyes like “flames of fire” and “a robe dipped in blood” who led the armies of heaven on white horses in a final, triumphant battle against the forces of the antichrist.\n\nWhite Christian nationalists have refashioned Jesus into a kick-butt savior who is willing to smite enemies to restore America to a Christian nation by force, if necessary, Du Mez and others say.\n\nWhile warlike language like putting on “the full armor of God” has long been common in Christian sermons and hymns, it has largely been interpreted as metaphorical. But many White Christian nationalists take that language literally.\n\nThat was clear on January 6. Some insurrectionists wore caps emblazoned with “God, Guns, Trump” and chanted that the blood of Jesus was washing Congress clean. One wrote “In God We Trust” on a set of gallows erected at the Capitol.\n\n“They want the warrior Christ who wields a bloody sword and defeats his enemies,” says Du Mez. “They want to battle with that Jesus. That Jesus brings peace, but only after he slays his enemies.”\n\nAnd that Jesus sanctions the use of righteous violence if a government opposes God, she says.\n\n“If you deem somebody in power to be working against the goals of a Christian America, then you should not submit to that authority and you should displace that authority,” she says. “Because the stakes are so high, the ends justify the means.”\n\nSupporters of then-President Donald Trump gather on the Ellipse near the White House to hear him speak on January 6, 2021. Mark Peterson/Redux\n\nThat ends-justify-the means approach is a key part of White Christian nationalism, says Du Mez. It’s why so many rallied behind former President Trump on January 6. She says he embodies a “militant White masculinity” that condones callous displays of power and appeals to Christian nationalists.\n\nBut with few exceptions, White Christian nationalists do not accept this “militant masculinity” when exhibited by Black, Middle Eastern and Latino men, Du Mez writes in “Jesus and John Wayne.” Aggression by people of color “is seen as a threat to the stability of home and nation,” she writes.\n\nWisconsin Republican Senator Ron Johnson echoed this double standard last year when he said on a radio talk show that he never really felt threatened by the mostly White mob that stormed the Capitol on January 6.\n\n“Now, had … President Trump won the election and those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters, I might have been a little concerned,” Johnson said.\n\nJohnson later elaborated, saying “there was nothing racial about my comments– nothing whatsoever.”\n\nThis embrace of a warrior Christ has shaped some White evangelicals’ attitudes on issues ranging from political violence to gun safety laws.\n\nA survey last year by the Public Religion Research Institute revealed that of all respondents, White evangelicals were the religious group most likely to agree with the statement, “true American patriots might have to resort to violence in order to save the country.”\n\nThere are also some White Christian nationalists who believe the Second Amendment was handed down by God.\n\nGun rights activists carrying semi-automatic firearms pose for a photograph in the state Capitol Building on January 31, 2020, in Frankfort, Kentucky. Bryan Woolston/Getty Images\n\nSamuel Perry, co-author of “Taking America Back for God: Christian Nationalism in the United States,” wrote in a recent essay that among Americans surveyed who believe “The federal government should declare the United States a Christian nation,” over two-thirds rejected the idea that the federal government should enact stricter gun laws.”\n\n“The more you line up with Christian nationalism, the less likely you are to support gun control,” wrote Perry. “Guns are practically an element of worship in the church of white Christian nationalism.”\n\nA belief there’s such a person as a ‘real American’\n\nIn the 2008 presidential election, vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin introduced a new term to the political discourse. She talked about “the real America” and the “pro-America areas of this great nation.” Since then, many conservative political candidates have used the term “real Americans” to draw contrasts between their supporters and their opposition.\n\nSuch language has been co-opted into a worldview held by many White Christian nationalists: The nation is divided between “real Americans” and other citizens who don’t deserve the same rights, experts on White Christian nationalism say.\n\nRepublican vice presidential nominee Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin speaks at the 2008 Republican National Convention in St. Paul, Minnesota. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nGorski, author of “The Flag and the Cross,” says he found in his research a strong correlation between White Christian nationalism and support for gerrymandering—an electoral process where politicians manipulate district lines to favor one party or, some critics say, race over another. He found similar support among White Christian nationalists for the Electoral College, which gives disproportionate political power to many rural, largely White areas of the country.\n\nWhen White Christian nationalists claim an election was stolen, they are reflecting the belief that some votes don’t count, he says.\n\n“It’s the idea that we are the people, and our vote should count, and you’re not the people, and… you don’t really deserve to have a voice,” Gorski says. “It doesn’t matter what the voting machines say, because we know that all real Americans voted for Donald Trump.”\n\nWhy White Christian nationalism is a threat to democracy\n\nThose who want the US to become a Christian nation face a huge obstacle: Most Americans don’t subscribe to their vision of America.\n\nThe mainstreaming of White Christian nationalism comes as a growing number of Americans are rejecting organized religion. For the first time in the US last year, membership in communities of worship fell below 50%. Belief in God is at an all-time low, according to a recent Gallup poll.\n\nA parishioner bows his head to pray while celebrating midnight Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral on December 24, 2021, in New York City. Alexi Rosenfeld/Getty Images\n\nAdd to that the country’s growing racial and religious diversity. People who identify as White alone declined for the first time since the census began in 1790, and the majority of Americans under 18 are now people of color.\n\nOn the surface, White Christian nationalism should not be on the ascent in America.\n\nSo White Christian nationalists look for salvation from two sources.\n\nOne is the emboldened conservative majority on the US Supreme Court, where recent decisions overturning Roe vs. Wade and protecting school prayer offer them hope.\n\nCritics, on the other hand, say the high court is eroding the separation of church and state.\n\nNot all Christians who support the high court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade and its school prayer decision are White nationalists. For example, plenty of Roman Catholics of all races support racial justice yet also backed the overturning of Roe.\n\nBut White Christian nationalists are inspired by those decisions because one of their central goals is to erase the separation of church and state in the US.\n\nA recent study concluded that five of the justices on the Supreme Court are the “most pro-religion since at least World War II,” and that the six conservative justices are “all Christian, mostly Catholic,” and “religiously devout.”\n\nThe sun sets in front of the Supreme Court on June 28, 2022, in Washington. A Supreme Court decision last month overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling and erased a federal right to an abortion. Nathan Howard/Getty Images\n\nWhile some Americans fear the dangers of one-party rule, others like Pamela Paul, a columnist, warn of the Supreme Court instituting one-religion rule.\n\n“With their brand of religious dogma losing its purchase, they’re imposing it on the country themselves,” she wrote in a recent New York Times editorial.\n\nGorski, the historian, says White Christian nationalism represents a grave threat to democracy because it defines “we the people” in a way that excludes many Americans.\n\n“The United States cannot be both a truly multiracial democracy – a people of people and a nation of nations – and a white Christian nation at the same time,” Gorski wrote in “The Flag and the Cross.” “This is why white Christian nationalism has become a serious threat to American democracy, perhaps the most serious threat it now faces.”\n\nThe other source of hope for White Christian nationalists is a former occupant of the White House. Their devotion to him is illustrated by one of most striking images from the January 6 insurrection: A sign depicting a Nordic-looking Jesus wearing a red “Make America Great Again” hat.\n\nIf Trump returns to the presidency, some White Christian nationalists may interpret his political resurrection as divine intervention. His support among White evangelicals increased from 2016 to 2020.\n\nAnd what the men carrying wooden crosses among the Capitol mob couldn’t achieve on January 6, they might yet accomplish in 2024.", "authors": ["John Blake"], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/24/politics/dobbs-mississippi-supreme-court-abortion-roe-wade/index.html", "title": "Supreme Court overturns Roe v Wade | CNN Politics", "text": "CNN —\n\nThe Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on Friday, holding that there is no longer a federal constitutional right to an abortion.\n\nThe opinion is the most consequential Supreme Court decision in decades and will transform the landscape of women’s reproductive health in America.\n\nGoing forward, abortion rights will be determined by states, unless Congress acts. Already, nearly half of the states have or will pass laws that ban abortion while others have enacted strict measures regulating the procedure.\n\n“Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in his majority opinion. “Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences. And far from bringing about a national settlement of the abortion issue, Roe and Casey have enflamed debate and deepened division.”\n\nThe vote was 5-4 in favor of overturning Roe. In a joint dissenting opinion, Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan heavily criticized the majority, closing: “With sorrow – for this Court, but more, for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection – we dissent.”\n\nRELATED: Justices spar over how Roe reversal puts precedents on gay rights and contraceptives at risk\n\nThe opinion represents the culmination of a decades-long effort on the part of critics of abortion seeking to return more power to the states. It was made possible by a solid six-member conservative majority – including three of Donald Trump’s nominees.\n\nAt least 21 states have laws or constitutional amendments already in place that would make them certain to attempt to ban abortion as quickly as possible, according to the Guttmacher Institute, which favors abortion rights. And an additional four states are likely to ban abortions as soon as possible without federal protections.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts did not join the majority, writing in a concurring opinion that he would not have overturned Roe but instead would have only uphold Mississippi’s law banning abortions after 15 weeks.\n\nBiden: Ruling casts a ‘dark shadow’\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Friday “the health and life of women in this nation are now at risk” after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the constitutional right to an abortion.\n\n“It’s a sad day for the court and for the country,” Biden said, speaking from the White House, calling for Congress to codify the right to an abortion – something that’s unlikely given the split balance of power in the Senate.\n\n“It was three justices named by one president, Donald Trump, who were the core of today’s decision to upend the scales of justice and eliminate a fundamental right for women in this country. Make no mistake, this decision is a culmination of a deliberate effort over decades to upset the balance of our law,” Biden said.\n\n“It’s a realization of an extreme ideology and a tragic error of the Supreme Court in my view,” he added.\n\n“The court has done what it’s never done before, expressly take away a constitutional right that is so fundamental to so many Americans that had already been recognized.

Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who voted to confirm Justices Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch, said she objected to the decision.\n\n“This decision is inconsistent with what Justices Gorsuch and Kavanaugh said in their testimony and their meetings with me, where they both were insistent on the importance of supporting long-standing precedents that the country has relied upon.\n\nTrigger bans mean abortion is prohibited in several states\n\nIn at least seven states, state officials say that abortion bans can now be enforced.\n\nThree states – Kentucky, Louisiana and South Dakota – have so-called “trigger bans” that went into effect automatically upon the Supreme Court’s ruling. Ten other states have trigger bans with implementation mechanisms that occur after a set period or after a step taken by a state government entity.\n\nAmong the trigger-ban states in the latter category, Missouri has already made the move required to implement its ban on abortion, with state Attorney General Eric Schmitt announcing Friday that he had taken the step of certification laid out by Missouri law.\n\nIt’s likely that elsewhere in the country, state legislatures will soon be called back into session to pass strict abortion laws that previously would have run afoul of Roe.\n\nSimilar to leaked draft\n\nThe final opinion was strikingly similar to the draft written by Alito that was leaked earlier this year. It repeats his scornful language towards the original Roe v. Wade decision that enshrined abortion rights.\n\nLike the draft opinion, Alito included a list of cases that also rested on a right to privacy, as Alito asserted that Roe was distinct from those cases.\n\n“What sharply distinguishes the abortion right from the rights recognized in the cases on which Roe and Casey rely is something that both those decisions acknowledged: Abortion destroys what those decisions call ‘potential life’ and what the law at issue in this case regards as the life of an ‘unborn human being,’” Alito wrote, in a line that was also present in the draft.\n\nWhat’s new is Alito’s response to the dissent, jointly written by the three liberal justices. The dissent would not have been written at the time that the leaked draft was circulated around the court.\n\n“The dissent is very candid that it cannot show that a constitutional right to abortion has any foundation, let alone a ‘deeply rooted’ one, ‘in this Nation’s history and tradition.’” Alito wrote. “The dissent does not identify any pre-Roe authority that supports such a right – no state constitutional provision or statute, no federal or state judicial precedent, not even a scholarly treatise.”\n\nIn that four-page section, Alito said that the dissent’s failure “engage with this long tradition is devastating to its position.”\n\nDissent points to potential impact on women\n\nThe dissenters said women’s rights are under attack.\n\n“Whatever the exact scope of the coming laws, one result of today’s decision is certain: the curtailment of women’s rights, and of their status as free and equal citizens.”\n\nFriday’s opinion, the dissent said, “says that from the very moment of fertilization, a woman has no rights to speak of.”\n\n“Across a vast array of circumstances, a State will be able to impose its moral choice on a woman and coerce her to give birth to a child,” the liberal justices added.\n\nThe dissent also stressed how the decision will impact poor women who now will have to travel in order to obtain the procedure. “Above all others, women lacking financial resources will suffer from today’s decision.”\n\nThe dissent also lashed out at Justice Brett Kavanaugh for suggesting that the decision simply returns the abortion question to the states.\n\nAs the three liberal Justices wrote, “no language in today’s decision stops the Federal Government from prohibiting abortions nationwide, once again from the moment of conception and without exceptions for rape or incest. If that happens,” they explained, throwing Kavanaugh’s words back at him, “‘the views of [an individual State’s] citizens’ will not matter. The challenge for a woman will be to finance a trip not to ‘New York [or] California’ but to Toronto.”\n\nChallenge brought by Mississippi\n\nChampioned by supporters of abortion and long reviled by critics, Roe v. Wade was decided in 1973 establishing a constitutional right to abortion before fetal viability which most experts say occurs now at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy. The decision was reaffirmed in 1992, in Planned Parenthood v. Casey.\n\nA majority of the court in that case replaced Roe’s framework with a new standard to determine the validity of laws restricting abortions. The court said that a regulation cannot place an “undue burden” on the right to abortion which is defined as a “substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion before the fetus attains viability.”\n\nBefore the court was Mississippi’s Gestational Age Act, passed in 2018 but blocked by two federal courts, which allows abortion after 15 weeks “only in medical emergencies or for severe fetal abnormality” and has no exception for rape or incest. A district court blocked the law, holding that it is in direct violation of Supreme Court precedent legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 23-24 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nA panel of judges on the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with the district court holding that in an “unbroken line dating to Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court’s abortion cases have established (and affirmed and re-affirmed) a woman’s right to choose an abortion before viability.” The court said states may “regulate abortion procedures prior to viability” so long as they do not ban abortion. “The law at issue is a ban,” the court held.\n\nMississippi appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, and after the justices agreed to hear the case, the state raised the stakes and argued that the justices should not only uphold the law but also invalidate Roe and Casey.\n\nMississippi Solicitor General Scott Stewart was blunt at oral arguments.\n\n“Roe vs. Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey haunt our country,” Stewart said. “They have no basis in the Constitution. They have no home in our history or traditions. They’ve damaged the democratic process. They poison the law. They’ve choked off compromise. For 50 years they’ve kept this court at the center of a political battle that it can never resolve and 50 years on, they stand alone. Nowhere else does this court recognize a right to end a human life.”\n\nSolicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued on behalf of the Biden administration in support of the clinics. She urged the justices to uphold precedent and avoid a ruling that would disproportionally harm women who have come to depend upon the decision.\n\n“For a half century, this Court has correctly recognized that the Constitution protects a woman’s fundamental right to decide whether to end a pregnancy before viability,” she argued. “That guarantee, that the state cannot force a woman to carry a pregnancy to term and give birth, has engendered substantial individual and societal reliance. The real-world effects of overruling Roe and Casey would be severe and swift.”\n\nShe added: “The court has never revoked a right that is so fundamental to so many Americans and so central to their ability to participate fully and equally in society.\n\nJulie Rikelman, a lawyer for Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the only licensed abortion clinic in Mississippi and Sacheen Carr-Ellis, the clinic’s medical director, told the justices that Mississippi’s ban on abortion “two months before viability” is “flatly unconstitutional under decades of precedent.”\n\nPublic opposed to overturning Roe\n\nA broad majority of Americans did not want to see Roe vs. Wade overturned, polling taken before the Supreme Court’s decision shows.\n\nIn a May CNN poll conducted immediately after the leak of the draft opinion, Americans said, 66% to 34%, that they did not want the Supreme Court to completely overturn its decision. In CNN’s polling dating back to 1989, the share of the public in favor of completely overturning Roe has never risen above 36%.\n\nIn the CNN poll, 58% of US adults said that, if Roe were overturned, they’d want their state to set abortion laws that were more permissive than restrictive. About half (51%) said they’d like to see their state become a safe haven for women who wanted abortions but couldn’t get them where they lived.\n\nBut not everyone was aware in advance how their own state would be affected. Of Americans living in states with trigger laws to immediately ban abortion after the overturn of Roe, only 45% realized that was the case, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted in May. Another 42% living in those states were unsure what the impact of the ruling would be where they live.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Ariane De Vogue Tierney Sneed Chandelis Duster Devan Cole", "Ariane De Vogue", "Tierney Sneed", "Chandelis Duster", "Devan Cole"], "publish_date": "2022/06/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/09/politics/gun-control-second-amendment-supreme-court-bruen-fallout/index.html", "title": "How the Supreme Court's Second Amendment ruling has already ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIt did not take long for top gun rights activists to realize that the Second Amendment ruling handed down by the Supreme Court in June was going to transform the legal fight over access to firearms.\n\nDudley Brown, the president of the National Association for Gun Rights, said the realization started to come when he received a phone call from another executive at his organization minutes after the decision was released.\n\n“He had just scanned through it. He said, ‘You won’t believe what this decision says. it’s way better than what we ever hoped for,’” Brown told CNN. Brown was coincidentally at the time walking by the Supreme Court, trekking between Senate and House offices as part of a lobbying push against new gun legislation being considered in the wake a mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.\n\n“Quickly, we knew this was something that was going to change the landscape,” Brown said.\n\nIn the three months since the 6-3 decision in New York State Rifle & Pistol Association, Inc. v. Bruen, scores of new lawsuits have been filed against gun restrictions at the federal, state and local levels.\n\nThough the Supreme Court case concerned a type of gun permitting regime embraced by just a handful of states, the conservative majority used the Bruen decision to provide new instructions for how courts are to assess the constitutionality of gun laws nationwide.\n\nThe decision was the first major Supreme Court guns ruling in more than a decade, and it came after Justice Clarence Thomas – who authored the majority opinion – had previously complained that the high court had allowed the Second Amendment to be treated as a “a disfavored right.”\n\nSince the June ruling, federal judges in at least a half-dozen different cases have already cited the Bruen decision to rule against gun restrictions that have included local assault weapons bans, prohibitions on the manufacture of homemade firearms and bans on older teenagers publicly carrying handguns.\n\nSeveral other laws now face new legal challenges under the precedent, among them zoning restrictions barring shooting ranges, licensing and training laws and the federal ban on certain misdemeanor offenders from possessing firearms.\n\n“The much more consequential thing about Bruen is that the court actually went further and did a little bit more than it needed to do and articulated an entirely new framework for how Second Amendment challenges are decided,” said Andrew Willinger, the executive director of Duke Center for Firearms Law.\n\nWhat the Supreme Court told judges to do\n\nThe case the Supreme Court decided last term was a challenge to the New York state system of approving licenses for gun owners to publicly carry their weapons. By a 6-3 vote, the justices said the rules – in which government officials had some discretion in deciding whether an applicant would be granted a license – violated the Second Amendment.\n\nBut what extended the reach of the ruling beyond the roughly half dozen states with similar licensing procedures was what Thomas said about how courts should decide whether gun limits comply with the Second Amendment.\n\nThomas said that the only regulations that can be deemed constitutional are ones don’t encroach on conduct plainly covered by the Second Amendment’s text and that are “consistent with this Nation’s historical tradition” – meaning they have a parallel in the type of regulations in place at the time of the Constitution’s framing.\n\nJustice Stephen Breyer, writing for the three liberal dissenters, wrote that this approach was “deeply impractical” and that it imposed “a task on the lower courts that judges cannot easily accomplish.”\n\nBefore the Supreme Court’s ruling, lower courts were coalescing around an approach that weighed the burden a restriction put on gun rights against the rationale the government had for implementing the law. The flurry of litigation spawned by the new precedent has begun to show how much the Bruen test will remake the legal playing field around firearms.\n\nA federal district judge cited the ruling last month when halting Delaware restrictions on possessing and manufacturing untraceable firearms, saying that the law’s defenders failed to provide persuasive evidence that similar restrictions existed in the historical record. The precedent was also referenced when local assault weapon bans in two Colorado jurisdictions were put on hold this summer; the judges in both cases were each appointed by Democratic presidents.\n\nOn Thursday, a federal judge in Syracuse leaned on Bruen to pause several New York restrictions, including limits on carrying firearms to sensitive places like summer camps, domestic violence shelters and zoos.\n\nLaws that withstood legal challenge in the past are now in jeopardy.\n\nTexas’ public carry handgun ban for 18- to 20-year-olds – a ban that was upheld by the conservative 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals in 2012 – was struck down by a district court last month. US District Judge Mark Pittman wrote in the opinion that he had not been pointed to any Founding-era laws that were a “sufficient historical analog to support Texas’s statutory prohibition.”\n\nGun safety advocates say there are cases where the historical record will be on their side, and, at least in the early post-Bruen flurry of legal action, some laws have been successfully defended in court.\n\nA judge who declined to block a San Jose, California, law requiring liability insurance for gun owners said that the mandate had adequate parallels in 19th century surety laws, which required some individuals to post bond in order to carry weapons. A week after a federal judge in Texas ruled against a federal law banning those under felony indictment from buying, the same judge decided in favor of the prohibitions on convicted felons possessing firearms. US District Judge David Counts reasoned in the latter case that there was a historical tradition supporting the exclusion from the Second Amendment’s protections people who “squander their rights for crimes and violence.”\n\n“If the question is now whether there’s a tradition of regulating firearms in different respects, we think that the historical evidence is going to show the answer is yes,” said Eric Tirschwell, the executive director of Everytown Law, which is the litigation arm of the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.\n\nChanging the work advocates must do to defend restrictions\n\nThe Bruen ruling, when laying out the historical prong of the test, said it was up to the government that was defending a gun law to prove the restriction had a parallel in the past.\n\nThis shift in burden has put gun rights groups at a greater advantage in court. It has also changed the type of work that government defenders – and the outside gun safety groups that often support them in litigation – must do to advocate for their laws.\n\n“Imagine if you are a district attorney, somewhere in some random state, you suddenly get a lawsuit brought on this, on some gun law you’ve got, and then you’ve got maybe 30 days to respond to the lawsuit. What are you going to do?” said Carlton Larson, a professor at UC-Davis School of Law who specializes in the historical basis of Second Amendment rights.\n\n“I am a legal historian by training,” Larson said. “I would find it very, very hard to turn around quickly on that and come up with something thoughtful.”\n\nBut gun rights advocates say this work of historical analysis is a better fit for courts than the means-ends balancing test that many lower courts were applying pre-Bruen. The old approach required courts to act like legislators, said Peter Patterson – a lawyer for the firm Cooper and Kirk, which has represented gun rights groups in high profile cases – while the historical analysis, he said, is “much more a judicial task.”\n\nThe Bruen decision has also put a greater focus on the first prong of the legal test – whether the conduct being burden is even covered by the Second Amendment in the first place – which was a question that was “underappreciated” in litigation over gun laws in the past, according to Tirschwell.\n\nUnanswered legal questions courts will hash out\n\nAs lower courts begin to apply the new precedent, questions left open by the Bruen ruling will be hashed out and debated.\n\nWhile finding laws in the historical record may be “clear cut,” according to David Kopel, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, “there’s still room for judicial discretion” in deciphering how closely a contemporary law must mimic its historical counterpart to be upheld.\n\n“Bruen says: You can have a modern gun law, that it doesn’t have to be a twin of some historic law. You can reason by analogy,” Kopel said.\n\nUS District Judge Glenn Suddaby, the judge who blocked parts of a New York gun law Thursday, said the historical parallels were strong enough for him to let stand the state’s ban on carrying firearms into schools.\n\n“However, the Court cannot find these historical statutes analogous to a prohibition on ‘summer camps,’” he wrote, so he was halting the ban on carrying firearms there.\n\nOne question legal experts will be watching is what Bruen means for the types of gun laws that the Supreme Court had previously identified as “presumptively lawful” in the landmark 2008 Heller case establishing that individuals have a right to bear arms. In the majority opinion, Justice Antonin Scalia wrote that the ruling was not meant to cast doubt on restrictions on carrying guns in sensitive places, possession bans for the mentally ill or felons, or other certain conditions imposed on the purchase of firearms.\n\n“It seems to be those that those Heller exceptions are up for grabs, potentially,” Larson said, referring to the name of the 2008 case.\n\nAnother question raised by the Bruen decision is what should be the historical touchpoint for assessing whether a restriction is constitutional: the 1791 enshrining of the Bill of Rights or the 1868 ratification of the 14th Amendment, under which the court has extended the protections against federal infringements on gun rights to state and local governments.\n\nGun advocates are staking out their arguments for seeing the earlier time period as the relevant one for whether a contemporary gun law has a historical analogue.\n\n“It’s really difficult for me to see guideposts in what the court said in Bruen,” Willinger said. “It really does leave quite a bit up to the judge in terms of determining what level of generality do I use to look at the history.”", "authors": ["Tierney Sneed"], "publish_date": "2022/10/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/26/politics/john-roberts-chief-justice-roe-dobbs-analysis/index.html", "title": "Chief Justice John Roberts lost the Supreme Court and the defining ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nChief Justice John Roberts has long piloted America’s highest court, securing majorities on controversies over religion, race, voting rights and campaign finance regulation. But on fundamental abortion rights and in the defining case of his generation, Roberts came up short.\n\nFriday’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned nearly a half-century of precedent, will be a seminal case in the annals of law and learning. It will be paired with the 1973 Roe v. Wade landmark that had declared a constitutional right to end a pregnancy, just as the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education, which ended the “separate but equal” doctrine and began desegregation of schools, has long been tethered to Plessy v. Ferguson, the 1896 decision that permitted separate but equal accommodations for Black and White people.\n\nYet where Brown ensured rights, of course, Dobbs eliminated them.\n\nIt was a sober, even humble Roberts who wrote – alone – as he separated himself both from the conservatives who dissolved a constitutional guarantee and from the liberal dissenters who expressed sorrow for American women and warned of further erosions on privacy.\n\nThe 67-year-old chief justice, who is finishing his 17th session, confessed to a rare lack of confidence.\n\n“Both the Court’s opinion and the dissent display a relentless freedom from doubt on the legal issue that I cannot share,” he wrote. Referring to the disputed Mississippi law at the heart of the Dobbs case, he added, “I am not sure, for example, that a ban on terminating a pregnancy from the moment of conception must be treated the same under the Constitution as a ban after fifteen weeks.”\n\nRoberts, who has forcefully pushed for conservative outcomes on race and religion, had tried to move incrementally here. He attempted to split the difference, to uphold the disputed Mississippi law that prohibits abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy but to hold off on confronting Roe.\n\n“I would take a more measured course,” he wrote and urging – in vain – some judicial restraint, said, “If it is not necessary to decide more to dispose of a case, then it is necessary not to decide more.”\n\nYet as much as the reversal of Roe represents a significant defeat for Roberts and is a singular, staggering moment for the country, the chief is down but not out. The 2005 appointee of Republican President George W. Bush still generally resides on the winning side of this ideologically lopsided bench.\n\nJust one day before Dobbs, Roberts was part of the supermajority that struck down a New York handgun law and greatly expanded Second Amendment rights. Earlier last week, he wrote the 6-3 opinion requiring states that subsidize private schools to include religious education, further breaching the separation of church and state.\n\nRoberts has taken the lead against racial remedies, regarding them as both outdated and unconstitutional, and he authored the consequential 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision curtailing voter protections, particularly in the South and other places with a history of discrimination at the polls.\n\nStill, Friday’s Dobbs decision was monumental and will demarcate the Roberts Court era, even as he was outflanked on abortion-rights precedent by Justice Samuel Alito, who penned the Dobbs decision, and Justices Clarence Thomas, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.\n\nThose last three justices were appointed by former President Donald Trump, and their sheer presence had emboldened Mississippi officials to seek an expansive decision in a case that originally was confined to the validity of the 15-week ban.\n\nThe three liberals who fully dissented remarked at the speed with which the relatively new five-justice bloc, secured by the 2020 addition of Barrett, moved to reverse Roe.\n\nIn doing so, they wrote, “this Court betrays its guiding principles.” They said they felt sorrow for the court itself although more “for the many millions of American women who have today lost a fundamental constitutional protection.”\n\nThe right wing grew weary of waiting for ‘another day’\n\nRoberts’ fate on the losing side of Dobbs was foreshadowed last year when he heatedly dissented as the same five conservatives who controlled in the Mississippi dispute allowed Texas to put into effect a six-week ban on abortion, known as S.B.8.\n\n“The clear purpose and actual effect of S.B. 8 has been to nullify this Court’s rulings,” including Roe v. Wade, Roberts wrote last December as the five justices endorsed the Texas ban that they had first permitted to take effect on September 1.\n\nIt was a sign that the tactical and usually persuasive chief justice, who himself has been critical of abortion rights, was outmaneuvered by a fivesome who wanted to go further, faster.\n\nBarrett’s succession of the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to be sure, diminished Roberts’ negotiating power. Her appointment transformed what was a 5-4 conservative-liberal court into a 6-3 bench, where Roberts no longer holds the crucial fifth vote for either wing. As the far right showed in Dobbs: it does not need the chief.\n\nRoberts had proposed a limited resolution at oral arguments last December, but he apparently never had any real momentum against the anti-Roe five. There were no signs in the opinions released on Friday that those who joined Alito had wavered in the view that, “Roe was egregiously wrong from the start. Its reasoning was exceptionally weak, and the decision has had damaging consequences.”\n\nKavanaugh, who has sometimes joined Roberts in compromise, stuck with a line of arguments he had tried out at oral arguments, that reversing Roe puts the court in a “position of neutrality” on the abortion dilemma.\n\nRoberts declined to address that assertion in his concurring opinion, but dissenting Justices Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan wrote that eliminating the right to abortion “is not taking a ‘neutral’ position.”\n\nRoe and the 1992 case that broadly reaffirmed it, Planned Parenthood v. Casey, had prevented states from interfering with a woman’s right to end a pregnancy before a fetus was viable, that is, could live outside the womb. Viability occurs at about 23 weeks.\n\nRoberts sought to “leave for another day whether to reject any right to an abortion at all.”\n\nAlito dismissed that possibility, saying “‘another day’ would not be long in coming. Some states have set deadlines for obtaining an abortion that are shorter than Mississippi’s.”\n\nHe said that Roberts’ “quest for a middle way would only put off the day when we would be forced to confront the question we now decide. The turmoil wrought by Roe and Casey would be prolonged. It is far better – for this Court and the country – to face up to the real issue without further delay.”", "authors": ["Joan Biskupic"], "publish_date": "2022/06/26"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/24/politics/texas-far-right-politics-invs/index.html", "title": "Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks: How two Texas megadonors have ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nGun owners allowed to carry handguns without permits or training.

Women forced to drive hours out-of-state to access abortion.\n\nThis is Texas now: While the Lone Star State has long been a bastion of Republican politics, new laws and policies have taken Texas further to the right in recent years than it has been in decades.\n\nElected officials and political observers in the state say a major factor in the transformation can be traced back to West Texas. Two billionaire oil and fracking magnates from the region, Tim Dunn and Farris Wilks, have quietly bankrolled some of Texas’ most far-right political candidates – helping reshape the state’s Republican Party in their worldview.\n\nOver the last decade, Dunn and his wife, Terri, have contributed more than $18 million to state candidates and political action committees, while Wilks and his wife, Jo Ann, have given more than $11 million, putting them among the top donors in the state.\n\nTim Dunn is seen during a National Network for Safe Communities conference in 2015.

Dunn and Wilks also hold sway over the state’s legislative agenda through a network of non-profits and advocacy groups that push conservative policy issues.\n\nCritics, and even some former associates, say that Dunn and Wilks demand loyalty from the candidates they back, punishing even deeply conservative legislators who cross them by bankrolling primary challengers. Kel Seliger, a longtime Republican state senator from Amarillo who has clashed with the billionaires, said their influence has made Austin feel a little like Moscow.\n\n“It is a Russian-style oligarchy, pure and simple,” Seliger said. “Really, really wealthy people who are willing to spend a lot of money to get policy made the way they want it – and they get it.”\n\nIn this Dec. 29, 2015, file photo, Farris Wilks watches U.S. Senator and then-presidential candidate Ted Cruz deliver remarks in Cisco, Texas.

In past interviews and opinion pieces, Dunn has argued that his political spending is focused on making Texas’ state government more accountable to its voters, while Wilks has described his donations as aimed at electing principled conservative leaders.\n\nFormer associates of Dunn and Wilks who spoke to CNN said the billionaires are both especially focused on education issues, and their ultimate goal is to replace public education with private, Christian schooling. Wilks is a pastor at the church his father founded, and Dunn preaches at the church his family attends. In their sermons, they paint a picture of a nation under siege from liberal ideas.\n\n“The cornerstones of our government are crumbling and starting to come apart,” Wilks declared in a 2014 sermon at his insular church, the Assembly of Yahweh 7th Day. “And it’s because of the lack of morality, the lack of belief in our heavenly Father.”\n\nTexas’ far-right shift has national implications: The candidates Dunn and Wilks have supported have turned the state legislature into a laboratory for far-right policy that’s starting to gain traction across the US.\n\nThe Texas State Capitol is seen on the first day of the 87th Legislature's third special session on September 20, 2021 in Austin, Texas.

Greg Abbott who lost by a wide margin.\n\nBut experts say the billionaires’ recent struggles are in part a symptom of their past success: Many of the candidates they’re challenging from the right, from Abbott down, have embraced more and more conservative positions, on issues from transgender rights to guns to voting.\n\n“They dragged all the moderate candidates to the hard right in order to keep from losing,” said Bud Kennedy, a columnist for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram newspaper who’s covered 18 sessions of the Texas legislature.\n\n“I don’t think regular Texans are as conservative as their elected officials,” Kennedy said. “The reason that Texas has moved to the right is because the money’s there.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Donors with influence on Texas politics 02:52 - Source: CNN\n\nPolitical investments paying off\n\nOver the last decade, many of the most conservative bills in the Texas legislature, on topics from LGBT rights to guns to private school vouchers, were killed by the moderate Republicans who held sway in the state House. That changed last year, thanks to people like Valoree Swanson.\n\nSwanson was a Sunday school teacher and political activist when she challenged a 14-year incumbent Republican, Debbie Riddle, in 2016 in a district covering Houston’s Republican-dominated northern suburbs.\n\nSwanson, who ran to Riddle’s right, shocked political observers by outraising the incumbent – an unusual feat for a first-time candidate. Her largest donor: Empower Texans, a political action committee created by Dunn and largely funded by him and Wilks. She defeated Riddle in the Republican primary by more than 10 percentage points and went on to easily win the general election.\n\nLast year, Swanson won a major legislative victory: She authored the transgender sports bill, which blocks trans students from playing on K-12 school sports teams that aren’t aligned with their genders at birth. While other bills about transgender issues had failed in previous years, the sports bill was approved by a legislature now firmly controlled by the GOP’s right flank after the moderate former House speaker retired. Observers saw it as a validation of the billionaires’ early investments in Swanson’s first campaign, paying off years later.\n\n“They’re effectively investing their money and they’re moving the needle on policy in Austin,” said Scott Braddock, the editor of Quorum Report, a publication that’s been covering the legislature for decades, referring to Dunn and Wilks. “These are extreme people investing a lot of money in our politics to reshape Texas, such that it matches up with their vision.”\n\nDemonstrators gather on the steps to the State Capitol to speak against transgender-related legislation being considered in the Texas Senate and Texas House, May 20, 2021, in Austin, Texas. Eric Gay/AP\n\nSwanson is hardly an outlier: All 18 of the current Republican members of the Texas Senate, and almost half of the Republican members of the Texas House, have taken at least some money from Dunn, Wilks or organizations that they fund. Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and Attorney General Ken Paxton have also been major beneficiaries of the billionaires’ spending.\n\nTexas is one of just 10 states that allow individuals to make unlimited contributions to state political candidates, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures – letting Dunn and Wilks have more influence than they might elsewhere in the country.\n\nWhile Dunn and Wilks focus on state politics, they’ve also gotten involved in national races. Wilks, his brother Dan and their wives were among the largest donors to super PACs supporting GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz in 2016, contributing a total of $15 million. And Dunn has given millions of dollars to super PACs supporting former President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans in recent years.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Cruz called the Wilks brothers “the epitome of the American dream” and “fearless champions of conservative causes, much to the consternation of the corrupt corporate media.”\n\nSo far in 2022, Dunn’s and Wilks’ political investments haven’t been as successful as in past years. Defend Texas Liberty, the group they fund, gave more than $3 million to Don Huffines, a former state senator who challenged Abbott in his Republican primary and won just 12% of the vote. Despite his loss, experts pointed out, over the course of the campaign Abbott embraced some of the positions Huffines had staked out, including strong opposition to transgender rights and support for deploying National Guard members to the US-Mexican border.\n\nDefend Texas Liberty’s second-largest beneficiary this year has been Shelley Luther, an unsuccessful far-right legislative candidate who attracted national attention after she was arrested for refusing to shut down her Dallas hair salon to comply with coronavirus restrictions.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Luther – who proposed banning Chinese students from Texas universities and declared she is “not comfortable with the transgenders” – said that Dunn and Wilks had been integral to her campaign.\n\n“Without them, I couldn’t have even run,” Luther said. But she added that the spending wouldn’t have given the billionaires influence over her votes or decisions: “He wants me to do what I say that I represent,” she said of Dunn.\n\nEnforcing the ‘law of the jungle’\n\nThe Texas Highway Patrol stands in front of pro-life demonstrators as pro-choice supporters leave the Capitol in Austin, Texas, on Saturday May 14, 2022. Jessica Koscielniak/USA Today Network\n\nDunn and Wilks don’t just use campaign donations to play a role in state politics. They also fund a network of organizations that have been influential at boosting conservative causes.\n\nTexans for Fiscal Responsibility, a non-profit chaired by Dunn, has released a “Fiscal Responsibility Index” each legislative session grading state lawmakers based on their stances on conservative bills. The scorecard, which is often cited in election ads that show up in voters’ mailboxes, is known in Texas political circles for its ability to make and break Republican primary campaigns.\n\n“If you don’t show up well on the scorecard, you’re going to have a lot of money spent against you,” Seliger said.\n\nTexas Republicans say that even a deeply conservative record doesn’t protect someone from a primary challenge funded by Dunn, Wilks and groups they bankroll.\n\nState Sen. Bob Deuell had won elections for years in his northeast Texas district and racked up a conservative record – including co-authoring a 2013 abortion bill that was considered among the strictest in the country at the time, and was struck down by the US Supreme Court.\n\nBut in 2013, Deuell, a doctor, supported a bill that overhauled Texas’ end-of-life procedures. Texas Right to Life, a group whose largest donor over its history is Wilks, falsely claimed the bill would “strengthen Texas’ death panels.” The following year, Deuell was challenged by Bob Hall, a tea party activist.\n\nBob Deuell speaks to CNN's Ed Lavandera in Greenville, Texas on February 23, 2022. CNN\n\nTexas Right to Life spent more than $150,000 on mailers, voter guides and political consultants for Hall and other candidates in 2014, airing a barrage of ads claiming Deuell had “turned his back on life and on disabled patients.” Hall won the Republican primary in a runoff by 300 votes. Since that first campaign, Hall has received more than $900,000 from Dunn, Wilks, and groups that they are major funders of – about a third of his total donations.\n\n“All this West Texas money is what made him into a viable candidate,” Deuell said of Hall, who did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.\n\nSeliger, Deuell’s former colleague in the Senate, has also staked out conservative positions on many issues, and Dunn gave his campaign $1,000 during his first year in office in 2004.\n\nBut after Seliger decided he couldn’t support efforts to divert funding from public schools to private school vouchers, Dunn turned on him, he said. In the decade since, he’s found himself repeatedly running against a challenger backed by groups funded by Dunn and Wilks.\n\n“That’s the law of the jungle now in Texas,” Seliger said. “The majority of Republican Senate members just dance to whatever tune Tim Dunn wants to play.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Conservatism vs. control within the Texas Republican Party 02:37 - Source: CNN\n\nDunn has defended his spending and his group’s campaign tactics.\n\n“Empower Texans remains outside the swamp, and the group informs voters who want their representatives to do in Austin what they promised during election season,” he wrote in a 2018 op-ed in The Dallas Morning News, responding to criticism of the group’s tactics. “If all of us outsiders stick together, we can drain the Austin Swamp.”\n\nZachary Maxwell has had an inside view of the billionaires’ influence. He worked for Empower Texans, Dunn’s PAC, and served as campaign manager and chief of staff for then-state Rep. Mike Lang, who received more than 60% of his campaign donations from Wilks and PACs he and Dunn were major funders of.\n\nMaxwell told CNN in an interview that there was “no way” Lang could have gotten elected without Wilks’ money. At one campaign fundraiser, he said, Jo Ann Wilks handed Maxwell a check for more than $100,000.\n\n“I was like, ‘Can you even write a check that big?’ ” Maxwell remembered. “I about had a heart attack.”\n\nHuge sums like that helped buy Wilks influence once Lang took office, Maxwell said. “Whenever (Farris Wilks) called, he answered,” Maxwell said of Lang. “There was a lot of control.”\n\nLang did not respond to requests for comment from CNN.\n\nWest Texas upbringings\n\nTexas has a long tradition of oil and gas magnates using their fortunes to shape politics. Hugh Roy Cullen, one of Houston’s wealthiest philanthropists, supported the pro-segregation Dixiecrat movement in the 1940s, and H.L. Hunt, who owned a vast swath of the East Texas Oil Field, funded a conservative radio program that aired across the US in the ’50s and ‘60s.\n\nWhat sets Dunn and Wilks apart, political observers say, is how they’ve spent so much money pushing not just business-friendly policies that boost their bottom line but also socially conservative bills that seem designed to reshape Texas in the image of their far-right Christian values.\n\nBoth are products of humble West Texas upbringings who earned huge fortunes in Texas’ energy industry.\n\nDunn, 66, lives in Midland, the childhood home of George W. Bush and a center of the state’s oil industry. He grew up in nearby Big Spring, the son of a farm and factory worker, and studied chemical engineering at Texas Tech before working for Exxon and other oil and banking companies.\n\nHe started his own oil company, now named CrownQuest Operating, in 1996. The firm operates oil wells around West Texas’ Permian Oil Basin and beyond, and pumped 31 million barrels of oil in Texas in 2021, making it the state’s 12th largest oil producer, according to government records.\n\nDunn became more involved in Texas politics in 2006, when he opposed a tax measure that included a new tax on business partnerships – including some that fund oil wells, Texas Monthly reported. He started an organization to oppose the measure, Empower Texans, which continued to fund conservative causes even after the tax legislation passed. The group’s PAC shut down in 2020, and the billionaires more recently pivoted to funding Defend Texas Liberty.\n\nWilks, 70, grew up in a converted goat shed in Cisco, Texas, a town of 3,700 where sleepy streets are dotted with more than a dozen churches. He and his younger brother Dan were the sons of a bricklayer and started their careers as apprentice masons.\n\nAfter several other business ventures, in 2002 they founded Frac Tech Services, a company that provided trucking services for fracking operators. It was perfect timing: Fracking was about to take off in Texas and elsewhere in the US amid a boom in shale gas.\n\nLess than a decade later, in 2011, the Wilkses sold their majority share of the company for more than $3 billion to a group that included international investors. Since then, they’ve been buying up land in Texas and around the Western US, joining the ranks of America’s largest landowners – and getting involved in politics.\n\nFarris Wilks is the pastor of the Assembly of Yahweh 7th Day Church, which operates a sprawling compound outside of Cisco and was founded by his father. In sermons, he has denounced homosexuality and abortion rights in vitriolic terms.\n\n“A male on male or a female on female is against nature,” Wilks declared in a 2013 recording of one sermon posted on his church’s website, which is no longer publicly available. “This lifestyle is the predatorial lifestyle in that they need your children. … They want your children.”\n\nDunn also preaches at his church, the Midland Bible Church, where he serves as a member of the congregation’s “pulpit team.”\n\n“No matter what rules you grew up with, none of them are enforceable in God’s kingdom,” he declared in one 2018 sermon.\n\nIn a 2004 interview with The Times of London, Dunn told a reporter he believed that, as the newspaper put it, “his oil has existed for only 4,000 years, the time decreed by Genesis, not 200 million years as his geologists know.”\n\nThat religious fervor has influenced Dunn’s and Wilks’ political moves. In a meeting with former Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, who is Jewish, Dunn declared that only Christians should hold leadership positions in the chamber, Texas Monthly reported. Straus declined an interview request with CNN.\n\nAnd both Wilks brothers have donated millions of dollars through their personal foundations to conservative Christian groups, including crisis pregnancy centers, according to IRS records, which work to dissuade women from abortion and in some cases share misleading medical information.\n\n‘The goal is to tear up, tear down’\n\nPeople who’ve worked with Wilks and Dunn say they share an ultimate goal: replacing much of public education in Texas with private Christian schools. Now, educators and students are feeling the impact of that conservative ideology on the state’s school system.\n\nDorothy Burton, a former GOP activist and religious scholar, joined Farris Wilks on a 2015 Christian speaking tour organized by his brother-in-law and said she spoke at events he attended. She described the fracking magnate as “very quiet” but approachable: “You would look at him and you would never think that he was a billionaire,” she said.\n\nBut Burton said that after a year of hearing Wilks’ ideology on the speaking circuit, she became disillusioned by the single-mindedness of his conservatism.\n\n“The goal is to tear up, tear down public education to nothing and rebuild it,” she said of Wilks. “And rebuild it the way God intended education to be.”\n\nIn sermons, Dunn and Wilks have advocated for religious influence in schooling. “When the Bible plainly teaches one thing and our culture teaches another, what do our children need to know what to do?” Wilks asks in one sermon from 2013.\n\nDunn, Wilks and the groups and politicians they both fund have been raising alarms about liberal ideas in the classroom, targeting teachers and school administrators they see as too progressive. The billionaires have especially focused on critical race theory, in what critics see as an attempt to use it as a scapegoat to break voters’ trust in public schooling.\n\nIn the summer of 2020, James Whitfield, the first Black principal of the mostly White Colleyville Heritage High School in the Dallas suburbs, penned a heartfelt, early-morning email in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, encouraging his school to “not grow weary in the battle against systemic racism.”\n\nJames Whitfield looks at photos at his home in Bedford, Texas on January 13, 2022. CNN\n\nThe backlash came months later. Stetson Clark, a former school board candidate whose campaign had been backed by a group that received its largest donations from Dunn and organizations he funded, accused Whitfield during a school board meeting last year of “encouraging all members of our community to become revolutionaries” and “encouraging the destruction and disruption of our district.” The board placed Whitfield on leave, and later voted not to renew his contract. He agreed to resign after coming to a settlement with the district. Clark did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nWhitfield said he saw the rhetoric pushed by Dunn and Wilks as a major cause of his being pushed out.\n\n“They want to disrupt and destroy public schools, because they would much rather have schools that are faith-based,” Whitfield said. “We know what has happened over the course of history in our country, and if we can’t teach that, then what do you want me to do?”\n\nMeanwhile, the legislature has also been taking on the discussion of race in classrooms, passing a bill last year that bans schools from making teachers “discuss a widely debated and currently controversial issue of public policy or social affairs.” The legislation was designed to keep critical race theory out of the classroom, according to Abbott, who signed the bill into law.\n\nSome of the co-authors and sponsors of the bill and previous versions of the legislation received significant funding from Dunn and Wilks.\n\nThe billionaires “want to destroy the public school system as we know it and, in its place, see more home-schooling and more private Christian schools,” said Deuell, the former senator.\n\nThe Texans feeling the impact include Libby Gonzales, an 11-year-old transgender girl living in the Dallas suburbs. She and her family say they feel like targets after the new law restricting trans students’ participation in school sports went into effect last year – passed by Swanson and other legislators bankrolled by Dunn and Wilks. Now, Libby won’t be able to play for the girls’ soccer team that she’d like to join.\n\nLibby Gonzales plays outside her home in a suburb of Dallas on January 19, 2022. CNN\n\n“We don’t have issues in our neighborhood, among our friends,” said her mother, Rachel Gonzales. “It’s when our legislators meet and decide that they’re going to leverage their political power against some of the most marginalized kids in our state.”\n\nGonzales has started volunteering for political campaigns in an attempt to turn the tide on anti-trans policies. Libby said she’s been following the news about Texas’ conservative turn – and worrying what’s coming next.\n\nLast month, the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a think tank that Dunn serves on the board of, called on the legislature to ban the prescription of puberty blockers and hormone treatments for minors.\n\n“I’m under attack,” Libby said. “I have no idea why people don’t understand that I’m just a girl: an 11-year-old girl living in Texas – with amazing hair.”", "authors": ["Casey Tolan Matthew Reynard Will Simon Ed Lavandera", "Casey Tolan", "Matthew Reynard", "Will Simon", "Ed Lavandera"], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/01/politics/what-is-the-supreme-court-how-does-it-work/index.html", "title": "What is the Supreme Court and why does it have so much power ...", "text": "Editor’s Note: A previous version of this story appeared on March 26, 2012.\n\nCNN —\n\nWith recent decisions on abortion, gun control, religious freedom and the environment, the US Supreme Court once again reasserted its central role in America.\n\nThe nine justices are unelected, serve for life and until recently were all White men. But their actions have helped define the American way of life for more than two centuries.\n\nHere are several common questions about the court, its makeup and its power:\n\nWhat does the Supreme Court do?\n\nIn essence, the court decides if laws and government actions are constitutional and outlines the breadth and limits of government.\n\nWhen a case reaches the Supreme Court, typically through a process of several years, it’s important because the precedent the majority opinion sets is then the standard by which future laws are measured. That’s due to the principle of “stare decisis,” Latin for “to stand by a decision,” where a current court should be bound by previous rulings.\n\nAre Supreme Court decisions final?\n\nYes, in the sense that they can’t be overturned by another body.\n\nBut no, in the sense that the court can overturn or change its own precedent over time, as it did with odious decisions allowing racial segregation or with last month’s reversal of the 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade, which had guarantee the constitutional right to obtain an abortion.\n\nCan Congress overrule decisions?\n\nNot directly, but Congress can pass laws that respond to rulings.\n\nFor instance, the court ruled in 2007 that Lilly Ledbetter had not filed an equal pay discrimination complaint within the allowed time period (because she had not discovered the discrepancy until years later). President Barack Obama signed a law in 2009 that eliminated those previous restrictions.\n\nWhat about amending the Constitution?\n\nThe Supreme Court interprets the Constitution, so amending the document changes how the court is able to rule. But amending the Constitution is a herculean political task requiring, in theory, mass public support, which doesn’t exist for either party at the moment.\n\nAre Supreme Court justices elected?\n\nNo. They’re appointed by the president, and then sent to the Senate to be confirmed.\n\nHow many justices are there and who appointed them?\n\nNine. Each has an equal vote.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts (George W. Bush, 2005).\n\nJustice Clarence Thomas (George H.W. Bush, 1991).\n\nJustice Samuel Alito (GWB, 2006).\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor (Barack Obama, 2009).\n\nJustice Elena Kagan (Obama, 2010).\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch (Donald Trump, 2017).\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh (Trump, 2018).\n\nJustice Amy Coney Barrett (Trump, 2020).\n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson (Joe Biden, 2022).\n\nWhy do some presidents get to appoint more than others?\n\nLuck and politics. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama each served for eight years and got two justices confirmed each.\n\nTrump served one term and appointed three: one because Obama’s final nominee in 2016 was blocked by Republicans, one due to a retirement and one, just before the 2020 presidential election, due to the death of liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n\nAre there any requirements to be a justice?\n\nNo. It’s most common for nominees to now have strong legal pedigrees (Ivy League law school, experience clerking for previous justices or experience on federal appeals courts) but none of that is required.\n\nKagan was a Harvard Law professor and solicitor general (a top Justice Department attorney) but was never a judge. The late Chief Justice Earl Warren had been the governor of California.\n\nAre Supreme Court justices appointed for life?\n\nYes, as are the judges for other federal courts, and they can serve until death or retirement. It means they’re in theory insulated from the whims of the political branches. But it doesn’t make the justices popular: Current polls show that fewer than one-third of Americans have confidence in the court.\n\nCan Supreme Court justices be removed?\n\nYes, via impeachment – the same process used to remove a US president. The House would vote to impeach, and the Senate would have a trial and vote on whether to remove the justice. It’s never happened for a Supreme Court justice, however.\n\nWhat is ‘court packing’?\n\nThe Constitution doesn’t say how many justices the court must have, but the number has been set at nine since the mid-19th century and codified into law since. In theory, the president can nominate and the Senate can confirm more justices to swing the court in a desired direction.\n\nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt suggested this in the 1930s after the court had struck down many of his “New Deal” policies. Recently faced with a court that has six conservatives and three liberals, Democratic politicians have suggested adding several more justices to tilt the balance of power.\n\nHow does the court work?\n\nThe Supreme Court first met in 1790, as the highest court in the judicial branch of government. The justices are led by the chief justice of the United States (that’s the official title). The court has occupied its current building in Washington only since 1935. Previously, it borrowed space in Senate chambers in the US Capitol.\n\nTraditionally, each term begins the first Monday in October, and final opinions are usually issued by late June. Justices divide their time between “sittings,” where they hear cases and issue decisions, and “recesses,” where they meet in private to write their decisions and consider other business before the court.\n\nIn the courtroom, justices are seated by seniority, with the chief justice in the middle and the junior-most justices on the outside. Before public arguments and private conferences, where decisions are discussed, the nine members all shake hands as a show of harmony of purpose.\n\nAs the gavel sounds and the justices are seated, the marshal shouts the traditional welcome, which reads: “Oyez! Oyez! Oyez! All persons having business before the honorable, the Supreme Court of the United States, are admonished to draw near and give their attention, for the court is now sitting. God save the United States and this honorable court.”\n\nSince most cases involve appellate review of decisions by other courts, there are no juries or witnesses, just lawyers from both sides addressing the bench. The arguments usually last about an hour, and lawyers from both sides very often have their prepared oral briefs interrupted by pointed questions from justices. In recent years, the court has given each justice five minutes to ask questions, going in order from the chief justice to the most junior.\n\nThis give-and-take, question-and-answer repartee requires lawyers to think concisely and logically on their feet. And the tone of the questioning often gives insight into a justice’s thinking, a barometer of his/her decision-making.\n\nAfter the arguments, conferences are scheduled, where justices discuss and vote on the cases. In these closed-door sessions, the nine members are alone. No clerks or staff are allowed. No transcripts are kept.\n\nJustices spend much of their time reviewing the cases and writing opinions. And they must decide which cases they will hear in open court. When asked just before her 2006 retirement what the jurists do most of the time, Justice Sandra Day O’Connor said bluntly, “We read. We read on average 1,500 pages a day. We read. Sometimes we write.” Added Justice Antonin Scalia: “We try to squeeze in a little time for thinking.”\n\nCameras are not allowed, and until the Covid-19 pandemic, live audio for oral arguments wasn’t available either, meaning that the actions of nine men and women that can impact every aspect of American life happen in the shadows.", "authors": ["Dan Berman"], "publish_date": "2022/07/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/27/politics/supreme-court-role-justice-breyer/index.html", "title": "Analysis: Breyer's role on the Supreme Court and the hole he's ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nSupreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer can come across as a bookish government man, captivated by the nitty-gritty of regulations and convinced that Washington, on the whole, works.\n\nEnsconced in chambers lined with shelves of antique books on philosophy inherited from an uncle and strewn with briefs, papers and more books, he has filled his opinions with charts, statistics and multi-point rationales.\n\nBut the liberal Breyer also wrote far-reaching opinions endorsing abortion rights and, in dissent, backing school integration. And behind the scenes at the court, the 83-year-old justice is known for trying to build consensus, even as the court grew more conservative, and he worked against the odds.\n\nThe bespectacled Breyer, who often quotes British humorist P.G. Wodehouse and retells his grandchildren’s jokes, has conversed easily with all eight of his colleagues, dodging the friction of clashing ideologies and personalities.\n\nAs such, Breyer will leave a hole in the fabric of the court when he officially steps down later this year. More than most of his colleagues, he worked to bridge the conservative-liberal divide that was long 5-4 and now is 6-3.\n\nSupreme Court Justices (L-R) Scalia, Ginsburg, Stevens, Souter, Chief Rehnquist, Thomas, O'Connor, Breyer and Kennedy in formal portrait in 1994. Diana Walker/The Chronicle Collection/Getty Images\n\nAny successor would presumably lack Breyer’s Washington experience. But a replacement would bring new youthfulness to the left side of the bench and, if President Joe Biden fulfills a campaign promise, would mean the first Black female justice in the court’s history.\n\nAmong Breyer’s notable moves at the center of the court: helping craft a compromise with Chief Justice John Roberts in 2012 to uphold the Affordable Care Act and casting the decisive vote in 2005 regarding displays of the Ten Commandments. His solo concurring statement allowed a 40-year-old monument at the Texas Capitol to remain in place – but meant framed Ten Commandment displays in Kentucky courthouses had to be removed.\n\nOne of Breyer’s most robust opinions emerged as he protested a 2007 majority decision striking down school integration plans in Seattle and in Louisville, Kentucky. The plans, which allowed consideration of students’ race in school assignments, were intended to offset neighborhood housing patterns and bring districtwide diversity.\n\n“This is a decision that the Court and the Nation will come to regret,” Breyer wrote, adding that Roberts and the conservatives who joined him had undermined the promise of the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education school-desegregation landmark.\n\nBreyer had been reared in San Francisco, where his parents were active in the community and local schools. His father, Irving Breyer, a lawyer, served the San Francisco school district. Justice Breyer still wears the Omega Seamaster wristwatch his father was given upon retirement.\n\nDuring the earlier stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, Breyer regularly decamped with his wife, a daughter and three grandchildren to the family home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. But he remained active on Zoom, appearing before legal groups and students.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer is photographed at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in September 2015.

He quipped in interviews that their ritual handshakes before each of their meetings had been replaced with elbow bumps, as a precaution against the virus. “We’re rubbing elbows,” he said, holding up his elbow and rotating it midair.\n\nIn an expansive interview with CNN in October, Breyer defended the high court against criticism that it engages in politics or requires institutional revisions such as term limits for justices or seats beyond the current nine.\n\n“It’s an institution that’s fallible, though over time it has served this country pretty well,” he said. Of his own approach, Breyer added, “Once you put on the robe of the judge, you’re a judge. And that means you’re a judge for every person. Every person won’t like your decisions. A lot will dislike them. … You still have to remember that you are there for everybody.”\n\nIn a book he published last year, adapted from a lecture at Harvard, Breyer maintained that the justices were not as politically divided as they appeared, now split between six Republican-appointed conservatives and three Democrat-appointed liberals.\n\nHe insisted that differences with his colleagues flowed from their distinct views of the structure of the Constitution. Yet in classic Breyer style, he had a three-point caveat to his claim that judging and politics don’t mix: “[I]t is wrong to think of the Court as another political institution. And it is doubly wrong to think of its Members as junior league politicians. But, given 1) the highly general language of the Constitution; 2) the ambiguous relationship between jurisprudence, political philosophy, and policy, and 3) the inevitable, conscious or unconscious impact of a human being’s background upon his or her basic professional views, to find a total divorce between the two is not quite right either.”\n\nHow Breyer got to the bench\n\nPresident Bill Clinton appointed Breyer to succeed the retiring Justice Harry Blackmun in 1994. Breyer previously had been a US appellate judge in Boston. An architecture enthusiast, he oversaw (as chief judge on the 1st US Circuit Court of Appeals) construction of a dramatic federal courthouse overlooking Boston Harbor and distinguished by an 88-foot glass wall that faces the water.\n\nBreyer’s legal career began at the Supreme Court, where he was a law clerk to Justice Arthur Goldberg. In the 1970s, he served as counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, assisting Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts, who strongly recommended Breyer to Clinton.\n\nIn his Senate work, Breyer focused on criminal sentencing guidelines and airline deregulation. As a judge, he continued to support agency solutions, especially in the face of court conservatives trying to rein in regulators. He also highlighted the importance of individual participation in civic life.\n\n“For our government to remain a democratic republic,” he wrote in a dissenting opinion in 2020 that touched on both themes, “the people must be free to generate, debate, and discuss both general and specific ideas, hopes, and experiences. The people must then be able to transmit their resulting views and conclusions to their elected representatives. The object of that transmission is to influence the public policy enacted by elected representatives.”\n\nThen-Supreme Court nominee Judge Stephen Breyer speaks with reporters in May 1994 in the White House Rose Garden as US President Bill Clinton listens. ROBERT GIROUX/AFP/Getty Images\n\nHe spoke as he wrote. To lawyers who argued before the justices, Breyer offered multi-part questions. His hypothetical scenarios grew wilder through the years, and he would inevitably leaven his queries with a self-deprecating remark. “This question may seem naive and simple-minded,” he said during one 2021 argument, “but I don’t mean it to be.”\n\nFluent in French, Breyer has sometimes invoked Albert Camus’ “The Plague” in oral arguments and speeches.\n\nDuring 2021 oral arguments in a case testing when police without a warrant may enter a home under certain emergency circumstances, he began a scenario: “A baby’s been crying for five hours; nobody seems to be around. A rat’s come out of the house at a time when rats carry serious disease and have to be stopped.” Breyer later added in the same colloquy: “Try reading ‘The Plague.’ Try reading something where a rat coming out of a house could give people bubonic plague. I mean, you know, it’s easy to invent hypotheticals.”\n\nModerate liberal rulings\n\nThe late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined the high court a year before Breyer, as Clinton’s first appointee, and she more prominently carried the banner for liberals. So, too, has Justice Sonia Sotomayor, a 2009 appointee of President Barack Obama.\n\nBreyer has partnered most with Justice Elena Kagan, who was named by Obama in 2010. They have been allies in trying to work with the individual justices on the right. In 2012, when Roberts broke from his conservative brethren to uphold the Obamacare law, he conferred with Breyer and Kagan for compromises on the individual insurance mandate and Medicaid expansion.\n\nLast year, when the justices rejected a challenge to Obamacare for the third time, Roberts assigned the opinion to Breyer, who wrote a narrow, consensus decision outright rejecting the claims. The court said the Republican-led states and other challengers lacked legal “standing” because they had suffered no injury related to the law. The case had centered on a tax penalty in the Affordable Care Act that Congress zeroed out in 2017.\n\nBreyer’s moderate liberalism has also led him to a leading role in a string of abortion-rights cases. His moderate approach, acknowledging the various interests, enabled him to keep the requisite five votes for a majority, at least through 2020, when liberal Ginsburg died and was succeeded by conservative Justice Amy Coney Barrett, an opponent of abortion rights.\n\n“We understand the controversial nature of the problem,” he wrote in a 2000 case. “Millions of Americans believe that life begins at conception and consequently that an abortion is akin to causing the death of an innocent child; they recoil at the thought of a law that would permit it. Other millions fear that a law that forbids abortion would condemn many American women to lives that lack dignity, depriving them of equal liberty and leading those with least resources to undergo illegal abortions with the attendant risks of death and suffering.”\n\nIn 2016, conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy provided the crucial fifth vote for a Breyer opinion striking down a strict Texas abortion regulation on physicians and clinics.\n\nIn 2020, Breyer produced only a plurality opinion (with three liberal justices), as the court invalidated a similar Louisiana credentialing regulation for physicians who perform abortions. Roberts cast the fifth vote to strike down the law, but unlike Kennedy, who retired in 2018, Roberts would not join Breyer’s broader abortion-rights rationale.\n\nThe court’s view of abortion rights is certain to diminish – because of the strengthened conservative majority. Breyer dissented in late 2021 and again this month as the right wing repeatedly refused to prevent a Texas ban on abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.\n\nIn a separate line of cases, Breyer has regularly criticized the US system of capital punishment but stopped short of the position taken by liberals of another era that the death penalty is plainly unconstitutional.\n\nIn a 2015 opinion, joined only by Ginsburg, he urged the justices to reconsider the constitutionality of capital punishment. He cited “three fundamental constitutional defects” in the death penalty: “(1) serious unreliability, (2) arbitrariness in application, and (3) unconscionably long delays that undermine the death penalty’s penological purpose.”\n\nPerhaps Breyer’s most memorable writing came in the 2007 case known as Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, when the majority struck down a school integration plan that assigned students based on race.\n\nJustices Stephen Breyer (L), David Souter and Anthony Kennedy (R) attend a news conference at the Supreme Court to urge better pay for federal judges May 28, 2003, in Washington. David Hume Kennerly/Getty Images\n\n“For much of this Nation’s history, the races remained divided,” Breyer wrote. “It was not long ago that people of different races drank from separate fountains, rode on separate buses, and studied in separate schools. In this Court’s finest hour, Brown v. Board of Education challenged this history and helped to change it. … To invalidate the plans under review is to threaten the promise of Brown. The (Roberts) plurality’s position, I fear, would break that promise.”\n\nWhen he formally steps down, Breyer will have served 28 years. With his self-effacing style and emphasis on the dustier esoteric workings of government, he remained one of the least-known justices of his time. He sometimes made light of his relative anonymity.\n\nDuring the period that he and Justice David Souter (who served from 1990 to 2009) overlapped, the two balding, unassuming men, just a year apart in age, regularly joked about how often they were mistaken in public for each other. At a joint appearance in 2011 at Harvard Law School, the two men delighted in the double meaning of one possible response when people asked whether they were mistaken for each other: No, we are not “mistaken,” but perhaps we are “confused.”", "authors": ["Joan Biskupic"], "publish_date": "2022/01/27"}]}

Here's what climate and aviation experts said about the worsening turbulence trends.\n\nWhat causes turbulance?\n\nThere are different kinds of turbulence, and they're caused by different things:\n\nMountain wave turbulence, as the name suggests, happens when the wind hits a mountain and is forced upward off its blustery path. That's why it's common to hit some bumps when you're flying over the Rockies on a transcontinental flight.\n\nas the name suggests, happens when the wind hits a mountain and is forced upward off its blustery path.

Clear air turbulence can be caused by a number of factors and is generally harder to predict than the other two types, but it is also the most likely kind to affect aircraft. And because it's harder to predict, it can also be harder to avoid.\n\nDing!Even if the seatbelt sign is off, you should stay buckled while flying. Here's why.\n\nIs climate change making turbulence worse?\n\nYes, at least with clear air turbulence.\n\nAccording to Paul Williams, a professor of atmospheric science at the University of Reading, there's no clear data on how climate change is affecting mountain waves or convective turbulence, but clear air turbulence is definitely becoming more frequent and intense.\n\n\"It's going up because of climate change,\" Williams told USA TODAY last year. \"The atmosphere is getting more turbulent; there will be more severe turbulence in the atmosphere.\"\n\nThomas Guinn, chair of applied aviation sciences at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, agreed.\n\n\"Turbulence is going to tend to become more frequent and more intense with climate change,\" he said.\n\nSee how it happens:Why is turbulence increasing? Rougher skies may be from climate change, scientists say\n\nBoth Williams and Guinn pointed out that severe turbulence is actually increasing more acutely than lighter chop.\n\nRecent studies Williams has worked on show severe turbulence is increasing by 149% increase versus 59% for light turbulence. However, severe turbulence will likely remain very rare.\n\nHow many deaths has turbulance caused?\n\nDeaths from turbulence are extremely rare.\n\nIn the U.S., the Federal Aviation Administration reported 163 passengers and crew have been seriously injured by turbulence between 2009 and 2022.\n\nMore information on turbulence:Climate change is making turbulence worse, but here's why you shouldn't worry (too much)\n\nCan planes withstand turbulance?\n\nYes, planes are designed to withstand even extreme turbulence, so it may be uncomfortable for passengers, but it almost never puts the plane itself in physical danger, according to Guinn. The bigger problems, he said, are the other complications turbulence can cause.\n\n\"If you can climb above it or go below it, that fixes things, but that costs a lot of fuel,\" Guinn said. \"Prolonged exposure to turbulence for a pilot is fatiguing. Pilots are going to have to deal with that as well.\"\n\nIt's tough on other parts of the aviation sector as well.\n\n\"If there’s three times as much turbulence in the atmosphere, that’s three times the obstacles you have to avoid as a pilot,\" Williams said. \"Every time a pilot tries to go around turbulence, it adds to the workload of air traffic controllers and pilots.\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in New York.

The seatbelt sign was on at the time, though some of those injured weren't wearing them, he said.\n\nThomas Vaughan, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Honolulu, said there had been a weather advisory for thunderstorms that included Oahu and areas that would have included the flight path at the time of the incident.\n\nThe airline was aware of the weather forecast and the unstable air and weather conditions, but had no warning the particular patch of air where the turbulence occurred \"was in any way dangerous,” Snook said.\n\nHe didn't know how much altitude the plane lost during the turbulence, saying that would be part of an investigation involving the National Transportation Safety Board. The plane's flight data recorder would provide those details, he said.\n\nThe investigation would also address precisely what the passengers and crew were doing at the time, he said.\n\nThe Airbus A330-200 began its descent immediately after the turbulence and crew declared an emergency due to the number of injuries on board, he said. Air traffic controllers gave the flight priority to land.\n\nThe aircraft will undergo an thorough inspection and maintenance, mostly to fix components in the cabin, Snook said.\n\nSnook said he could only speculate whether some passengers hit their heads, but that was likely based on the injuries and the damage to cabin paneling.\n\n“If you don’t have your seatbelt on, you stay where you are as the aircraft goes down and that’s how those injuries occur,” Snook said.\n\nThe investigation will examine what other measures were taken, aside from turning on the fasten seatbelt sign, to ensure passengers were buckled in, he said.\n\nIn 2019, 37 passengers and flight crew members were injured when an Air Canada flight from Vancouver to Sydney hit intense turbulence about two hours past Hawaii. The Boeing 777-200 was diverted to Honolulu, where the injured received treatment. Thirty people were taken to hospitals and nine had serious injuries.\n\nOver the Atlantic, a 2017 American Airlines flight from Athens hit severe turbulence along the New York coastline. Seven crew members and three passengers were injured.\n\nMost people associate turbulence with heavy storms. But the most dangerous type is so-called clear-air turbulence. The wind-shear phenomenon can occur in wispy cirrus clouds or even clear air near thunderstorms, as differences in temperature and pressure create powerful currents of fast-moving air.\n\nPlanes can sail into clear-air turbulence without warning.\n\n——-\n\nAssociated Press Writer Becky Bohrer in Juneau, Alaska, contributed to this report.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/airline-news/2023/02/13/united-airlines-flight-maui-pacific-ocean/11248817002/", "title": "United Airlines flight from Maui dove within 775 feet of Pacific Ocean", "text": "A United Airlines flight leaving Hawaii in December had a close call after flight data showed the plane took a dive and came within 800 feet of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nThe incident happened on Dec. 18 when United Airlines flight UA1722, a Boeing 777, took off from Kahului Airport on the island of Maui en route to San Francisco, according to data from Flight Radar.

Yet as the stream of guilty verdicts were read Wednesday, he looked down, put his head on his hands and sat silently.\n\nThe trial comes less than a year after he drove a red SUV through the crowd in Waukesha’s Christmas parade on November 21, killing an 8-year-old boy and several members of the “Dancing Grannies” group.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'It was zooming': Man marching in parade describes SUV plowing through crowd 02:07 - Source: CNN\n\nBrooks had been released from jail less than two weeks prior in a domestic abuse case, on a $1,000 bail that prosecutors later acknowledged was “inappropriately low.” In that case, he allegedly ran over a woman who said she’s the mother of his child, according to court documents.\n\nProsecutors said in closing arguments Tuesday he intentionally drove through the crowd at significant speeds and hit 68 individual parade-goers, turning a joyous afternoon into a horrific one.\n\n“He reached speeds of approximately 30 mph. That’s intentional. He plowed through 68 different people. 68. How can you hit one and keep going? How can you hit two and keep going?” Waukesha County District Attorney Susan Opper said.\n\n“His intent I do have to prove, and I submit without any doubt there’s overwhelming evidence that this was an intentional act by Darrell Brooks and an act of utter disregard for human life.”\n\nIn his own closing arguments, Brooks attempted to raise questions about the vehicle and about his intent. He repeatedly said there had been “misconceptions” and “lies” told about him during the trial.\n\n“I’ve never heard of someone trying to intentionally hurt someone while attempting to blow their horn while attempting to alert people of their presence,” Brooks said.\n\nJurors deliberated on Tuesday night for just under two hours and then resumed again on Wednesday morning before quickly reaching its verdicts.\n\nThe family of Virginia Sorenson, the 79-year-old killed in the attack, thanked the jury for the verdicts.\n\n“We have been praying for this day for a long time,” her son Marshall Sorenson said.\n\n“This morning my five-year-old daughter came up to me and handed me this necklace with my mom’s ashes in it and she told me to take my mom with us for the sentencing so she was with us today,” he continued. “My mom always used to tell us when we were kids and our family, she always said, ‘Angels watch over you guys,’ so I just want to say, ‘Angels watch over you guys,’ and turn on those blue lights tonight.”\n\nHow the trial played out\n\nIn court, a series of videos and witnesses detailed the disturbing sights of the SUV ramming through the parade route.\n\n“The band had just passed us, a red SUV … going maybe 30, 40 miles per hour, just went straight over the Waukesha South (high school) band,” said Kyle Jewell, a spectator who tried unsuccessfully to catch up to the SUV to stop it. “And it’s not like it stopped, it went over … it looked like it went in the air, like over a pretty big object, and it was just like a big old speed bump and kept going.”\n\nNicole White, who prosecutors said was the first person struck by Brooks’ vehicle, testified she sustained injuries to her spine and tailbone and suffered ligament damage to her right knee.\n\n“I just remember being struck by the vehicle from behind on my back and then I fell to my knees and kind of rolled under the vehicle,” White said.\n\nBrooks’ trial has been marked by his unusual decision to represent himself in court and his persistent disruptions. Throughout the trial, he has spoken over prosecutors and the judge, asked vague questions, challenged the court’s jurisdiction and declared “Darrell Brooks” is not his name.\n\nJudge Jennifer Dorow has repeatedly removed Brooks from the court for his outbursts and placed him in a nearby courtroom, where he can communicate via a monitor and microphone which is most often muted.\n\nOn Tuesday, after removing him for the prosecution’s closing arguments due to interruptions, she called him “stubbornly defiant.”\n\n“He continues to not respect the fact that a ruling has been made, and he wants to argue and reargue and reargue points that this court has already gone over,” she said.\n\nBrooks previously pleaded not guilty by insanity, but his public defenders withdrew the insanity plea in September. The attorneys later filed a motion to withdraw from the case, and the judge ruled to allow Brooks to represent himself at trial.\n\nOpper, the prosecuting attorney, told jurors in her closing arguments not to be distracted in their deliberations by Brooks’ conduct during the trial.\n\n“You must not, not, not consider anything about Darrell Brooks other than his conduct in downtown Waukesha on the evening of November 21, 2021,” Opper told the jury. “Nothing he’s done before that, nothing he’s done since that. When you go back to that deliberation room, please obey Judge Dorow. Confine your comments to his conduct on November 21.”\n\nOutside court on Wednesday, Opper said Brooks’ behavior was “taxing.”\n\n“We felt very, very offended by his behavior, his disrespect of the court, the decorum, the families, in insulting the judge, in challenging the judge,” she said. “That’s not the way our system is designed. That was intentional on his part, we truly believe that, he did everything he can except claim that the dog ate his homework.”", "authors": ["Eric Levenson Bill Kirkos Brad Parks", "Eric Levenson", "Bill Kirkos", "Brad Parks"], "publish_date": "2022/10/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2014/08/09/how-to-scare-yourself-stupid/13796695/", "title": "How to scare yourself stupid", "text": "Morgan Housel\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nI flew from San Francisco to Washington, D.C. this weekend. Sitting next to me was a woman, probably about 30 years old, who shook so much during takeoff that her knee hit mine several times. She did the same thing in the middle of the flight when we hit a little turbulence. She whispered \"Thank God\" as we landed.\n\nShe was clearly terrified of flying. But when we arrived in Washington, she walked to the curb, got in a car, and drove off.\n\nThis reminded me of a section from Gerd Gigerenzer's book, Risk Savvy:\n\nHow many miles would you have to drive by car until the risk of dying is the same as in a nonstop flight? I have asked this to dozens of expert audiences. The answers are all over the place: one thousand miles, ten thousand miles, driving three times around the world. However, the best estimate is twelve miles. Yes, only twelve. If your car makes it safely to the airport, the most dangerous part of your trip is likely already behind you.\n\nThis has been a deadly year for air travel, with more than 700 fatalities in the last four months. But more than 700 people die in auto accidents every five hours.\n\nEbola has also been in the news this week, scaring people around the world. Ebola has killed 1,590 people since it was identified in the 1970s, according to the World Health Organization. Measles -- which faces a vaccination backlash -- kills about as many people every 96 hours.\n\nThe craziest thing about risk is that people fear what's rare and unknown much more than they fear things that are common but deadly.\n\nWhy?\n\nGigerenzer writes:\n\nPeople aren't stupid. The problem is that our educational system has an amazing blind spot concerning risk literacy. We teach our children the mathematics of certainty -- geometry and trigonometry -- but not the mathematics of uncertainty, statistical thinking. And we teach our children biology but not the psychology that shapes their fears and desires. Even experts, shockingly, are not trained how to communicate risks to the public in an understandable way. And there can be positive interest in scaring people: to get an article on the front page, to persuade people to relinquish civil rights, or to sell a product. All these outside causes contribute to the problem.\n\nSeveral other causes contribute to the problem of what I'd call scaring yourself stupid.\n\nStorytelling. Every teenager can tell you the story of the Titanic. But many educated adults have never heard of the 1987 sinking of the ferry MV Dona Paz, which killed almost three times as many people, a quarter of them children.\n\nSome tragedies become famous because they made good stories independent of their actual damage. The result is that certain things we're most scared of aren't that big a deal, while things we're oblivious to can be major risks.\n\nGullibility during times of fear. People are more likely to believe lies, misconceptions, and fairy tales when they're scared or facing an uncertain outcome. In his 1841 book Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, Charles Mackay wrote:\n\nDuring the Great Plague of London, in 1665, the people listened with avidity to the predictions of quacks and fanatics. Defoe says that at that time the people were more addicted to prophecies and astronomical conjurations, dreams, and old wives' tales than ever they were before or since.\n\nThis helps explain why so many investors became end-of-the-world goldbugs in 2008. Uncertainty makes you believe things you would have ignored under a more rational state of mind.\n\nCulture. Germans and Austrians are generally terrified of nuclear power and radiation. Most of Europe has banned X-ray scanners at airports over cancer fears. Austria built one nuclear power plant in the 1970s, but voters shut it down before it ever operated.\n\nAmericans and the French, on the other hand, could not care less. The French embraced nuclear power long ago, and Americans X-ray and CT scan with abandon.\n\nSome things may seem risky or harmless not because you've evaluated the facts, but because you were born into a culture that told you a story one way or the other.\n\nThe unfamiliar. Mapmakers once wrote \"Here be dragons\" over unexplored areas. The unfamiliar is viewed as risky even if you have no evidence that it is.\n\nIf hundreds of thousands of people die from heart disease every year, the risk might actually seem diminished, because you become desensitized to its regularity. But if one person dies from Ebola, it is front-page news, only because it's rare. People would rather do something very risky but common (eat a poor diet) than something trivially dangerous but less common (flying).\n\nBill Gates recently posted this fascinating graphic. Annoying-but-common mosquitoes kill 70,000 times as many people every year across the globe as terrifying sharks. Freshwater snails kill 1,000 times as many people as wolves:\n\nNobel Prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman once explained a version of this flaw: \"A reliable way to make people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth. Authoritarian institutions and marketers have always known this fact.\"\n\nStatistical blindness. Gigerenzer writes about a farmer asking a veterinarian about surgery risk to one of his cows:\n\nBen, the owner of the farm, asked how likely the cow was to have problems after the surgery. Trying to put it in terms that he could relate to I said, \"If we did this procedure on 100 cows, I expect about 10 to 15 would not completely recover within a few weeks of surgery.\" He paused a moment and said, \"Well that's good because I only have 35 cows.\"\n\nWe generally just suck at math.\n\nAmericans were widely worried about growing government spending in 2009. After the federal government passed a $3.5 trillion annual budget to mass protests, a group of economists asked 1,000 Americans a simple question: \"How many millions are in a trillion?\" Only 21% answered correctly. The rest either didn't know or answered wrong. Most Americans were worried about spending $3.5 trillion, but most had no idea how much a trillion actually was.\n\nPeople deal with statistical illiteracy by reacting with their gut. Sometimes that's good -- I don't need to calculate risks to know that driving blindfolded is stupid. But it can be dangerous, too. It makes us overreact to things that seem dangerous only because they're unknown, and underreact to things that are dangerous but look benign.\n\nFinancial adviser Carl Richards says \"risk is what's left over when you think you've thought of everything.\" Wherever you're not looking, or not thinking, that's where it is.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/08/09"}]}

OpenAI said it supports stronger protections against deepfakes and works to prevent its synthetic voices from copying those of real people.\n\n\"The voice of Sky is not Scarlett Johansson's, and it was never intended to resemble hers,\" Altman said in a statement late Monday. \"We cast the voice actor behind Sky’s voice before any outreach to Ms. Johansson. Out of respect for Ms. Johansson, we have paused using Sky’s voice in our products. We are sorry to Ms. Johansson that we didn’t communicate better.\"\n\nWhen OpenAI released a demo of its latest ChatGPT model last week, it included “Voice Mode,” with an emotive AI answering questions. One of those voices was \"Sky.\"\n\n“When I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference,\" Johansson said. \"Mr. Altman even insinuated that the similarity was intentional, tweeting a single word ‘her’ - a reference to the film in which I voiced a chat system, Samantha, who forms an intimate relationship with a human.”\n\nOpenAI said it is “pausing” the use of the Sky voice to address questions about how it chose the ChatGPT voices.\n\nA Sunday blog post from the artificial intelligence company says Sky’s voice “is not an imitation of Scarlett Johansson but belongs to a different professional actress using her own natural speaking voice,” and that the company \"carefully selected\" each of the voices over the course of a five-month process.\n\nJohansson said her legal counsel wrote two letters to Altman and OpenAI asking them to \"detail the exact process by which they created the 'Sky' voice.\n\n\"Consequently, OpenAI reluctantly agreed to take down the 'Sky' voice,\" she said.\n\nThe news was first reported by NPR.\n\nThe spat with Johansson comes at a tricky time for OpenAI, which is facing litigation from media companies, authors and artists for allegedly using their materials without consent or compensation.\n\n“Johansson is one of the world’s most famous actresses, and she speaks for an entire class of creatives who are now wrestling with the fact that automated systems have begun to erode the value of their work. OpenAI’s decision to usurp her voice for its own purposes will now get wide and justified attention,” journalist Casey Newton wrote in Platformer Monday.\n\nAnother powerful player, SAG-AFTRA, said it is backing Johansson. The influential union that represents television and radio artists is fighting over the rights to actors' voices and images as studios look to tap AI to create entertainment. SAG-AFTRA said supports federal legislation that would protect its members' voices and likenesses from unauthorized digital replication.\n\n\"We thank Ms. Johansson for speaking out on this issue of crucial importance to all SAG-AFTRA members. We share in her concerns and fully support her right to have clarity and transparency regarding the voice used,\" SAG-AFTRA said Tuesday in a statement.\n\nAltman said in a speech last year that he and other OpenAI executives were inspired by “Her,” the tale of a lonely man (Joaquin Phoenix) who falls in love with his virtual assistant Samantha (Johansson).\n\nOpenAI employees tweeted references to the movie on social media platform X after last week’s announcement. Altman posted one word: “her.”\n\nMira Murati, OpenAI’s chief technology officer, said the OpenAI team was more inspired by human conversation than “Her.” “When you stop talking, I’m about to jump in. I can kind of read your tone and respond to that. And it’s really natural, rich and interactive,” she said, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nWhen asked by USA TODAY, ChatGPT said Sky's voice \"doesn't specifically mimic Scarlett Johansson's voice,\" and that it was developed to have a \"neutral, natural tone rather than emulating any particular celebrity's voice.\"\n\nJohansson, a star in the Marvel universe, has challenged business behemoths before. In 2021, she settled a breach of contract lawsuit she brought against Walt Disney over her payout for \"Black Widow.\"\n\nThis is Johansson's full statement:\n\n“Last September, I received an offer from Sam Altman, who wanted to hire me to voice the current ChatGPT 4.0 system. He told me that he felt that by my voicing the system, I could bridge the gap between tech companies and creatives and help consumers to feel comfortable with the seismic shift concerning humans and AI. He said he felt that my voice would be comforting to people.\n\nAfter much consideration and for personal reasons, I declined the offer. Nine months later, my friends, family and the general public all noted how much the newest system named \"Sky\" sounded like me.\n\nWhen I heard the released demo, I was shocked, angered and in disbelief that Mr. Altman would pursue a voice that sounded so eerily similar to mine that my closest friends and news outlets could not tell the difference. Mr. Altman even insinuated that the similarity was intentional, tweeting a single word \"her\" - a reference to the film in which I voiced a chat system, Samantha, who forms an intimate relationship with a human.\n\nTwo days before the ChatGPT 4.0 demo was released, Mr. Altman contacted my agent, asking me to reconsider. Before we could connect, the system was out there.\n\nAs a result of their actions, I was forced to hire legal counsel, who wrote two letters to Mr. Altman and OpenAI, setting out what they had done and asking them to detail the exact process by which they created the \"Sky\" voice. Consequently, OpenAI reluctantly agreed to take down the \"Sky\" voice.\n\nIn a time when we are all grappling with deepfakes and the protection of our own likeness, our own work, our own identities, I believe these are questions that deserve absolute clarity. I look forward to resolution in the form of transparency and the passage of appropriate legislation to help ensure that individual rights are protected.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/20"}]}

Their idea of being a man is toxic.\"\n\n\"But that's not you. It's not us,\" he said.\n\nBiden's remarks to the 414 graduates at Morehouse, an all-male historically Black college in Atlanta, came as he is struggling to unite Black voters, particularly Black men, around his candidacy. Many Morehouse students and faculty criticized Biden's participation when it was announced because of his support for Israel's war in Gaza.\n\n\"In a democracy, we debate dissent about America's role in the world.

More than a dozen graduates and at least three faculty members wore keffiyehs, while one student entered the ceremony draped in a Palestinian flag.\n\nAs Biden delivered his address, at least one female faculty member stood in the opposite direction, her fist raised, in a sign of protest.\n\nBiden, wearing a maroon gown at the outdoor ceremony, said his administration is \"working around the clock for more than just one cease-fire,\" but also to \"bring the region together.\" He reiterated his support for a two-state solution in which Israelis and Palestinians live in peace.\n\n\"This is one of the hardest, most complicated problems in the world.

Biden won Black voters in the 2020 election by a 87%-12% margin, according to exit polls.\n\nAhead of Biden's arrival, Anwar Karim, a sophomore studying film at Morehouse and a member of Atlanta University Center Students for Justice in Palestine, told USA TODAY he was disappointed in his school’s choice of commencement speaker. He also decried Morehouse’s decision to award Biden an honorary degree, which is typically awarded to the school’s commencement speaker after a faculty vote.\n\n“Morehouse College is dedicated to producing men of consequence who lead lives of service and leadership, and I just have to beg the question, when it comes to Biden, what is an example of his leadership?” Karim said Friday.\n\nBiden commits to showing 'democracy is still the way'\n\nIn his speech, Biden touted his presidency as one that has delivered to Black Americans, pointing to efforts to invest in Black families and communities, cut child poverty, expand work opportunities, reduce prescription drug prices and cut student loan debt. He called out the \"poison of white supremacy\" and \"systemic racism.\"\n\nHe said he is committed to \"show that democracy, democracy, democracy is still the way,\" even in the face of inequality for Black Americans.\n\n\"What is democracy if Black men are being killed in the street? What is democracy if the trail of broken promises still leave Black communities behind?\" Biden said. \"What is democracy if you have to be ten times better than anyone else to get a fair shot? Most of all, what does it mean, as you've heard before, to be a Black man who loves his country even if it doesn't love him back in equal measure?\"\n\nBiden railed against new voting restrictions in Georgia and the \"constant attacks on Black election workers.\" He also said those who stormed the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 \"are called patriots by some,\" a clear reference to Trump.\n\n“Not in my house,\" Biden said.\n\nIn the days leading up to his Morehouse visit, the White House focused on Black outreach. Biden met on Thursday with plaintiffs of the landmark Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision, on the 70th anniversary of the dismantling of the \"separate but equal\" precedent. On Friday, Biden met with leaders of the \"Divine Nine\" HBCU sororities and fraternities.\n\nMore:In a nod to history, Biden meets with Brown v. Board of Education families\n\nIn Atlanta on Saturday, Biden spoke to Morehouse alumni and others at a campaign event at Mary Mac's Tea Room. \"The fact is, this election, lots at stake, lots at stake. It's not about me. It's about the alternative as well,\" Biden said. \"My opponent's not a good loser, but he is a loser.\"\n\nIntroducing Biden, Morehouse President David Thomas said, \"No administration in history, since the inception of historically Black colleges and universities, has invested more in our institutions than the Biden administration.\"\n\n\"And if you look at his policies, it is very clear that those investments are not charity,\" Thomas said.\n\nBiden, 81, closed his remarks with a reference to his age, a liability that has hung over his reelection. When he started his political career, Biden said he was told he was \"too young.\" Now he hears he's \"too old.\"\n\n\"Whether you're young or old, I know what endures: The strength and wisdom of faith endures. And my challenge to you is to still keep the faith as long as you can,\" Biden said. \"Together we're capable of building a democracy worthy of our dreams.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/05/16/morehouse-college-graduation-ceremonies-cancelled-if-joe-biden-speech-interrupted/73719262007/", "title": "Morehouse College to cancel commencement if President Joe ...", "text": "If anyone interferes with President Joe Biden’s commencement speech at Morehouse College on Sunday in Atlanta, all ceremonies will be canceled “on the spot,\" David A.

Thomas said he also won't allow police to remove students from the ceremony in zip ties. \"I will cease the ceremonies on the spot If we were to reach that position,\" he said.\n\n“I would rather be the first president to have a failed commencement than to say you are less important than the ceremonies of this institution,” Thomas told CNN.\n\nCollege can ‘hold tensions,’ only allowing silent protests\n\nThe only thing Thomas will not stand for on commencement day, or any other day is the demonstration of “hate speech,” calling for violence against another group or individuals, he shared.\n\nMorehouse College is a place that “can hold” tensions.

Ambition without perspective can be a killer when reality intrudes. And it will intrude.\"\n\n\n\n\"All of you will go through something like this,\" he said, imploring the students to resist the \"temptation to rationalize\" putting meetings and business opportunities ahead of family birthdays and vacations.Biden pointed to the deaths of his wife and daughter in a 1972 car crash and briefly touched on the death of his oldest son Beau to brain cancer in 2015.\n\n\"If you rationalize, you will lose so, so much,\" he said. \"You may succeed but it will be very hard for you to be happy.\"\n\nVideo:Watch VP Joe Biden's commencement address.\n\nFinally, he said, the graduates students must be willing to accept the risk of failure.\n\n\"Change is hard but necessary,\" he said. \"Progress is never easy, but it is always possible.\"\n\nMinutes after Biden finished his speech, the sun poked out from behind the clouds before the sky opened into a steady downpour. But the rain did little to dampen the spirits of the students, who wore plastic ponchos while collecting their diplomas.\n\nMaryland native Edwin Motton, who earned a bachelor's degree in psychology, said he was excited for Biden's speech and encouraged to learn the vice president was the first member of his family to earn a college degree.\n\n\"I'm a first generation college student, too, so I understand the struggles of trying to get an education and pursue your goals,\" he said. \"But, like he said, in the future we have a lot to look forward to. There's a lot more opportunities out there now so there's no reason we can't explore those avenues and get what we need.\"\n\nBiden's address was the first time a sitting vice president has served as a keynote speaker during graduation ceremonies for the historically black, public university and marked the start of the school's 125th anniversary celebration. The vice president last gave the commencement address at DSU in 2003 while serving as Delaware's senior U.S. senator.\n\n\"We don't get a lot of big name people here and the fact that he's from Delaware makes it even more special,\" said Chelsea Stanley, a 23-year-old North Wilmington native who earned a bachelor's degree in accounting.\n\nThe DSU graduation was only one of three major events in the state capital on Saturday, along with The Dover Days Festival and Wesley College's graduation.

Instead, the school opted move its typical morning start time to 1:30 p.m., after both the DSU graduation and The Dover Days parade.\n\n\n\nJust days after taking issue with Donald Trump's Cinco de Mayo tweet, Biden and the Republican presidential nominee are both slated to attended the May 15 graduation ceremony for University of Pennsylvania's College of Arts and Sciences, where Biden's granddaughter Naomi and Trump's daughter Tiffany each will receive degrees.\n\nDSU's commencement also marked the start of a busy graduation schedule for the vice president.\n\nBiden's next commencement speaking gig will be at his alma mater Syracuse University College of Law on May 13, followed by the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York on May 15.

The morning's presenters filled their remarks with references to Biden's career accomplishments – with many noting that any of the 6,411 graduates could be the second University of Delaware alum to become president.\n\nIn the course of his 28-minute speech, Biden told the story of a small-town Delaware kid who barely made it through school and was never pegged as the nation's next leader.

But to only see my life in that way would be the equivalent of opening a book to the 10th of 13 chapters and feel like you know the full story. My career did not begin on the location of a glamorous film set or on a reality-defying soundstage. I started acting at the St. Petersburg Little Theater in a production of 'The Great Sebastians' while I was still in high school. The fire that acting ignited in me was so fierce that it fueled me each day as I juggled a busy schedule filled with classes and homework assignments. But that’s what we do when we have goals. We work towards them, despite the challenges, difficulties and sacrifices we might have to make. So now, if someone ever says to you that you are doing too much, you tell them, 'I’m just getting started.' \"\n\n“This moment conjures up the exiting image of a high diver poised to leap into the void.

Why have I been asked to deliver the keynote speech to you on this pivotal day in your lives as you dive headfirst into a presumably bright, but unpredictable, future? Well, maybe the reason I’m here is because I happen to have some experience leaping off high perches into scary voids. So do allow me to offer some simple pointers that I’ve picked up along the way in my career full of leaps and dives. Stay loose. When falling, the tendency is to tighten up, to brace for impact. But in truth, the safest thing one can do is remain calm, even curious, about the shifting world around you. Learning how to fall teaches you how to land. And learning to land gives you the courage to jump higher.”\n\n\"It’s been truly amazing to see how your generation has rebelled against every bad habit of mine and every generation that came before me. You’ve rejected that whole 24/7, no days off grind. You’ve rejected apathy. You’ve rejected ignoring your mental health. You’ve rejected alienation and cruelty. You rejected not trying to include everyone, and you’ve rejected not looking out for each other – and those are hard things to reject. Because accepting them sometimes makes life way easier. If you just shut off your soul from the world, life is way easier. It’s also way less colorful. It’s way less complicated, way less nourishing and way less memorable. I’ve seen things you people wouldn’t believe. I’ve seen port-a-potties on fire from a helicopter above Woodstock ’99. I’ve seen Charlize Theron glitter in the dark from the backstage wings of the Oscars. All of these moments, and far better ones, are waiting to be experienced and marveled at by every one of you. It’s time to live.\"\n\n\"For me, this school is more than a degree. Adelphi University is my Ellis Island. Imagine it is the fall of 1994. There is a 21-year-old boy on the train to Garden City (New York). And he is terrified. He just arrived in America. He doesn’t know a soul. And he doesn’t speak English. This morning, I took the same train out to Garden City that I took 29 years ago. Looking at all of the other passengers, I couldn’t help but wonder how many of them ate Chobani yogurt this morning? But who would have thought that the yogurt recipe I carried in my bag 29 years ago would one day be welcomed in homes across America? I wonder today what I would say to the 21-year-old boy now. I’d say you were right to leave Turkey when you did. What an amazing country we are living in. There is magic in the soil here. There are things you can do in America that you can’t do anywhere else on earth. We can never forget how fortunate we are to be here. With it comes a responsibility to keep this country’s light alive for future generations, and to make this world a better place.\"\n\n\"I worked to achieve peace with the oldest and most powerful guerrilla group in the Western Hemisphere – the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known as the FARC. It was not an easy task. In fact, making peace is much more difficult than making war. I know this because I have made both. We face immense challenges ahead, as humanity always has. There are countless conflicts across the planet. Not only the war on Ukraine, but also the wars in Asia and Africa. And now, we have a new existential threat straight out of science fiction. Many experts are warning us about artificial intelligence and its real dangers to humankind. Many scientists have even asked for a moratorium in its development, cautioning us that we must first learn to master AI before it masters us. This threat is so real that one of the godfathers of AI resigned from Google. Of course, AI, like all technological breakthroughs, can be harmful or can be beneficial. It depends entirely on us and on our wisdom in using it. Humanity has overcome existential crises in its hundreds of thousands of years on earth, and I am certain, certain that we will be able to overcome the current ones.\"\n\n\"You stand on the broad shoulders of generations of Americans who have worn the uniform, including many barrier breakers and trailblazer. In fact, this year, you celebrate the 75th anniversary of the integration of women in the military, as well as the desegregation of our military. Looking forward to the future, it is clear you graduate into an increasingly unsettled world where longstanding principles are at risk. Soon, as officers in the United States Army, you will join the ranks of those brave warriors and make your own mark on the world. The power of America's military not only rests on our technology, our weaponry, our hardware. It rests on the character and the resolve of our people.

I’m in the wine business, too! In my experience, whether manufacturing fine wines, negotiating contracts or playing hoops, the only consistent rhythm is start-and-stop, speed up then slow down. Timing is everything! As president of the NBA Players Association, I’ve spent the last two years bargaining for the new CBA (Collective Bargaining Agreement) agreement. In negotiations, both sides need to know when to back off or move the deal forward – to land on a mutually beneficial agreement. It’s a matter of determining the right balance.

Penney, J. Crew, Neiman Marcus and Hertz.\n\nOff-price retailer Tuesday Morning and restaurant chain Le Pain Quotidien joined them in Chapter 11 on Wednesday, while Advantage Rent A Car filed on Tuesday.\n\nTaken together, these cases illustrate how the nation's weakest companies are desperately trying to avoid outright liquidation.\n\nCoresight Research, which tracks retail openings and closings, has upped its projected store closures for 2020 from 8,000 at the beginning of the year to 15,000 at the beginning of March to about 25,000 now.\n\n“That’s unlike anything the industry has ever seen,” Coresight CEO and founder Deborah Weinswig said. “It’s the speed with which it’s all happening which has been a little surprising.”\n\n230 store closings planned:Tuesday Morning retailer files Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nPermanent restaurant closings likely:Le Pain Quotidien files Chapter 11 bankruptcy\n\nBut there’s no stopping the bankruptcies now, she said. She predicted that retail the number of June bankruptcies will double May bankruptcies.\n\nThat doesn't necessarily mean those companies will go out of business. Bankruptcy can serve as a place of refuge for struggling companies, offering the chance to shed unsustainable debt, close unprofitable stores and restructure operations.\n\nIn each case so far during the pandemic, the debtors have said they hope to use bankruptcy to preserve their businesses for the long haul.\n\nBut filing for bankruptcy in the midst of what may be the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression poses the serious possibility of widespread going-out-of-business sales.\n\n\"I do think there is a genuine hope that the turnaround efforts will proceed, but it is kind of hard when people are prohibited from coming into your store and you can’t turn the lights on,\" U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Jones, who is overseeing the J.C. Penney case, said during a court hearing May 16.\n\nIn some cases, companies were already headed toward bankruptcy before the pandemic became an issue. That was the case for Belgian restaurant chain Le Pain Quotidien, chief restructuring officer Steven Fleming said in a court filing. The company had been struggling with increased competition from nimbler competitors, including fast-casual companies, and had suffered from a lack of digital ordering until recently.\n\n“If you were a retailer with a heavy debt load, a questionable brand position and you weren’t sprinting to digital … you were probably on your way” to Chapter 11, said Matthew Katz, managing partner and practice lead in the retail and consumer practice of strategic advisory SSA & Co. \"The pandemic has certainly made the slope (more) slippery.”\n\nFor companies in the travel sector, it's a different story. They've been knocked out by a force they could not have seen coming. But some of them were in rough shape already, as well.\n\nFor Advantage Rent A Car – which has been hit hard by a slowdown in travel, much like larger rival Hertz – bankruptcy is a familiar place. The company's filing on Tuesday marks its third time in Chapter 11 since 2008, or what restructuring professionals dubiously call \"Chapter 33.\"\n\nRegardless of their path to bankruptcy, companies that find themselves there in the midst of the pandemic face the double-barreled challenge of not being able to confidently project their future and grasping to secure fresh financing from lenders who may be extra hesitant to help out.\n\n\"We live in a world of no normal,\" said Greg Portell, lead partner in the global consumer practice of Kearney, a strategy and management consulting firm. \"We can’t plan what we’re going to do for July 4, so how is a retailer going to plan for the holiday season?\"\n\nFor some, their best-laid plans have already gone awry.\n\nTake Pier 1 Imports, for example. The company filed for Chapter 11 protection in February with plans to close up to 450 stores and keep several hundred alive. At the time, COVID-19 was not viewed as a major threat to the American economy. But Pier 1's prospects grew increasingly grim with the onset of the pandemic, and the company announced last week that it will close all of its remaining stores.\n\nLike Pier 1, Tuesday Morning was struggling when the coronavirus pandemic began. The off-price retailer – which sells a wide variety of merchandise including home decor, bath and body goods, crafts, food, and toys – hopes to stay in business while using the bankruptcy process to close about 230 of its 687 stores this summer.\n\nAlthough about 80% of its stores have reopened after temporary closures, Tuesday Morning said in a statement that the \"immense impact of COVID-19\" created \"an insurmountable financial hurdle\" as it tried to reinvent itself without court protection from its creditors.\n\nThe store closings are expected to lead to a spike in vacancies. In the 54 largest markets, retail vacancies are expected to rise from 4.5% at the end of 2019 to 5.6% at the end of 2020, according to real estate tracker CoStar.\n\nRetailers are paying the price for failing to invest in their in-store-and-online connections, often referred to as “omnichannel,” as well as their logistics and supply chain, analysts said.\n\nBut there may be hope on the horizon. Signs are emerging that private equity companies are looking to snap up struggling retailers at bargain prices, Katz said.\n\nJ.C. Penney announces new home brand:Still planning store closings in bankruptcy\n\nStore closings:Victoria's Secret to close about 250 stores in the U.S. and Canada\n\nTens of thousands of jobs are at stake in the bankruptcy cases that have been filed since the pandemic began. J.C. Penney alone had 85,000 workers when the crisis erupted.\n\nFor J.C. Penney, which was synonymous with the American shopping mall experience for decades, the future may rest on how quickly the company can arrange a debt restructuring plan or a sale of its operations. The company plans to permanently close 242 of its about 846 stores in bankruptcy.\n\nJones, the bankruptcy judge overseeing the case, said he's concerned that the retailer is not moving fast enough. But he signaled that he wants to help.\n\n\"I want to keep everybody’s eyes focused on saving the business,\" he said at the hearing. \"This is middle America, at least in my view.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/food/2024/02/28/outback-steakhouse-closing-locations/72771215007/", "title": "Outback Steakhouse parent company is closing 41 restaurant ...", "text": "Bloomin' Brands Inc., the parent company of Outback Steakhouse and other restaurants, says it is closing 41 locations across its portfolio.\n\n“Closing restaurants is never easy.

The restaurant closed at the end of November.\n\nOthers are reading:Indoor dining returns and restaurant owners breathe a tentative sigh of relief\n\nSizzler\n\nIn late September Sizzler USA, the casual steakhouse chain known for its salad bar, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The 62-year-old restaurant chain has closed numerous locations, including the one in Salem at 1151 Lancaster Drive NE. Sizzler locations in Albany, Springfield and Roseburg also have closed.\n\nThe company is currently undergoing restructuring practices meant to reduce its debt. A Dec. 11 business filing with Oregon's Secretary of State by Sizzler USA Restaurants Inc. indicates the company plans to continue operations in the state of Oregon, though does not specify particular operating locations.\n\nA company representative confirmed while the chain plans to reopen some Oregon locations, Salem will not be among them.\n\nKyoto Japanese Restaurant\n\nA Salem destination for sushi and teppanyaki since the early 1980s has closed.\n\nKyoto Japanese Restaurant, 1610 Lancaster Drive, held its final service Nov. 8.\n\nOwners Sue and Sam Koizumi have operated the business for 37 years.\n\n\"It's hard,\" said Sue. \"We're lucky we could make it this long.\"\n\nThey closed the restaurant for three months at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Though they reopened over the summer, pandemic operating precautions were particularly difficult for them to manage because of the style of the restaurant.\n\nIn teppanyaki meals, a cook prepares a meal for a large party of guests on a flat top grill built into the table itself. It's a style of dining that lends itself to birthdays and other celebrations, which is part of what made adapting to coronavirus recommendations so difficult.\n\nAt a table built to seat eight, Sue said, they were serving parties of two or four, and \"we only have seven tables.\" Phased reopening requirements prohibited seating guests at their sushi bar. These factors combined, said Koizumi, \"that's not enough business.\"\n\nThey made the decision to close without announcement or celebration and are in the process of cleaning and clearing out the restaurant space.\n\nCould they reopen after the pandemic is resolved? It's more likely, Koizumi said, this closure means retirement.\n\nWatch:Craving wings?

Imes did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMallory Ramey, McCormick's fiancee, launched a crowdfunding campaign on Go Fund Me with the goal of raising $75,000 to reopen The Ritz.\n\nThe bulk of the resources would go toward paying back rent, largely deferred since March, as well as paying back bills to vendors and utility providers, McCormick said, with a cushion of about $8,000 to help the business go forward.\n\nMcCormick said he hasn't taken a paycheck from the business since March, instead prioritizing payroll and payments to suppliers.\n\nHe has worked at The Ritz since 2010, both as a cook and manager, and had begun making cosmetic improvements to the business before the pandemic began.\n\nEven though business was good, he said, \"once rent comes due again, I'll never be able to catch up.\"\n\nBirdie's Bistro\n\nBirdie's Bistro has announced plans to close for good.\n\nShana and Toy Schmidt founded Birdie's Bistro in Keizer in 2012 in the River Road space that is now Gyro Stop. Katrina and Aaron Beale bought the restaurant and moved it to the Equitable Center in December 2017.\n\nIt has been a favorite daytime destination for many, beloved for its salads, sandwiches and pastries, especially among the downtown breakfast and lunch crowd. The restaurant's last day of operations was Oct. 18.\n\nShawerma Owok\n\nShawerma Owok, a red food truck across from the Roth's Vista location on Liberty Road and Commercial Street in South Salem was a favorite quick lunch option for some reporters, yours truly included.\n\nIt was one of few places locally specializing in Middle Eastern sandwiches, platters and salads, all crowned with a swizzle of pungent garlic sauce. Open since summer 2017, the truck was a mother-son venture of Amal Idris and Mohammad Hasan.\n\nThey closed the businesses temporarily in March and April, at the start of the pandemic.\n\n\"We reopened in June, but it wasn't worth it,\" Hasan said, because they were still paying rent on the space and sales were slow.\n\nIn a late September post to the business' Facebook page, they announced plans to close and they've since listed the truck for sale.\n\n\"We feel sorry for our customers,\" Hasan said, \"but corona was too hard on us.\"\n\nPolk County restaurant inspections:Bartender started work without washing hands\n\nThe Portland Press\n\nThe Portland Press, Brandon and Aaron Appel's gluten-free waffle sandwich spot announced plans to close via social media on Sept. 15. They attributed the closure to the combined impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the wildfires in the community impacting air quality.\n\n\"Words cannot express our gratitude for Portland Press supporters and fans. You really showed our little family-owned restaurant some love, Salem,\" they said in a post to the restaurant's Instagram page.\n\nThe Portland Press was the first vendor to sign on to open inside the food hall a year ago.

Owners Amanda Singharaj and Perry Sinasone could not be reached for comment.\n\nState business filings indicate that Kelly Cepeda registered El Vaquero Santa Maria BBQ for the 4907 River Road N address in the first week of July. The new business specializes in a style of barbecue from the central coast of California. It opened on Sep. 11.\n\nSalem Ale Works\n\nAfter seven years of \"putting the ale in Salem,\" Jake Bonham and Justin Ego closed their brewery Salem Ale Works at the end of August.\n\nTypically, Bonham said, 80% to 90% of the beer S.A.W brewed was sold directly to the person drinking it in the brewery's 25th street taphouse.\n\n\"That's what our model was built on,\" Bonham said, but \"in March we were looking to make a pivot as best we could.\" The brewery had just begun canning their beers before the pandemic necessitated closing the taproom, and they switched from draft sales to entirely canned beers.\n\nBonham said they hoped reopening under Phase 1 guidelines would reinvigorate taproom sales.\n\n\"As we got into late July and we were looking at our sales numbers,\" Bonham said, \"we were coming to the end of what is normally peak beer season. Looking out into fall and winter without any sort of change, we just didn't really see a way forward.\"\n\nRead More:Salem Ale Works will close, citing slow sales since phase one of COVID-19 reopening\n\nFirepit Wandering Kitchen\n\nRebecca and Ryan Fineran closed their mobile food business, Firepit Wandering Kitchen, over the summer. Since they opened in 2017, the truck moved around town frequently, popping up at various offices, dispensaries, wineries and bars.\n\nBeloved for meaty burgers, sausage sandwiches, tacos and more, Firepit also had a steady presence at Salem's bottleshop Barrel & Keg. In January, they opened a third location at Salem Ale Works helmed by former Table Five 08 cook Quinton Soto.\n\nRebecca Fineran said slow sales and the vulnerability of the pandemic were major factors in their decision to cease operations entirely.\n\nBossi's BBQ\n\nMegan Bossi, Salem's barbecue queen, served her final brisket, nacho cheese and jalapeño sandwich at Beehive Station on July 31. Bossi launched her barbecue business last fall, popping up in Dallas before moving her cart to Salem early this year. The cart gathered fans quickly, especially of the loaded pulled pork nachos.\n\nThough she has been able to operate steadily through the pandemic, the rising costs and fluctuating availability of the meat have cut into the food cart's margins. That, said Bossi, combined with the announcement that Salem-Keizer Public Schools would begin the first nine weeks of the upcoming school year using distance learning in place of in-person instruction, made continuing cart operations unfeasible.\n\nUntil now, Bossi has been able to juggle childcare and distance learning for her kids, but faced with the start of school, \"there's no possible way I can do that,\" Bossi said, \"It's just been one thing after another.\"\n\nBossi hopes to return to barbecue at some point in the future but, at the moment, she's hoping to sell her barbecue cart and find work in another field.\n\nTable FIVE 08\n\nThe six-year-old High Street restaurant beloved for its modern takes on steakhouse classics, Asian flavors and creative cocktail program has closed.\n\nThe restaurant's last day was July 9. Longtime Table FIVE 08 bartender Rob \"Drinkenstein\" Melton confirmed coronavirus as the reason behind the closure.\n\n\"It overtook us. It got too far out in front of us.\"\n\nThe restaurant is the first in downtown Salem to permanently close because of coronavirus. Co-owners Steven Freeburg and Jason Freeburg announced the closure on the restaurant's Facebook page. The storefront remains vacant.\n\nCourtyard Cafe\n\nTony and Tori Garcia had big dreams when they bought Dallas' Courtyard Cafe in the fall of 2019. They made substantial cosmetic renovations to the breakfast and lunch space and reopened in December.\n\nWhen coronavirus arrived in Oregon, however, the couple realized they didn't have the resources yet banked to maintain the cafe operations amidst the pandemic. They listed the restaurant for sale.\n\nTony Garcia said they hope to revisit the possibility of opening another restaurant sometime in the future. After Courtyard Cafe closed, Tino Land and Augustin \"Jay\" Razo opened a third Azuls Taco House location in the Dallas storefront.\n\nMore:Slowed by a loss, Azuls Taco House plans third location in Dallas\n\nStay up to date on all Salem-area food and restaurant news.

The helicopter went down in heavy fog in a remote area Sunday, and search operations were hindered by the fog, blizzard conditions and difficult terrain. The bodies of all eight on board were found Monday.\n\nState Department spokesman Matt Miller said Monday that the U.S. offers its \"official condolences\" for the Iranians killed in the helicopter crash. \"As Iran selects a new president, we reaffirm our support for the Iranian people and their struggle for human rights and fundamental freedoms,\" Miller said in a statement.\n\nRaisi's death is not expected to upend Iran's domestic or foreign politics. But it does come at a time of raised international tensions and increases speculation over who will eventually replace Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Raisi was viewed as a possible successor to the 85-year-old cleric.\n\nRaisi's funeral will be held Wednesday, and a presidential election has been scheduled for June 28, state media reported Monday. Candidates for the position may include Khamenei's second son, Mojtaba Khamenei, regarded as an influential behind-the-scenes figure. However, the elder Khamenei has expressed opposition to hereditary rule.\n\nRemembering those we lost: Celebrity Deaths 2024\n\nIranian president:Here's what to know about Ebrahim Raisi\n\nDevelopments\n\n∎ Mohammad Mokhber, Iran's vice president, was appointed acting president. Mokhber appointed Iranian nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani acting foreign minister. Iran declared five days of public mourning.\n\n∎ State media reported the U.S.-made Bell 212 helicopter may have slammed into a mountain peak, although there was no official word on the cause of the crash. Iran's Red Crescent published video footage showing rescue teams recovering bodies from the crash site.\n\n∎ Among the leaders to express condolences for the death of Raisi and the rest of his traveling party are such disparate figures as Pope Francis and North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un.\n\n∎ The deaths of Iran's president and its top diplomat deprive the country of two senior politicians at a time when Iran and the broader region are on edge because of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza and recent direct military exchanges between Iran and Israel that risked sparking a wider regional conflict. Domestically, Iran's theocratic government has been facing anger over corruption, its sanctions-hit economy and calls for an end to clerical rule.\n\nIran's President Ebrahim Raisi diesin Vietnam-era Bell 212 helicopter crash on mountain\n\nRaisi had record of 'atrocious human rights,' White House official says\n\nJohn Kirby, the White House spokesman on national security, said Monday it is typical for the U.S. to offer official condolences to foreign governments for a major loss after the Biden administration statement came under scrutiny from critics of the Iranian regime. But, he said, “President Raisi was responsible for atrocious human rights in his own country, the arrest and the physical violence against hundreds of protesters.”\n\nKirby said Raisi was also responsible for the support Iran provided to “terrorist” networks throughout the region, including Hamas, the militant group behind the Oct. 7 attack in Israel that killed 1,200 people.\n\n“No question this was a man who had a lot of blood on his hands,” Kirby added. “As we would in any other case, we certainly regret, in general, the loss of life and offered official condolences as appropriate.”\n\nKirby told reporters the U.S. does not have additional details about the crash and its cause, adding: “We’re going to continue to stand with the Iranian people as they fight for their own civil rights. And we're going to continue to hold Iran accountable for all their destabilizing behavior in the region, which continues to this day.”\n\n– Francesca Chambers\n\nDissident groups say election will put pressure on regime\n\nJamal Abdi, president of the Washington-based National Iranian American Council, said the deaths create a void in leadership amid a deepening legitimacy crisis for the Islamic Republic. Raisi's election was \"highly choreographed, even by the Islamic Republic's standards,\" he said, as hardliners consolidated power. But the cost of excluding moderate and reform candidates was a drop in turnout.\n\n\"The state will now weigh its interest in mobilizing public participation in an unprecedented election at a time of great regional turmoil against its fears of popular challenges to its rule amid domestic unease,\" Abdi said in a statement. \"The divides between state and society will only deepen if the Guardian Council only approves a narrow list of conservative regime insiders to run for the Iranian presidency.\"\n\nMaryam Rajavi, president-elect of the Paris-based National Council of Resistance of Iran, said the deaths represent an \"irreparable strategic blow\" to the regime.\n\n\"It will trigger a series of repercussions and crises within theocratic tyranny, which will spur rebellious youths into action,\" Rajavi said.\n\nRegime supporters pack mosques\n\nGovernment supporters filled mosques and squares to pray for the crash victims. Mohammad Hossein Zarrabi, 28, a member of the volunteer Basij religious militia in the holy city of Qom, called Raisi a hard worker whose \"legacy will endure as long as we are alive.\"\n\nOther Iranians had a different view.\n\n\"Who cares. One hardliner dies, another takes over and our misery continues,\" said Reza, 47, a shopkeeper in the central desert city of Yazd who did not give his full name to Reuters, fearing reprisals. \"We're too busy with economic and social issues to worry about such news.\"\n\nWho built the helicopter? Who owns Bell Helicopter?\n\nThe helicopter was a civilian version of the Vietnam War-era \"Twin Huey\" that today is popular with governments and private helicopter companies around the world. Iranian media said the helicopter that went down was connected to the Islamic Republic Red Crescent Society, and experts suggested it may have been more than 40 years old.\n\nAlthough the cause of the crash was still under investigation, former Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif blamed the crash on U.S. sanctions that make aviation replacement parts difficult to obtain in Iran.\n\nThe aircraft that crashed was built by Bell Helicopter, now Bell Textron, a division of Textron Inc., a Fortune 500 company based in Providence, Rhode Island. The helicopter, which seats about 15, was developed for the Canadian military in the late 1960s and introduced for civilian use a few years later. Non-military organizations that fly the Bell 212 include many U.S. law enforcement agencies and fire departments, Japan's Coast Guard and Thailand's national police, among others.\n\nThe most recent fatal crash of a Bell 212 was in September 2023, when a privately operated aircraft crashed off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, according to the Flight Safety Foundation.\n\nIran's air force and navy have 10 of the helicopters, according to FlightGlobal's 2024 World Air Forces directory. It's not clear how many the civilian government owns and flies.\n\nCondolences pour in from world leaders\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said Raisi’s death was “a great loss to the Iranian people\" and that China had lost a good friend. Russian President Vladimir Putin described Raisi as a \"true friend of Russia\" and an \"outstanding politician.\" European Council President Charles Michel said the EU \"expressed its sincere condolences\" to the families of all those killed.\n\nSaudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz, whose country has seen tensions with Iran ease somewhat in recent months, extended \"deepest sympathy\" to the Iranian people.\n\nSyrian President Bashar al-Assad, Lebanon's Foreign Minister Abdallah Bou Habib and leaders of Hezbollah all offered their condolences, and Syria and Lebanon declared three days of mourning.\n\nWhile the U.S. government's response was diplomatic, some individual officials have pointed out Raisi's litany of human rights abuses. Florida Republican Marco Rubio, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, did not hold back.\n\n“The regime in Tehran has lost one of its bloodiest hard-liners,'' Rubio said in a statement. \"Since before his sham presidential election, President Raisi subjugated the Iranian people to years of repression and left behind a reign of terror. From his support of international terrorism, mass murders of the Iranian people and other human right abuses, the world won’t soon forget Raisi’s atrocities.\"\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers\n\nWhat do we know about the cause of the Iran crash?\n\nNot a lot. Some theories, mostly conspiratorial in nature and lacking evidence, have sprung up on social media. There's a tendency in Iran to blame Israel, its chief regional enemy, whenever there is an unexplained accident or death of a public security or nuclear official in Iran.\n\nTehran has so far been silent on this point. However, Israeli officials have already been anonymously briefing reporters there Monday, saying, \"It wasn't us.\"\n\nIran’s isolation from the world has long left it with one of the oldest civil-aviation fleets in the world, and it has facilitated a fatal trend in its aviation-safety record. Western manufacturers, under the sanctions, are prohibited from selling planes and even crucial spare parts to Iran. What's not known is whether the U.S.-made Bell 212 crashed because of lack of access to spare parts or some other technical maintenance issue.\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nKhamenei, Iran's supreme leader, has the final say on all major policy decisions. However, according to Iran's constitution, the vice president takes over if the president is not able to execute his duties because of illness or death. That means power has been transferred temporarily to Mokhber, 68, who has been Raisi's No. 2 since the election in 2021 that handed Raisi the presidency. Khamenei ordered Mokhber to work with the Iranian judiciary to arrange an election within 50 days. Hopefuls for the job must have their candidacies approved by Khamenei's regime.\n\nWho is Mohammad Mokhber?\n\nMokhber is close to Khamenei, and like Raisi is a politically conservative hardliner when it comes to issues such as violating \"morality\" laws, clampdowns on protests and nuclear talks with the West. He hails from Iran's southwestern Khuzestan Province on the Iraqi border and the Persian Gulf. He was a Revolutionary Guard Corps officer in the 1980s and is a former head of Setad, a powerful economic organization controlled by Khamenei. Setad, despite its billions of dollars in assets, struggled to get effective COVID-19 vaccines to the masses − Iran was among the most hard-hit Middle East nations. The official death toll was nearly 150,000 and the actual one is believed to be much higher.\n\nSetad and Mokhber were sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury in 2021, accused of violating “the rights of dissidents by confiscating land and property from opponents of the regime,\" among other things.\n\nThe New York-based Center for Human Rights in Iran warned that Raisi's death could lead to deeper crackdowns on \"civil society.\" Hadi Ghaemi, executive director, urged the international community to remain vigilant and responsive to any potential escalation of the violent suppression of peaceful dissent under Iran's new president. Mokhber will be on a three-person panel overseeing the coming election.\n\n\"Real alternatives to Iran's hardliners have simply not been allowed to stand for office in the last few elections,\" said Trita Parsi, an expert on Iran and the co-founder and executive vice president of the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, a Washington think tank.\n\nInside Iran:America’s contentious history in Iran leads to mix of anger, wonderment and weariness\n\nWho was Ebrahim Raisi?\n\nRaisi ascended to the presidency after a long career of service to the conservative clerical leadership. He worked as a prosecutor assigned to cases connected to the Iran-Iraq war that raged from 1980 to 1988. When it ended, he was one of four judges who allegedly oversaw the mass execution of thousands of political prisoners. Iran has never acknowledged the killings, which Human Rights Watch estimates involved 2,800 to 5,000 people being executed. Activists dubbed Raisi the \"Butcher of Tehran.\"\n\nRaisi rose through the ranks to be Iran's top legal official. He lost the 2017 presidential election to the relatively moderate incumbent Hassan Rouhani before winning the job four years later, immediately tightening morality laws.\n\nIn 2022, Iran was besieged by mass protests after the death of Mahsa Amini, who had been taken into custody for opposing Iran's strict headscarf − hijab − mandates for women. The demonstrations prompted Raisi's monthslong crackdown that left hundreds of Iranians dead and thousands detained.\n\nExperts warn that the airtight dominance of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and his Revolutionary Guards guarantees that Raisi’s passing won’t bring Iranians any closer to justice for the decades of human rights abuses they’ve endured.\n\nIran president 'has blood on his hands':Ebrahim Raisi and Iran's prison massacres\n\nRaisi played a key role in the 1988 prison massacres\n\nNo abuses were more severe than the prison massacres of 1988. The prisons were packed with young leftists who’d been convicted for having links to an Iraq-based rebel group, the People’s Mujahedeen Organization of Iran, or Mujahedeen-e-Khalq. In July 1988, after the group launched an attack on Iran from its base in Iraq, Ayatollah Rouholla Khomeni, the Islamic Republic’s founding cleric, called for all PMOI prisoners to face special tribunals. In a secret fatwa, Khomeni ordered officials to “annihilate the enemies of Islam immediately.”\n\nSitting in judgment at some of these hastily called “death commissions” was deputy prosecutor Raisi, a hardline cleric. The U.S. Treasury Department said in a 2019 sanctions notice that \"as deputy prosecutor general of Tehran, Raisi participated in a so-called 'death commission' that ordered the extrajudicial executions of thousands of political prisoners in 1988.\"\n\nWhen asked about the killings many years later, Raisi described himself as a \"defender of human rights.\" Raisi called the killings “one of the proud achievements” of Iran’s government, according to an Amnesty International report. He went on to serve as prosecutor general in Tehran and later as the top prosecutor in the country.\n\n“Raisi was a pillar of a system that jails, tortures and kills people for daring to criticize state policies,” Ghaemi said. “His death has enabled him to escape being held accountable for his many crimes and the state’s atrocities committed under his rule.”\n\n− Dan Morrison\n\nContributing: Reuters", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/05/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2024/02/09/capt-jack-casey-of-dover-nh-dies-in-marines-helicopter-crash/72539495007/", "title": "Capt. Jack Casey of Dover NH dies in Marines helicopter crash", "text": "DOVER — A Dover man was one of the five U.S. Marines who died in a routine military helicopter training flight outside of San Diego.\n\nCapt. Jack Casey, a 26-year-old CH-53E helicopter pilot, was confirmed to be one of the victims on Friday by the Marine Corps, and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu. He was a 2015 graduate of St. Thomas Aquinas High School, a private Catholic school in Dover.\n\n“Capt. Jack Casey gave his life while serving his country,\" Sununu said in a prepared statement. “Valerie and I are deeply saddened as we mourn the loss of these five Marines. Capt. Jack Casey’s death is a profound loss for his family, his community, New Hampshire, and the country. I have directed all flags on all public buildings and grounds in the state of New Hampshire to fly at half-staff on the day of interment.”\n\nCasey commissioned in the Marine Corps on May 16, 2019 and was promoted to the rank of captain on Sept. 1, 2023, according to Sununu's office. During his service, he was awarded the National Defense Service Medal.\n\nDover Mayor Bob Carrier offered his condolences to Casey's family.\n\n“I absolutely feel terrible. The Caseys are an old family name in the city of Dover,” he said Friday. “There are many, many Caseys and my heart goes out to the family. From the point of view of the city of Dover, it’s a tragic loss.”\n\nThe four other male Marines identified as victims of the crash were Lance Cpl. Donovan Davis, 21; Sgt. Alec Langen, 23; Capt. Benjamin Moulton, 27; and Capt. Miguel Nava, 28.\n\nThe Marine helicopter vanished late Tuesday night on its way back to Miramar air station in San Diego from Creech Air Force Base, the Associated Press reported. The craft was discovered Wednesday morning near the mountain community of Pine Valley.\n\nThe military confirmed Thursday that all five Marines were killed when their helicopter went down during stormy weather, and efforts were underway to recover their remains, which will take weeks because of the rough terrain and weather, said Col. James C. Ford, operations officer with 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. In the meantime, Marines are staying with the remains round-the-clock to adhere to their ethos of never leaving any Marine behind.\n\nThe military is investigating the crash.\n\nSt. Thomas Aquinas High School President Paul Marquis spoke about Casey Friday.\n\n“The entire STA community is saddened and heartbroken over the loss of Capt. Casey,” he said. “He meant a great deal to the community here. His entire family was part of Catholic education here on the Seacoast. He had his entire life ahead of him. He lived a life of service and mission to others, and it's so sad to see someone with such a bright future lose his life here at such a young age.”\n\nTeachers and school staff members who remember Casey swapped anecdotes about him on Friday, he said.\n\n“He was kind. He loved life. He really just had such a positive impact on everyone and even from just talking to some of the folks down at (Saint Mary Academy) where he went, we all just have shared such joyful stories,” Marquis added. “We certainly are offering our support and will be offering whatever we can to the family moving forward.”\n\nQiayra Randolph, who was classmates with Casey at St. Thomas, was stunned to hear of his death.\n\n“This devastating loss has left me speechless. Between his contagious energy and silly antics that made us all break out in laughter, I’ll remember him fondly,” she said. “My condolences to his family and everyone else who loved him. Jack will truly be missed.”\n\nFormer St. Thomas science teacher Bill Dinan said Friday he had been following news coverage of the Marines’ fatal crash but never expected to know one of the victims. Hearing Casey's name \"sadly really hit home,\" he said.\n\n“I remember Jack so fondly as a kid who always had a smile and a warm greeting for everyone. In my honors physics class he was a natural leader as well as a top student. He was a young man who had an unlimited future,\" Dinan said. \"The last time I saw Jack was a few years ago when he was in college. We bumped into each other on the street in Portsmouth and he was telling me how excited he was to get commissioned as an officer and serve his country.”\n\nSt. Mary Academy of Dover, a grades K-8 private Catholic school, issued a statement about the passing of Casey, who graduated in 2011.\n\n\"It is with heavy hearts that we inform our community of the passing of one of our former students, Jack Casey, while bravely serving our country as a member of the United States Marines,\" the school posted on its Facebook page. \"Jack was not only a dedicated student during his time with us but also a courageous individual who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our nation's freedoms. Jack’s unwavering commitment to service and bravery exemplifies the values we hold dear in our community.\"\n\n\"During this difficult time, our thoughts and deepest condolences go out to Jack's family, friends, and fellow Marines. We recognize the profound loss felt by all who knew and loved him, and we stand together in honoring his memory,\" the school's statement adds. \"May we never forget the sacrifice of Jack Casey and all those who have given their lives in service to our country.\"\n\nMore:Names of 5 Marines killed in California helicopter crash identified\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-New Hampshire, reacted to Casey's death on social media. \"I’m deeply saddened to hear of the loss of Capt. Jack Casey, a U.S. Marine from Dover,\" she said. \"My thoughts are with his family and loved ones as we honor his heroic service and sacrifice on behalf of our nation.\"\n\nOn Thursday, President Joe Biden shared that the military aircraft was traveling from Nevada to California in a routine mission.\n\n\"Our service members represent the very best of our nation—and these five Marines were no exception,\" Biden's statement read in part. \"Today, as we mourn this profound loss, we honor their selfless service and ultimate sacrifice—and reaffirm the sacred obligation we bear to all those who wear the uniform and their families.\"\n\nThe five Marines were all assigned to Miramar’s Marine Heavy Helicopter Squadron 361, Marine Aircraft Group 16, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing at Air Station Miramar in California.\n\n“We have been confronted with a tragedy that is every service family’s worst fear,” said Lt. Col. Nicholas J. Harvey, commanding officer of HMH-361. “Our top priority now is supporting the families of our fallen heroes, and we ask for your respect and understanding as they grieve. The Flying Tigers family stands strong and includes the friends and community who have supported our squadron during this challenging time. We will get through this together.”\n\nJack Casey's death preceded by other NH soldiers perishing in military training flights\n\nCasey is the second U.S. military service member from New Hampshire to die in a helicopter crash in three months. In November, Army Staff Sgt. Tanner Grone, a 25-year-old Gorham resident, was one of five service members who died aboard a UH-60 helicopter that crashed in the eastern Mediterranean Sea during an air refueling training mission.\n\nIn June 2022, Marine Corps Capt. Nicholas Losapio, an Exeter High School graduate who grew up in Kensington, was one of five Marines who died in a California aircraft crash, also as part of a training mission.\n\nUSA TODAY reported the CH-53E Super Stallion has been involved in several deadly incidents, in addition to the crash that took Casey's life.\n\nIn April 2018, four crew members were killed when their CH-53E Super Stallion crashed a few miles from the U.S.-Mexico border. The helicopter was also with the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing out of the Miramar air station in San Diego.\n\nTwo years earlier, 12 Marines died when two Super Stallion helicopters collided off the coast of Oahu in Hawaii. In 2005, 31 people died when a CH-53E crashed in Iraq during a sandstorm.\n\nRich Martindell, a former aircraft accident investigator in the Air Force, told USA TODAY the accident rate of CH-53 helicopters is more than double that of other Marine aircraft. He said that from 1984 to 2008, the CH-53 had an average of 5.96 accidents per 100,000 hours of flight, while other helicopters had an average of 2.26 per 100,000 hours.\n\nFatal crashes in helicopter training flights have been frequent across the U.S. military. The U.S. Government Accountability Office reported there were 298 Army and Air National Guard helicopter accidents in training flights from 2012 to 2021, and approximately 45 were deemed \"serious,\" meaning they involved death, permanent disability, extensive hospitalization or property damage of $500,000 or more. In April 2023, the Associated Press reported 14 soldiers had died and three were injured in a series of crashes in the first few months of last year.\n\nReporting from USA TODAY and the Associated Press is used in this story.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/20/us/oklahoma-botched-executions-history/index.html", "title": "Oklahoma, with a history of botched lethal injections, prepares to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nOklahoma will soon begin executing death row inmates at a pace of about one man per month, with plans to put to death 25 prisoners over the next two years despite cries by critics and experts who point not only to outstanding questions of the mental fitness or possible innocence of some but also the state’s recent history of botched lethal injections.\n\n“It’s just yet one more reckless move by Oklahoma,” Deborah Denno, a Fordham University law professor, told CNN of the state’s scheduled execution timetable, which she said is in line with its staunch, decadeslong record of capital punishment. “If there was going to be any state that was going to do something so obviously irresponsible and unjust … it would be the state of Oklahoma, given the history.”\n\nJames Coddington is the first scheduled to be executed on August 25. He would have been followed about a month later by Richard Glossip, who has maintained his innocence and on Tuesday got a 60-day stay of execution so an appeals court can complete its review of his petition for a new hearing.\n\nTwenty-three more men are set to be executed through 2024, and when the executions are complete, more than half the 43 inmates convicted and sentenced to death in Oklahoma are due to have been killed.\n\n“The family members of these loved ones have waited decades for justice,” Oklahoma Attorney General John O’Connor said, referring to the families of the condemned men’s victims, in a July 1 statement as the executions dates were set. “They are courageous and inspiring in their continued expressions of love for the ones they lost.\n\n“My office stands beside them as they take this next step in the journey that the murderers forced upon them,” he said.\n\n“Oklahomans overwhelmingly voted in 2016 to preserve the death penalty as a consequence for the most heinous murders,” the attorney general said. “I’m certain that justice and safety for all of us drove that vote.”\n\nOklahoma’s proposed series of executions follows similar sprees in Arkansas in 2017 and by the US government under the Trump administration. But experts say these undertakings are anomalies, standing in contrast to the continued decline of the death penalty in America in recent years.\n\nOklahoma’s execution docket is a particularly troubling prospect, given the state’s “recent history with capital punishment has been characterized by botched executions,” according to Death Penalty Information Center. While those can be cases in which an inmate suffers inordinately, experts use “botched” to describe any execution that deviates from officials’ prescribed protocol for a given method – what Austin Sarat, author of “Lethal Injection and the False Promise of Humane Execution,” said might be called “standard operating procedure.”\n\nAnd carrying out a series of death sentences in quick succession could raise the chances of a botched execution, experts said.\n\n“When a state or the federal government makes a commitment to execute people in bulk, to do it over a period of time in a way that doesn’t give it a lot of time to adjust to errors and problems, that political momentum is often hard to resist,” Sarat told CNN. It can encourage “a kind of carelessness … and Oklahoma is not a national model of scrupulousness in the world of lethal injection.”\n\nIn 2014, Oklahoma death row inmate Clayton Lockett writhed and moaned during his execution by lethal injection for 43 minutes before suffering a heart attack. Months later, witnesses reported Charles Warner said, “My body is on fire,” as he was put to death in the state. And last October, after a yearslong moratorium on the state’s death penalty spurred in part by the Warner case, John Grant convulsed and vomited on the gurney, per witnesses.\n\n“I think that the problems that were present when Lockett was executed remain present in Oklahoma today,” said Sarat, a professor of law and politics at Amherst College. “And the Grant execution is a testimony to that fact.”\n\nPointing to Lockett’s and Warner’s executions, a number of the inmates now slated for execution sued corrections officials in federal court, claiming in part that Oklahoma’s three-drug lethal injection protocol was unconstitutional. Midazolam, one of the drugs used in the protocol, would not render them adequately unconscious, they argued in part, and could put them at risk of severe pain as they died, violating their Eighth Amendment protection against “cruel and unusual punishments.”\n\nBut the judge ruled in June against the inmates, citing the US Supreme Court’s ruling in Bucklew v. Precythe, in which Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote the Eighth Amendment “does not guarantee a prisoner a painless death.”\n\nThe inmates’ attorneys responded with claims the judge had ignored “the overwhelming evidence presented at trial that Oklahoma’s execution protocol … creates an unacceptable risk that prisoners will experience severe pain and suffering.”\n\nOklahoma’s attorney general later that month requested the execution dates.\n\nA history of troubled executions\n\nLike most states, Oklahoma primarily uses lethal injection to carry out its executions. But today, the “very meaning of ‘lethal injection,’ or the thing that it designates, is now hard to specify from state to state,” said Sarat.\n\nAcross the country, “lethal injection” used to refer to a three-drug procedure: The first drug would put the prisoner to sleep, rendering him unconscious. The second caused paralysis, and the third would stop the heart. But about a decade ago, states began struggling to obtain the drugs they needed, after a US manufacturer stopped making the drug and European companies began withholding the chemicals so they wouldn’t be used in these procedures.\n\nAs a result, states have scrambled to find alternatives they can reliably obtain, resulting in what Denno described as a “constant experimentation with drugs.”\n\nMidazolam has been used as the first drug in several states’ fatal three-drug cocktails, even as critics long have argued it is a sedative – not a painkilling anesthetic – and can leave an inmate suffering immense pain during the execution, even if they look peaceful. Still, the US Supreme Court has upheld its use.\n\nOklahoma’s recent troubling incidents date to Lockett’s 2014 execution – the first time the state used midazolam as the first of its three-drug cocktail. The execution began with officials struggling for 51 minutes to place an IV line on his body to deliver the fatal drugs before placing the line in Lockett’s groin. The inmate then writhed and moaned on the gurney for 43 minutes before officials called off the execution. Lockett died anyway after he suffered a heart attack.\n\nThen-Gov. Mary Fallin, a Republican, halted executions while the state investigated what went wrong, and the state Department of Public Safety ultimately said the complications with the placement of the IV played a significant role in the execution’s problems.\n\nWarner was executed the following January. But months later, officials aborted an attempt to execute Glossip after they procured the wrong drug for his execution: potassium acetate instead of potassium chloride, the drug used to stop an inmate’s heart approved by the state’s protocol. Then it emerged officials had, in fact, used that drug to put Warner to death.\n\nFallin again halted executions and a grand jury again reviewed the execution protocol and recommended protocol revisions. Then, a bipartisan state commission recommended in 2017 the state extend the moratorium until it implemented “significant reforms,” including dozens of recommendations from a 294-page report that addressed everything from the drugs used to inmates’ innocence claims.\n\nThe state announced in 2020 it would resume executions, saying it had found a “reliable supply” of drugs and would use a revised protocol that included recommendations by the grand jury. That protocol still called for the use of midazolam.\n\nBut “virtually none” of the commission’s recommendations have been implemented, its cochairs, former Democratic Gov. Brad Henry and former magistrate judge Andy Lester, wrote last month in an op-ed for The Oklahoman. “Yet the state is barreling ahead,” they wrote, “with an unprecedented number of executions despite the numerous flaws in the implementation of the death penalty.”\n\nThe entrance to the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester Sue Ogrocki/AP\n\n‘Oklahoma is swimming upstream against the tide’\n\nThese issues and risks are not limited to Oklahoma: The execution just last month of Joe Nathan James in Alabama, for instance, has drawn wide scrutiny after a three-hour delay and a report in The Atlantic that he suffered. Indeed, between 1890 and 2010, 3% of all American executions were botched, with lethal injection showing the highest rate of any method at 7%, according to Sarat. Since 2010, the overall rate of botched executions has increased, he said, rising to 8% – and as high as 20% in executions in which a sedative, like midazolam, was used.\n\nOklahoma also is not the first jurisdiction in recent years to attempt a lengthy series of executions: In 2017, Arkansas moved to execute eight men in 11 days, though it ended up executing four. And the federal government after a nearly two-decade hiatus executed 13 inmates under the Trump administration between July 2020 and January 2021.\n\nThese sprees, though, are “anomalies,” said Sarat. The US is in a “period of a national reconsideration of capital punishment,” he said, as evidenced by declines in numbers of death sentences and executions and the growing number of states that have abolished the death penalty.\n\n“Oklahoma is swimming upstream against the tide across the country,” he said, “in which the death penalty is waning and in which the death penalty is increasingly discredited.”\n\nBut Oklahoma’s insistence on carrying out these executions reflects the stance it’s held toward the death penalty for decades, Denno said. It was the first state in the country and the first jurisdiction in the world to adopt lethal injection as its preferred execution method in 1977, developing a protocol soon adopted by states including Texas, which carried out the first execution by lethal injection in 1982.\n\nIt was also among the first to switch to midazolam, Denno said, when states began having problems obtaining drugs. And Oklahoma was the first state to allow nitrogen hypoxia as a potential method of execution – one that has never been used.\n\nTaken together, Oklahoma is a “state that will do anything to keep executions going, including trying to execute 25 people between August of 2022 and December of 2024,” she said. “It’s just one more chip in a state that stands out, perversely, really, in its efforts to engage in reckless adoptions” of execution methods and drugs.\n\n“There’s no question” that an execution spree would “enormously increase the risk” of a botched execution, Denno said. “How could they ever improve upon that with this many executions? It’s just going to be worse.”", "authors": ["Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/08/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/26/middleeast/iran-clashes-mahsa-amini-grave-intl/index.html", "title": "Mahsa Amini: Clashes break out as people mourn teen's death | CNN", "text": "CNN —\n\nClashes broke out throughout Iran Wednesday as thousands of people came to the burial site of Mahsa Amini in Saqqez, a city in the Kurdistan province, to mark 40 days since her death, semi-official Iranian state news agency ISNA said.\n\nProtests have swept through the Islamic Republic following the death of the 22-year-old Kurdish Iranian woman, who died on September 16 after being detained by “morality police” and taken to a “re-education center,” allegedly for not abiding by the country’s conservative dress code.\n\nNationwide protests took place in Iran on Wednesday to mark 40 days since Amini died, an important day of mourning in Iranian and Islamic tradition.\n\nThe unrest came on the same day that at least 15 people were killed and 10 others were injured in what appeared to be a terrorist attack at the Shahcheragh Shrine in the city of Shiraz, southern Iran. ISIS later claimed responsibility for the shrine attack, saying in a statement that one of its members had “targeted groups of Sunni refusal infidels inside the shrine with his machine gun.”\n\nThe state news agency ISNA said security forces “did not prevent” protesters from visiting Amini’s grave in Saqqez, which is also her birthplace, but reported that clashes took place after people left the site.\n\n“There were no clashes between mourners and police at the burial site, most were chanting Kurdish slogans, some moved towards the city with the intention of clashes, one of them raised the Kurdish flag,” ISNA said.\n\nIn videos shared on social media, large crowds of people and lines of cars are seen making their way to Saqqez’s Aichi cemetery where Amini is buried.

West Asia News Agency/Reuters\n\nDecades of repression\n\nAuthorities hope that by restricting the internet they can control the protests – the latest in a wave that has swept Iran in recent years. They started with the Green movement in 2009 over contested election results and more recently the 2019 protests sparked by a rise in fuel prices. Hundreds were believed to have been killed in the violent crackdown three years ago and thousands injured, according to estimates released by the UN and rights groups.\n\nBut this year’s protests are different – in their scope, scale and unprecedented feminist nature. There is also mobilization across the socio-economic divide. A young generation of Iranians are rising up on the streets against decades of repression – arguably bolder than ever.\n\nThe demonstrations have spread to dozens of Iranian cities, from the Kurdish region in the northwest, to the capital Tehran and even more traditionally conservative cities like Mashhad.\n\nWhile they were ignited by the death of Amini – the initial calls for accountability have turned into demands for more rights and freedoms, especially for women who for decades since the 1979 Islamic Revolution have faced discrimination and severe restrictions on their rights.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Iranian women open up about hijab law and morality police 01:13 - Source: CNN\n\nBut calls for regime change are growing too. People across the country are chanting for “death to the dictator,” in a reference to the Supreme Leader, tearing down portraits of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Remarkable images emerged on Friday night from Khamenei’s birthplace in the city of Mashhad, where protesters set fire to the statue of a man considered one of the symbols of the Islamic Revolution. Such scenes were unthinkable in the past.\n\nThis is all happening at a time when Iran’s hardline leadership is under growing pressure with talks to revive the stalled 2015 nuclear agreement and the state of the economy under US sanctions; ordinary Iranians are struggling to cope with soaring levels of inflation.\n\nWhile these protests are the biggest challenge for the government for years, analysts believe the government will likely move to contain them by resorting to the heavy-handed tactics it has used in the past. There are signs a brutal crackdown is coming, along with the internet restrictions on a level not seen since 2019. Other measures include the government mobilizing its supporters in mass rallies following Friday prayers; officials dismissing the demonstrators as rioters and foreign agents, and ominous warnings the army and powerful Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps will be deployed to deal with the protests.\n\nSpeaking with state broadcaster IRIB on Friday, Iran’s Minister of Communications Ahmad Vahidi said, “Until the riots end, the internet will have limitations. To prevent riot organization through social media, we are obliged to create internet limitations.”\n\nVahidi’s comments came after videos on social media showed scenes of public defiance, with women removing and burning their headscarves and demonstrators chanting such slogans as, “women, life, freedom.”\n\nThe move to further restrict the internet also followed a call by the United Nations for an independent investigation into Amini’s death and for Iran’s security forces to refrain from using “disproportionate force” on the protesters.\n\nOutrage over Amini’s death comes from public skepticism over the account given by state officials, who claim she died after suffering a “heart attack” and fell into a coma. But Amini’s family have said she had no pre-existing heart condition.\n\nAmini’s death has now become a symbol of the violent oppression women have faced in Iran for decades, and her name has spread around the globe, with world leaders invoking her even at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City this week.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on Thursday said UN experts strongly condemned the use of physical violence against women in Iran by state authorities.\n\n“Iranian authorities said (Amini) died of a heart attack, and claimed her death was from natural causes. However, some reports suggested that Amini’s death was a result of alleged torture and ill-treatment,” it said in a statement.\n\n“We call on the Iranian authorities to hold an independent, impartial, and prompt investigation into Ms Amini’s death, make the findings of the investigation public and hold all perpetrators accountable,” it added.\n\nInternet crackdown\n\nThe internet monitoring agency Netblocks said Friday Iranians are facing a third wave of “nation-scale” loss of mobile internet connectivity as the protests continue.\n\nThe watchdog group said earlier in the week that Iran was experiencing the most severe internet restrictions since 2019, with mobile networks largely shutdown and social networks Instagram and WhatsApp restricted in the country since protests began.\n\nTo circumvent internet blocks, Iranians both inside the country and in the diaspora are turning to popular Virtual Private Network (VPN) providers such as Tor Project and Hula VPN – the top downloaded apps available in Iran via Google Play Store, a marketplace for Android smartphone users to download apps, according to monitoring service AppBrain.\n\nHowever, Netblocks has warned that the kind of internet disruption seen currently in the country “cannot generally be worked around with the use of circumvention software or VPNs.”\n\nSimilar internet restrictions took place in Iran in November 2019, taking Iranians almost entirely offline as authorities tried to curb the spread of nationwide protests over fuel prices.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Violent crackdown doesn't slow protest against Iran's morality police 02:35 - Source: CNN\n\nOracle’s Internet Intelligence called it at the time the “largest internet shutdown ever observed in Iran.”\n\nMeanwhile, Internet activist hacker group Anonymous has also targeted the Iranian government online over the past week, announcing several breaches of government websites on Thursday.\n\nUsing the hashtag #OpIran, short for Operation Iran, which started gaining traction on social media following the death of Amini, Anonymous also tweeted Thursday that the organization was successful in hacking more than 1,000 CCTV Iranian cameras – a claim CNN has not been able to independently confirm.\n\nUN calls for investigation\n\nUN Secretary General António Guterres said Friday he was “concerned about reports of peaceful protests being met with excessive use of force leading to dozens of deaths and injuries.”\n\n“We call on the security forces to refrain from using unnecessary or disproportionate force and appeal to all to exercise restraint to avoid further escalation,” Dujarric said at the daily briefing on UNTV.\n\nThe UN said it’s closely following the protests in Iran and called on authorities to “respect the right to freedoms of expression, peaceful assembly and association.”\n\n“We also call on the authorities to respect women’s rights and to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women and girls and implement effective measures to protect them from other human rights violations, in accordance with international standards.”\n\nGuterres reiterated a call from the Acting High Commissioner for Human Rights for a prompt investigation into the death of Amini by an “independent competent authority.”\n\nIran’s Interior Minister denied Mahsa Amini was beaten up, citing investigations into the incident, the country’s state news agency, IRNA, reported Saturday.\n\n“The results of observations, talking with those who were on the scene, receiving reports from relevant bodies and other investigations showed that late Ms. Amini was not beaten, Iranian Interior Minister Ahmad Vahidi told (Iran’s state broadcaster) IRIB,” IRNA reported.\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi called Amini’s family saying he had ordered the incident to be investigated carefully so that no rights would be violated, according to IRNA. He said during his trip to the UNGA in New York last week that early coroner’s findings found no signs of beating.\n\nAfter returning to Iran follow his trip to the UNGA in New York, Raisi also called the family of a Basij member, a volunteer paramilitary group connected to the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, who was killed during protests in Mashhad, according to his official website.\n\nIn the statement released by his office, Raisi expressed his condolences to the family of Rasool Doust Mohammadi, the Basij member, and said there is a “need to distinguish between protest and disruption of public order and security,” while also describing the protests “as rioting and evil.”", "authors": ["Artemis Moshtaghian Jomana Karadsheh Caitlin Hu Kathleen Magramo Sahar Akbarzai Richard Roth", "Artemis Moshtaghian", "Jomana Karadsheh", "Caitlin Hu", "Kathleen Magramo", "Sahar Akbarzai", "Richard Roth"], "publish_date": "2022/09/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/22/middleeast/iran-president-ebrahim-raisi-christiane-amanpour-intl/index.html", "title": "Iran's President abandons CNN interview after Amanpour declines ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nIranian President Ebrahim Raisi withdrew from a long-planned interview with CNN’s chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on Wednesday, after she declined a last-minute demand to wear a head scarf.\n\nSome 40 minutes after the interview was scheduled due to start and with Raisi running late, an aide told Amanpour the president had suggested that she wear a head scarf. Amanpour said that she “politely declined.”\n\nAmanpour, who grew up in the Iranian capital Tehran and is a fluent Farsi speaker, said that she wears a head scarf while reporting in Iran to comply with the local laws and customs, “otherwise you couldn’t operate as a journalist.” But she said that she would not cover her head to conduct an interview with an Iranian official outside a country where it is not required.\n\n“Here in New York, or anywhere else outside of Iran, I have never been asked by any Iranian president – and I have interviewed every single one of them since 1995 – either inside or outside of Iran, never been asked to wear a head scarf,” she said on CNN’s “New Day” program Thursday.\n\n“I very politely declined on behalf of myself and CNN, and female journalists everywhere because it is not a requirement.”\n\nIranian law requires all women to wear a head covering and loose-fitting clothing in public.

He referred to it as “a matter of respect,” given that it is the holy months of Muharram and Safar, and referred to “the situation in Iran,” alluding to the protests sweeping the country, she added.\n\nAnti-government protests erupted across Iran last week over the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini while in custody, after having been arrested by Iran’s morality police on an accusation of violating the law on head scarves.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Mahsa Amini's family demands truth about her death in police custody 03:20 - Source: CNN\n\nThousands of people have taken to streets, with some women cutting their hair and burning their hijabs in protest against the law. Human rights groups have reported that at least eight people have been killed in the demonstrations, which have been met with a sharp crackdown by authorities, according to witnesses and videos shared on social media.\n\nThe demonstrations appear to be the most large-scale displays of defiance against the Islamic Republic’s rule, one which has become more stringent since the election of Raisi’s hard-line government last year. After eight years of Hassan Rouhani’s moderate administration, Iran elected Raisi, an ultra-conservative judiciary chief whose views are in line with the thinking of the country’s powerful clergy and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nIn Iran, the head scarf is a potent symbol of a set of personal rules imposed by the country’s clerical leaders, which govern what people can wear, watch and do. Over the past decade, protests have flared as many Iranians have grown resentful of those limitations.\n\nAmini’s death has fueled an outpouring of long-simmering anger over restrictions on personal freedoms. Surveys and reports in recent years have shown an increasing number of Iranians do not believe the hijab, or head scarf, should be mandatory.\n\nIranian officials have claimed Amini died after suffering a “heart attack” and falling into a coma, but her family have said she had no pre-existing heart condition, according to Emtedad news, an Iranian pro-reform media outlet.

A wreath-laying will be held at his grave site.\n\n“Today, we remember my father’s death,\" said Bernice King, CEO of The King Center in Atlanta. \"But most importantly, we must remember the purpose and power of his life.\"\n\nIn Washington, a single bouquet of spring flowers stood sentry at the base of the 30-foot monument along the picturesque Tidal Basin as the diverse crowd waved signs and banners demanding an end to racism in America.\n\nSaundra Lucas, an African-American woman wearing a shirt reading “I will end racism NOW,” said she traveled from Oklahoma to honor the occasion, remember King’s legacy and to inspire others to continue his mission. Lucas, 74, said she used the trip to reflect on the day of King's death.\n\n“It was a sad, sad day,\" Lucas said. \"It was a day that seemed like all hope was gone.\"\n\nKing's death shocked the world and set off riots in more than 100 U.S. cities. Lucas said she has been hopeful seeing a new generation, especially student survivors of a school shooting in Parkland, Fla., picking up the reins and standing up to those in power.\n\n\"There’s been an awakening,\" Lucas said. \"His spirit has been awakened in this new generation.”\n\nThe crowd started the silent march by filing past the King monument. Absent were the familiar chants and calls for justice. The marchers were led down Independence Avenue by a booming drum line.\n\nKing was a Baptist minister, but many faiths were represented — Sikh, Jewish, Muslim, Christian. All talked about discrimination and spreading love. The Rev. Molly Carlson, who came from Portland, Ore., despite a cast on her right foot, said she planned to march and rally with her teenage son in hopes of standing up against bigotry.\n\n“Racism is at the core of many of our country’s issues,” said Carlson, who is white. “We need to stand up for a just world, one where all people are not only created equal but treated that way.”\n\nThe anniversary comes amid a resurgence in white nationalist movements and after a series of fatal shootings of unarmed black men by police officers, including one in Sacramento on March 18. Shirley Paulson and other members of her church, Christian Science, walked and talked about what they hoped would be the start of a movement.\n\n“Historically, many churches were divided on the issue of race,” Paulson said. “That isn’t going to be part of our future.”\n\nRajwant Singh, founder of the National Sikh Campaign to promote better understanding of his religion, said he immigrated to the U.S. from India 35 years ago for a better future for his family.\n\n“We’ve enjoyed the freedoms of America, and while there are so many amazing opportunities, there is also a dark side,” he said wearing orange garments and a bright yellow turban. “Our skin color makes people think we’re terrorists. This bigotry affects people of all color. We can’t allow it to continue.”\n\nEvents were not limited to cities closely associated with King. Rep. John Lewis, an icon of the civil rights movement, headlined an event in Indianapolis in and around Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Park.\n\nThe 78-year-old congressman talked about the Freedom Riders, voter registration for blacks in the South during the 1960s and about meeting with King, who called him \"the boy from Troy.\"\n\n\"Stand up, speak up and get in good trouble,\" Lewis told his young audience.\n\nThe NAACP sponsored an event in Paterson, N.J., where King visited on March 27, 1968, to raise money and awareness of the Poor People's Campaign. It would be his last appearance in the North.\n\nCharley Mae Garrison was in the choir that day and remembers the song she sang, Holding On (And I Won't Let Go My Faith).\n\n\"He was very kind,\" she said. \"He was talking about the things we need to do in our neighborhood and what young people need to do to walk a straight line and stay out of trouble.\"\n\nContributing: Jennifer Biggs, Robert King and Richard Cowen, The USA TODAY NETWORK", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/04/04"}]}

To block what a court order said should be the imminent eviction, by giant government-sponsored lender Fannie Mae, of the lifelong Detroiter.\n\nYet, after a string of court hearings and Free Press coverage last year, the two sides met outside the courtroom in February. And last week, a lawyer from the activist group Detroit Eviction Defense said he’d reached a quiet settlement with a local law firm representing Fannie Mae. Whitfield now owns the house free and clear.\n\nWhitfield, now 57, had inherited her mother’s house, only to find that she’d also inherited a reverse mortgage, a form of loan that consumer experts say too often means that unsuspecting heirs find themselves unhoused after a parent dies. Her mother's loan ultimately accrued a balance due Fannie Mae of nearly $60,000 — on a house appraised at about $9,000.\n\nReverse mortgages safer now but still have pitfalls\n\n“Lela owns the house now, free and clear,” Whitfield’s pro bono attorney Matthew Clark said. He said he and Whitfield were so concerned about not violating a confidentiality agreement in the deal that both had been reluctant to discuss it. Whitfield declined to be photographed at the house to which she now holds the title. Her only comment was a statement she crafted last week with her lawyer:\n\n“I am very happy to be in my home and am thankful for the great work of Detroit Eviction Defense.”\n\nA deed recorded at Wayne County offices in Detroit shows that Whitfield paid $2,500 for the house on Manistique, just blocks from the mansions of Grosse Pointe Park. Equally reluctant to speak was the lawyer from Trott & Trott, a Farmington Hills-based law firm that represented Fannie Mae in the case.\n\n“The deed says what it says,” said attorney Kevin Hammons, who specializes in foreclosure cases.\n\nTo some, Whitfield’s story is a simple tale of a low-income homeowner at the mercy of an unyielding lender. To others, it’s the more complex story of a homeowner who, court records show, failed to use consumer protections and seek legal help quickly after she inherited the heavily mortgaged house.\n\nA key point in the deal the two sides finally worked out, after more than two years of court hearings, was that Whitfield was able to stay put throughout the negotiations, preventing the house from being ruined by scrappers, as she and her neighbors said they feared on Detroit’s gritty far-east side. For most of the two years of court hearings, attorneys for the lender argued that Whitfield would need to vacate the property — citing a rule by HUD, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which administered insurance on the mortgage — before any arrangement could be made for her to purchase the house. They argued, and documented, that she had missed deadlines for buying back the house that would've allowed her to settle without moving out.\n\nBut Whitfield's lawyer found a loophole in the HUD rules that provided for \"exceptions\" to the move-out rule in her case. Now, he and the other anti-eviction activists said they’re seeking a broad statement from HUD that would apply nationwide, allowing those trying to buy back houses from Fannie Mae to stay in their homes while negotiating, instead of moving out only to move back after making the purchase. Queried by the Free Press in March, HUD spokeswoman Gina Rodriquez confirmed: “FHA does not require that these properties to be vacated for an insurance claim to be filed.\"\n\nThough housing prices are bouncing back nationwide and Michigan’s foreclosure rate is plummeting, numerous metro Detroiters remain at risk of losing their homes. Across Wayne County, about 19,000 properties face property-tax foreclosures this year, said Eric Sabree, appointed earlier this month as the new Wayne County treasurer.\n\n“The main thing we’re focusing on right now is trying to get folks who are homeowners or owner-occupants to get into the interest reduction payment plan,\" a temporary exception to the state law that mandates 18% on protracted tax arrearages, Sabree said. The reduced-interest plan, under state law, ends June 30, \"so we’ve got about two months to help people take advantage of the lower interest rate” on unpaid property taxes,\" he said.\n\nThe storm of about 70,000 mortgage foreclosures in metro Detroit during the Great Recession of 2008-2012 has largely wound down. But there remain isolated cases worth fighting for, said Steve Babson, a retired labor studies instructor at Wayne State University and an activist with Detroit Eviction Defense\n\n\"Just because there aren't as many now isn't the point. The people we work with are still facing eviction,\" said Babson, 67, of Detroit.\n\nContact Bill Laitner: 313-223-4485 or blaitner@freepress.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2014/09/09/longview-terrace-owner-facing-foreclosure/15350413/", "title": "Longview Terrace owner facing foreclosure", "text": "Adam Rodewald\n\nUSA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin\n\nCountry Healthcare Inc. must find new financing or sell its facilities to avoid foreclosure.\n\nOwner Debra Tegge owes Anchor Bank more than %242 million.\n\nState regulators shut down Tegge%27s Longview Terrace facility after finding abuse and neglect.\n\nAnchor Bank claims Tegge%27s company is %22in imminent danger of insolvency.%22\n\nThe owner of Longview Terrace, the troubled assisted living home shut down earlier this year for abusing and neglecting residents, is facing foreclosure of her three remaining facilities.\n\nCountry Healthcare Inc. owner Debra Tegge has four months to sell the properties or find alternative financing to pay off her $2.1 million debt, according to a stipulation agreement made with her lender, Anchor Bank.\n\nThe facilities facing foreclosure include Longview Terrace II in Suamico, Country House in Oconto and Woodhaven Manor in Pulaski.\n\nAnchor Bank believes Tegge's facilities \"are insolvent or are in imminent danger of insolvency,\" according to an affidavit filed in Brown County Court by the bank's vice president and senior special assets manager, Stephen Rice.\n\nTegge has not made any payments since the loan became due on June 1, and interest continues accruing at rate of $387 per day, according to the affidavit.\n\nState regulators were not aware of the impending foreclosure until contacted by Press-Gazette Media.\n\n\"We will be following up on this with the licensee (Tegge) to obtain more information about this filling, monitor this situation and follow up as needed to protect health, safety and welfare of the residents,\" said Claire Smith, spokeswoman for the state Department of Health Services Division of Quality Assurance.\n\nIf foreclosed on, Tegge would be responsible for relocating residents. State statutes would require Tegge to seek the state's approval of that plan. Relocation wouldn't be required if there is a change of ownership.\n\nTegge originally borrowed $2.5 million in May 2005, and she had only paid down about $500,000 in principal, according to court filings.\n\nAttorney Jon Anderson, who is representing Tegge, said \"prospects are very positive\" that Tegge will secure another loan to pay off her debt to Anchor Bank.\n\nAnderson declined to elaborate on those prospects, saying sources of funding are confidential.\n\nAnchor Bank's attorney Norm Farnam, said the bank agreed to give Tegge extra time to secure a new loan.\n\n\"We are working with the borrower for her to obtain financing elsewhere. That's our goal,\" Farnam said.\n\nAccording to the foreclosure filings, Anchor Bank cited Press-Gazette Media investigations into abuse and neglect at Tegge's facilities when arguing in court that she wasn't capable of paying her debts.\n\nRegulators documented physical and mental abuse of residents at Longview Terrace I in Suamico at the hands of former administrator Jason Tegge, a sex offender and Debra Tegge's son. Staff at her other facilities forcibly restrained residents, drugged them, cut cords off their call lights and left frail elderly patients alone with violent residents, according to state inspection reports.\n\nTegge responded by hiring an outside management firm, Madison-based Arete Senior Concepts, to oversee daily operations. But the owners of that company, mother and son duo Delores and Jonathan Moyer, sold off their own assisted living chain after the state found them to be neither fit nor qualified to continue operating between 2006 and 2010.\n\nAt that time, a federal investigation determined the Moyers provided worthless services to Medicaid recipients after investigators found abuse and neglect linked to resident deaths at several facilities. They were ultimately ordered to pay back $258,000 in 2010.\n\nTegge and Jonathan Moyer previously claimed to have an agreement that Tegge would sell her facilities to Moyer. They had said they anticipated finalizing the deal on June 1, the same day Tegge's debt became due.\n\nThe sale has not happened.\n\n—arodewal@pressgazettemedia.com and find him on Twitter @AdamGRodewald.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2014/09/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/local/2021/07/14/swfl-man-holding-up-sale-naples-beach-hotel-no-stranger-legal-battles/7901788002/", "title": "Naples resident holding up sale of Naples Beach Hotel is no ...", "text": "In late May, Gregory Myers' last-minute lawsuit filed in Collier Circuit Court stopped the looming sale of the 125-acre property in its tracks.\n\nIn the suit, Myers, a close neighbor, questions the right of the proposed buyers — the Athens Group — to pursue their ambitious plans without his input or approval.\n\nThis much is known: He's no stranger to the court system, or arguing his own legal case, and he's faced financial woes for years.\n\nNaples resident Gregory Myers has thrust himself into the spotlight with a legal challenge involving the long-anticipated redevelopment of the landmark Naples Beach Hotel.\n\nIn late May, his last-minute lawsuit filed in Collier Circuit Court stopped the looming sale of the 125-acre property in its tracks.\n\nIn the suit, Myers, a close neighbor, questions the right of the proposed buyers — the Athens Group — to pursue their ambitious plans without his input or approval.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/07/27/weco-coffee-shop-building-faces-sheriffs-sale/472931001/", "title": "York coffee shop building faces sheriff's sale", "text": "Brett Sholtis\n\nYork Daily Record\n\nThe building that houses the former New Grounds Roasting Company is up for sale again, this time for its owner's failure to pay on the building's mortgage and liens, according to the York County Sheriff's Office.\n\nThe property, 282-284 W.

He did not return phone messages from the State Journal this week.\n\nThe hotel's sale would end a unique partnership between its overseas owner, Alvin Peh of Singapore, and the nonprofit.\n\nThe group has been a constant presence at the Magnuson, located off South Pennsylvania Avenue just north of Interstate 96, for the last few years.\n\nHomeless Angels maintains a second-floor office at the hotel, where they keep donated food and hygiene supplies. The group works with an average of 40 homeless families housed there at any given time. Their rooms are paid for through donations.\n\nIf the hotel's ownership changes hands, Karl said it's likely the homeless families staying there will end up back on the streets.\n\nHe said if his nonprofit doesn't want to see that happen it has no choice but to raise the money needed to buy it now.\n\n\"If the Magnuson Hotel goes down where are all these families we've been housing going to go?\" Karl said.\n\nLooming financial issues\n\nThe hotel is valued at $1.6 million but is mired in tax issues.\n\nThe county could foreclose on the Magnuson by March 31 of 2017 if Peh fails to pay more than $107,000 in delinquent property taxes from 2013 and 2014, Ingham County Treasurer Eric Schertzing said.\n\nThe property will go into forfeiture, a year-long process, if those taxes aren't paid by March 1, he said. Another $37,452 in taxes for 2015 are due next month as well.\n\nThe State Journal has been unable to contact Peh. Yingtao Xiao, the hotel's regional manager, did not return phone calls this week from the State Journal.\n\nKarl said he's only spoken to Peh a few times in the last two years but he believes the unpaid taxes are driving his effort to sell the hotel.\n\n\"That's the urgency for him,\" he said. \"I think he really just wants to sell it.\"\n\nSchertzing said if the county forecloses on the property next spring allowing it to remain occupied could be problematic, although leases are sometimes negotiated after a foreclosure.\n\n\"Often, the easier way for me to deal with that is to close the building down, go through an eviction process and make sure everyone is out of the building,\" he said.\n\nTypically, foreclosed properties are then sold at auction to the highest bidder.\n\nKarl said he doesn't want to see the hotel reach foreclosure.\n\nHomeless Angels has invested considerable manpower and resources into cleaning up rooms at the property that were previously uninhabitable.\n\nXiao confirmed in November that more than 20 rooms have been re-opened, thanks to a Homeless Angels effort to rehab them.\n\nLinda Karl, Mike's mother and a member of the Homeless Angels' Board of Directors, said that rehab effort will continue while the nonprofit raises money to buy the property.\n\nShe isn't surprised it's for sale but said she doesn't believe it's worth the listing price. The kitchen isn't functional, she said, and the roof needs major repairs.\n\n\"The whole building needs major repairs, and we're working one room at a time to correct that,\" Linda said. \"It's perfect for what we do but it's certainly not an ideal location for a fancy hotel.\"\n\nPreparing for the worst\n\nMore than 30 of the hotel's homeless are children, Linda said.\n\n\"Absolutely we want to own it because most of them will have nowhere to go without the hotel,\" she said.\n\nAccording to documents filed with the Internal Revenue Service last year, the Homeless Angels spent just under $10,000 of its $28,000 budget to house homeless people in 2014.\n\nKarl admits the nonprofit would need to generate more donations annually to maintain the hotel.

Amid heaters that will never blow warm again and lights that have surrendered to perpetual darkness, at least one piece of equipment is still plugging away.\n\nThe danger of fire is a very real worry. Bad enough when the corridors and rooms buzzed with people going about their lives, fire started by a vandal or camper is the biggest concern now. An environmental study of 50 Front St. found asbestos and other nasty things that would cost $2 million to abate. In light of that, an unchecked blaze would be \"a tragedy\" that would harm the whole neighborhood, Duncan said.\n\nThe debris inside ranges from the dangerous to the incongruous. There's the Price Chopper shopping cart on the sixth floor, filled to the brim with cassette tapes. There's the crucifix on an end table in the basement, beside a tape of the Blue Ridge Quartet (\"The sweetest singing this side of heaven\"). There's the bike in a shadowy corner entombed in a quarter-inch of fine grey dust.\n\nProperties like 50 Front St. are ideal for the land bank to tackle. They give the community a bigger say in what happens to a property than in, for example, a tax-foreclosure auction.\n\n\"If you were to simply auction this off, you wonder whether that buyer really knows what they're getting into,\" Martin said.\n\nAn expensive obstacle\n\nRooms seem frozen at some moment just after the inhabitants left. A carefully made bed supports a face-down television, with 1990s issues of Architectural Digest scattered around. Suit separates still hang in a closet, while one bathroom still contains neatly arranged toiletries. Squint, and parts of the upper floors could be mistaken for a shabby-but-servicable hotel.\n\nThe difference between the basement and the top floor of 50 Front St. is more than night and day, it's also a move from problem to potential. The basement, home to the old studio for WBNG-TV as well as the now-frozen machinery that was once the beating heart of the building, is a dark and still affair. At the top, windows look out on the West Side and the Chenango, with Downtown Binghamton beyond.\n\nThis is the sort of view in a location that developers covet. As it stands now, 50 Front St. — and its multi-million-dollar cleanup costs — is an obstacle.\n\nThe land bank is awaiting the result of an application through the Regional Economic Development Council that would fund demolition. It's asking for $3 million in state funds, and is expected to leverage almost $21 million in private investment and create 75 construction jobs.\n\nWord on the application could come within weeks. Martin and Duncan said it they were successful, the wrecking ball could swing swiftly.\n\nBefore that, though, teams would go through the building to salvage what can be salvaged, recycle what can be recycled, and toss what must be tossed.\n\nUntil that time, 50 Front St. remains a place for ghosts and memories.\n\nFollow John R.

But in May, the older woman she cared for died from COVID, Nanton said.\n\nSo she searched for new jobs, called charity numbers, went to the food pantry to feed herself and her two kids. She couldn’t reach anyone in the unemployment office, and her daughter was denied food stamps, she said. She also had to cope with the recent deaths of her sister and mother.\n\nHer landlord kept asking her to pay — or leave. The landlord needed a tenant who could pay rent so she could cover her mortgage. By the end of July, Nanton's landlord filed an eviction notice, since she owed more than $10,000.\n\n“I feel really, really helpless,” Nanton said recently as she shed tears. “I have nowhere to go that I can afford.”\n\nNew Jersey renters like Nanton can’t be kicked out of their homes, even if they miss rent payments, under a COVID eviction moratorium Gov. Phil Murphy signed in March — at least for now.\n\nBut tenants and advocates fear what could happen when that protection expires. They predict a tidal wave of evictions numbering in the hundreds of thousands if financial aid or legal help isn’t made available to renters in a state where 1.8 million people have applied for unemployment since mid-March.\n\nWhat happens next?:Wayne loses affordable-housing immunity\n\nNew rules:New Jersey to lower gathering limits as COVID cases rise\n\nNJ housing:Why these 10 New Jersey towns are the state's hottest housing markets right now\n\nA bill designed to provide a cushion for paying back rent, nicknamed “the People’s Bill,” has lagged in the Legislature since April, and lawmakers have only two scheduled voting sessions left this year. And landlords associations have pushed back against the bill, saying lawmakers should wait to see what relief the new Biden administration may offer.\n\nThe bill does not require rent forgiveness, or provide money to help renters pay back their landlords — measures that will be necessary for those who can’t make up the thousands they owe in back rent, experts say. And only 13% of 60,000 applicants won state rental relief through a recent lottery program.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress has so far failed to pass new stimulus measures that include emergency rental assistance.\n\n“Having more time to pay back rent is great, but it’s not going to be enough,” said Amy Albert, a staff attorney with the Waterfront Project, a legal services nonprofit working to prevent evictions and foreclosures in Hudson County. “And the programs that the state has done so far have been a lottery system. ‘We’ll pay your rent if you win the lottery.’ It’s too uncertain. It’s tough.”\n\nUnder New Jersey’s eviction moratorium, landlords can still jump-start the eviction process and be ready to kick out non-paying tenants the day the moratorium ends. It will expire two months after the end of the state’s “public health emergency,” a period that Murphy continually renews each month. Landlords have filed more than 45,600 eviction notices with courts from March through October, according to the Administrative Office of the Courts.\n\n\"And our data only cover court filings — they do not include experiences of illegal or informal evictions, which we estimate occur at double the rate of legal eviction filings,\" said Alieza Durana, with Princeton University's Eviction Lab.\n\nLandlords and tenants can also go through a mediation process or come to an agreement or settlement.\n\nBefore Nanton received help from the Waterfront Project, she agreed to a deal she did not understand. She gave her landlord $1,000, most of what she had been able to save. In exchange, she would agree to leave the apartment by Oct. 31.\n\nShe did not know about the eviction moratorium, had nowhere else to go and had only a month to figure it out. Albert, her lawyer, filed a motion to cancel the agreement, enabling Nanton to remain in her home, trying to find a solution. Her family keeps suitcases and plastic containers packed with their belongings, ready to go just in case.\n\nIt’s an undesirable situation for both sides, since small landlords who depend on rental income to cover their mortgage, property taxes and other expenses are not being paid, and they cannot displace current tenants for others who could make payments.\n\n“This bill shifts the burden from one impacted group of people to another — small landlords and homeowners — and provides no meaningful financial assistance to them,” said David Brogan, executive director of the New Jersey Apartment Association. “This incentivizes non-payment in rent, so how are landlords supposed to afford their insurance, property taxes, utilities, maintaining the building and keeping food on the table?”\n\nAs of mid-September, 330,000 to 480,000 of New Jersey’s 1.2 million renters were at risk of eviction, according to a study by the business management consultant Stout for the National Council of State Housing Agencies.\n\nBy January of next year, the Garden State could see 280,000 eviction filings, with a rent shortfall of up to $1.3 billion, the Stout study predicted.\n\nA stalled first step\n\nThe People’s Bill, which has gone through many iterations since April, requires that landlords and financially strapped tenants come to a payback agreement. It includes a default plan: Renters have six months to pay back one month of missed rent in six equal installments. If a tenant missed five months of rent or more, they have 2½ years to repay it all.\n\nThe legislation also includes an incentive for small landlords to forgive missed rent by offering them an income tax write-off.\n\nAnd the bill addresses homeowners who are landlords and fell behind on their mortgage payments because they lost the revenue from rent, by providing a form of mortgage forbearance.\n\n“If we don’t act, we’re going to see mass waves of homelessness starting with tenants, and then landlords will go to court to recoup their losses, and good luck recovering funds from a person who is homeless,” said the bill’s sponsor, Assemblywoman Britnee Timberlake, D-Essex. “The New Jersey Apartment Association has been delaying this bill from the beginning. Every other day it’s a new argument.”\n\nLandlords associations say the bill will have the unintended consequence of shifting the tax burden onto homeowners who are not landlords. They argue that if tenants don’t pay their rent, the owners of multifamily properties will file tax appeals to lower their property tax payments, since the properties are valued by their net operating income. If those tax assessments are lowered, then property taxes could rise for non-landlord homeowners to make up the difference, if the state or federal government doesn’t provide assistance.\n\n“It’s not the People’s Bill, it’s the tenants' bill,” said Derek Reed, past president of the Property Owners Association. “It doesn’t speak for housing providers and doesn’t speak for the homeowners who will see a huge shift in property taxes.”\n\nCOVID housing relief:What would the stalled 'People's Bill' do for homeowners, renters?\n\nNJ bill: Measure to protect judges goes to Gov. Phil Murphy\n\nNJ housing:How much can $600,000 buy you in North Jersey's overheated housing market?\n\nNow the ball is in the Senate’s court, and the chamber’s leader, Steve Sweeney, D-Gloucester, said he thinks the bill still has problems.\n\n“We want to help the people, but landlords are people, too,” Sweeney said. “There’s a sweet spot to it, but we’re not there yet. But we’re working towards it.”\n\nSweeney said he would put the bill up for a vote in December if “we could get some kind of commonality.”\n\nExisting relief and what’s needed\n\nIn addition to the ban on evictions and foreclosures, New Jersey cobbled together grants and policies to temporarily help tenants and landlords navigate the federal aid they received so far. But the need for help is still great.\n\nThe state set up a $100 million rental assistance program to provide up to six months of rent to New Jerseyans, chosen through a lottery system. Of the more than 60,000 who applied, only 8,000 households will receive the financial aid.\n\nIn October, the state put aside another $12 million in federal CARES Act funds for rental or mortgage assistance, and counties are creating their own relief programs with federal dollars. New Jersey also opened up a $15 million program for landlords who forgave tenants’ missed rent payments, nowhere near the $1.3 billion rent shortfall Stout predicted.\n\nUnder an executive order Murphy signed in April, tenants can use their security deposits and the accrued interest on those deposits to pay rent, which must be paid back to the landlord six months after a public health emergency or at the end of the lease, whichever is later.\n\nBut these programs barely scratch the surface of the need faced by people at risk of being displaced.\n\n“New Jersey can’t, by itself, with its constitutional limitations of creating money, provide full rental assistance, which is why we’re supporting the People’s Bill,” said Staci Berger, president of the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey, an association of nonprofit housing and community development groups. “It buys time for the federal government to get its act together and give us the relief we need with the HEROES Act.”\n\nThe $3.4 billion federal HEROES Act — which House Democrats passed in May and which stalled in the Republican-controlled Senate — includes a $100 billion emergency rental assistance program and a $75 billion homeowner fund aimed to prevent foreclosures.\n\nSteps to protect tenants\n\nLandlord tenant court is confusing and complicated in non-pandemic times, and most tenants aren’t represented by a lawyer. Renters often agree to settlements they can’t afford to make, don’t understand or felt pressured into taking, said Albert, with the Waterfront Project.\n\nThe New Jersey Pandemic Relief Fund, a nonprofit chaired by first lady Tammy Murphy, is offering a $2.35 million grant to pay for counseling and pro-bono legal work to help tenants facing eviction.\n\nBut more is needed to represent the thousands who fear losing their rental space, experts say, and New Jersey can do more by following the lead of other states that have taken key steps to protect tenants.\n\nA coalition of lawyers and housing groups urged in June that New Jersey should join 14 states that require landlords to submit a certification and other evidence that attest they are allowed to start eviction filings. They also pointed out that 19 states don’t allow eviction filings for non-payment because of a COVID-related hardship.\n\n\"That's one hole in New Jersey's moratorium, that landlords can still file,\" said Matt Mleczko, with Princeton's Eviction Lab. \"A filing can still be really, really harmful to a renter’s credit history or ability to obtain affordable housing in the future.\"\n\nAnnis Nanton, meanwhile, keeps searching for a steady job that will pay for her expenses. She has cobbled together sporadic child care jobs, but the pay varies depending on how many days her clients need her. It’s not close to what she made as a home health aide.\n\nShe struggles to find a new place she can afford.\n\nShe likes Jersey City. It’s quiet, and the people are kind. She began visiting the United States in 1986 from her home in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. She found work in Brooklyn and later Hoboken, and then moved into her current home in 2019.\n\nShe’s stashing away $100 here, $50 there, from her child care work. She enjoys baking sweet coconut bread and banana bread that people enjoy so much they pay her for it.\n\n“I don’t like to owe anyone anything,” Nanton said. “I like to work. Once I get a steady job and get back on my feet, I know I will be able to do the things to help myself.”\n\nStaff Writer Stacey Barchenger contributed to this article.\n\nAshley Balcerzak is a reporter in the New Jersey Statehouse.

Celebrities such as 90-year-old “Star Trek” actor William Shatner and “Good Morning America” co-host Michael Strahan followed soon after. Another billionaire self-funded a historic, three-day mission aboard a SpaceX orbital capsule that flew higher than any human has traveled in decades.\n\nAnd all that promises to just be the beginning.\n\nThe trio of space billionaires — Branson, Bezos and Elon Musk — have their eyes set squarely on the future. Over the past year, their visions continued to bump up against one another, stirring up plenty of controversy and one-upmanship.\n\nHere’s a look back at some of the most memorable moments the commercial space industry had to offer in the last year.\n\nBranson v. Bezos\n\nBranson’s and Bezos’ space companies have for years been working to develop spacecraft capable of taking paying customers on brief, supersonic trips to the edge of space, promising to usher in an age in which booking a flight to view the Earth from space is as easy as jetting across the Atlantic. (Musk’s SpaceX, it should be noted, is not in the suborbital tourism game. Its rockets and spacecraft take much longer and more dangerous treks into Earth’s orbit.)\n\nWe’re not quite there yet. But both billionaires pledged to kick off their respective suborbital space tourism businesses by taking the rides themselves, both as a show of their confidence in their vehicles’ safety and some strategic PR.\n\nJeff Bezos spoke about his flight on Blue Origin's New Shepard into space during a press conference on July 20, 2021 in Van Horn, Texas. Bezos and the crew that flew with him were on the first human spaceflight for the company. Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nBezos, founder of the rocket firm Blue Origin, planned to become the first person ever to travel to space aboard a spacecraft his own company developed, setting his sights on a July 20 launch. (Blue Origin even auctioned off a ticket to ride alongside him for a whopping $28 million, though that auction winner did not ultimately fly.)\n\nThen, Branson swooped in, announcing days later that he planned to hop on the next flight of the rocket-powered space plane developed by his company, Virgin Galactic, on July 11 — nine days before Bezos’ mission.\n\nThat set off an immediate wave of speculation that — although Branson has repeatedly said in interviews he doesn’t view his competition with Bezos as a “race” — there was a bitter rivalry brewing behind the scenes.\n\nRichard Branson takes off on July 11, 2021 from a base in New Mexico aboard a Virgin Galactic vessel bound for the edge of space. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBoth billionaires’ flights ended without apparent issue, with the men emerging from their respective spacecraft outfitted in custom flight suits and beaming for the cameras.\n\nAdding to the spectacle, both flights also carried some notable crewmates for the billionaires.\n\nBezos was joined by 82-year-old Wally Funk, who famously trained for NASA’s Mercury program in 1961 but never went to space, and then-18-year-old Oliver Daemen, the son of a wealthy businessman. The pair became the oldest and youngest people, respectively, ever to travel to space. (Funk’s record was bested shortly after by the 90-year-old William Shatner.)\n\nBranson took with him Virgin Galactic executive Sirisha Bandla, who became only the second Indian-born woman to fly to space and back.\n\nShaping up suborbital space\n\nBezos’ successful July launch catapulted the company into a busy rest of the year spent flying some high-profile figures as “honorary guests” — meaning they didn’t have to pay for tickets. Shatner took his suborbital excursion in October, a feat widely celebrated by “Star Trek” fans that was followed by an Amazon video special on the flight. Michael Strahan and Laura Shepard Churchley, the daughter of famed astronaut Alan Shepard, flew in December.\n\nWilliam Shatner and the NS-18 crew inside the capsule, floating around. Blue Origin\n\nWhile Blue Origin was sending celebrities to space, Virgin Galactic faced significant delays. A report from the New Yorker revealed that warning lights had gone off in the cockpit during Branson’s flight and the space plane had traveled outside its designated airspace for 41 seconds. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded all flights pending a review, which concluded in September and gave Virgin Galactic the all-clear. Still, the company is delaying the start of commercial services, citing unrelated technology upgrades.\n\nBlue Origin, meanwhile, has faced its own controversies, though none that have indicated specific safety issues with its rocket or spacecraft.\n\nRather, a group of 21 current and former employees co-signed a letter alleging the company operates a toxic work environment where “professional dissent” is “actively stifled.” Blue Origin responded to the claims by saying it has “no tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind.”\n\nInspiration4 flies higher\n\nThough Musk does not have any apparent plans to join one of SpaceX’s missions, his company continued to prove its technology chops. It drastically expanded its space-based internet service, Starlink, growing the constellation to include roughly 2,000 satellites. Its Dragon spacecraft also launched and returned astronauts to and from the International Space Station this year, and it topped the billionaire space tourism competition with a historic space tourism mission of its own.\n\nSpaceX’s Inspiration4 mission, self-funded by billionaire payments platform CEO Jared Isaacman, sent Isaacman and three other people, none of whom were professional astronauts, on a three-day trip to orbit that traveled even higher than the International Space Station — higher than any human has traveled this century.\n\nThe passengers floated around the capsule, played songs, created works of art and kept in touch with ground control as their 13-foot-wide capsule whisked around the planet once about every 90 minutes, traveling at more than 17,500 miles per hour.\n\nThe SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Inspiration4 crew launched from Pad 39A at NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida on September 15, 2021. Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe mission was intended to raise money for St. Jude Children’s Hospital, a cause to which Isaacman donated $125 million and a public fundraiser fetched more than $118 million. Musk promised to donate $50 million.\n\nThe whole thing went off (almost) without a hitch.\n\nStill, all the billionaires-in-space news generated plenty of backlash, including from high-profile figures such as the United Nations secretary general and Prince William.\n\nA “disease is spreading in our world today: a malady of mistrust,” UN Secretary-General António Guterres said in September, adding that includes “billionaires joyriding to space while millions go hungry on earth.”\n\nBezos v. Musk\n\nPlaying out in the background of all the space tourism hype was a tense battle pitting the two wealthiest people on the planet against each other.\n\nBezos and Musk each want their own companies to be at the center of NASA’s plans to return astronauts to the moon this decade. But after initially planning to bring on more than one contractor to build the lunar lander for the job, NASA later said it only had enough money for one — and it went with Musk’s SpaceX. It awarded $2.9 billion to the company.\n\nBlue Origin fought that decision all year, saying NASA unfairly favored SpaceX. Meanwhile, the PR offensives and twitter battles began.\n\nBut a federal judge delivered a major blow to Blue Origin in November by ruling in favor of NASA and SpaceX. That put the future of the Bezos-owned company’s plans to build a lunar lander into question.\n\nThe ordeal highlighted how important government contracts are to the viability of the commercial space industry. Though these companies are private, their revenue streams still rely heavily on taxpayer money.\n\nAnd the battle over NASA’s moon lander contract queued up what are sure to be more high-profile battles and an interesting few years ahead, as NASA and its contractors map out a path back to the lunar surface for the first time in half a century.", "authors": ["Jackie Wattles"], "publish_date": "2022/01/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/08/10/virgin-galactic-success-launch-customers-space-spaceport-new-mexico-civilian/70567309007/", "title": "Virgin Galactic flight successfully launches customers into space", "text": "It was a perfect day for Virgin Galactic's historic first spaceship launch with paying civilian customers aboard, rather than trained astronauts or company employees.\n\nClear blue skies gave the new private astronauts — an 80-year-old described daredevil and a mother-daughter duo from Antigua — a \"completely surreal\" view of Earth from space.\n\n\"If anyone is wondering, Earth is round,\" Keisha Schahaff, one of the passengers, quipped as she safely disembarked the spacecraft.\n\nAt 8:30 a.m., Galactic 02, as the mission was dubbed, took off from Spaceport America, the world's first purpose-built spaceport located an hour into the desert from Las Cruces, New Mexico.\n\nGalactic 02 was composed of two ships — VMS Eve and VSS Unity — coupled together at takeoff. Just 10 seconds after taking off from Spaceport's runway, the two ships and the six humans aboard had already reached Mach 1, the speed of sound. All aboard were thrust back into their seats.\n\nForty-five minutes and 47,000 feet into the climb above New Mexico, the VSS Unity — the ship holding the four passengers and two pilots — detached from Eve, the mothership.\n\nUnity rocketed upwards towards the edge of space, reaching a maximum speed of Mach 3 or 2,301 miles per hour.\n\nIn a humorous understatement, Jon Goodwin, one of the customers, said that the thrust of a spaceship surpassed even the fastest cars he'd driven.\n\nMoments later, the three civilian passengers and Beth Moses, Virgin Galactic's chief astronaut instructor, were given permission to unbuckle and began to float around Unity's cabin in zero gravity. Although they were only in space and weightless for roughly three minutes, the customers officially became astronauts.\n\n'Galactic 02: safe and sound'\n\nBy 9:30 a.m., an hour after takeoff, Unity touched down on the Spaceport tarmac. \"Galactic 02,\" Moses announced upon landing to cheers of the onlookers, \"safe and sound.\"\n\nMission Pilot Kelly Latimer, sweating in her black space suit and beaming with pride, offered her congratulations to the civilians aboard Unity. \"It was my pleasure to give my first ever space flight with you guys on it,\" she said.\n\n\"I can't wait to do it again,\" added Flight Commander CJ Sturckow, the only person to have flown eight times into space.\n\nVisiting space, seeing Earth 'is completely surreal'\n\nThe three civilian passengers who had never visited space before were awestruck after landing.\n\nGoodwin, at 80 years old one of the oldest people to go to space, was animated as he exited the Unity. He ran to his wife Pauline's arms, drawing heartwarming reactions from the crowd assembled outside the spaceport.\n\nSpeaking of his historic space flight, Goodwin said that it was \"by far the most awesome thing I did in my life.\"\n\nHe registered his surprise at the \"pure beauty of Earth from space. It is completely surreal.\"\n\nGoodwin was among the first people to register for a Virgin Galactic spaceflight in 2005. One of his fellow passengers on the Galactic 02 mission, described him as a \"daredevil,\" from canoeing at an Olympic level to climbing Mount Kilimanjaro even after his Parkinson's diagnosis in 2014.\n\nThe 18-year wait, Goodwin declared triumphantly on the tarmac after landing, was \"worth every moment.\"\n\nGoodwin's two fellow passengers were the first two Caribbean people in space.\n\n\"Antigua went to space,\" Schahaff cried, referencing her home island, to a crowd of her compatriots waving flags and cheering. \"We're making history,\" she said of herself and her daughter.\n\nIn fact, less than 100 women have been to space, Sirisha Bandla, a Virgin Galactic aeronautical engineer who hosted the livestream, said. Of the Unity spacecraft's six astronauts, four — including the three passengers and Latimer, the pilot — were women, the most flown to space in a single mission.\n\nThe mother and daughter won their tickets to space in a lottery that Schahaff, a wellness coach in Antigua, entered while aboard a Virgin Atlantic flight between her home island and London in 2021.\n\n\"A childhood dream has come true,\" Schahaff said.\n\nAn 18-year-old student at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, Mayers is tied for the youngest person to have visited space. (Another 18 year old flew to space aboard a commercial spaceflight with Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin space travel company in 2021.) She was speechless after her experience: \"just wow.\"\n\nMayers hoped her story would serve as \"motivation for other young people to dedicate their time and efforts to reaching their goals.\"\n\nFor all three new astronauts, the experience was profound and unforgettable.\n\n“I’m still up there,” Schahaff said with a dreamy sigh. “I would love to do this again.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2023/11/27/virgin-galactic-aims-to-launch-50-million-dollar-spaceships-in-2026-at-new-mexico-spaceport-america/71660486007/", "title": "Virgin Galactic aims to launch new, $50M spaceships at Spaceport ...", "text": "Officials for Virgin Galactic, the anchor of Spaceport America in southern New Mexico, recently delivered bad and good news for the fledgling spaceport as the company moves into its next phase of space tourism.\n\nThe bad news: The company is pausing spaceflights for about a year beginning in mid-2024 and, in January, is laying off 73 workers tied to the spaceport, located 56 miles north of Las Cruces and about 100 miles north of El Paso.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2021/09/15/spacex-inspiration-4-private-space-mission-launches-successfully/8323589002/", "title": "SpaceX Inspiration4 all-civilian crew, rocket launch from Florida", "text": "Four civilians lifted off atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Kennedy Space Center Wednesday night to start the first ever all-private orbital space mission.\n\nThe rocket carrying Jared Isaacman, Hayley Arceneaux, Sian Proctor and Chris Sembroski cleared pad 39A's tower at 8:02:56 p.m. EDT and was off to start three days of continuously orbiting Earth some 357 miles above. The four non-professional astronauts will spend about three days together in the capsule that measures 13 feet in diameter.\n\n\"Few have come before and many are about to follow,\" Isaacman said just before Crew Dragon entered its planned orbit. \"The door is opening now and it’s pretty incredible.\"\n\nNine-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, SpaceX confirmed Falcon 9's 162-foot first stage had successfully landed on the Just Read the Instructions drone ship stationed hundreds of miles off the Florida coast in the Atlantic Ocean. It should return to Port Canaveral for checkouts and refurbishment this weekend.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, the mission will come to an end with a brief engine firing after about 72 hours, putting the crew of four on an irreversible trajectory to splash down off the coast of Florida. Whether that means the Gulf of Mexico or Atlantic Ocean will depend on weather conditions at the time.\n\nSpace tourists have paid tens of millions of dollars in the past to hitch rides to the International Space Station aboard Russian Soyuz rockets. In recent months, Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos have taken short suborbital hops to the edge of space in vehicles developed by their companies Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin.\n\nBut Inspiration4, as the current mission is known, goes far beyond those ventures.\n\nUntil now, all such space trips have been government missions flown by men and women who had received years of extensive training. In the 60 years since Yuri Gagarin first orbited the Earth only three countries — the United States, Russia and China — have had national space programs that have been able to send humans to orbit.\n\nAdd SpaceX to that list.\n\nInspiration4 is the first private use of the rocket system SpaceX developed for NASA. The space agency paid SpaceX more than $3 billion over the past decade to build a space capsule capable of carrying humans to the International Space Station.\n\nThe Crew Dragon capsule's first crewed mission launched in May 2020 and carried NASA astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken to ISS, the first human flight from U.S. soil since the end of the space shuttle program in 2011. Since then, SpaceX launched two more NASA crews to the station.\n\nSpaceX launch, Inspiration4:Five things to know about all-civilian space flight\n\nIn their own voices:Inspiration4 civilian crew enthusiastic as SpaceX launch nears\n\nBut while taxpayers footed the cost to develop the Crew Dragon capsule, SpaceX had long planned to also make it available for private use for any willing to pay the tens of millions of dollars it cost launch a Falcon 9.\n\nAnd along came Jared Isaacman.\n\nIsaacman dropped out of high school at 16 to start an internet company in the basement of his parents' New Jersey home. Twenty-two years later he is the billionaire CEO of Shift4 Payments, an online payments-processing service.\n\nHe is also a serious aviation enthusiast who is qualified to fly unarmed military fighter jets and commercial aircraft.\n\nIsaacman was on a phone call late last year with SpaceX officials on an unrelated matter when the topic of a private spaceflight came up. When Isaacman heard SpaceX was just about ready to do one, he jumped at the chance to be the company's first commercial customer.\n\nNeither SpaceX nor Isaacman have said how much he is paying for the trip. A 2019 NASA report said the agency would end up paying SpaceX $55 million per astronaut it carried to the space station.\n\nThe proliferation of startups in recent years that hope to one day offer private spaceflights have drawn plenty of criticism from detractors who decry the vast sums of money spent to provide \"joyrides to billionaires.\"\n\nIsaacman decided to push back against such criticism in advance by turning this trip into a fundraiser for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the famed pediatric cancer institution in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\n\"We're not going to go up with a bunch of fishing buddies,\" Isaacman said.\n\nAnd so Inspiration4 was born.\n\nIsaacman said he hopes to raise $200 million. He has pledged the first $100 million and hopes to raise rest with the various fundraising efforts surrounding the mission.\n\nHe is basing Inspiration4 around four \"mission pillars:\" Leadership, Hope, Generosity, and Prosperity, with each represented by a seat in the Dragon capsule.\n\nIsaacman fills the Leadership seat. The other three crew members are:\n\nHayley Arceneaux, 29, who is riding in the Hope seat, is a physician assistant at St. Jude, where she was treated for bone cancer as a child. \"This is for everyone who’s ever been through something difficult, and I know we all have. Hold onto hope because there WILL be better days,\" she tweeted Wednesday.\n\nChris Sembroski, a 42-year-old data engineer for Lockheed Martin, will ride in the Generosity seat. Sembroski won his seat via a raffle among contributors to St. Jude. “Launch Day, best day!” he tweeted Wednesday. “Let’s do this Falcon 9! Take @inspiration4x to Space!”\n\nSian Proctor, 51, the daughter of an Apollo-era NASA worker, will ride in the Prosperity seat, awarded to an entrepreneur based on short videos posted to Twitter. She was a finalist to be a NASA astronaut in 2009. \"I’ve be been waiting for this moment all my life,\" Proctor tweeted Wednesday morning. \"Thank you for all the well wishes & support. Let’s do this!\"\n\n'Many more to follow': Historic all-civilian crew first of its kind in orbit\n\n“While a historic journey awaits us in space, I hope this mission reinforces how far inspiration can take us and the extraordinary achievements it leads to here on Earth,\" Isaacman said in February when first announcing the mission.\n\nIsaacman and SpaceX unveiled the mission concept during a Super Bowl ad back in February.\n\nThe Hollywood-style glamor surrounding the mission didn't end with the Super Bowl ad. Camera crews from Netflix have been involved in the process from the very beginning.\n\nWhile \"Countdown: Inspiration4 Mission to Space\" is labeled a documentary series, it is more akin to reality television than a Ken Burns film. Video cameras have followed the crew for months capturing everything from the moment the crew members first found out they were headed to space (via Zoom calls in which reactions varied from shock to tears) to them sharing the news with friends and family to a trip to KSC to visit the launch pad where they will blast off. It even includes video footage of Arceneaux as 10-year-old patient at St. Jude.\n\nPrevious coverage:Health care worker, cancer survivor selected for SpaceX Crew Dragon flight\n\nMore like this:Meet the two crew members who won seats on SpaceX's Crew Dragon\n\nThe crew of Inspiration4 has had to cram all its training into six months, while basic astronaut training takes two years at NASA. Among the training the crew has received are centrifuge rides to simulate G forces, Zero-G plane training and time in a Dragon capsule simulator.\n\nIsaacman appears to have tried to mimic some of NASA's storied training such a crew team-building exercises. For Isaacman's crew it was a hike to Camp Muir on Mount Rainier. NASA astronauts go through survival training that can include time spent in the Canadian wilderness or floating on a raft in the Black Sea.\n\nOf course, the flight is fully automated and the Inspiration4 crew will likely never have to take control of the capsule.\n\nWhile in orbit, Arceneaux, who is billed as the mission's medical officer will oversee medical research that will be conducted during the flight, such as tests to see how microorganisms within the human body change in orbit.\n\nThe mission also includes a variety of items that will be auctioned off to raise money for St. Jude. Among the things up for grabs:\n\nA non-fungible token of the new song \"Time in Disguise\" by the Grammy-winning rock band Kings of Leon. A non-fungible token, or NFT, is the digital equivalent of unique trading card. The winning bidder will get the actual digital file of the song played in space.\n\nAlso flying are Inspiration4 mission jackets featuring unique artwork by St. Jude patients.\n\nSixty-six pounds of hops that, upon return, will be used to brew an out-of-this world beer by the brewers of Samuel Adams. As the official beer of Inspiration4, Sam Adams has committed a maximum $100,000 donation to St. Jude.\n\nAnd, finally, a ukulele from Martin Guitar that Sembroski will play in space.\n\nIt was unclear how many people traveled to Brevard County to watch the launch in person. But anybody traveling over from Orlando at the last minute may have found themselves out of luck. A fuel tanker crashed on State Road 528 at the county line in the late afternoon. Traffic on the highway, the main road between Orlando and the Space Coast, was closed for hours.\n\n“I think this is the quintessential example of the very purpose of (NASA’s) Commercial Crew Program, as envisioned by the Obama administration when they developed it – and as the Trump administration doubled down on it,” said Dale Ketcham, Space Florida's vice president of government and external relations.\n\n“It doesn't have anything to do with NASA. Somebody else is picking up the tab, paying for the exercise, and helping to generate more activity,” Ketcham said.\n\n“That then lowers the cost to the government for NASA’s exploration missions and Space Force national security missions. The federal government in general is benefiting from commercial activity,” he said.\n\n“This will be but the first of many, many more to follow,” he said.\n\nA 25+ year veteran of FLORIDA TODAY, John McCarthy currently oversees the space team and special projects.

He worked for 3½ years as the National Reconnaissance Office's mission manager preparing for the agency's first Delta IV Heavy launch: NROL-26 in January 2009 from Cape Canaveral.\n\nAnd Long said he considers the Delta IV Heavy \"near and dear to my heart.\"\n\nCape Canaveral:Is there a launch today? Upcoming rocket launch schedule for SpaceX, NASA in Florida\n\n“That was a great learning experience. You learn soup-to-nuts on how to take a satellite and put it on a launch vehicle,” recalled Long, who is now president and CEO of Space Florida.\n\nNow, ending an era in American spaceflight, the 16th and final Delta IV Heavy rocket is scheduled to lift off at 1:40 p.m. Thursday from Launch Complex 37 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. However, ULA officials reported that the forecast only shows a 30% chance of favorable weather conditions.\n\nThe mission marks the 389th and last flight of the Delta program, which dates to 1960. ULA is replacing the retiring rocket with the next-generation Vulcan, which logged a successful maiden flight in January from the Cape. Crews can configure the flexible, less-expensive Vulcan with zero, two, four or six solid-rocket boosters to accommodate an array of orbital missions.\n\n\"We're into reusability, and we're into new ways of doing business. On one hand, it's nostalgic. And it's personally a great memory for me. But at the same time, I think it speaks to just moving forward in the industry — and not looking back,\" Long said.\n\nTune in Thursday to floridatoday.com/space for FLORIDA TODAY Space Team live coverage and updates on the last Delta IV Heavy launch, starting about two hours before liftoff.\n\nThe historic rocket will soar skyward with a classified payload on the NROL-70 national security mission, conducted in tandem with the NRO and the Space Force’s Space Systems Command. The massive rocket launches the NRO's heaviest satellites.\n\nULA CEO: 'It's a beautiful rocket'\n\nFLORIDA TODAY asked ULA President and CEO Tory Bruno about the Delta IV Heavy retirement last month during an interview at the SpaceCom convention in Orlando.\n\n“It’s a beautiful rocket. It’s launched amazing missions. It’s the most metal of all rockets, as I like to say — it sets itself on fire before going to space,” Bruno said.\n\n“I just love it. And so, we’re all going to miss it. So it’ll be bittersweet,” he said.\n\nWhy does the Delta IV Heavy seem to \"emerge from a cloud of fire\" at liftoff? A ULA video explains that the fireball is created by buoyant hydrogen gas that ignites before the engines come up to power.\n\nBruno noted that he discussed the rocket's fiery characteristics with the Swedish heavy metal band Sabaton, one of his favorite bands, when he attended their concert in Denver in September 2022.\n\n\"We brought them a Delta IV Heavy model. We were in the back with them in their green room. They were getting rocket science lessons, and they knew it was the most metal of all rockets — but they wanted to know why. So we had fun with them,\" Bruno said.\n\nDelta IV Heavy debuted in 2004\n\nThe Delta IV Heavy debuted during a December 2004 demonstration flight from Launch Complex 37. At that time, it was the most powerful rocket launched from Cape Canaveral save the Saturn V and space shuttles.\n\nThree years later, the inaugural Delta IV Heavy mission with a payload launched in November 2007 from the Cape, lifting a U.S. Air Force satellite designed to provide early warning of intercontinental ballistic missile launches. Long's NROL-26 mission in January 2009 represented the rocket's second mission and third overall flight.\n\nLong was an Air Force captain when he started his 3½ years of mission-management duties, then got promoted to major by liftoff. He went on to command Space Launch Delta 30 as a colonel at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California.\n\nAccording to a Space Force summary, the Delta family of rockets, which includes smaller models such as Delta II, has delivered a wide array of payloads \"including military, government, and commercial weather, communications and science satellites, robotic probes for exploration, eight Mars rovers, and one telescope\" during the past 60-plus years.\n\n“These launches place critical capabilities into orbit for our nation and our allies in what are dynamic times for the space community,\" Col. Jim Horne, senior materiel leader for Space System Command's Launch Execution Delta, said in a press release ahead of the final launch.\n\n\"Every member of our launch team understands what’s at stake and works with care and efficiency to prepare for what’s going to be a tremendous launch,” Horne said.\n\nLast launch 'will be one for the books'\n\nULA's mission preparation timeline for the last Delta IV Heavy launch:\n\nMay : The rocket arrived at Cape Canaveral aboard ULA's R/S RocketShip, a 312-foot cargo vessel, after a trek from the company rocket factory in Decatur, Alabama.\n\n: The rocket arrived at Cape Canaveral aboard ULA's R/S RocketShip, a 312-foot cargo vessel, after a trek from the company rocket factory in Decatur, Alabama.

That will be followed by a flight by three businessmen to the International Space Station in January.\n\n“We’ve always enjoyed this incredible thing called space, but we always want more people to be able to experience it as well,” NASA astronaut Shane Kimbrough said from the space station Wednesday. “So I think this is a great step in the right direction.”\n\nIt’s all rooted in Shepard’s 15-minute flight on May 5, 1961.\n\nVideo:New NASA Administrator: 'It's a new day in space'\n\nShepard was actually the second person in space — the Soviet Union launched cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin three weeks earlier, to Shepard’s everlasting dismay.\n\nThe 37-year-old Mercury astronaut and Navy test pilot cut a slick sci-fi figure in his silver spacesuit as he stood in the predawn darkness at Cape Canaveral, looking up at his Redstone rocket. Impatient with all the delays, including another hold in the countdown just minutes before launch, he famously growled into his mic: “Why don’t you fix your little problem and light this candle?”\n\nHis capsule, Freedom 7, soared to an altitude of 116 miles before parachuting into the Atlantic.\n\nTwenty days later, President John F. Kennedy committed to landing a man on the moon and returning him safely by decade’s end, a promise made good in July 1969 by Apollo 11′s Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.\n\nShepard, who died in 1998, went on to command Apollo 14 in 1971, becoming the fifth moonwalker — and lone lunar golfer.\n\nSince Gagarin and Shepard’s pioneering flights, 579 people have rocketed into space or reached its fringes, according to NASA. Nearly two-thirds are American and just over 20% Soviet or Russian. About 90% are male and most are white, although NASA’s crews have been more diverse in recent decades.\n\nA Black community college educator from Tempe, Arizona, sees her spot on SpaceX’s upcoming private flight as a symbol. Sian Proctor uses the acronym J.E.D.I. for “a just, equitable, diverse and inclusive space.”\n\nNASA wasn’t always on board with space tourism, but is today.\n\n“Our goal is one day that everyone’s a space person,” NASA’s human spaceflight chief, Kathy Lueders said following Sunday’s splashdown of a SpaceX capsule with four astronauts. “We’re very excited to see it starting to take off.”\n\nMore:How fast is the universe expanding? We know nought.\n\nTwenty years ago, NASA clashed with Russian space officials over the flight of the world’s first space tourist.\n\nCalifornia businessman Dennis Tito paid $20 million to visit the space station, launching atop a Russian rocket. Virginia-based Space Adventures arranged Tito’s weeklong trip, which ended May 6, 2001, as well as seven more tourist flights that followed.\n\n“By opening up his checkbook, he kicked off an industry 20 yrs ago,” Space Adventures co-founder Eric Anderson tweeted last week. “Space is opening up more than it ever has, and for all.”\n\nThere’s already a line.\n\nA Russian actress and movie director are supposed to launch from Kazakhstan in the fall. They’ll be followed in December by Space Adventures’ two newest clients, also launching on a Russian Soyuz rocket. SpaceX will be next up in January with the three businessmen; the flight from Florida’s Kennedy Space Center was arranged by Axiom Space, a Houston company run by former NASA employees. And as early as 2023, SpaceX is supposed to take a Japanese entrepreneur and his guests around the moon and back.\n\nWhile no fan of human spaceflight — he prefers robotic explorers — Duke University emeritus history professor Alex Roland acknowledges the emergence of spaceflight companies might be “the most significant change in the last 60 years.” Yet he wonders whether there will be much interest once the novelty wears off and the inevitable fatalities occur.\n\nThen there’s the high price of admission.\n\nThe U.S., Canadian and Israeli entrepreneurs flying SpaceX early next year are paying $55 million — each — for their 1 1/2-week mission.\n\nMore:Check out Virgin Galactic's newest spaceship, the VSS Imagine\n\nVirgin Galactic’s tickets cost considerably less for minutes versus days of weightlessness. Initially $250,000, the price is expected to go up once Branson’s company starts accepting reservations again.\n\nAs for SpaceX’s private flight on a fully automated Dragon capsule, tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman won’t say what he’s paying. He considers his three-day flight a “great responsibility” and is taking no shortcuts in training; he took his crewmates hiking up Mount Rainier last weekend to toughen them up.\n\n“If something does go wrong, it will set back every other person’s ambition to go and become a commercial astronaut,” Isaacman said recently.\n\nJohn Logsdon, professor emeritus at George Washington University, where he founded the Space Policy Institute, has mixed feelings about this shift from space exploration to adventure tourism.\n\n“It takes the romance and excitement out of going to space,” Logsdon said in an email this week. Instead of the dawn of a new era like so many have proclaimed, it’s “more like the end of the era when space flight was special. I guess that is progress.”\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

Long wooden tables are stacked in another area of the taproom, which will soon be set up inside and outside on the patio to replicate a German beer hall.\n\nAfter clearing a bulk of the hurdles which come with opening a business, Ben Brotman and Jamey Tielens can finally see the finish line as they prepare to launch Liquid State Brewing Company this fall in the West End District.\n\n“This place is unrecognizable compared to what it looked like when we first moved in,” Brotman said while standing in the taproom at Liquid State, which is located on 620 W. Green St. in a building previously used by Cornell Laundry. “We’ve always thought downtown has needed something more for craft beer, and we love this space and the location is fantastic.”\n\nWhile there is no official opening date, Brotman and Tielens said Liquid State could open by the end of October. Most of the brewing areas, backrooms and cooler are complete. The brewing system – ordered used from Japan – was fired up for the first time about three weeks ago and three batches of beer were in the fermenter during a visit on Oct. 4. The duo hopes to have four original beers on tap when the brewery opens.\n\nThe bulk of the work remains in the taproom and outside patio, which faces State Street.\n\n“We have a lot of space to grow, which is something we thought of when we were looking for a building,” Tielens said. “We have a few more permits to take care of, but we are close. We’re just tying up loose ends, waiting for beer to ferment, and then we’ll put it in kegs.”\n\nBrotman and Tielens both moved to the Ithaca area from the Pacific Northwest about 10 years ago and met while working at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. Upon discovering their shared love of beer and brewing, they originally floated the idea of starting a brewery about six years ago. Brotman, who is from Philadelphia, is a former biologist and has worked at several local breweries in the area. Tielens, who is from Wisconsin, has a small hop farm in Trumansburg.\n\n“We both have science backgrounds, and a lot of science is involved in the actual brewing,” said Brotman, who has a small laboratory and workshop in the back. “There’s a lot of infrastructure we need when brewing on this scale.”\n\nThe duo became serious about starting a business two years ago and began renting the space on West Green Street last year. Brotman and Tielens have already reached out to local restaurants and plan to highlight local food trucks. The taproom and beer hall will host local events like live music, radio broadcasts, fundraisers, art galleries and more.\n\nLiquid State plans to serve up New England IPAs, barrel-aged sours and traditional German beers. In addition to their own beer, the pair plans to have local cider and wine on tap as well.\n\nBrotman and Tielens recently completed a successful Kickstarter campaign to help ease the cost of a newly installed sprinkler system throughout the brewery. Installing the system allows for more people and the ability to hold bigger community events. The campaign, which ended on Oct. 8, eclipsed its goal of $30,000 by $292.\n\nLiquid State also has strong ties with other local breweries because of Brotman and Tielens’ backgrounds.\n\n“It’s a pretty close community, and a bunch have already been here and seen what we’re working on,” Brotman said. “More breweries brings more people in and more tourism. That’s never a bad thing.”\n\nFollow @SteinTime44 on Twitter", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/10/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/science/space/2024/03/30/spacex-falcon-9-rocket-launch-starlink-eutelsat-when-where-cape-canaveral-kennedy-space-center/73142114007/", "title": "SpaceX rocket launch RECAP: Falcon 9 double Cape launch Saturday", "text": "Doubleheader!\n\nSpaceX successfully launched two Falcon 9 rockets from Florida Today.

Upcoming rocket launch schedule for SpaceX, NASA in Florida\n\nMeanwhile, the earliest the Delta IV Heavy could make another attempt after its Thursday scrub looks to be at 1:25 p.m. Monday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n10:58 p.m. SpaceX says teams are readying for California Falcon 9 launch — later scrubbed due to weather\n\nWeather remains the primary concern of this planned Starlink launch, which has now pushed back to 9:46 p.m. PT which is 12:46 a.m. ET. The window extends until 2:30 a.m. ET. SpaceX later scrubbed due to weather.\n\n10:03 p.m. SpaceX pushes back launch time for California launch\n\nSpaceX is going for a tripleheader with a Falcon 9 launch of 22 Starlink satellites from Space Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. Liftoff is targeted for 8:54 p.m. PT, which is 11:54 p.m. ET. The window extends until 11:30 p.m. PT or 2:30 a.m. ET.\n\nThis will end our live launch coverage but we'll come back in the morning to provide updates on the California mission.\n\nFor those who are interested, here is a list of all 2024 launches so far from the Cape.\n\n9:38 p.m. SpaceX Falcon 9 booster lands\n\nThe Falcon 9 first-stage booster just landed aboard SpaceX's drone ship A Shortfall of Gravitas out on the Atlantic Ocean, completing its 18th mission.\n\n9:31 p.m. Falcon 9 supersonic, faster than speed of sound\n\nIt passed through Max Q. The rumble is passing right now over Merritt Island.\n\n9:30 p.m. LIFTOFF! SpaceX Falcon 9 lifts off on Starlink mission\n\nAnd SpaceX is off with a doubleheader as it launches the Falcon 9 rocket on a Starlink mission from Cape Canaveral Space Force.\n\n9:25 p.m. SpaceX Webcast begins\n\n.SpaceX's launch webcast hosted on X (formerly Twitter) is now posted above, right below the countdown clock.\n\nLiftoff is scheduled in five minutes from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\n9:20 p.m. SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket 10 minutes to launch\n\nNow is the time to make sure you get to your viewing spot. Seven minutes before launch, the Falcon 9 will begin engine chill.\n\n9:15 p.m. Key moments after the 9:30 p.m. Falcon 9 launch\n\nAfter SpaceX's Falcon 9 launches, a key moment will come 1 minute and 12 seconds after liftoff. That's known as Max Q and it's when the rocket experiences the peak mechanical stress.\n\nOther key moments include what's known as MECO or Main Engine Cutoff at 2 minutes and 26 seconds after liftoff. The first and second stage separate at 2 minutes and 30 seconds after lift-off.\n\nThe fairing deploys at 3 minutes and 4 seconds.\n\nThe booster or first-stage won't land back until 8 minutes and 26 seconds, and there will be entry burns proceeding that. There won't be a sonic boom because it's landing on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. But if the sky is clear enough, you might get lucky and see something.\n\n9:10 p.m. SpaceX Falcon 9 counting down 20 minutes to Starlink launch\n\nAs we count down toward the launch, thinking back to a previous holiday, Valentine's Day, and a previous doubleheader. The Space Coast saw a double-header was February 14-15 , when SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 rocket carrying the Intuitive Machines moon lander from KSC Pad 39A, just over seven hours after a Falcon 9 rocket launched a secretive USSF-124 national security mission from Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The Odysseus moon lander did make it to the moon albeit with a tipped-over landing, becoming the first American spacecraft to land on the moon since the Apollo 17 mission in December 1972.\n\n9:00 p.m. Bonus: International Space Station passing over Space Coast\n\nA reader just pointed out that we may get a chance to spot the International Space Station as it passes over the Space Coast about 9:09 p.m. appearing in the north-northwest part of the sky and heading eastward.\n\nHere's a link to find the location: https://spotthestation.nasa.gov/\n\n8:56 p.m. SpaceX is fueling Falcon 9 for launch\n\nSpaceX said on X, formerly known as Twitter, that they are loading the propellant into the rocket, which means they are now committed to a 9:30 p.m. liftoff.\n\nHere's what SpaceX said: \"All systems are ready and weather looks perfect for launch.\"\n\n8:53 p.m. Where to look for tonight's SpaceX Starlink launch\n\nAs we wait for some confirmation that fueling has started, here's some information for our visitors.\n\nSLC-40 is located further south than pad 39A. Look towards the area which lies south of Kennedy Space Center, according to your location. For example, if you are located south of the Cape, look northeast. If you are north of the Cape, look to the southeast.\n\nFor those who live in the Cape area (Titusville, Cocoa, Cocoa Beach, etc..) it would be hard to miss the bright rocket, even in daylight, under a clear sky.\n\n8:45 p.m. Key moment for SpaceX Starlink will be start of fueling\n\nSpaceX's launch director will make the call to start fueling 38 minutes before the planned liftoff at 9:30 p.m. Once that call is made and fueling begins, SpaceX is locked in to the 9:30 p.m. liftoff time. If they have to delay, it's a scrub and they'd have to use another launch opportunity Sunday.\n\nSo the start of fueling becomes a key moment in whether this launch is happening on schedule. Stay tuned.\n\n8:35 p.m. SpaceX Starlink launch - 22nd launch from Cape in 2024\n\nIf SpaceX's Starlink's 6-45 mission launches tonight, it will be the 22nd launch from Florida this year. It would be the second launch today.\n\nHere's our 2024 launch list but just note: we haven't put in the earlier launch from today yet.\n\n8:30 p.m. Key Countdown times toward 9:30 p.m. SpaceX Starlink launch\n\nHere's a behind-the-scenes rundown of SpaceX’s countdown timeline as we approach the one hour mark to the new launch time of 9:30 p.m.. SpaceX does not provide audio coverage into their launch control center.\n\nT-minus\n\n38 minutes: SpaceX launch director verifies “go” for propellant load.\n\nSpaceX launch director verifies “go” for propellant load. 35 minutes: Rocket-grade kerosene and first-stage liquid oxygen loading begins.\n\nRocket-grade kerosene and first-stage liquid oxygen loading begins. 16 minutes: Second-stage liquid oxygen loading begins.\n\nSecond-stage liquid oxygen loading begins. 7 minutes: Falcon 9 begins engine chill prior to launch.\n\nFalcon 9 begins engine chill prior to launch. 1 minute: Command flight computer begins final prelaunch checks; propellant tank pressurization to flight pressure begins.\n\nCommand flight computer begins final prelaunch checks; propellant tank pressurization to flight pressure begins. 45 seconds: SpaceX launch director verifies “go” for launch.\n\nSpaceX launch director verifies “go” for launch. 3 seconds: Engine controller commands engine ignition sequence to start.\n\nEngine controller commands engine ignition sequence to start. 0 seconds: Liftoff.\n\n8:20 p.m. SpaceX Falcon 9 launch: what to expect in the skies\n\nIf you’re never seen a Falcon 9 launch, you’re in for quite a show.\n\nAfter the rocket rises into the sky, the 1st and 2nd stages of the rocket will separate after two-and-a-half minutes into flight.\n\nThe 1st stage continues to put on an additional show, which is best viewed from the beach — depending on the droneship location, you may be able to catch the 1st stage entry and landing burns, which occur at 6 minutes and 10 second and 8 minutes and 4 seconds respectively.\n\nBecause of the droneship landing at sea, there will be no sonic booms.\n\n8:10 p.m. SpaceX now targeting 9:30 p.m. for launch\n\nSpaceX has moved the launch time and is now working toward a 9:30 p.m. launch. They have until 10 p.m. to launch.\n\n8:02 p.m. SpaceX Falcon 9 Starlink launch prep underway\n\nWith one hour to launch, Brevard County Emergency Management officials have activated the agency's launch operations support team ahead of SpaceX’s upcoming Falcon 9 launch. This is the second launch of the day.\n\nAll of these launches do have an impact. If you're curious, FLORIDA TODAY reporters wrote a story about it last year. Here's the link.\n\n7:50 p.m. Weather looking good for SpaceX Falcon 9 launch two\n\nJust as with the earlier SpaceX Falcon 9 launch, the 45th Weather Squadron had forecast near ideal launching conditions.\n\nThey put the chance of weather violating a launch rule at less than 5 percent. The main concern: thick cloud layers.\n\nIt's a little cooler as the sun sets on the Space Coast, and right now the sky looks decorated in the colors of Easter eggs as we await this second-of-the-night rocket launch.\n\n7:40 p.m. SpaceX's Falcon 9 booster another well-traveled rocket\n\nThis launch will mark the 18th flight for this Falcon 9 booster. Its most memorable previous launches include NASA Crew-3 and NASA Crew-4. This will be the booster’s 9th Starlink mission.\n\nWhere is the SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage booster landing?\n\nThis specific SpaceX Falcon 9 will land out in the Atlantic Ocean on the A Shortfall of Gravitas droneship — which will ferry the booster to shore in the coming days.\n\nWith it coming in over the ocean, no sonic booms are expected. No need to cover your ears tonight but you'll still get that launch rumble if you're close enough and the wind is right.\n\n7:30 p.m. What is SpaceX Falcon 9 launching this time\n\nIf you missed the launch earlier this evening, here is your chance to see one tonight.\n\nA group of 23 Starlink satellites will be headed to low-Earth orbit in what promises to be a spectacular night launch at 9:02 p.m.\n\nThis is the second in back-to-back launches from the Space Coast. The launch will occur from Space Launch Complex 40, which is at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\nSpaceX is in the process of transforming pad 40 into a facility that can also launch crews.\n\nThe launch window tonight goes until 10 p.m., and there are backup opportunities tomorrow, too, starting at 7 p.m.\n\n7:20 p.m. Just over 90 minutes until Falcon 9 Starlink launch\n\nWe're just over 90 minutes until the planned 9:02 p.m. liftoff of a Falcon 9 Starlink mission on what will be the second SpaceX launch from Florida today. For this launch, we turn to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\nBut first, below is a photo of the Falcon 9 that blasted off from KSC flying behind an American flag. Great capture by our veteran Space Photographer Craig Bailey\n\n6:30 p.m. Next up: SpaceX Falcon 9 Starlink launch from Cape Canaveral\n\nWe'll be back to bring you live countdown coverage of the SpaceX Starlink launch, which is set for 9:02 p.m. right now from Cape Canaveral Space Force Launch Complex 40.\n\nThis is a real treat — a double launch in Florida, including one nighttime launch. Nighttime launches can be spectacuar.\n\nAlso up tonight, SpaceX is hoping to make it a tripleheader with a launch at 10:30 p.m. ET from California.\n\n6:10 p.m. SpaceX set to deploy satellite around 6:25 p.m.\n\nThe Eutelsat36D satellite will be deployed 33 minutes and 57 seconds after liftoff, according to SpaceX.\n\nNext up: launch preps for the second SpaceX launch from Florida tonight.\n\n6:00 p.m. SpaceX Falcon 9 booster lands on drone ship\n\nThe Falcon 9 booster returned with a landing out on Just Read the Instructions drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean. This marked SpaceX's 289th recovery of a first-stage rocket.\n\nSpaceX has just launched the Falcon 9 rocket carrying the EutelSat36D satellite from KSC, in what's the first of two launches planned today from Florida's Cape. A third launch is being targeted for California.\n\n5:47 p.m. SpaceX Falcon 9 tracking no issues, weather is green\n\nSpaceX says the Falcon 9 is tracking no issues. Weather is green meaning go for launch.\n\nAll is looking good for the planned 5:52 p.m. launch from Kennedy Space Center's Pad 39A.\n\n5:43 p.m. SpaceX live broadcast begins\n\nSpaceX's launch webcast hosted on X (formerly Twitter) is now posted above, right above the countdown clock. Liftoff is scheduled at 5:52 p.m.\n\n5:42 p.m. T-10 to liftoff of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket\n\nHead outside if you plan on catching this launch! If you have clear skies, it will be hard to miss the bright rocket rising into the sky. And get ready for the rumble (my favorite part!).\n\nAt T-1 minute, the command flight computer will begin final checks.\n\nAt 45 seconds to launch, the launch director verifies they are go for launch.\n\n5:30 p.m. What to expect after SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches\n\nAfter launch, the rocket will reach Max Q, that's the moment of the most mechanical stress, at 1 minute and 14 seconds into the flight. At 2 minutes 30 seconds, there's MECO - Main Engine Cutoff. At 2 minutes 34 seconds, the first and second stage separate.\n\nThe first stage is set to land on the drone ship at 8 minutes 36 seconds into the flight.\n\nThe satellite deploys 33 minutes and 57 seconds into the flight.\n\n5:25 p.m. Fueling appears to be underway for SpaceX Falcon 9 launch\n\nVisual cues on the rocket indicate SpaceX has begun fueling the Falcon 9 ahead of a planned 5:52 p.m. launch from KSC's Launch Pad 39A.\n\n5:15 p.m. Waiting to hear if fueling underway for tonight's first SpaceX Falcon 9 launch\n\nIf SpaceX plans to make the 5:52 p.m. launch, they will have begun fueling the Falcon 9 at Kennedy Space Center's Launch Pad 39A.\n\nSpaceX has yet to make an official announcement. Unlike United Launch Alliance and SpaceX missions for NASA, SpaceX doesn't make audio from its launch control center available to listen in.\n\nOnce fueling gets underway, that means tonight’s Starlink mission would be locked in to lift off at 5:52 p.m. without any countdown delays, or else the launch must be postponed. But if fueling is not underway, SpaceX still has time in their launch window to pick a new launch time.\n\n5 p.m. No sonic booms expected with this SpaceX Falcon 9 launch\n\nBoth of today’s launches will be landing on droneships in the Atlantic Ocean. Sonic booms are not expected.\n\nThis first Falcon 9 will land on the Just Read the Instructions droneship.\n\nBut while there won't be sonic booms, expect a rumble as the sound wave hits you after liftoff.\n\nSpaceX just posted on X, formerly known as Twitter, that \"all systems are looking good and there are blue skies\" over the launch pad.\n\n4:55 p.m. SpaceX Falcon 9 launch prep underway\n\nBrevard County Emergency Management officials have activated the agency's launch operations support team ahead of SpaceX’s upcoming Falcon 9 launch from Kennedy Space Center.\n\nThe launch window is 5:52 p.m. to 8 p.m. At this point, we're anticipating a launch at the opening of the window but we'll let you know if that changes.\n\n4:52 p.m. One hour to planned SpaceX Falcon 9 launch\n\nWith one hour to go until launch, we're looking for some key milestones. The first critical one is at At T-38 minutes, the SpaceX launch director will decide to \"go\" or not for fueling.\n\nHere's a behind-the-scenes rundown of SpaceX’s countdown timeline. T-minus:\n\n35 minutes: Rocket-grade kerosene and first-stage liquid oxygen loading begins.\n\nRocket-grade kerosene and first-stage liquid oxygen loading begins. 16 minutes: Second-stage liquid oxygen loading begins.\n\nSecond-stage liquid oxygen loading begins. 7 minutes: Falcon 9 begins engine chill prior to launch.\n\nFalcon 9 begins engine chill prior to launch. 1 minute: Command flight computer begins final prelaunch checks; propellant tank pressurization to flight pressure begins.\n\nCommand flight computer begins final prelaunch checks; propellant tank pressurization to flight pressure begins. 45 seconds: SpaceX launch director verifies “go” for launch.\n\nSpaceX launch director verifies “go” for launch. 3 seconds: Engine controller commands engine ignition sequence to start.\n\nEngine controller commands engine ignition sequence to start. 0 seconds: Liftoff.\n\n4:45 p.m. SpaceX aiming for three launches from three pads, two states\n\nIf all goes as planned today, this would be one for the record books. SpaceX is trying to launch three missions from three different launch pads in two states within hours of each other. First up, is the Falcon 9 EUTELSAT 36D mission launching from the storied KSC Launch Complex 39A.\n\nThis might be the most famous launchpad in the world. It's where Apollo 11 launched on July 16, 1969, with astronauts Buzz Aldrin, Neil Armstrong, and Michael Collins for the first mission to put a man on the moon. It's also the location where the first and last launches of NASA's space shuttle program occurred 30 years apart.\n\nWant to know what other launch pads are active on the Space Coast? Here's a great guide.\n\nThe second launch from Florida tonight is targeting 9:02 p.m. from Cape Canaveral Space Force Launch Complex 40 and the third launch is in California at Vandenberg Space Force Base at 10:30 p.m. ET.\n\n4:25 p.m. What is SpaceX launching from KSC today?\n\nEUTELSAT 36D is a telecommunications satellite which will serve Africa and Eurasia.\n\nAccording to an Airbus press release earlier this month, the satellite was built by Airbus and has a 15-year life expectancy. Its purpose is to provide TV broadcasting as well as government services for Africa, Europe, and Eurasian countries.\n\nThe satellite was transported to Kennedy Space Center earlier this month after arriving in Stanford, Florida, via an Airbus Beluga transport aircraft.\n\n4:15 p.m. Falcon 9 booster launching from KSC has a history\n\nThe most memorable of launches for this Falcon 9 may be CRS-26, a commercial resupply mission for the International Space Station which launched on November 26, 2022.\n\nOverall, this will be its 12th launch.\n\nIn fact, every one of SpaceX's Falcon 9 boosters flying on all three planned launches today have flown before.\n\n4:00 p.m. Weather conditions for SpaceX Falcon 9 launches look good\n\nWith just under two hours to go to the first SpaceX launch, the skies over the Cape are cloudy with patches of blue. The Space Force's 45th Weather Squadron had forecast a less than 5 percent chance of weather conditions violating the launch rules. The main weather concern: thick cloud layer.\n\nWhen was the first SpaceX Falcon 9 launch Saturday\n\nThe first SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launched at 5:52 p.m. from KSC's Launch Pad 39A.\n\nWhen was the second SpaceX Falcon 9 launch Saturday\n\nSpaceX will try for a doubleheader by launching a batch of Starlink satellites on another Falcon 9 at 9:30 p.m. from Cape Canaveral Space Force Launch Complex 40.\n\nWhen is the third SpaceX Falcon 9 launch Saturday - this one from California?\n\nOn the U.S. West Coast, SpaceX intends to launch another batch of 22 Starlink satellites from Launch Complex 4 East at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California. That launch is targeting 10:30 p.m. ET. If all launches go, that would mean SpaceX sent three Falcon 9 rockets up into space in the span of hours on Saturday.\n\nBrooke Edwards is a Space Reporter for Florida Today. Contact her at bedwards@FloridaToday.com", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/05/24/asheville-regional-airport-new-parking-deck/632227002/", "title": "AVL parking explained: Growth brings new deck, higher fees, fewer ...", "text": "AVL has experienced 4 straight years of record-breaking traffic.\n\nWith strong growth, airport management said a new $20.6M parking deck was a necessity.\n\nParking rates recently were raised for the first time in six years.\n\nSome may argue that $4 a day seems like small potatoes.\n\nBut to Asheville resident John Chapman, who uses the Asheville Regional Airport about every six weeks, what he considers a de facto bump in parking costs has taken the shine off a place he otherwise views as a gem.\n\n\"It stinks,\" said Chapman, a 76-year-old retired market research analyst. “Because the longer the trip and the higher the price to park, it just takes a bite after a while.”\n\nIn November, Asheville Regional opened its new $22 million, 1,100-space parking deck, a project aimed at easing the parking crunch at the bustling facility, which has set usage records each of the past four years.\n\nIn 2017, the airport had 956,634 passengers, the most in its 57-year history, and a number that marked four consecutive years the airport has broken its record for passenger utilization.\n\nBut while the white concrete deck with a recurring mountain motif is beautiful and spacious, its introduction has resulted in a net loss of long-term surface parking lot spaces, which are cheaper. The airport charges $9 a day for them, while the deck runs $13 daily.\n\nIt’s not uncommon now to see a sign at the entrance to the airport’s surface parking lot that reads, “Long term lot full.” Some airport users, like Chapman, feel that forces them into the more expensive deck.\n\nSome travelers also complain that signage about rates and how to use the deck initially were inadequate and confusing.\n\nSource of complaints\n\nPart of the problem, airport spokeswoman Tina Kinsey says, is that during construction of the deck, the airport kept open a temporary, long-term surface lot on the south end of the facility, at the cheaper rate. With the opening of the new deck, the airport closed nearly all of that lot.\n\n“We’ve always operated approximately 750 long-term spaces, and now we have approximately 700,” Kinsey said. “For the first time in our history, the (long-term) parking lot has become full on occasion. I would like to say we retained almost all of our surface long-term spaces. However, I think the perception is that that overflow lot was always long-term parking, but it wasn’t.”\n\nIn years past, that overflow lot was only opened on very high-demand days, usually a few times a year. It had 500 spaces, and the airport has closed 345 of them, while converting the remainder to long-term parking.\n\nWhile not unusable, the overflow lot's pavement was old and the location the farthest from the terminal of any of the airport’s passenger parking areas.\n\n“It was the source of most of our complaints for many years, because people who parked there, they didn’t like pulling their luggage up the hill,” Kinsey said. “People did not like arriving in the evening and having to walk all the way down there at night.\"\n\nSince the new deck opened, “All of those complaints have gone away,\" she said.\n\nKinsey also noted that the airport had a sizable net gain in parking once the deck opened, going from 1,450 total public spaces before to 1,900 now.\n\nRELATED: Answer Man: Asheville Regional Airport long-term parking MIA?\n\nRELATED: Answer Man: New AVL Regional Airport deck rates too high?\n\nHendersonville resident Jean Sibbers, a frequent customer of car rental services at the airport, said she’s not enamored with the funneling of cars to the parking deck when the long-term surface lots are full.\n\n“There’s still plenty of parking, it just costs a heck of a lot more,” said Sibbers, a clinical social worker.\n\nIn late March, Sibbers ran into the “Long term lot full” sign, and felt she was forced into the new garage.\n\n“I didn’t want to park in the garage, but the only other alternative was short-term parking, which is ridiculously expensive,” Sibbers said.\n\nShe left her car overnight and ended up with a two-day charge of $40, as the short-term lot is $20 a day. At that time, the long-term charge would’ve been $16 ($8 a day — the airport has since increased the long-term fee by $1).\n\nShe didn’t realize she was supposed to scan her short-term ticket at the garage entrance to get the reduced rate, a hiccup the airport has since addressed with better signage.\n\nSibbers said last week the airport has since refunded her $22 of the fee, and she appreciates their customer service. But she's still not happy about what she essentially considers coercion to use the new deck.\n\n“Long story long, the quaint Asheville airport does not have quaint parking any longer,” Sibbers said in March. “I guess the airport has to pay for that pretty new garage somehow.”\n\nDeck payoff is 15 years\n\nThe airport does have a bond to repay for the garage, as parking facilities are not eligible for Federal Aviation Administration grant funding like other airport projects. Asheville Regional used airport bond funding to finance the deck, a $21-million, 15-year bond that comes with “high government oversight” to ensure operating revenue will be available to cover the debt service, Kinsey said.\n\nBudgeted at $21.9 million, the actual cost of the garage was $20.6 million. Per space cost came in at $16,000, well within the range the airport's parking deck consultants estimated — $15,000-$18,000 per space.\n\nWith its strong growth — Asheville Regional is one of the fastest growing small hub airports in the country — the deck was a necessity, airport management says.\n\nProjections before the deck was built show overall parking revenue was estimated to increase by about 10 percent a year, based upon growth and utilization of all parking options, as well as the increase in price.\n\n“Asheville Regional Airport’s growth has been phenomenal, and we know that with growth comes some ‘growing pains,'” said Lew Bleiweis, the airport’s executive director. “We’re working hard to navigate the long-term decisions that must be made in order to continue to grow along with this region.”\n\nKinsey noted that the increased parking rates were the first in six years. The long-term and overflow lots went from $1.50 an hour and a maximum of $8 daily to $2 hourly with a $9 daily max, while short-term parking stayed at $1 per 30 minutes, but jumped from a $12.50 daily maximum to $20.\n\nFor the 2017-18 fiscal year, parking revenue totaled $3.3 million. For the 2018-19 fiscal year, the revenue is budgeted at $3.6 million.\n\nNot forcing people from lower-priced parking\n\nWhile the airport has to cover that bond debt service, it was not looking to significantly boost airport revenues as the expense of people parking their cars there, said Stephanie Pace Brown, a member of the Asheville Regional Airport Authority Board.\n\n“It was nobody’s strategy to move people into higher costs for parking,” Brown said. “The strategy was to get the garage built so there was enough parking to respond to increased use of our airport, which is really fantastic for the economy of our area and for the convenience of the community.”\n\nThe deck affords travelers covered space that’s considerably closer to the terminal, and the rates are reasonable and compare well with other airports. With the growth and high usage Asheville Regional is experiencing, the deck absolutely was needed, Brown said.\n\n“It’s true there is a bond issued, and there has to be revenues associated with the garage to meet those debt requirements,” said Brown, who is also president and CEO of Explore Asheville, the Convention & Visitors Bureau. “But trying to force people from lower priced (parking) was not a strategy. We’re just experiencing a shortage of surface lot parking compared to what the estimates were.”\n\nChapman understands payments have to be made and the airport has to meet financial obligations on the bonds, but he said he does believe the airport is funneling drivers into the more expensive deck, in part to meet the bond obligation.\n\nHow AVL parking compares\n\nChapman is a numbers guy, and he’s run some numbers on Asheville’s parking and how it compares to Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport in South Carolina, and Charlotte-Douglas International Airport. What really irks him about Asheville is that, taking out the 100 really expensive short-term lot spaces, about 61 percent of Asheville’s parking capacity is in the deck, and 39 percent in the long-term surface lots.\n\nThe Citizen Times verified the parking statistics with the airports in question.\n\nAt Charlotte, a much larger airport in a major metro area, travelers can use three long-term lots comprising 10,328 spaces, or 61 percent of overall parking capacity, for $7 daily. Travelers also have access to another daily lot with 985 spaces that charges $8 a day.\n\nCharlotte has two huge decks, with a total of 5,732 spaces, with a daily rate of $10, according to the airport.\n\n“That’s a ratio of nearly two times as many cheaper surface spaces as higher-priced deck spaces,” Chapman said. “That’s a ratio that would also make sense for Asheville.”\n\nAsheville, Chapman maintains, gets it \"bass-ackwards.\"\n\nGreenville-Spartanburg, a keen competitor for mountain travelers as local residents often shop for better fares there, has 4,577 total parking spaces, with its two garages providing 1,973 of those spaces, or 43 percent of spaces. GSP charges $14 a day for the premium garage spots.\n\nTravelers can use 603 uncovered spaces on the garage’s top levels for $7 daily, a 484-space daily lot at $9 a day, or a less convenient 1,517-space economy lot at $5 a day.\n\nRELATED: Asheville airport bests passenger record in 2017, up 50 percent in past five years\n\nChapman has made his case to Asheville Regional's board and management, but he feels he’s not getting anywhere.\n\nHe said he believes the airport authority board, instead of “adjusting the pricing to be more attractive,\" has \"decided to force more patrons to park in the deck by reducing the number of long-term surface spaces.”\n\nKinsey said comparing Asheville to Charlotte and Greenville-Spartanburg constitutes “flawed logic,” as “every airport is different.\"\n\n“Different campuses, land availability, topography, air service mix, population, and operating budget (to name just a few differentiators),” she said. “Each airport must make business decisions that support their operations.”\n\nPositive reviews, too\n\nKinsey said the airport has heard mostly positive responses from the public about the new deck and especially about recently improved signage.\n\nWest Asheville resident Daniel Carter, who returned last week to Asheville Regional from a trip up North with his wife and two young children, raved about the airport’s parking and the new deck. They found a spot for their Toyota Prius in the long-term surface lot, leaving the car there for eight days.\n\nWith a weekly max of $54, plus $9 for the extra day, they were looking at $63.\n\n“Honestly, this is the cheapest parking I’ve ever paid in my life for anything,” Carter said. “I love it. There’s more parking. That’s all you could really ask for.”\n\nSecond deck a possibility\n\nMost of the overflow lot that was pressed into service as a long-term lot remains vacant, and that puzzles some travelers in search of cheaper surface spaces, but the airport has no plans to reopen it. The spot is “slated for potential development,” Kinsey said, adding that “the key there is something that is revenue-producing for the airport.”\n\nShe noted that the Marathon gas station near the airport’s southern entrance is on land owned by the airport, and thus a revenue producer.\n\nThe airport receives FAA funds, but those are specifically earmarked for aviation-related projects. The airport receives most of its revenues from ticket fees that passengers pay, as well as fuel fees from airlines and other usage fees. Those fees are administered by the FAA.\n\n“Because we use those funds from the FAA, we have rules that are imposed on us by the FAA, and one of them is we must operate in a self-sufficient manner,” Kinsey said. “So airports have to diversify and find revenue streams so you can continue to respond to growth. That’s just part of long-term master planning.”\n\nA second parking deck also is a possibility \"at some point,” Kinsey said, stressing that the location down the hill would be unlikely.\n\n\"A second garage is not part of the current master plan; however, the new garage was constructed 'off-center' in front of the terminal in anticipation of a future second garage — which could potentially be constructed beside the existing structure,\" Kinsey said.\n\nKinsey stressed that the airport is always looking to improve the experience travelers have. They want passengers to regard the airport with the same enthusiasm as Carter, the West Asheville resident.\n\nOne improvement in the works is an automated, electronic lot space counter for the long-term surface lot so passengers will know exactly how many spaces remain. The airport now uses a manual system of placing those “lot full” signs, and sometimes spaces actually are available even though the sign indicates otherwise.\n\nThe airport also has installed several new signs, including large “headache bars” — overhead beams with signage — at the entrance, and better directional signs to the deck and signs explaining parking rates in detail.\n\n“We definitely listen,” Kinsey said. “We’re trying very hard to listen to feedback and see if there’s something constructive that we might be able to do to improve the experience.\"\n\nAsheville Regional Airport public parking, by the numbers\n\nShort-term surface lot: Spaces: 100.

Most American men don't seem to ...", "text": "Most of us seem to know that the average American lives between 70 and 80 years: 73.5 years for men, and 79.3 for women, to be exact.\n\nFewer of us understand that life expectancy rises with age. An American man who turns 70 today will live to 85, on average. A woman of 70 will live to 87.\n\nThat knowledge is called longevity literacy. Many of us don’t have it, and ignorance may cost us.\n\nLet's say a man retires at 65 with $250,000 in savings. If he spends it down at a rate of $30,000 a year, the money might last him to age 73.5. But longevity tables say he can expect to live another decade, to 84.\n\nA large share of older Americans, and especially men, don’t know how long their own retirement is going to last: in other words, how long they are going to live.\n\nLongevity literacy matters when it comes to retirement planning. If your retirement budget assumes you will live to 75, and you make it to 85, you will probably run out of money.\n\n“Moving into retirement, you have to think about, ‘When am I going to die?’” said Paul Yakoboski, a senior economist at the TIAA Institute, the research arm of the financial services nonprofit. “That filters back on how I’m managing my money, how I’m drawing it down.”\n\nThe TIAA Institute publishes widely read surveys on retirement finance. When the institute asked Americans, in a recent survey, how long a man of 65 is likely to live, only one-third of the men gave the correct answer: 19 more years.\n\nA larger share of men in the TIAA survey, 35%, underestimated the lifespan of a retirement-age male. Another 23% said they didn’t know. That response, in particular, left researchers bewildered: the question was multiple-choice.\n\nWomen seem to understand longevity somewhat better. In the survey, 36% correctly answered that a woman of 65 can expect to live about 22 more years, to age 87. Only 26% guessed low.\n\n“Women just have a better grasp on that,” Yakoboski said. “The reality of most households, it’s the woman who focuses on the health care in the family and everybody’s well-being and caregiving issues.”\n\nTheir findings draw on a nationally representative survey of 3,503 adults.\n\nHow long does retirement last? Longer than many people think\n\nLuigi Ferrucci is 69. According to official Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data for human longevity, men live to about 74, which would give Ferrucci another five years.\n\nBut Ferrucci works at the National Institute on Aging, and he knows about longevity. If an American male reaches age 69, he can expect to live to 85, according to a simple longevity calculator from the Social Security Administration.\n\nFerrucci expects to live longer than that.\n\n“My mother died at the age of 97, and my father died at the age of 98,” both in Italy, said Ferrucci, scientific director at the federal agency. He credits good genes and the Mediterranean diet.\n\nThe human lifespans reported by the CDC are “calculated at birth,” Ferrucci said. Those are the numbers most Americans learn in school, the ones reported in the newspaper every year.\n\nBut life expectancy goes up from there. Simply put: The longer you do live, the longer you will live.\n\n“Mortality is very high in the first year of life, and then declines, and then tends to increase gradually,” Ferrucci said.\n\nTIAA has made longevity literacy something of an institutional crusade, putting out reports that warn of dire consequences for older Americans who do not plan for the full span of their retirement.\n\n“You look at the numbers, there’s a good chance someone at 67 is going to be alive at 90,” Yakoboski said, speaking in a video conference call interview. “Some of those people are going to be alive at 100.”\n\nHis colleague, Andrea Sticha, chimed in: “The decision you have to make is whether to outlive your money or leave something behind.” Sticha is the deputy academic director of the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center at Stanford University.\n\nIn retirement savings, plan for a longer life\n\nThe takeaway here is twofold, the researchers said: Figure out how long you are going to live, and make sure you have a retirement plan that covers those years.\n\nThe TIAA researchers have noticed that people with strong longevity literacy, about 12% of the population, are more likely than other adults to have a retirement plan. Conversely, people with a solid retirement plan tend to understand how long they will live. The two traits go hand in hand.\n\n“Individuals with better longevity literacy do a better job planning and saving for retirement,” Sticha said. “There’s a very strong link between longevity literacy and retirement outcomes.”\n\nHere are a few simple tips for retirement planning:\n\n◾ Make a plan. Consult a retirement calculator. Meet with a retirement planner, or do the math yourself. Experts say you'll need 70% to 90% of your working income to maintain your standard of living. Figure out how long you are likely to live. Assess your health risks.\n\n◾ Start saving, if you haven't. Try to increase the amount you save every year. Resist the temptation to spend the money. Take full advantage of your 401 (k) plan, if you have one.\n\n◾ Build net worth: Pay down debts. Trim unnecessary expenses. Consider working longer, especially if the work is fulfilling. Consider drawing Social Security later, yielding a larger monthly check.\n\nSticha and Yakoboski collaborated with researcher Annamaria Lusardi on an August TIAA report on longevity literacy.\n\nThe scholars are alarmed that so many adults underestimate how long they will live. If anything, people should err in the opposite direction. If you are 65 now and expect to reach 85, plan for 90.\n\nHow much money do you need to retire?Most Americans calculate $1.8 million, survey says.\n\nRoughly half of Americans have at least attempted to calculate how much money they will need to live comfortably in retirement, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute's 2023 Retirement Confidence Survey.\n\nAnd how much should you save for retirement? One analysis, from the investment firm T. Rowe Price, suggests a savings target of seven to 13 times your annual salary by age 65.\n\nThe research institute survey found that only 64% of workers believe they will have the funds to last through retirement. The figure declined sharply over the past year. Americans are worried about nagging inflation and sagging retirement savings, which took a hit in 2022. The average 401(k) account lost about one-fifth of its value last year, according to Fidelity Investments data.\n\nHere's why budgeting for retirement matters more than ever\n\nBudgeting for retirement is more important than ever, said Craig Copeland, director of wealth benefits research at the research institute because more Americans are setting the budget themselves.\n\nIn decades past, many American retirees relied primarily on Social Security and defined-benefit pensions, funding sources that guaranteed steady payments until death.\n\nOver time, the traditional pension has given way to the 401(k) and other defined-contribution plans. Upon retirement, the worker sets the schedule for withdrawing the money.\n\n“Longevity,” Copeland said, “is the key factor in that equation.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/12"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/06/02/health/work-and-aging-life-itself-wellness/index.html", "title": "At 99, iconic producer Norman Lear doesn't want to quit working ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAmerican producer, writer and director Norman Lear, creator of such iconic 1970s television characters as the bigoted blowhard Archie Bunker in the sitcom “All in the Family,” turns 100 in July.\n\nOn Thursday, at an early celebration for Lear at the Life Itself conference, a health and wellness event presented in partnership with CNN, he told the audience his secrets to living to a ripe old age: Lox and bagels, the love of his family, laughter and a life of invigorating work.\n\n“I like getting up in the morning with something on my mind, something I can work on … to some conclusion,” Lear said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback At 100 years, what does aging mean to Norman Lear? 01:33 - Source: CNN\n\nOver the last century, Lear has done it all. He was executive producer of the cult movie classics “The Princess Bride” and “Fried Green Tomatoes” and was nominated for an Academy Award for best screenplay for “Divorce American Style.” His sitcom spinoffs of “All in the Family” dominated ’70s and ‘80s television, tackling topics of racism, feminism and social inequalities no one had yet dared touch. His political advocacy even led to the establishment of the liberal political organization People for the American Way.\n\nEven in his 90s, a time when most people who live that long are lucky to be rocking on their front porch, Lear has never stopped working. Along with Jimmy Kimmel, a 95-year-old Lear produced and hosted three episodes of “Live in Front of a Studio Audience,” which won Primetime Emmy Awards in 2019 and 2020. The series used current stars such as Jamie Fox, Woody Harrelson and Viola Davis to re-create original episodes of “The Jeffersons,” “All in the Family” and “Good Times.”\n\nIn recent years, Lear and his business partner Brent Miller rebooted some of his ’70s sitcom successes, including “One Day at a Time.” They also have several movies and other projects in the works.\n\nOne secret to his work longevity, Lear has said, is his attitude toward stress. During his ’70s sitcom heyday, Lear was juggling up to hit eight successful television series: “All in the Family,” “Maude,” “Sanford and Son,” “Good Times,” “The Jeffersons,” “One Day at a Time,” “Archie Bunker’s Place” and “Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman.”\n\nYet in his 2014 book, “Even This I Get to Experience,” Lear wrote that period of his life was full of “joyful stress.”\n\n“Even doing your best work and enjoying the results of that, there is a reasonable amount to a great amount of stress,” Lear told Variety last year. “And if one can learn to accept that joyfully, one can be stressed and understand that he or she is having a good time also. And so, I’ve enjoyed an awful lot of that through my career.”\n\nThe science of stress\n\nResearch shows that stress can be good for you – especially if you share Lear’s attitude. Viewing stress as a normal, acceptable and even positive part of life can lead to resilience, and just like rock, paper, scissors … resilience covers stress.\n\nBut does that mean everyone should follow Lear’s lead and work long past the traditional retirement age?\n\n“Research shows people who work longer are healthier and people who are healthier work longer. So, it’s really tempting to look at that correlation and be like, ‘Ah, this means that working longer will make you live longer.’ But it’s much more complicated,” said sociologist Beth Truesdale, a research fellow at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research.\n\n“If you’re in a job where you have control over your working environment and can make choices that allow you to take care of your family, then you’re lucky, and in that case, job stress can be challenging but satisfying,” she said. “But for many people, especially those without college degrees, jobs are incredibly stressful because they have very little control.”\n\nThe reality of retirement\n\nIn reality, Lear is one of a “tiny, tiny minority” of fortunate people who found a job that might nourish them financially and physiologically as they age, said Truesdale, the coeditor of a soon-to-be-published book called “Overtime: America’s Aging Workforce and the Future of ‘Working Longer.’ “\n\n“We hear these wonderful stories about people who could retire if they wanted to, but they choose to keep working because that’s what they want to do,” Truesdale said. “But we don’t hear the stories that balance that, such as people forced to retire at 57 because their life’s work was physically demanding, and their back and knees gave out.\n\n“Then it’s years before they turn 65 and can draw Social Security or qualify for Medicare,” she added. “And for a lot of people in a middle- to lower-class economic group, that means ending up below the poverty line.”\n\nIt’s not just poor health that might force people into retirement long before they might wish (or can afford), Truesdale said. Being a member of the “sandwich generation” and taking care of an older family member can force middle-aged adults, especially women, out of work. Age discrimination is another unfortunate reality for many older workers, she added.\n\n“And statistics show nine out of 10 people who involuntarily lose their jobs in their 50s and early 60s never again get a job that pays as well as the one they lost,” she said.\n\nDespite his age, Lear continues to use his skills to be successful in his work, and his wit and humor remain razor-sharp.\n\nHowever, many people are less fortunate, as can be seen in the growing number of older people being diagnosed with dementia and Alzheimer’s. That’s why making early, brain-healthy choices such as getting enough sleep, reducing stress, exercising and eating well are key factors in deciding about working and retirement, said Harvard Medical School neurologist Rudy Tanzi, director of the Genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.\n\n“You want to sleep well and handle stress, with mindful meditation and managing your expectations about social media and the like,” Tanzi said. “You want positive social interactions because loneliness is a risk factor for Alzheimer’s – not being alone but loneliness.\n\n“Exercise induces neurogenesis and removes amyloid and stops brain inflammation,” Tanzi added, “while learning new things to make new brain synapses is like money in the bank.”\n\nThe severity of cognitive impairment as you age correlates with loss of brain synapses, “so the more synapses you make every day, the more you can lose,” Tanzi said. “So, when you want to retire, don’t just think about your financial reserve and how long that will last. Think about your synaptic reserves and how long they are going to last.”\n\nThere are also other ways to keep your brain and body healthy than work, Truesdale said, such as spending quality time with friends and family, practicing hobbies and doing meaningful volunteer work, which studies have shown are important to healthy aging.\n\n“People do many fulfilling activities they may have never had time to do when they were in paid employment, which keep them active and give them a great sense of meaning and satisfaction,” she said. “Yes, stay active as you age. But the idea that work is the only way to do that doesn’t make sense.”", "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "publish_date": "2022/06/02"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2015/10/31/credit-dotcom-living-longer-finances/74743012/", "title": "Will you live too long for your own good?", "text": "Christine DiGangi\n\nCredit.com\n\nIn the past 20 years, the life expectancy of the average American increased about two years, according to the World Health Organization. Getting to hang around for a few more years means more time to travel, bond with family or do whatever it is you want to do. Of course, you'll need money to check off items on your bucket list, which could be a problem.\n\nA new report from organizations of actuaries in Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. says people tend to underestimate how long they'll live and don't understand the risk that poses to their financial stability. Some of the biggest obstacles people face in saving for retirement are getting information on how to save and understanding what's considered adequate savings for retirement. The researchers say consumers and policymakers alike need to be better educated about financial planning for the population's increasing longevity.\n\nWhen today's 65-year-olds were born in 1950, the average American had a life expectancy of 68.2, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of 2013, it was 78.8 years. Traditionally, Americans think of the retirement age as 65 or close to it, based on when they can start collecting full Social Security retirement benefits, but sticking to that traditional retirement age means you'll probably need to save a lot more than Americans have in the past. Given the historical increase in life expectancy as time goes on, today's young workers may need to save for decades of retirement (though, studies have suggested, they may not retire in their 60s, because of increasing student loan debt and changes in money-management styles among young people).\n\nGetting retirement ready\n\nThere are many calculators that can help you figure out how much you need to save in order to maintain your standard of living after you stop working. To save adequately, your options are to work beyond the traditional retirement age, save more now or some combination of the two. Failing to save enough may put you in a situation where you work longer than you want to, live on less than you planned or go into debt trying to sustain your standard of living.\n\nNot only do you probably want to avoid debt in retirement, but minimizing it in your working years may help you achieve long-term financial stability. Debt costs a lot of money — and if you have bad credit, it will cost you more — and can be difficult to escape. (You can see what shape your credit is in by checking your credit scores for free on Credit.com.)\n\nNo matter where you are in life, make it a priority to get out of debt, as well as figure out how much you need to save now in order to reach your future goals.

Modern pensions are largely confined to the public sector, where unions have helped keep them alive.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean pensions aren’t popular.\n\nMost Americans equate the pension with the American Dream\n\nIn a recent survey by the nonprofit National Institute on Retirement Security, more than three-quarters of respondents agreed with the statement: “The disappearance of traditional pensions has made it harder for workers to achieve the American Dream.”\n\nMore than two-thirds of those surveyed opined that pensions do more than 401(k)s to “help workers achieve a secure retirement.”\n\nThe survey, conducted in October 2023 by Greenwald Research, covered a demographically balanced sample of 1,208 adults.\n\nThe finding is unusual if only because of how seldom surveys ask Americans about pensions.\n\n“It’s been kind of a moot point in the private sector,” said Craig Copeland, director of wealth benefits research at the Employee Benefit Research Institute.\n\nThe survey, published in February, comes from a nonpartisan think tank whose leaders “think pensions serve workers very well,” said Dan Doonan, the group’s executive director.\n\nTraditional pensions typically offer a guaranteed monthly benefit to retirees, a steady stream of checks that continues until death.\n\nThe 401(k), by contrast, offers a way for employees to build their own retirement savings, often with help from the employer. Upon retirement, the retiree largely decides how quickly or slowly to spend the money.\n\nFor the modern job-seeker, the pension has nostalgic appeal\n\nTo modern job-seekers, the pension has a nostalgic appeal. Many consider it the gold standard of retirement benefits.\n\n“When you’re asked, ‘Do you like a pension?’ Yes, of course I do. It’s kind of like asking, ‘Do you like ice cream?’” said Anqi Chen, a senior economist and retirement researcher at Boston College.\n\nWith traditional pensions, employers bear most of the risks that come with promising workers a steady stream of income, often decades in the future.\n\n“You’re promising these benefits 30, 40 years before you have to pay them out,” Chen said. “How is the market going to play out over 30, 40 years?”\n\nAnother imponderable: How long is the retiree going to live?\n\nOver the years, private companies gradually shifted from pensions to 401(k)s, which are generally cheaper and entail far fewer risks for the company. Indeed, the 401(k) transfers most of the risk to the worker.\n\n“The beauty of traditional pensions is that I work, I don’t really have to deal with any investment returns… and then I retire, and I get essentially a retirement paycheck on top of my Social Security,” said David John, a senior strategic policy adviser at the AARP Public Policy Institute.\n\nWith a 401(k), he said, “you have to make a decision at the end of your working life: ‘What am I going to do with this money?’ And that is a complex and confusing decision that one has to make. It’s scary.”\n\nThough popular, pensions are far from perfect\n\nBut pensions are far from perfect. And, according to experts, the golden age of pensions is more myth than fact.\n\nPension participation peaked at around two-fifths of the private workforce in the 1970s, according to Andrew Biggs, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n“The reality is that most people never participated in a pension, and most people who participated in a pension never got a benefit,” he said.\n\nDecades ago, private employers might require workers to log 25 or 30 years to qualify for a pension, John said.\n\nPensions delivered retirement security to millions of factory workers. Yet, minimum-wage employees never had real access to pensions, Copeland said.\n\nWorkers who change jobs frequently might never qualify for a traditional pension. By contrast, workers seldom face long waits to enroll in a 401(k).\n\nWill pensions make a comeback?\n\nTwo developments in 2023 seeded enthusiasm that the pension might be making a comeback.\n\nStriking autoworkers made headlines by demanding the return of traditional pensions for some workers. They didn’t get the pensions back, but the bold ask illustrated their enduring appeal.\n\nAnd IBM announced a return to defined benefits for U.S. workers, a plan akin to a traditional pension. Instead of contributing matching funds to employee 401(k)s, IBM would make automatic contributions to Retirement Benefit Accounts.\n\n“It’s been difficult to have conversations about starting new pensions,” Doonan said. “But I think we’re starting to see the conversation shift a little bit.”\n\nBut IBM caught flak for its new retirement plan. Removing the 401(k) match robbed employees of an incentive to save more, critics said, and workers lost control of how to invest their retirement funds.\n\nIn any case, retirement experts do not envision many more corporations reviving the traditional pension.\n\n“The main aversion is that they are expensive for the employer,” John said. “All of the decisions and all of the risks fall on the employer, rather than the employee. It’s expensive, and it’s complex.”\n\nHow expensive? Biggs estimates a pension might cost an employer a sum equivalent to 20% of each worker’s salary. A 401(k) match is a lot cheaper.\n\nMore:What if the government abolished your 401(k)? Economists say accounts aren't worth it\n\n“Let’s say they contribute 3% of pay to a 401(k),” he said. “They could give you a defined-benefit pension if they take away another 17% of your pay.”\n\nAnd that, of course, would mean a lower salary for the worker.\n\n“The question, to me, is not, Would you want to have a pension?” he said. “It’s, 'What are you willing to give up in order to have a pension?' Because you’re not going to get it for nothing.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2016/04/19/older-ceos-issue-knowing-when-bow-out/83114728/", "title": "For older CEOs, issue is knowing when to bow out", "text": "Marco della Cava, and Charisse Jones\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nCorrections and clarifications: An earlier version of the Oldest CEOs listing accompanying this story misidentified the current CEO of PPG Industries. Chart data has been updated to reflect the change.\n\nThe American workforce is getting grayer, and that includes the chief executives at the top of the food chain.\n\nOver the past decade, the number of CEOs ages 65 to 69 nearly doubled to 36, while those ages 70 to 74 increased from nine to 13, according to a survey of Fortune 500 CEOs by management consulting firm Korn Ferry.\n\nJust as older employees stay in jobs out of desire or necessity, some of those occupying the C-suite aren’t eager to head into retirement. The length of time that executives cling to the leadership reins was brought into sharp focus with the recent drama of former Viacom and CBS executive chairman Sumner Redstone, 92, who stepped down in early February amid concern over his mental competence.\n\nMany of the more distinguished senior leaders’ names are familiar, such as investing guru Warren Buffett, 85, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, and media baron Rupert Murdoch, 85, executive chairman of News Corp. and Twenty-First Century Fox. Less known are people such as Leslie Wexner, CEO of L Brands, 78, and Ellen Gordon, 84, who took the top spot at Tootsie Roll last year after her CEO husband, Melvin, died at 95.\n\nDuring the past 10 years, the average Fortune 500 CEO age has inched up to 58 from 56, according to Korn Ferry. This reflects the overall aging of the U.S. workforce as Baby Boomers continue working long past traditional retirement age. By 2022, 31% of those ages 65 to 74 will still be working, up from 20% in 2002, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe issues raised by this demographic shift range from the potentially ageist nature of mandatory retirement policies to the need for corporate boards push for succession planning. The balancing act between valuing experience while keeping companies vibrant is bound to grow more contentious as the desire to stay at the helm potentially threatens a younger generation’s ability to take charge.\n\n“It’s about performance, competence and engagement, not chronological age,” says Paul Irving, chairman of the Center for the Future of Aging at the Milken Institute. Age bias against older workers “is absurd and indefensible,” he says.\n\nTrue enough in the abstract. But when billions of dollars are at stake, shades of gray matter. Perhaps the most pressing concern for shareholders is simply whether or not an aging CEO depresses a company’s value.\n\nRedstone lawsuit by ex-girlfriend to proceed\n\nAGE CAN BENEFIT INVESTORS\n\nIn a few notable cases, stock prices rose upon the departures of older leaders. When Tootsie Roll’s Melvin Gordon died after leading the company for a half-century, the stock rose 7%. Shares of Viacom rallied after Redstone stepped aside.\n\nOther evidence suggests the wisdom that comes with age can benefit investors. According to an analysis of S&P Global Market Intelligence data that USA TODAY did last year, shares of companies with the oldest 10 CEOs were up 48.9% on average over a two-year period ending Jan. 25, 2015, topping the 39.5% average gain of the other stocks in the S&P 1500.\n\n“There are CEOs operating well into their 70s and beyond who are awesome, and you could argue you’re doing the company a disservice by removing them (at 65),” says Thomas Fuller, CEO of C-suite advisory firm Epsen Fuller Group. He is not a fan of the mandatory retirement policies that have been adopted by roughly half of the nation’s largest companies.\n\nFacebook CEO leads list of U.S.' youngest\n\nSuch policies typically require CEOs to step down at 65 and board members to retire at 72. The Age Discrimination in Employment Act specifically safeguards older workers for being laid off due to age, but the act is not valid for those in executive-level positions.\n\n“In our work, we try and advise boards (hiring CEOs) to take age off the table,” says Fuller. “Yes, there can be concerns that older CEOs may be more concerned with preserving their legacies. But you could also argue that older, seasoned CEOs will help a company avoid mistakes.”\n\n11 CEOs bust through $30M-a-year barrier\n\nBut even allowing for business brilliance, every CEO has his or her season.

At risk is the company’s very future, as talented employees can see in a CEO's tenacity a vanishing of their own career dreams.\n\nMark Rittmanic, CEO of private-company consultancy ForteOne, recalls one client who, while leading a company in his 80s, signed every company check as his company’s growth stalled.\n\n“One issue with people like that is truly talented people won’t work for them very long because they recognize they’re going to be stymied,” he says.\n\nSUCCESSION PLANNING CRITICAL\n\nThe smoothest transition? That’s the one from CEO to chairman, says Bhaskar Chakravorti, associate dean of international business and finance at Tufts University’s Fletcher School. He cites Bill Gates’ move at Microsoft as an example.\n\n“You step back from executive function but continue to lend your pattern recognition skills (while serving as) an effective partner to someone younger,” he says.\n\nBoards not inclined to plan for a handover of power could be forced to do so by activist investors, who may not be as gentle in their approach.\n\nThat certainly is on display in Silicon Valley – home to innumerable young CEOs – where activist investors have been aggressive in their approach to restructuring leadership positions at Yahoo, where CEO Marissa Mayer, 40, has failed to pull off her promised turnaround of the ailing tech giant.\n\n“Maybe five or so years ago, boards would fight activist investors, but now they look to see if maybe a change needs to be made,” says Mark Rogers, corporate governance expert and CEO of BoardProspects.com.\n\nRogers says that today “boards, who are influenced by shareholders, are much more mindful of the ages of CEOs at publicly traded companies. You could easily have a case where a 70-year-old CEO is doing a great job, but most boards will still look at that carefully. Even if a lot of that talk won’t play out publicly.”\n\nFounders make great CEOs. Here's why\n\nLOOK OUT FOR A THREE-LETTER WORD\n\nIn the end, the C-suite age versus experience debate would seem to boil down to a singular and critical element that CEOs and boards alike should watch out for: ego.\n\nWhen the company’s best interest is in focus, age often takes a back seat as still-sharp 70- and 80-year-old leaders leverage deep expertise to steer a course through rough financial waters.\n\nBut any time titanic personalities with long corporate histories factor into the picture, stepping away can become tantamount to professional suicide, something to be rejected even if a company’s future hangs in the balance.\n\n“With people like Redstone and Murdoch and so many others, their persona and personality is so firmly attached to the company itself that quite often the lines get blurred,” says Chakravorti, noting that in seeing their organization as an extension of themselves such CEOs find the idea of leaving abhorrent.\n\nBut, he adds, life wisdom and years of dealmaking acumen aside, “every organization at some point deserves a fresh injection of leadership.”\n\nContributing: Jon Swartz and Matt Krantz\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporters on Twitter: @marcodellacava; @charissejones; @jswartz; @mattkrantz", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/19"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/01/14/traditional-or-roth-401k-which-to-choose-in-2024/72224400007/", "title": "Traditional or Roth 401(k)? Which to choose in 2024", "text": "Chuck Saletta\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nYour retirement is likely the largest financial goal you have. If you have a 401(k) available at work, it can be an incredibly powerful tool in your arsenal to help you save for that goal. With annual contribution limits as high as $23,000 for people under age 50 or $30,500 for those age 50 and up, you might even be able to become a millionaire by retirement from your 401(k) alone.\n\n401(k) plans come in two distinct styles: traditional and Roth. The differences between them can have a big impact on both your current financial situation and what your overall financial profile looks like in retirement. If you've got both available to you in 2024, choosing between them might seem a bit daunting at first. This article can help you weigh several key factors to come up with a great decision for yourself.\n\nWhat are the key differences between the two?\n\nIn a Traditional 401(k), the money you contribute comes out of your paycheck before tax. While inside the plan, that money grows tax-deferred. Once you reach a standard retirement age (typically 59 and a half), you can withdraw the money from your plan without penalties, but you will pay ordinary income taxes on those withdrawals.\n\nIn a Roth 401(k), on the other hand, you contribute after-tax money to the plan. While inside it, the money again grows tax-deferred. Once you reach a standard retirement age, you can withdraw the money from your plan without facing penalties or ordinary income taxes.\n\nIn addition, once you reach age 73 (rising to 75 by 2033), you face required minimum distributions (RMDs) on the money inside your traditional 401(k). Starting in 2024, Roth 401(k) plans are no longer subject to those RMDs during the original account owner's life. That can make a big difference for retirees who have managed to build a substantial nest egg in their plans.\n\nWhy pick a traditional 401(k)?\n\nDespite the potential disadvantages once you reach retirement, there are still often good reasons to pick a traditional 401(k) over a Roth 401(k).\n\nFirst, because the money you contribute is tax-deductible, it is easier to come up with a significant amount of cash to invest. Say you're in the 24% Federal tax bracket and face a 5% state income tax rate. Every $1,000 you invest in a traditional 401(k) will cost you only around $710 of spendable income. If you're looking to make a major contribution to your retirement account, that difference can quickly add up.\n\nSecond, the tax trade-off can work to your advantage if you don't expect to have a huge nest egg in traditional-style retirement accounts by the time you hit retirement. Say you deposit $30,000 in a high-income year late in your career, and then, once you retire, a $30,000 withdrawal from your 401(k) is your only source of income in a year before you start Social Security. In that sort of situation, you can easily save money on taxes overall.\n\nThird, there are situations where financial benefits phase out based on your income level. If you buy your own health insurance, for instance, premium subsidies are based on your income and household size. Similarly, the child tax credit has income levels where the benefit starts to phase out. Getting the reduction in adjusted gross income that comes with a traditional 401(k) contribution may help you keep your income low enough to qualify for subsidies and benefits such as those.\n\nFourth, if you are part of the financial independence, retire early (FIRE) movement, you might want to put at least some money into a traditional 401(k). This is because strategies to access your retirement money early don't let you avoid the taxes on the gains in your Roth 401(k) for those early withdrawals.\n\nFifth, a traditional 401(k) can be a great source of money to tap to cover expensive healthcare costs later in life. This is because medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of the income of a person age 65 or up become deductible expenses. Even if a major medical expense means a very large withdrawal from a traditional 401(k) for a senior, the tax burden won't bite nearly as badly.\n\nWhy pick a Roth 401(k)?\n\nThe Roth 401(k) can be a clear winner for people who want to -- and are able to -- max out their retirement plan contributions throughout long stretches of their careers. This is because the contribution limits are the same whether you contribute to a Roth 401(k) or a traditional one. Since money in a Roth 401(k) is not taxed once you reach a standard retirement age, any given account balance in a Roth 401(k) translates to more spending power than the same balance in a traditional 401(k).\n\nIn addition, the Roth 401(k) can be a tremendous tool for people who start saving for retirement early in their careers. Compounding over the space of 45 years can potentially turn a single year's $20,000 contribution into over $1 million, all on its own. That can be a really nice bucket of completely tax-free money to have simply for forgoing a small tax break from that initial contribution.\n\nFinally, Roth 401(k)s no longer being subject to RMDs during the original account owner's life makes them great tools for keeping income down in retirement and for estate planning.\n\nFrom the perspective of keeping your income down in retirement, money can now be compounded in a Roth 401(k) for the duration of the original account owner's life. That means any dividends, interest, or capital gains in the account remain tax-free. When Roth 401(k)s were still subject to RMDs, if you invested the money once you withdrew it, it could be subject to investment-related taxes.\n\nWhen it comes to estate planning, your heirs would much prefer to inherit money from a Roth 401(k) than a traditional one. While both types of inherited 401(k)s are typically subject to RMDs (with certain exemptions for spouses), distributions from an inherited Roth 401(k) are tax-free. That's a huge benefit to heirs compared to distributions from an inherited traditional 401(k), which faces ordinary income taxes.\n\nGet started now\n\nIf you still can't decide whether to contribute to a Roth 401(k) or a traditional 401(k), you can split your contributions between the two if your employer allows. Just note that your contribution limits are the total you're allowed to contribute across both plans.\n\nEither way, it's still January 2024, so you still have most of the year ahead of you to get as much as you can into your 401(k). Make today the day you get started and improve your chances of reaching retirement with a financially comfortable nest egg.\n\nChuck Saletta has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

As of last year, the average balance for people aged 65 and older participating in one of its employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement plans stood at $279,997. Not bad.\n\nMost people would likely prefer more, and plenty of people certainly have less. Either way, an average nest egg of this size isn't too shabby given that most of these individuals will also be collecting at least some Social Security retirement benefits.\n\nYou can do better than the average, though, particularly if you're closer to the beginning of your career than the end of it. Here are the four most important actions to take right now – if you haven't taken them yet – if you'd like to give yourself a chance at beating the average by age 65.\n\n1. Start as soon as possible, even if you're not really ready\n\nThe reasons for not participating in a company-sponsored 401(k) plan are reasonable enough. Chief among them is the reality that once all the bills are paid, there's just not enough left over from your paycheck. This is especially true for young adults who may be starting out their careers with below-average paychecks and above-average expenses, including student loans. It's not easy.\n\nThis is the time for young people to make a point of proverbially digging deep. That is to say, this is an important time to do anything you can feasibly do to sock away even small amounts of savings toward retirement – even if it means reducing some of your discretionary – \"fun\" – expenses.\n\nBecause the younger you are, the more time you have until retirement, and time is your biggest ally when it comes to building a retirement fund. For perspective, $1,000 invested in an S&P 500 index fund will be worth about $2,600 a decade from now, assuming it achieves average annual returns of 10%. Twenty years from now, however, that $1,000 will grow to something in the ballpark of $6,700. The 30-year end result will be around $17,500. And how much will a $1,000 investment in the S&P 500 be worth 40 years from now? Around $45,000.\n\nThere comes a point when the gains made on your previous gains are far greater than the benefit of adding more funds to the account in the meantime. You just need to start somewhere, even if that start seems too small to make a difference.\n\n2. Qualify for 100% of your employer's matching contributions\n\nMost employers will also help you accelerate your 401(k) account's growth even if you're only setting aside small amounts.\n\nThey do so with matching contributions. As the name suggests, employers will match savings you put in your 401(k) with a contribution of their own. This benefit will vary from one company to the next, but employers will commonly match contributions on a one-to-one basis or at $0.50 on the dollar. And the maximum they're willing to chip in often ranges from 3% to 6% of your annual salary.\n\nIt may be challenging to forego as much as 6% of your wages to save for retirement, but this is essentially free money, so every effort should be made to claim 100% of this benefit.\n\n3. Explore all of your retirement account options\n\nJust because your employer will only match up to 3% or 6% of your salary in a 401(k) doesn't necessarily mean you have to stop there. You can contribute up to $23,000 of your wages to a 401(k) account in 2024, all of which is tax deductible.\n\nIf you've got more to work with or don't love the investment options in your company's retirement plan, no problem. You may also be eligible to contribute to a traditional IRA or a Roth IRA.\n\nThe tax-deductibility of contributions to a traditional IRA depends on a combination of your income and whether or not you're able to participate in an employer-sponsored plan. And although Roth contributions are never tax deductible (because withdrawals come out tax-free), higher earners may not be eligible to contribute to such an account at all. Still, it makes sense to explore all of your tax-advantaged savings options within and outside of your company-sponsored plan.\n\n4. If you've got 10 or more years to go, prioritize growth\n\nLast but not least, don't forget to actually invest the money you've put into a 401(k) account. Too many people go through the trouble of enduring the budgetary sacrifice of making contributions but then let these savings sit idle.\n\nHow you choose to invest this money is up to you, but most work-sponsored 401(k) plans offer a wide array of mutual fund options ranging from growth-seeking funds to value funds to dividend-oriented funds and more. While all of these choices have their appeal to certain sorts of investors, people with 10 or more years until retirement should prioritize growth. Although growth stocks tend to be more volatile than other options, they're usually worth it in the long run due to their bigger returns. With 10 or more years to work with, you've got time to ride out the additional volatility.\n\nThat being said, do embrace the fact you're likely better served by using index funds than actively managed funds whether your goal is growth, safety, or income.\n\nMost actively managed mutual funds meant to outperform the overall stock market don't actually do so. Standard & Poor's reports that over the course of the past year only 40% of large-cap mutual funds available to investors in the U.S. did better than the S&P 500. Over the past five years, nearly 80% of these funds trailed the benchmark index. In the past decade, 87% of these large-cap mutual funds lagged the S&P 500's overall returns.\n\nGiven how difficult it is for these professional money managers to beat the market, accepting a market-matching result with simple index funds is still a smart-money move for your 401(k) account.\n\nJames Brumley has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

An insurance quality evaluator from New York's Long Island, Cronin also has two pensions (one from a former company). Her husband, Bill, also has a pension from his teaching job.\n\nThey've always had an emergency fund. And they set up college savings for their kids, ages, 5 and 7, soon after they were born. \"We're more prepared than most,\" said Cronin.\n\nStill, she's worried about their retirement. \"I know we're going to have to set aside more or we won't have enough,\" she said. \"It makes me nervous.\"\n\nThat's an increasingly common concern among members of Generation X as they edge closer to their 50s.\n\nMuch of the research on retirement readiness has focused on Baby Boomers, who are turning 65 at a rate of 10,000 a day and seem woefully ill-prepared as a group. (A GAO analysis released this week found that among households with members age 55 or older, nearly 29% have no retirement savings or pension plan.)\n\nBut in a new multi-generational survey by Northwestern Mutual, Gen X respondents reported the highest levels of financial insecurity of the four generations. Their number one concern: having enough savings to retire comfortably. Two-thirds said they expect to have to work past traditional retirement age out of necessity, and 18% believe they'll \"never retire.\"\n\n\"There's an increasing shifting of financial responsibility onto individuals' shoulders,\" said Rebekah Barsch, vice president of financial planning at Northwestern Mutual. \"And Generation X will be the first generation to really feel the effect of that.\"\n\nAnd without some major changes, advisers say, it could be painful.\n\nGen X, which includes those born between 1965 and 1980, is the first generation to experience the shift from traditional pension plans to 401(k)s and individual retirement plans.\n\nAnd they'll hit retirement age just as the Social Security program's trust fund is projected to run dry, around 2033. Not surprisingly, a whopping 80% of Gen Xers in the Northwestern Mutual study said they don't expect Social Security to take care of their needs. (The study was conducted by Harris Poll and included responses from 813 Gen X members.)\n\nRead More:41% expect no Social Security benefits\n\n\"It used to be, keep your nose down and keep working and you'll be taken care of,\" said Andrew W. Ferraro, a certified financial planner with Strategic Wealth Partners in Columbus, Ohio. \"For Gen X, it shifted to: Keep working hard, but it's on you to take care of your retirement because it's not our responsibility to take care of you anymore.\"\n\nHaving the discipline and foresight to set money aside throughout your career is challenging enough; but with longer lifespans and growing health care expenses, even estimating how much you'll need to fund your retirement can be a challenge. In the Northwestern Mutual survey, 34% of Gen Xers said they have no idea how much income they need to retire.\n\nThere are general benchmarks to guide them, but most savers are falling short.The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, for example, estimates that in order to maintain their lifestyle in retirement, households need about 70% of pre-retirement income on average.\n\nUnder current laws, Social Security can replace about 36% of retirees' final inflation-adjusted earnings. In order to make up the difference, the center estimates savers need to set aside about 15% of their pay over the course of 30 years to retire comfortably.\n\nRead More:Older Americans fall short on retirement savings\n\nBut only 12% of Gen Xers are putting more than 15% of their income into savings, according to a Bankrate survey released in April. Nearly 4 in 10 were putting aside 5% or less of their incomes.\n\nFor them, it could be particularly challenging to catch up. The Center for Retirement Research estimates that those who start saving at 45 and hope to retire at 65 will need to save a whopping 27% of their income each year. That drops to 10%, though, if they can put off retirement until they're 70.\n\nThat may be more realistic for many Gen Xers, as they're often facing more immediate financial needs. Many are not just taking care of themselves but children, and sometimes aging parents, as well. Andthey tend to carry more debt than other generations — in particular, student loan balances. Those in their 30s and 40s have the highest average student loan debt among borrowers, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nRead More:Strategies to cover college costs, for less\n\n\"Aside from weathering a number of economic cycles, this group is juggling home mortgages, educational debt and lifestyle needs,\" said Barsch. \"Figuring out how to plan for the future can be daunting.\"\n\nIndeed, another recent survey by the New York chapter of AARP found that Gen Xers are even more nervous than their predecessors about funding their retirements. More than 6 in 10 said they're somewhat or very anxious about having enough money to live comfortably once they retire, and a quarter said they weren't confident they would ever be able to retire.\n\nCronin, who participated in the survey, and her husband each put about 5% of their income into retirement accounts annually. \"But we know that's not going to be enough,\" she said, even with their pensions.\n\nThe challenge is that they're simultaneously paying off more than $30,000 in student loan debt and saving money for their kids' education. \"I'd put more money aside in our retirement if I didn't have that debt, but it's there,\" she said.\n\nShe and her husband are diligently chipping away at the loan balance and hope to have it paid off in the next three to five years. Then, she said, they can start boosting their retirement savings—assuming other major expenses don't crop up.\n\nMORE FROM CNBC:\n\n'Seinfeld'' cast made money hand over fist\n\nCramer: I was just plain wrong about this stock\n\nFiorina and husband unveil net worth\n\nRussia faked MH17 images: Report\n\nWhy Greece could erupt into complete chaos\n\nCramer: Buy on the dip of 3 high-flying stocks?", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/06/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2024/02/08/case-against-401k-ira-retirement-tax-breaks/72506433007/", "title": "401(k) and IRA retirement tax breaks don't benefit many Americans", "text": "In a recent paper, two economists from opposing ideological camps made a provocative case: The federal government should abolish the 401(k) and Individual Retirement Account, the tax-sheltered savings plans that help millions of Americans fund their golden years.\n\nAllowing people to shelter their retirement money from taxes is a policy that largely favors the well-heeled, they said. Congress could use that money, nearly $200 billion a year in lost tax dollars, to shore up the underfunded Social Security program.\n\nTheir suggestion created a stir. One social media post has drawn more than 700,000 views.\n\n\"We do not think that this subsidy, which you can only rationalize if it increases saving ... we don't think it does increase saving very much,\" said Alicia Munnell, an assistant treasury secretary under President Clinton. She co-wrote the brief with Andrew Biggs, a senior fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute.\n\nHere's why economists are coming for your 401(k)\n\nWhy, then, are economists coming after your 401(k)?\n\nThat employee retirement plan and its personal savings counterpart, the Individual Retirement Account, were created to help Americans save for retirement.\n\nBut federal data suggests tax-favored retirement accounts help only some Americans, and wealthy Americans in particular.\n\nFor households in the top 10% by income, the median retirement account held $559,000 in 2022, according to the Survey of Consumer Finances. An overwhelming 93% of those households held retirement plans.\n\nFor middle-income Americans, those in the 40th to 60th percentile by income, the median retirement plan held just $39,000, and nearly half of that group had no retirement savings.\n\nMany smaller employers don't offer 401(k) plans. Even when they do, workers might balk at participating, because they can't spare the income or they're afraid they might need to withdraw it later on, triggering tax penalties.\n\n\"Income for a lot of workers is very unpredictable,\" said Monique Morrissey, senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.\n\nA looming crisis in retirement savings\n\nMany researchers believe America faces a crisis in retirement savings. Fewer than half of us have retirement accounts, Census data show. Even among those nearing retirement, ages 56 to 64, the share with retirement accounts lagged below 60% in 2020.\n\nWithout a retirement account, most retirees depend on Social Security. But monthly Social Security checks averaged about $1,800 in 2023. The typical household run by someone 65 or older spends $4,345 a month, according to a BlackRock analysis of federal statistics.\n\nThe 401(k) and IRA emerged in the 1970s and gained popularity as tools for Americans to build savings for retirement. Over the years, the plans have gradually replaced traditional pensions, which deliver monthly benefits to retired workers. From 1975 to 2019, active private sector pension participants dwindled from 27 million to fewer than 13 million, according to a congressional report.\n\nAs investments, tax-advantaged retirement plans are “a really good deal,” said Damon Jones, a University of Chicago economist. The government doesn’t tax income contributed to a traditional 401(k) or IRA. You pay taxes when you withdraw the money in retirement.\n\nThe tax breaks cost the federal government about $185 billion a year in lost revenue, according to Treasury Department estimates for 2020.\n\nYet, millions of Americans don’t take advantage of tax-favored retirement savings − or can't. Nearly half of workers have no access to a retirement plan at work, according to one AARP analysis.\n\nTo encourage retirement savings, several states have adopted \"automated savings\" programs, automatically enrolling hundreds of thousands of workers in retirement plans overseen by the states.\n\nAutomated savings plans target workers whose employers don't offer retirement plans, with an ultimate goal of raising the rate of employees who save for retirement. Retirees who can't fund their retirement put a massive strain on social services.\n\nLower-income Americans miss out on retirement tax breaks\n\nMany lower-income Americans have more pressing priorities than saving for retirement.\n\n“Most people, middle-class or lower, struggle to put food on the table and a roof over their head, and they don’t have the money left over to save,” said Steve Rosenthal, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center.\n\nWealthier Americans, on the other hand, tend to take full advantage of the tax perks. According to research by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, three-fifths of the retirement savings tax benefits go to people in the top 20% of Americans by income. More than four-fifths go to people in the top 40%.\n\n“The fundamental problem with our retirement system is it rewards people who need no help,” Rosenthal said. “All the schemes are oriented toward rewarding those who have the savings or the income to reap the benefits.”\n\nThe whole point of the tax subsidies was to encourage more Americans to save for retirement, say the authors of the research brief, published by the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College.\n\nBut that hasn’t happened. From 1989 to 2022, the share of workers ages 25 to 64 who participate in employer-sponsored retirement plans has risen 2 percentage points, from 51% to 53%, the researchers found.\n\n“They’re basically saying we ought to call it quits on our retirement tax system because it’s broken. And it is broken,” Rosenthal said.\n\nMany in the financial industry applaud tax-favored retirement plans\n\nAgreement on that point is far from unanimous, and some in the retirement industry greeted the new research with vitriol.\n\nBrian Graff, chief executive of the American Retirement Association, flagged the paper on LinkedIn with the comment, \"No, it's not April 1st. . . and I personally cannot think of a more preposterous idea.\"\n\nMuch of the financial services industry applauds tax-favored retirement plans, saying they deliver a dignified retirement to millions of lower- and middle-income Americans.\n\n“It’s not only the rich,” said Craig Copeland, director of wealth benefits research at the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit that works with benefit providers. “A lot of middle-class people have 401(k)s, and typically, that’s the bulk of their savings outside of their homes.”\n\nStrip away the tax benefits, Copeland says, and employers would lose their incentive to offer retirement savings in the first place. Companies use 401(k) plans to attract workers, and employers reap their own tax savings by administering the plans.\n\n“Most of these plans wouldn’t exist if there wasn’t a tax preference for them,” he said.\n\nAbolishing the tax subsidies “is not going to hurt the wealthy,” Copeland said, “because the wealthy are going to save. It’s going to hit those middle-quartile people” − the middle class.\n\nEven the economists who wrote the brief concede there’s little chance Congress will abolish tax-favored retirement savings anytime soon.\n\n“I know they’re not going to repeal it tomorrow,” Munnell said. “But it should be part of the debate.”\n\nInstead of eliminating the tax benefits, the economists say, Congress could modify the subsidies so the programs reward responsible saving without lavishing tax breaks on the wealthy.\n\nFor example, the tax subsidy could be capped for savers who amass $500,000 or $1,000,000 in retirement money. Or, the tax benefit could be limited to the first $10,000 or $20,000 in annual contributions.\n\n'The economy is different now':Parents pay grown-up kids' bills with retirement savings\n\nAlternatively, Congress could lower the age by which savers must begin drawing down their retirement accounts. Instead of lowering that age, Congress has been raising it, from 70½ in 2019 to 75 in 2033.\n\n“If you’re troubled by how large these retirement plans are, you can limit what goes in,” Rosenthal said, “or you can limit what comes out.”\n\nDaniel de Visé covers personal finance for USA Today.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/retirement/2018/11/17/retirement-age-early-may-not-realistic/38533019/", "title": "Retirement age: Why dream of leaving work early may not be realistic", "text": "Maurie Backman\n\nThe Motley Fool\n\nMany workers look forward to retirement and all it symbolizes – a permanent break from the daily grind and the ability to pursue hobbies without restraint.\n\nBut while plenty of working folks have pretty much resigned themselves to retiring in their late 60s or 70s, most Americans would rather call it quits much earlier.\n\nThe ideal retirement age for U.S. workers today is 58 1/2, according to a new study by GOBankingRates. Whether that's realistic, however, is another story.\n\nThe challenges of early retirement\n\nThough retiring at any age means moving from a steady paycheck to a fixed income, there are certain challenges that come with retiring at the relatively young age of 58 1/2. For one thing, savings housed in a traditional IRA or 401(k) cannot be withdrawn without penalty prior to age 59 1/2. To retire a year earlier than that, therefore, hinges on having enough savings in a traditional bank or brokerage account to cover the bills until retirement funds can be tapped.\n\nLearn more: Best personal loans\n\nMore:Despite common usage, health savings accounts are helpful for retirement\n\nThen again, a large number of workers today won't get much from their IRAs or 401(k)s in retirement if they don't ramp up their savings efforts. An estimated 42 percent of working-age adults have less than $10,000 in long-term savings, which is hardly enough to have an impact during retirement, regardless of what age it starts at.\n\nThen there's Social Security to think about. Eligible seniors are allowed to start claiming benefits as early as age 62, which means that folks who retire at 58 1/2 can't access those benefits for a solid 3.5 years. Furthermore, filing at 62 means doing so ahead of full retirement age, and that's a dangerous move that could result in a permanent reduction in benefits – something that's apt to hurt seniors who don't have much in the way of savings.\n\nFinally, there's healthcare to think about. Medicare eligibility doesn't kick in until age 65, so retiring 6.5 years earlier means having to absorb the cost of health insurance independently.\n\nPlan ahead to retire early\n\nIf your goal is really to retire early, then there are steps you can take to make that happen, the most important of which is to save consistently beginning at an early age. If you were to start setting aside $600 a month at age 23 1/2 and continue through 58 1/2, you'd wind up with close to $1 million if your investments were to generate an average annual 7 percent return during that period. And since that 7 percent is a few percentage points below the stock market's average, it's certainly doable over a 35-year time frame.\n\nMore:Most women now see retirement as the 'most liberating phase' of their lives\n\nThat said, you'd also need to store some savings in a nontraditional retirement plan to gain penalty-free access to that money at age 58 1/2. But if you save in a Roth IRA, for example, or put some of your money into a traditional brokerage account, you can grow wealth and have easier access to your money later in life.\n\nDon't rush into retirement\n\nAlthough retiring early has its benefits, it can be challenging not just from a financial perspective, but a mental one as well. Going from full-time work to an unstructured schedule can result in a fair share of emotional upheaval, so much so that the risk of depression increases exponentially once retirement kicks in.\n\nIf you're eager to retire at 58 1/2, or thereabouts, because you're worried that you won't have enough time to fulfill your goals if you wait, consider that Americans are living longer these days, with 1 in 4 65-year-olds living past age 90 and 1 in 10 living past 95. Therefore, you might find that retiring in your 60s gives you the best of both worlds – access to the money, benefits and resources you need to stay afloat financially and enough time to do the things you've always wanted.\n\nMore:How to max out your retirement savings in 2019\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

The system will recognize paid time based on vehicle.\n\nBackground:In Ocean City, new parking system to shorten wait time\n\nOcean City has a similar “gateless” system at the Inlet parking lot, which costs $3.00 per hour and is free for cars that leave within 30 minutes. Visitors are required to put down how much time they expect to keep their cars parked.\n\nIf you don't leave the Inlet lot in time, you'll be fined for the amount of time spent in the lot, plus a $25 administrative fee. Expect that fee to double if you don't pay it within 30 days.

The shuttle service costs $3 to ride all day. Ocean City also offers a bus service that runs from downtown to Delaware state line.\n\nIn Delaware, there are two Park & Ride locations: The Lewes Park & Ride near Five Points at 17616 Coastal Highway and the Rehoboth Beach Park & Ride at Del. 1 and Shuttle Road.\n\nThe cost for the park and rides, which can be covered through the free DART Transit app, has not changed since 2018. Parking at the Lewes Park & Ride is free, while it costs $10 at Rehoboth but comes with free daily passes for passengers. Bus fees run $2 for a one-way pass, $4.20 for an all-day pass, $18 for a seven-day pass, or $65 for a 30-day pass.\n\nFor those who'd rather sit through the beach traffic and deal with downtown parking meters, here's a breakdown of parking rules from Ocean City north to Lewes.\n\nOcean City\n\nWhile most beach towns don’t begin charging for parking until mid-May, paid parking went into effect in the Maryland resort town on April 1, and continues through Oct. 1.\n\nParking at the Inlet Lot in downtown Ocean City costs $3 per hour while street and municipal parking at other town lots from downtown to 100th Street is $2 per hour.\n\nThe resort has switched to pay by plate parking so you will need to enter your license plate while paying at the kiosks located at the parking lots. Payment can be made by quarters, credit cards or ParkMobile app.\n\nFenwick Island\n\nLike its closest beach neighbors, Fenwick Island also offers free parking until May 15.\n\nParking permits are required from May 15 to Sept. 15 and can be purchased at the police department at 800 Coastal Highway. Permits cost $20 for a daily pass, $120 for a weekly pass or $400 for the summer season, according to Fenwick Island's website.\n\nSouth Bethany\n\nThere are no parking meters in South Bethany and parking permits are usually available with a rental home. Handicapped-accessible parking is available on Ocean Drive and South 3rd Street.\n\nPermits are not required until May 15.\n\nBethany Beach\n\nBethany Beach operates a similar schedule to Dewey, which means parking is free until May 15, according to Bethany Beach's website.\n\nAfter then, people will have to wait until Sept. 15 for parking to be free again.\n\nMeters in this beach town run $2 per hour while parking permit costs range from $27 to $183.\n\nDelaware Seashore State Park\n\nAs part of the Delaware state parks system, the beaches at Delaware Seashore State Park between Dewey and Bethany offer seaside parking options as part of the parks entrance fee.\n\nThis beach option will cost $5 a day for Delaware residents or $10 a day for out-of-state visitors. Annual passes also are available for $35 for residents or $70 for nonresidents. Discounts are available for seniors.\n\nDewey Beach\n\nFor two more weeks, parking in Dewey Beach also is free.\n\nStarting May 15, parking meters and permits are in effect from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m. until Sept. 15. Permits range from $10 for a one-day weekday pass to $200 for a seasonal pass and $2 an hour for the meter.\n\nPermits can be purchased at Town Hall at 105 Rodney Ave. or at the kiosk in front of Town Hall.\n\nParking is always free in Dewey Monday through Wednesday from 5-11 p.m.\n\nRehoboth Beach\n\nFor a few more weeks, parking in Rehoboth Beach is free.\n\nParking meters throughout the city do not go live until the Friday before Memorial Day (May 24), when they will increase to $3 an hour in the most prime seaside spots on Rehoboth, Baltimore and Wilmington avenues. All other meters in the city will remain $2 an hour from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. through the second Sunday after Labor Day.\n\nParking permits follow the same schedule. Their cost has increased $10 to $90 for weekly passes. All non-metered spots will require a permit starting May 24.\n\nLewes\n\nParking meters throughout the city and its beaches are in effect from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. May 1 through Oct. 14, according to the city's web page.\n\nThis year, parking fees at Beach No. 1 and Beach No. 2 on Savannah Road increased to $2 per hour. Feeding the meter at these beaches ends on Sept. 30, about two weeks earlier than other Lewes parking spots.\n\nThe following locations have meters that cost $1 per hour: 1812 Park, Canalfront Park, Second Street, Market Street, Bank Street, Front Street and the lot on 3rd Street.\n\nCredit cards are not accepted at the side-street parking meters.\n\nFree parking is available at Otis Smith Park on Savannah Road at the corner of Schley and Franklin avenues.\n\nDelmarva Now contributed to this report\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.\n\nMore: Ocean City's new movie theater on track for May opening\n\nMore: Gourds flying into the sea with Punkin Chunkin in Ocean City?

Restaurants are allowed to resume dine-in services, but only at 30% of their permitted capacity.\n\nMoving toward a new normal also means no more free parking in places like Bethany Beach and Rehoboth Beach, which have delayed the onset of parking meter charges as they struggled with a decline of springtime visitors. In Rehoboth, the meters will go into effect on Saturday, May 30; in Bethany and Lewes, on Monday, June 1.\n\nThis Memorial Day weekend, the crowds came out – but nowhere near what they would have been on a normal holiday weekend. In Rehoboth Beach, police officers handed out free face masks to those who didn’t have them. Visitors and family spread out on the beach, trying not to place blankets and umbrellas too closely.\n\nBut with restrictions on who was allowed to visit Delaware’s beaches remaining in place, it was a historic Memorial Day weekend – in a way that tourism officials would never brag about.\n\n“It was pretty uneventful,” said Rehoboth Beach Patrol Capt. Kent Buckson, who said it was a good weekend for him and his lifeguards because it was their first chance to be on duty this season. “Crowds were moderate to low, and obviously the weather helped keep people away. Just having the bad weather for three days kind of promoted social distancing.”\n\nAs the weather warms, though, and restrictions are lifted, that’s going to change.\n\nBusinesses rely on the spring months and Memorial Day weekend to give them a kick-start to summer financially. It’s a first shot at seeing how the season will play out, figuring out how much inventory they need and making sure their staffs are up to speed.\n\nA MEMORIAL DAY LIKE NO OTHER:Holiday weekend brings familiar summer scenes with a COVID-19 twist\n\nRestaurant and real estate experts say the height of the summer season kicks in closer to the end of June and runs through August. The fall months are also a boon with festivals that attract huge crowds – events that may not happen this year as social distancing efforts remain in place.\n\nThere will be no Fourth of July fireworks, one of the events that attracts an estimated 50,000 people to Rehoboth Beach, according to city officials.\n\n“That’s a big crowd and that’s not going to be there,” Everhart said. “We’re just looking forward to some good weather. “\n\nUPDATED RESTRICTIONS:As Delaware reopens, here's what's open and the rules\n\nAs coronavirus-related restrictions took effect in March and April, tourism officials and local leaders worried that without allowing short-term rentals and out-of-state visitors, there would be no way that the seasonal businesses at the beaches could survive. Even now, some are still worried about the fate of a few.\n\n“I encourage everybody to support the local businesses because I just worry about how many we will lose,” said Carol Everhart, president and CEO of the Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce. “We will lose some.”\n\nWeeks ago, the seven mayors that represent Delaware’s coastal resort towns outlined what they thought would be a feasible reopening. The letter they sent to Gov. John Carney raised concerns about overwhelming the two beach towns with boardwalks during a reopening, but also the economic impact if seasonal businesses had to rely on local influxes of cash alone.\n\nAs nearby resorts like Ocean City, Maryland, opened the floodgates to visitors, business owners and officials in Delaware worried that the spending dollars they’d normally see this time of year would drive right by and over the state line.\n\nRELATED:With short-term rentals still banned, Delaware locals fear visitors will leave for new beaches\n\nNow the beaches are open to sunbathing and swimming, people can start booking hotel rooms and vacation homes as of Monday, June 1.\n\nBut some of the damage has already been done.\n\nIn recent years, tourism officials have noted that the beaches aren’t quite as seasonal as they once were. The shoulder seasons in the spring and summer are extending as more big events like the Seawitch Festival attract people to Delaware’s coastline.\n\nEven in the dead of winter, people are still booking hotel rooms on the weekend to enjoy a quiet getaway at the beach.\n\n\"Tourism is a $42 billion industry to this state. Most of the tourism is in our area,\" Everhart said. \"How far are we into the year? Did we lose half? I don't know yet. But it’s gonna be significant.\"\n\nBacked by the numbers\n\nEverhart collects hotel occupancy data to compare visitation numbers season over season and year after year. Looking at 2020’s first quarter of hotel stays, it seemed like the year was on track to be better than the last.\n\nThen the novel coronavirus showed up.\n\nHotel occupancy numbers for hotels in the Rehoboth Beach and Dewey Beach areas from January through mid-May of this year are about half what they were for the same time period in 2019: 20,347 compared with 41,437, according to data compiled by Everhart. Weekend occupancy data looks at one weekend night, the one with the highest occupancy, which is usually Saturday, she said.\n\nThe second weekend of March, right before the first coronavirus case was confirmed in Delaware, those hotels' occupancy was recorded at 2,017 stays that Saturday, with 345 stays more than the same weekend in 2019.\n\nThen the numbers began to plummet. The following weekend, occupancy rates were at about half compared with 2019. By the weekend of April 24, there were only 51 recorded hotel stays compared with the 2,971 recorded the previous year.\n\nThis Memorial Day weekend, the chamber recorded only 248 stays on Saturday, compared with 3,265 for a weekend night during the holiday in 2019. This year, hotels were available only to essential employees and a few others excluded from the ban ordered by Carney.\n\nIn July, August and September, recent years have seen over 3,000 hotel stays – not to mention the thousands of other rentals available through private landlords, rental companies and online booking websites. As businesses begin to reopen, it remains unclear how much fear will play a role in keeping people away even when they're welcome to come visit.\n\nThat’s not just money lost by the hotel owners and their employees, Everhart said. It’s money lost that would be spent at local restaurants and businesses. It’s money lost that would go into the general fund to pay for everything from beach replenishment projects to grants for local community groups.\n\nNow that the short-term rental ban is set to lift Monday, June 1, hotel lobby phones are ringing off the hook with people looking to make reservations, said William Sullivan with the Delaware Hotel & Lodging Association.\n\n“They’re ready; they know how to do this safely,” Everhart said of the beach businesses. “It’s ready. It’s set. We’re just waiting for the go.”\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/05/28"}]}

Board", "text": "Most people understand the Brown v. Board of Education decision as one of the most definitive cases in education and American history. On Tuesday, though, a special panel looked to remind listeners of not only how closely Delaware is tied to that story — but how that relevance still echoes.\n\nThe decision, eventually stripping the country of its \"separate but equal\" doctrine across schools, just marked a 70th anniversary this month. Two cases from Delaware joined that landmark case at the Supreme Court, Bulah v. Gebhart and Gebhart v. Belton, led by Wilmington powerhouse attorney and civil rights advocate Louis L. Redding.\n\nDelaware Division of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion invited several speakers to dive into this intersection. State officials were joined by the Rev. JB Redding, daughter of Louis L. Redding; René Ricks-Stamps, daughter of plaintiff Shirley Bulah; Justice C.J. Seitz Jr., of the Delaware Supreme Court and son of late judge Collins J. Seitz; and James “Sonny” Knott, a 94-year-old former student of the very school they sat in. More names lined the list.\n\nSpeakers and a small audience packed Hockessin Colored School #107C for two hours of discussion, and the public livestream can still be watched. Here are just some key takeaways.\n\n\"We're standing on hallowed ground today,\" said Ricard Potter Jr., chief diversity officer within Delaware's Department of Human Resources. \"And hopefully this conversation will be one that enriches individuals who are in attendance, as well as an opportunity for us to have a call for action.\"\n\n'Trail to Desegregation':How one Wilmington bus tour honors 70th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education\n\nThe work is not over\n\nThis was never an instant solution.\n\nThough the 1954 decision called for an \"immediate\" stop to segregated schools, the reality would play out much more slowly. And in the very state with two cases fueling arguments, school segregation persisted in some areas until the late '60s. Impact was clear, but progress painfully lagged for many.\n\nAnd, Tuesday's speakers would argue, it has yet to be entirely achieved.\n\n\"Even today, Black students in our state and across the nation continue to face challenges that impact their academic success,\" said guest Rep. Kendra Johnson, speaking in opening comments. \"Issues such as unequal funding, resource gaps and racial discrimination are reminders that the promise of Brown v. Board of Education is yet to be fully realized.\"\n\nRedding echoed her thoughts as the panel heated up.\n\n\"I think the first thing to say is where we are not,\" said the daughter of Delaware's first Black attorney. \"That whatever brown the board did, it did not desegregate America. That right now, straight across the nation, north and south, any of our big cities but also rural areas, are as segregated as they were at the time required.\"\n\nThe state's own Redding Consortium has rooted its recent work in this reality, having been created in 2019 to recommend policies aimed at educational equity in Wilmington and the northern county. Legal and political decisions over decades, members write, have left the city with several racially identifiable, high-poverty schools — plagued with higher rates of crime, housing instability and poverty, alongside educator turnover and persistent underachievement.\n\nAnother familiar face on the panel came in Mark Holodick, secretary of the Delaware Department of Education.\n\n\"Equality and fairness have changed, and I would say improved, since the Brown decision,\" Holodick said. \"However, opportunities and outcomes for students of color — not so much.\"\n\nHe nodded to this consortium work, exploring how redistricting could be a first step in more systemic reform for Wilmington schools, which he senses an appetite for from the state board. He also called on necessary impact from a very similar body, charged with improving city schools: the Wilmington Learning Collaborative.\n\nBut statewide, Delaware is battling low proficiency among students of color, not leading such students to high levels of success in math and reading in particular. His department, Holodick told the panel, is particularly focused on trying to bolster elementary reading levels.\n\n\"We need to do something about our literacy rates in Delaware, particularly among students of color,\" he said, also quoting some counsel from activist Bebe Coker. \"Because we all know reading opens the door for everything else.\"\n\nJustice Seitz, of the Delaware Supreme Court, also noted the ongoing need for diversity in the law — having formed the Delaware Bench and Bar Diversity Project, back on the 67th anniversary of Brown. There's hope changemakers like his father won't be far and in between again.\n\n\"We have a huge amount of work and resources going in to education because that is, as we said today, that is the key to a long-term solution to getting greater diversity in the Delaware bar,\" the justice said.\n\nWilmington with two school districts?Delaware’s latest redistricting vision to take shape\n\nRemember Delaware's history\n\nWhen asked if segregation made him angry as a child, Louis L. Redding said no.\n\n\"It was not anger he felt,\" said Claire DeMatteis, Delaware's secretary of human resources, moderating the panel, \"but instead: 'Curiosity.'\"\n\nDuring the more than 50 years that he practiced law in Delaware, Redding handled cases that challenged discrimination in housing, public accommodations, employment and criminal justice. His two Delaware cases that consolidated under Brown v. Board of Education played out on New Castle County soil.\n\nIn 1951, the families of Ethel Louise Belton and Shirley Barbara Bulah hired Redding in separate cases, suing the state for refusing to provide transportation to attend the schools closest to their homes. Belton was required to attend Howard High School, a forced 20-mile round trip on public transportation, while living just blocks from all-white Claymont High. Bulah attended Hockessin Colored School #107-C, even though a white school would have been much closer for the 7-year-old.\n\n\"The quest to satisfy this curiosity changed the face of Delaware and shaped laws within our nation,\" DeMatteis said, noting the very decision joining this panel.\n\nSonny Knott, alongside nearly every speaker, stressed Delaware cannot forget this history. That is, both what these parents went through for their children's education, as well as the stories within the state's Black schools.\n\nHe remembers a vibrant community, in a close-knit one-room school with six grades and one teacher. But he also remembers missing pages in school books, given as hand-me-downs if the white schools upgraded.\n\n\"I love the opportunity to talk about the 107, and I encourage each and every one of you: Forget about today,\" the former student said to the crowd. \"Think about tomorrow and the next day in our future. Bring your kids here. There's a lot of history here. There's only about five of us left that spent their entire career at the 107.\"\n\nKnott's stories and many more fill the pages of another panelist's book. Lanette Edwards, author and school historian, published \"Hockessin Colored School #107C (Images of America)\" just last year.\n\nHockessin Colored School #107C ceased operations after desegregation. After a rocky road, the school has now been restored and transformed into a Center for Diversity and Social Equity. In 2022, President Joe Biden protected the site, having signed a law incorporating Hockessin Colored School #107 into the National Park System among other additions.\n\nRedding House Museum and Community Center, maintained by its own foundation, is now a historic landmark located near downtown Wilmington. Today's Howard High School of Technology was once the only high school serving Black students in the state and one of the earliest in the nation. Once-Claymont High is now the Claymont Community Center.\n\n\"The remarks you quoted from my father are what I would say are hopeful remarks,\" said Justice Seitz, noting passages from his father, who ruled on the Delaware Gebhart v. Belton case that conditions were unequal, and the only remedy to suffice would be integration.\n\n\"And I think he'd recognize the reality that the solutions to race relations in the United States are not going to be found in the courts; as he said, 'They have to be found in the hearts of people.' And I think events like today are so important because they eliminate or reduce complacency.\"\n\nGot a story?

Borak, a reporter for Sentinel Newspapers, during a reunion of the 1919 team nearly five decades ago.\n\n“We are all indebted to them for starting the game here and giving us the chance to play.”\n\nAccording to a hand-written account of South River’s first game from Kathryn Fee, the wife of James Fee, who was a member of the high school’s original team, Paul “Wrong Way” Schack intercepted a pass on the opening series.\n\n“Shortly after the kickoff,” Kathryn Fee wrote of the October 1919 contest against the Jamesburg Reform School, “Jamesburg threw a forward pass, which for some reason was incorrectly aimed and was about to hit one of the South River players in the face. To protect himself, (Schack) held up his hands and the ball landed in his grasp. On shouts of ‘run, run run’ the player did just that.”\n\n“When I crossed the goal line, the fans cheered wildly,” Schack told Borak during the 1971 reunion. “Then it got strangely quiet and they began throwing stones at me. It turned out that I ran the wrong way.”\n\nSchack’s now infamous wrong way run and the availability of stones was more than understandable considering South River players gathered on the eve of the game, according to Kathryn Fee, to review the rules of football, and that on the day of the game, contested at Miller’s Field on Williams Street, players from the team had to remove debris from the makeshift gridiron, which was marked with lime and which utilized donated two-by-fours for goalposts.\n\n“To prepare for that first game,” Kathryn Fee wrote, “the players first walked up and down the field to pick up rocks and broken glass bottles. Due to the tall grass, however, it was not a thorough job.”\n\nUnlike the Jamesburg Reform School players, who, according to multiple accounts of the game, were fully outfitted with leather helmets, shoulder pads, cleats and full uniforms, their counterparts lacked proper equipment.\n\n“Although the school authorities sanctioned the team, there was no financial provision for equipment or uniforms,” Kathryn Fee wrote, noting a man named John Kennedy, who founded the football program at South River “ordered football pants and maroon jerseys from a local sporting goods merchant.”\n\n“When the bill was presented to the board of education, there was an uproar,” Kathryn Fee wrote, “but eventually the bill was paid.”\n\nAccording to multiple accounts of the game, which South River lost 62-0 or 65-0, depending on which report one believes, players in the fledgling program competed without helmets, with rags under their jerseys for shoulder pads and with pieces of leather or rubber affixed to the bottoms of their shoes for cleats.\n\nUnlike the Jamesburg Reform School, which had a full complement of reserves, South River fielded a team of 11, 14 or 15 players, depending yet again on which account of the high school’s first game one believes.\n\nKennedy enlisted the help of Carl Jenkins, a former college player, who was at the time the secretary of the South River Chamber of Commerce, to start the high school football team.\n\n“They received permission from the school authorities to organize a football team and to train the players in the fundamentals of the game,” Kathryn Fee wrote. “To these two men South River owes its gratitude for the ensuing fame the game has brought to the town.”\n\nSouth River, which now conducts its gridiron battles on Saturday afternoons at Bill Denny Stadium, has since played 948 games and won 23 state championships.\n\nThe Rams own a 582-323-43 all-time record under 10 coaches including current mentor Rich Marchesi, who is the winningest head coach in school history with a 211-121-1 career record in 32 seasons.\n\nA lifelong South River resident and 1979 graduate of the borough’s high school, Marchesi started at center on one of the best teams in school history, helping the Rams finish undefeated and win a state title as a senior.\n\nThe team, which ended the year ranked third in the state, featured receiver Kenny Jackson, who went on to join former South River quarterback Joe Theismann, an NFL Most Valuable Player, and former South River wideout Drew Pearson, an NFL All-Pro, in the NFL.\n\nSouth River, whose players have been wearing 100-year anniversary decals on their helmets all season, will debut brand new game jerseys for Saturday’s homecoming game against Dunellen. The jerseys, which feature a commemorative patch above the left breast, would have made the 1919 South River players envious.\n\nIn an attempt to raise money for equipment following the 1919 season – which South River finished with a 1-3-1 record including the school’s first victory, a 19-6 win over South Amboy – players promoted and held a dance advertising “Music by Whiteman’s Band.”\n\nPaul Whiteman's Orchestra, according to redhotjazz.com, was the most popular band of the 1920s. But Paul Whiteman’s band was not the one that would be performing in South River.\n\n“We held the dance under false pretenses,” Schack told Borak. “We wanted everyone to think Paul Whiteman’s band was going to play in order to sell a lot of tickets.”\n\nSouth River classmate Ralph Whiteman and his bandmates actually performed, according to Borak’s account of the ruse.\n\n“Only 100 people came and Ralph had to pay each of his band members $5 out of his own pocket,” Schack told Borak, noting South River players hoped the heavily promoted event would sell 500 tickets at five cents apiece. “As a result, we still had to play football without helmets and shoulder pads.”\n\nThe 1919 South River squad apparently was not a trustworthy bunch. Benny Mark, whose brother played halfback on the 1919 team, told Borak the team’s time keepers would add a few more minutes to the game clock if the score did not favor the home squad.\n\nMark’s home, a block away from the high school, became the football players’ clubhouse, according to Borak, where Mark’s mother enforced “strict training” rules that included no cigarette smoking or gambling.\n\n“However,” Mark told Borak, “the players knew there was a little crap shooting in the cellar of the house next door.”\n\nThe cast of colorful characters that formed the 1919 South River team will be duly celebrated and remembered this weekend, even if they literally got the football program started in the wrong direction on Schack’s ignominious run.\n\nSchack's name is immortalized in South River football lore for scoring the first points in school history.\n\nUnfortunately, they were for the other team.\n\nSOUTH RIVER HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL HISTORY\n\nRECORD BY DECADE\n\n1919 (1-3-1) .250\n\n1920s (45-28-7) .616\n\n1930s (66-19-13) .767\n\n1940s (54-25-7) .683\n\n1950s (47-37-3) .559\n\n1960s (56-31-3) .691\n\n1970s (56-39-1) .589\n\n1980s (67-26-7) .720\n\n1990s (72-30) .705\n\n2000s (70-37) .633\n\n2010s (42-44) .488\n\nALL-TIME RECORDS VS.

After more than two dozen Reeltown High School players were baptized on the field in November, the Wisconsin-based Freedom from Religion Foundation demanded an investigation. “There is a strong relationship between conservative Protestantism and football at the high school and college level,” said Michael Altman, a religious studies professor at the University of Alabama. Altman said the Wisconsin group “is doing its best to call attention to a practice it finds unconstitutional by trying to take a local story national.” Tallapoosa County Schools Superintendent Joe Windle told Al.com he found no wrongdoing. The baptism was not conducted by the school, he said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Smoke has risen miles above a volcano on one of the Aleutian Islands, the Alaska Volcano Observatory says. Lava flowed down the side of Shishaldin Volcano on Unimak Island on Saturday, and smoke rose more than 5 miles high Sunday, Anchorage Daily News reports. The National Weather Service issued an alert for pilots Sunday, as plumes were recorded 30,000 feet in elevation and extending up to 90 miles east. The volcano observatory tweeted late Sunday that the ash emissions ended about 8:30 p.m. The largest island on the Aleutian chain, Unimak is 120 miles northeast of Unalaska Island and about 700 miles west of Anchorage. The same volcano erupted two weeks ago, officials say. The volcano was quiet until seismic activity increased Friday, says geologist Tim Orr of the volcano observatory.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state has agreed to pay $100,000 to settle a lawsuit by a former corrections officer who alleged his coworkers and supervisors repeatedly harassed him over his status as a transgender man. The lawsuit, which was tentatively settled Thursday, alleged colleagues used derogatory terms to refer to the officer and put his safety at risk by revealing to inmates that he had undergone a gender transition. The officer, who filed the lawsuit under a pseudonym due to safety and privacy concerns, alleged that the Department of Corrections responded inadequately to his complaints and that the harassment continued after he was transferred to another facility. Unable to tolerate the harassment, the officer resigned in 2016 after working nearly 11 years in state prisons in Florence and Douglas, according to the suit.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: CLL16 – a new high-yield, long-grain Clearfield rice variety developed by the University of Arkansas System Division of Agriculture – will be available to rice growers from Horizon Ag in 2021. Karen Moldenhauer, professor and rice breeder for the Division of Agriculture’s Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station, says CLL16 has excellent rough rice yields, averaging 205 bushels per acre, slightly better than Diamond, which averages 204 bushels per acre. CLL16 is resistant to blast in Arkansas growing conditions, Moldenhauer says. It has demonstrated good milling yields, averaging 63% whole kernel and 69% total milled rice for samples from Arkansas Rice Performance Trials across the state.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: Homeless mothers who were evicted last week from a house where they were squatting plan to move back after speculators agreed to sell the property to a nonprofit organization, it was announced Monday. Wedgewood Inc. will sell the home to the Oakland Community Land Trust, which buys and fixes up property for affordable housing. The group plans to allow women from the group Moms 4 Housing to return, Mayor Libby Schaaf announced. The city helped negotiate the agreement with the land trust and Wedgewood after a public outcry following the evictions. “This is what happens when we organize, when people come together to build the beloved community,” Dominique Walker of Moms 4 Housing said in a statement on the holiday honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. “Today we honor Dr. King’s radical legacy by taking Oakland back from banks and corporations.” Wedgewood also agreed to work with the city to negotiate a right-of-first-refusal program for all its other Oakland properties, a city statement said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A sheriff’s deputy who was pulled over by state troopers while driving three prisoners in a transport van has been charged with traffic offenses including reckless endangerment, authorities said Monday. Denver Sheriff Department Deputy James Grimes was charged following an investigation into the alleged aggressive driving incident, the Colorado State Patrol said. Grimes and the driver of a second vehicle were allegedly racing in and out of traffic as they traveled northbound on Interstate 25 on Thursday while under observation by a state patrol aircraft. Grimes faces additional charges of reckless driving and speeding in a construction zone. Grimes and another deputy who was with him in the prisoner van have been reassigned and placed on leave pending an internal investigation, the Denver Sheriff Department said in a statement.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State lawmakers plan to resurrect a bipartisan proposal that attempts to help older workers who often face age discrimination when seeking employment. The bill would prohibit employers from requiring a job applicant to list their date of birth and school graduation years, information that reveals a worker’s age even though prospective employers are not allowed to ask about age during interviews. Supporters said the legislation is aimed at addressing the discrimination older online job applicants often face. West Hartford Sen. Derek Slap, a Democrat, said this move could level the playing field for older workers in Connecticut and “give them a chance once they get into the application process to get that interview and make a case.” Slap said Connecticut has the sixth-oldest workforce in the U.S. Recent U.S. Census Bureau data show more than a quarter of the state’s workforce is over age 54.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Legislation aimed at settling a minor controversy involving dogs and eating establishments has passed the state House of Representatives without a dissenting vote and now goes to the Senate for consideration. The bill has broad bipartisan support, with more than a third of the General Assembly sponsoring or co-sponsoring the measure. House Bill 275 specifies that the owner of a food establishment may permit leashed dogs in the business’ outdoor patio area or beer garden, regardless of any state regulation to the contrary. The Delaware Division of Public Health inadvertently sparked controversy last summer when it took a renewed interest in an existing state regulation that prohibits pets in food establishments, including in outdoor areas. The ban does not apply to service animals.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A local startup is betting the skies are the future of food delivery with no delivery fees, no tips, and no worries for rumbling stomachs hoping to avoid getting so hungry that the sensation turns to anger, WUSA-TV reports. Shehan Weeraman and Nick Adimi named their company Hangry after becoming annoyed and exasperated by homemade food. “We got really lazy to cook, and we just decided to order a lot,” Weeraman says. “We realized we were paying like $10, sometimes more, for delivery that would take us sometimes over an hour to arrive.” The engine that drives this enterprise is a drone with a basket attached by a rope to the bottom. Hangry plans to partner with area restaurants and other establishments to deliver its products. Users would be able to meet the pilotless aircraft at a designated drop site, then scan a QR code to pick up their food.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: Invasive iguanas burrowing into the soft dirt around an aging dam have cost the city $1.8 million in emergency repairs. Employees noticed last year that water was seeping around the edges of a decades-old weir that controls water delivery in West Palm Beach, the Palm Beach Post reports. South Florida’s green iguana population has exploded since the last prolonged cold spell in 2010 reduced their numbers. They’ve become infamous for nuisance pool pooping and munching on ornamental landscapes, giving rise to a cottage industry of iguana-removal experts. They are also becoming an issue for agencies in charge of managing the hundreds of miles of canals that channel water throughout South Florida, says William Kern, an associate professor in the entomology and nematology department at the University of Florida’s Fort Lauderdale Research and Education Center.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: One of Republican Brian Kemp’s first acts as governor involved revamping the state’s handling of sexual harassment complaints and placing State Inspector General Deborah Wallace in charge of the issue. Kemp now wants to expand Wallace’s office, adding $435,182 to fund five new positions in his proposed fiscal 2021 budget, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Kemp’s budget proposal must be approved by lawmakers. The expansion, which would represent a 43% budget increase for the small agency, comes as other state agencies are being asked to trim their budgets amid a revenue shortfall. Kemp also proposed an additional $250,000 in the current year’s budget, as the agency already brought on new staff to handle complaints.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man suspected of stabbing a woman and killing two police officers last weekend wandered his neighborhood recording people with a camera mounted on his hat and rigged a barbecue grill to blow thick smoke directly into neighbors’ windows, a lawyer for residents said. Jaroslav “Jerry” Hanel, a handyman who lived in the home in exchange for his work and faced eviction, stabbed a woman in the leg Sunday before he fired on responding authorities, killing Honolulu Police Officers Tiffany Enriquez and Kaulike Kalama, police said. A fire at Hanel’s residence then spread through a normally peaceful neighborhood at the far end of the famed Waikiki Beach neighborhood. “It was pretty clear he was out of control,” said attorney David Hayakawa, who represented three neighbors in obtaining restraining orders against Hanel. Police have said Hanel is missing, and they’re almost certain he’s inside the burned house.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: A lawmaker says that Chicken Dinner Road in southwestern Idaho is a historic name and that he is opposed to an animal protection group’s request to rename it. Republican Rep. Scott Syme on Monday introduced a concurrent resolution urging fellow lawmakers to support the existing name. Concurrent resolutions do not need the signature of the governor and don’t have the force of law. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals in July asked Caldwell officials to change the name to what it said is the kinder and simpler Chicken Road. Syme said the original name stems from a 1930s resident famous for her chicken dinners who helped persuade then-Democratic Gov. C. Ben Ross to improve the road in Canyon County.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker has signed a law that eliminates driver’s license suspensions for most non-moving violations. The Democrat signed the “License to Work Act” last week. It takes effect in July. Pritzker says it will allow tens of thousands of motorists to have driving privileges reinstated. That means more people will be able to work. “Illinois now recognizes the fact that suspending licenses for having too many unpaid tickets, fines and fees doesn’t necessarily make a person pay the bill, but it does mean that people don’t have a way to pay,” Pritzker said. He said license suspensions are too harsh a penalty for “a practice that reinforces cycles of instability.” Each year authorities suspend more than 50,000 licenses belonging to people who can’t afford to pay tickets, fines and fees. According to Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, a study shows 42% of those who had their licenses suspended lost their jobs.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Hoosiers’ electricity bills could rise and several state utilities may face obstacles in their plans to phase out coal-based power generation in the coming years under politically charged legislation that would help a struggling Indiana industry. House Bill 1414, filed last week by state Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, would require Indiana utilities to prove that any plans to shut down a power plant are either required by a federal mandate or otherwise in the public interest. Though the word “coal” does not appear in the language of the bill, advocates and analysts say the legislation specifically targets coal-burning plants. The proposed regulatory requirement follows similar but unsuccessful legislation last year and is raising concerns among not only environmentalists but also some conservatives who see it as heavy-handed favoritism.\n\nIowa\n\nDavenport: City leaders are condemning a homeowner’s snow display depicting a figure gunning down a snowman wearing a Bernie Sanders shirt and another adorned with a Democratic Party hat. Mayor Mike Matson said he’s asked the police chief to investigate the display. “My personal reaction is that it’s terribly wrong and an embarrassment to our city,” Matson told the Quad-City Times. Homeowner Donald Hesseltine laughed off such concerns, saying he created the display to “mess with” friends who support Sanders, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for president. “It’s just to make people cry I guess,” Hesseltine said. “They’re crying, so I win.” The display includes a mannequin topped with a military helmet that’s holding a rifle and chainsaw, as well as a can of beer. The rifle is pointed toward the Sanders snowman, which has red-dyed snow near its head.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The University of Kansas will close its School of Languages, Literatures and Cultures, but departments within the school will remain open, and students will not be affected, according to a school official. The closing at the end of the academic year will change only the administrative structure for languages at Kansas, said John Colombo, interim dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. The degree offerings and curriculum will not be affected, he said. Budget problems prompted the closing, The Lawrence Journal-World reports. One staff position will be lost because of the closing. The director and co-director of the school will return to their respective positions within their academic units, Colombo said in an email. The creation of the school about five years ago did not increase enrollment for language departments or raise substantial private support to sustain the language programs as anticipated, he said.\n\nKentucky\n\nHenderson: Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear have teamed up on an effort to expand the new Green River National Wildlife Refuge in western Kentucky. The two leaders on Tuesday announced the approval of federal Duck Stamp funding for land acquisition to expand the wildlife refuge. Duck Stamps can be purchased by hunters, conservationists and stamp collectors. The stamps provide revenue to support federal conservation and outdoor recreation. Last November, federal and state officials announced the wildlife refuge’s establishment with the acquisition of the first tract – a 10-acre parcel donated by the Southern Conservation Corp. McConnell and Beshear discussed the issue before the new governor took office. Beshear has since given his approval so “Duck Stamp” funding can be used to support land acquisition from willing property sellers to expand the refuge.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Revenue from food and drinks has increased from a new $1 billion terminal at Louis Armstrong New Orleans International Airport, according to a recent report, which could mean more flights are added in the future. There was a 32% increase in food and beverage revenue in November 2019, compared to November 2018, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reports. The new terminal opened Nov. 6. A 46% revenue increase from drinking and dining options was recorded in December 2019, compared to the year before. The numbers were included in a report to the New Orleans Aviation Board last week, airport spokeswoman Erin Burns said. More non-airline revenue means it’s cheaper for carriers to fly in and out of the airport, and thus the airport is more attractive for airlines considering adding flights, the newspaper reports.\n\nMaine\n\nYarmouth: A massive elm tree nicknamed Herbie is long gone, but it will live on, thanks to cloned trees being made available to the public. At 110 feet and more than 200 years, Herbie was the tallest and oldest elm in New England and survived 14 bouts of Dutch elm disease thanks to the devotion of his centenarian caretaker, Frank Knight, the late tree warden of Yarmouth. The duo became famous after Knight spent half of his life caring for the tree, which he referred to as “an old friend.” Knight realized he couldn’t save the town’s elms as they succumbed by the hundreds to Dutch elm disease. So he focused his efforts on Herbie. Over five decades, Knight oversaw selective pruning of Herbie’s diseased limbs, plus applications of insecticides and fungicides. The tree was cut down Jan. 19, 2010, as the 101-year-old Knight looked on. Knight died two years later. But before Herbie was chopped down, the Elm Research Institute in New Hampshire worked with Knight to collect some cuttings from Herbie to preserve the tree’s legacy with clones. The hope is that Herbie’s descendants will have some resistance to Dutch elm disease.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: As rising seas drive saltwater farther inland, state officials are urging local governments, drinking water suppliers, farmers and others to start preparing now for a saltier future. Gov. Larry Hogan’s administration in December released the state’s first plan to combat saltwater intrusion. The 76-page report doesn’t forecast how widely impacts will be felt, citing a lack of existing research, but it identifies the resources facing the highest risk, ranking agriculture at the top. Wetlands, coastal forests, freshwater streams and aquifers also are in danger of turning salty, according to the report. Melting ice at the poles and the ocean’s thermal expansion – both triggered by climate change – are causing seas to rise across the globe, carrying salt into new places above and below ground. Saltwater intrusion is of even greater concern in the Chesapeake Bay region, climate scientists say, because the area’s land surface is sinking.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: No Charlie Card required to board these MBTA trains – just about $500 cash. The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority is auctioning off seven vintage subway cars. To make room for hundreds of news cars coming in the years ahead and to comply with safety laws, the MBTA removes salvageable parts from inoperable trains, then puts the cars up for auction. “The old cars are sold to the highest bidder, usually for the scrap metal,” MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo told The Boston Globe. “Old cars are retired after they are no longer capable of providing safe and reliable passenger service.” Made by Boeing and Kinkisharyo in the early 1970s and ’80s, the cars have sat idle for at least three years, according to the auction posting. Bidding for the lot of seven cars – Orange Line subway cars and Green Line trolley cars – starts at $500. The auction ends Jan. 28.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A national competition is underway that seeks artists’ proposals for a planned public sculpture outside the main entrance to the TCF Center downtown. The Detroit Regional Convention Facility Authority and its Art Foundation say the proposals for the permanent sculpture cannot be taller than 30 feet and no more than 8 feet in diameter. Artists must register for the competition and are encouraged to consider physical placement, material and size in their proposals. Themes may reflect positive changes and growth in Detroit and southeastern Michigan, the area’s strong spirit of innovation and design, the global impact of Detroit, and the region’s renaissance. Proposals will be reviewed by a jury of expert panelists. The winning proposal will be awarded a budget of $250,000 to support the sculpture’s conceptualization, fabrication and installment. An additional $50,000 will go to the winning artist.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: State troopers will be carrying more than 600 kits to give to homeless people who need clothes, food and toiletries. The Department of Public Safety collected donations and assembled them into “Care and Go” kits. “A lot of times people will think it’s just a metro issue,” said Booker Hodges, assistant commissioner of law enforcement in the Department of Public Safety. “In greater Minnesota, our troopers do encounter quite a few people who are homeless.” Hodges said he wanted to start the program in the Department of Public Safety after seeing a similar initiative used in Ramsey County for recently released inmates. Hodges said he hopes to have kits in place by Feb. 1. He said the “goal is that every state trooper will have one in his or her squad car.” The kits include socks, T-shirts, toothpaste, conditioners, hand wipes and feminine products. They also include protein bars and water.\n\nMississippi\n\nMeridian: The state will pay $3 million for a fence to keep wild animals off the runways of a military base. A Navy official said the state’s job-creation agency, Mississippi Development Authority, has offered a grant to pay for the barrier at Naval Air Station Meridian. The new chain-link fence would be built inside an existing fence surrounding the base, and the bottom of the new fence will be buried deep, the Meridian Star reports. Deer, cattle, hogs and coyotes have reached the property in recent years, and a farmer reported that a hunter killed a sow near the fence last month, said Jim Copeland, community planning and liaison officer for the base. Pigs have a low center of gravity and can cause a plane to lose control if they are hit by the nose wheel, Copeland said.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: The state Supreme Court on Tuesday gutted a voter ID law that has been called “a solution in search of a problem.” In a 5-2 decision, the court cleared the way for Missourians to vote with non-photo IDs like current utility bills and bank statements, as well as Missouri college IDs, without having to swear they are who they say they are on penalty of perjury. Republican politicians had said the law combats voter fraud. Studies say the kind of fraud voter ID detects is practically nonexistent. Judge Mary R. Russell wrote for the majority Tuesday that the sworn statement requirement was “misleading,” “contradictory” and ultimately unconstitutional. Two dissenting judges, both appointed by Republicans, argued that the court could fix the issue by editing out “contradictory” language or prohibiting voting with non-photo ID entirely. Russell called both ideas “nonsensical.”\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: Federal environmental regulators say the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs violated an order to repair a public water supply system serving about 1,300 people on the Crow Indian Reservation. Environmental Protection Agency officials said in a letter that the bureau has repeatedly missed deadlines to complete repairs following concerns last spring about potential water contamination. Last March, a main line on the Crow Agency water system broke, prompting an advisory for users to boil water or use alternate supplies as a precaution. The concern was that loss of pressure because of the line break could have allowed contaminated water to seep into the system through cracks and joints. EPA spokeswoman Lisa McClain-Vanderpool says the Bureau of Indian Affairs has completed enough required work that there is no longer an imminent public health danger.\n\nNebraska\n\nWaverly: A woman who fell off a bridge while stargazing has been transferred from a Lincoln hospital to one in Omaha, authorities said. Lindsay Kroger, 37, of rural Lincoln, had gone with five other people to the bridge about 2 miles southeast of Waverly to look at the sky early Sunday morning. She leaned back, thinking there was a support piece behind her, but instead fell 27 feet to the ice below, the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office said. She was flown to a Lincoln hospital and then sent Monday to the Omaha facility.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Organizers of a protest of new city ordinances affecting the homeless say 12 demonstrators were taken into custody. About 100 protesters blocked a downtown street Monday to voice their opposition to two laws that ban camping. They had tents, sleeping bags and cardboard boxes. One ordinance prohibits camping on sidewalks if there are available beds at a shelter. The second bans sitting or camping on city sidewalks during street cleaning hours. Violation of either law could result in a misdemeanor. Police Lt. Jeff Stuart says about a dozen people were arrested after they refused to move from the road. It was not immediately known Tuesday what charges they might face. Opponents of the ordinances have been protesting since the first ordinance was passed in November. Supporters of the measures say they are necessary for public safety and sanitation.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is holding a weeklong celebration of wine. New Hampshire Wine Week includes the 17th annual Winter Wine Spectacular, which benefits EasterSeals New Hampshire. The event, on Thursday, attracts more than 1,500 guests who get to sample more than 1,800 wines. A new event, “Cellar Notes: An Evening of Wine and Music,” will be held Wednesday evening at the Rex Theater in Manchester. It will feature a panel discussion and tasting.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJackson: An ad in the Waze navigation app is misdirecting motorists headed to Atlantic City’s Borgata Hotel Casino & Spa into the wilderness of New Jersey’s Pine Barrens, police said. Jackson Township police posted on Facebook that officers in recent weeks have had to help motorists who followed the directions into the Colliers Mills Wildlife Management Area, where they became stuck on unpaved roads. “The wildlife area is comprised of more than 12,000 acres, mainly located in Jackson and Plumsted townships, which is about 45 miles away from the actual Borgata Casino in Atlantic City,” police said. The Borgata is off the Atlantic City Expressway. According to police, the problem stems from an orange ad logo in the Waze app. The address on the ad is correct, police said, but the location pinned with the ad is actually in the Colliers Mills wildlife area, police said. Waze was working to fix the problem, police said.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The Democrat-led Legislature is looking for new ways to bolster a lagging public education system and open up new economic opportunities by legalizing recreational marijuana and providing tuition-free college education, as a 30-day legislative session begins Tuesday. Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is pushing for new investments in public education that include $74 million in new annual general fund spending on early childhood programs. She’s also calling for the state to underwrite tuition-free college education for residents. A state scholarship fund from lottery proceeds already covers 60% of in-state tuition, and at least $35 million is needed to cover the remainder plus fees. Record-setting oil production is producing an economic windfall for state government, with state economists forecasting an $800 million budget surplus.\n\nNew York\n\nBattenville: The state is planning restoration work on the early childhood home of women’s rights advocate Susan B. Anthony. The house Anthony’s father built in 1833 in Battenville is water-damaged and in rough shape. The state Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation bought the foreclosed property in 2006 but has done little to preserve it. The Albany Times-Union reports the agency now plans to invest $700,000 this year on the Greek Revival-style house where Anthony lived from age 6 to 19 when her father managed a nearby cotton mill. The official Susan B. Anthony Museum and House is in Rochester, where she lived for 40 years while she was a national figure in the women’s rights and suffrage movement. No plans have been developed yet for the Battenville house, beyond preserving it. This year marks the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution giving women the right to vote, as well as the 200th anniversary of Anthony’s birth.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: An appeals court on Tuesday upheld the legality of a legislative session Republicans quickly called in December 2016 to push through laws that weakened the power of incoming Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. The unanimous decision of three judges on the intermediate-level Court of Appeals affirmed a 2018 trial-court ruling that declined to declare as unconstitutional the procedures used in calling and passing legislation during the three-day session. The group Common Cause and several citizens who sued in 2017 argued that the rushed session – announced and convened mere hours after another legislative session on Hurricane Matthew relief – violated their right in the North Carolina Constitution to “instruct their representatives.” The GOP-dominated General Assembly used it to pass laws that in part diluted the governor’s powers.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A new agreement between the state and Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation means bighorn sheep could be roaming the reservation in the next couple weeks. North Dakota Game and Fish director Terry Steinwand says 30 to 40 bighorns will be brought to North Dakota once they are captured on a Montana reservation. They’ll be released in the Mandaree and Twin Buttes areas. The Bismarck Tribune says the state-tribal agreement includes a provision for a ram hunting season. Williams says that will depend on how well the animals do in their new habitat. The pact is the third such agreement between the state and the tribal nation. The others are twin agreements with MHA Nation in 2008 related to hunting and fishing access issues and a 2017 pact with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe for an elk hunting season.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state Supreme Court has rejected a recommendation that tools used to measure offenders’ suitability for being released after an arrest be made available to all judges as they make bail decisions. Requiring the availability of so-called risk assessment tools was the top recommendation of a task force commissioned by the court last year to examine Ohio’s bail system. The tools – there are several nationally – look at a variety of factors, including defendants’ age, criminal history and past failures to appear, when analyzing what type of bond conditions should be set. More than 70 courts in Ohio already use them. Supporters say the tools are a more accurate way to examine the two most important factors that judges consider when setting bond: Will the offender skip out, and will they pose a public safety risk if released? Detractors say the tools can be racially biased, are costly to smaller courts and improperly override judges’ own experiences in setting bond.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A lawmaker is seeking to repeal the state’s controversial permitless carry law that took effect last year. Rep. Jason Lowe, D-Oklahoma City, who tried to prevent permitless carry from taking effect, filed legislation to repeal the law that allows most Oklahomans to carry a firearm without a permit. The legislation faces unfavorable odds in Oklahoma’s Republican-controlled Legislature, where majorities in both the House and Senate overwhelmingly approved of permitless carry last year. The Legislature also passed similar legislation in 2018, which was vetoed by then-Gov. Mary Fallin. House Bill 3357 would repeal the permitless carry law dubbed by supporters as “constitutional carry.”\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A beloved but decaying piece of artwork created from an industrial eyesore faces limited, costly options, according to an action plan from the city. Restoring Eco-Earth, the massive mosaic tile sculpture at Riverfront Park, would cost an estimated $475,000, and removing what was once an acid ball and repurposing the site would ring in at $680,000. “What would that say about Salem if they scrapped it?” said former Mayor Roger Gertenrich, who chaired the Eco-Earth project 20 years ago. The community turned the 25-foot-diameter black tank from the long-gone Boise Cascade paper mill into a colorful, one-of-a-kind globe. It once held liquid and chemical gases used to cook wood chips into pulp and has been a fixture of the riverfront since 1960, when the tank was floated up the Willamette River from Portland. Volunteers logged more than 30,000 hours to transform it, but more than 86,000 tiles have failed, and asbestos has been revealed underneath. Eco-Earth’s fate lies with the Salem Public Art Commission.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGreensburg: A defense attorney says he expects to appeal the murder conviction of a man who asserts that his now-deceased twin brother was the shooter. Jurors in Westmoreland County deliberated for about two hours Friday before convicting 30-year-old Darrelle Tolbert-McGhee of first-degree murder in the shooting death of 32-year-old Michael Wilson. McGhee had asserted that he was in Florida at the time of the April 2017 slaying in downtown Jeannette. He said the shooter was his twin brother, Dwayne, who was killed in a shooting 13 months later in Wilkinsburg. The Tribune-Review reports that defense attorney Tim Dawson said he was surprised by the speed of the verdict. “Apparently, they convinced the jury beyond a reasonable doubt that one identical twin committed the murder rather than the other,” Dawson said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: A woman is taking legal action against the city for handcuffing and arresting her 13-year-old daughter after a fight with another student, the American Civil Liberties Union says. Tre’sur Johnson, an honors student who had no prior disciplinary infractions, was charged with disorderly conduct and kept in a police station holding cell for about an hour last June, ACLU lawyer Shannah Kurland said at a news conference Monday. The ACLU is representing the girl’s mother, Tiqua Johnson, who is seeking $100,000 for physical pain, emotional distress and other damages. The school and police violated state law that bars the arrest of someone on misdemeanor charges, Kurland said. The brief confrontation at Goff Middle School involved physical contact, Kurland said, but neither student was hurt, and it was quickly broken up.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Twenty-four years ago, the Greenville County Council passed a resolution, with three members opposed, condemning homosexuality as incompatible with their community values. Today, an Upstate group representing members of county’s LGBTQ community says it is time for the current County Council to reverse that action. Terena Starks, the diversity officer for Upstate Pride, together with the board of her organization sent an open letter Thursday to every member of the council. The letter, which is posted on the organization’s website, also links to a change.org petition, which by late Friday had drawn more than 1,200 signatures. Upstate Pride has gotten more active over the past year, most notably with the Upstate Pride Festival last summer.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Prisoners at the South Dakota State Penitentiary are trying to raise money and awareness about Native American women who are crime victims. The nonprofit organization Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women says Native American women are more than twice as likely to experience violence as any other demographic. The inmates made 200 pairs of earrings and raised $5,000, which they donated to Urban Indian and Health of Sioux Falls and Rapid City. Connie Hopkins, vice president of prisoner support, tells KELO-TV the money will be used in a variety of ways to bring awareness to what some say is an epidemic when it comes to Native American women. “It’s going to help them get more media out there or pay for fliers or to help people travel to go look for these women,” Hopkins said.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The state’s college athletes could financially benefit from the use of their names, images and likenesses under legislation introduced by a pair of lawmakers from the city. The bill would allow athletes to sign contracts to advertise for local businesses or other companies and would also prohibit schools from “discriminating against players based on donations by coaches to universities.” “It’s time we treat college athletes like everyone else in America and allow them to earn money in the free market,” Sen. Brian Kelsey, R-Germantown, said in a statement. Kelsey and Rep. Antonio Parkinson, D-Memphis, each brought the legislation to their respective chambers months after a University of Memphis basketball player, James Wiseman, was suspended by the NCAA.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The number of foster care children who slept in state offices, hotels and other temporary housing spiked last year, as the child welfare system continues to grapple with recruiting and retaining specialized foster homes. Last year, the monthly count of foster care children who did not have a home for at least two nights totaled 678, a 49% increase from 2018, according to data from Child Protective Services. Many of them were teens, and most slept in state offices. The number of foster children without placements has increased every year but two since 2011. The problem became particularly acute last year amid the loss of 197 foster beds across the state, lengthier discharges from residential treatment centers, and an uptick over the summer in foster youth who rejected the placements assigned to them.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A new survey has found that in the Beehive State more than anywhere else in the nation, divorce doesn’t necessarily mean contention. USAWillGuru.com, which provides will and testament information, surveyed 5,000 divorcees across the country and asked if the divorce ended on good terms. Utah has the highest percentage of amicable breakups at 79%. Neighboring Nevada ranked the lowest, with only 15% saying their marriage ended amicably. The survey also looked at what percentage of divorcees include their ex in their will. According to the survey’s findings, 12% of divorced Utahans include former spouses in their will. Loni Stookey, a licensed marriage and family therapist in St. George, said there’s a “strong family element” in Utah that may contribute to why parents try to split on good terms.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state House on Tuesday unanimously approved a proposed constitutional amendment to make clear that Vermont prohibits slavery. The Senate passed the proposal last session. Vermont was the first state to abolish adult slavery. The state Constitution currently says no person 21 or older should serve as a slave unless bound by their own consent or “by law for the payment of debts, damages, fines, costs, or the like.” The amendment would remove that language and add that slavery and indentured servitude in any form are prohibited. The proposed constitutional amendment must be considered by the 2021-2022 Legislature. If it passes, the question will be go before Vermont voters in 2022.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state Senate has advanced legislation to scrap the state’s Lee-Jackson holiday celebrating two Confederate generals. The Democratic-led Senate voted largely along party lines Tuesday to pass legislation that would make Election Day a state holiday instead of Lee-Jackson Day. The legislation now goes to the House for consideration. Lee-Jackson Day, established more than 100 years ago, is observed annually on the Friday preceding the third Monday in January. It honors Confederate generals Robert E. Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, both native Virginians. Critics of the Lee-Jackson holiday view it as a celebration of the state’s slaveholding history that’s offensive to African Americans. Many cities and counties have opted not to observe it.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: State Attorney General Bob Ferguson is challenging the lavish personal spending of bankrupt anti-tax activist and candidate for governor Tim Eyman, saying Eyman’s assets must be preserved so he can pay his debts to the state. Eyman’s been spending an average of nearly $24,000 a month over the past year, The Seattle Times reports, citing his bankruptcy filings. At the same time, the state is seeking more than $3 million from Eyman, including $230,000 in contempt-of-court sanctions for failing to cooperate with Ferguson’s campaign-finance case against him. Eyman’s expenses include legal fees, a vacation to Orlando, rent on a Bellevue condo, $4,000 a month in unspecified business spending and at least $2,400 to buy 97 Starbucks gift cards during a 10-month span. The first month after filing for bankruptcy, he ate out on 20 days. Last February, he made 74 restaurant purchases. Last month, Eyman reported meals at three separate restaurants to celebrate his birthday.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: People interested in portraying historical figures for the West Virginia Humanities Council’s History Alive program can submit proposals through Feb. 1. The council is seeking proposals for portrayals of influential people who have made important contributions to state, national or international history. The roster of characters now includes Gabriel Arthur, Nellie Bly, Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson, Ostenaco, Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Charles Schulz, Harriet Tubman and Mark Twain, The Herald-Dispatch reports. The council will consider portrayals of historically significant people who are no longer living, from any period in history.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: All day care centers, child care providers and children’s camps would have to test their water for lead under a bill the state Senate approved Tuesday. Current state law requires anyone who cares for at least four children under age 7 less than 24 hours a day to obtain a license from the state Department of Children and Families. The state agriculture department licenses recreational and educational camps. Under the bill, child care center operators, child care providers, group home operators and camp runners would have to test water from every source in their facilities for lead contamination to obtain or renew their licenses. If the water is contaminated, the applicant would have two options: They could stop all access to the water, come up with a remediation plan and supply drinkable water in the interim. Or they could come up with a plan for supplying drinkable water on a permanent basis.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: A second Democrat has entered the race for an open U.S. Senate seat. University of Wyoming ecology professor Merav Ben-David, of Laramie, announced her candidacy Saturday at the annual Women’s March in downtown Cheyenne. A native of Israel, Ben-David has lived in Wyoming for 20 years. She says she decided to get involved in politics to get more involved in decisions affecting ecosystems worldwide. She says her goal in Washington, D.C., would be to develop new sources of income and industries in Wyoming, where fossil-fuel extraction is a critical part of the economy. Another Laramie resident, community organizer Yana Ludwig, announced her candidacy in June, the Wyoming Tribune-Eagle reports. Three Republicans including former U.S. Rep. Cynthia Lummis are running to replace U.S. Sen Mike Enzi, who plans to retire in 2021 after four terms.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/06/13/pride-pickup-sphinx-move-tony-starks-cabin-news-around-states/39576815/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nPike Road: Montgomery County’s Hindu community came together for a “once-in-a-lifetime” event Sunday to celebrate the opening of a new temple in this town. The four-day celebration, called Pran Pratistha (dignity of life), kicked off Thursday and continued through the weekend as hundreds attended from all over the world. Because it is rare for a new temple to be opened, very few Hindu people get the opportunity to attend Pran Pratistha. Sunday’s festivities brought together more than 200 people as nine priests finalized the grand opening and “gave life” to the eight main idols inside the temple. The site will serve the Hindu community throughout central and south Alabama. Manoj Mishra, president of the Hindu Society of Alabama, says the community welcomes anyone who wants to tour the space and learn about the voluminous traditions present in Hinduism.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The fight over the dividend Alaskans receive from the state’s oil-wealth fund could hamper efforts to finalize a state infrastructure budget as the end of the special session looms. Major provisions in the capital budget draft that advanced from the House Finance Committee on Tuesday would require support from three-quarters of the House – or at least 30 of the House’s 40 members. House Minority Leader Lance Pruitt said he cannot see any of his 15 Republican members lending their support without funding for an Alaska Permanent Fund dividend settled. Lawmakers have been unable to come to agreement on the size of dividend that should be paid this year. House Speaker Bryce Edgmon said the expectation is for a future special session on the dividend. The current special session expires Friday.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: A ski resort wants to expand services with night skiing and tubing, new chairlifts and mountain biking trails, and a zip line. The Arizona Snowbowl operates on roughly a square mile of the San Francisco Peaks in northern Arizona. Snowbowl general manager J.R. Murray says the resort will submit a master plan to the U.S. Forest Service this fall. The plan will be subject to environmental review and public comment. Murray says implementing the plan could boost visitation from 3,870 to 4,500 people daily. The resort says the earliest that the new services could start is 2021. Native Americans have challenged the Snowbowl for decades over its existence on a mountain they consider sacred. More recently, they lost a lengthy legal battle to prevent snowmaking at the resort.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The voting system for electing judges to the state’s top courts violates black residents’ rights by diluting the strength of their votes, according to a federal lawsuit filed by civil rights lawyers. The lawsuit filed Monday says that because the state’s seven Supreme Court justices are elected statewide, instead of by district, the white voting bloc overpowers the votes of black Arkansas residents. The suit says that’s why no black judge has ever been elected to the court. The lawsuit points to several cases in which a black candidate was supported by a majority of black voters in an election but was defeated by a white candidate supported by a majority of white voters. Instead, lawyers suggest the state should change the voting system for Supreme Court justices by creating electoral districts, for which black voters “in at least one district would constitute a majority of the voting-age population.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A $2 billion transit terminal that was shut down six weeks after opening last year will reopen July 1. The Transbay Joint Powers Authority said Tuesday that it has fixed the cracks that led to the San Francisco terminal’s abrupt closure in September. The authority, which operates the Salesforce Transit Center, also said it conducted a thorough review. The terminal will provide local bus service in early July, with regional transportation starting in late summer. The new center replaced the grim and seismically deficient Transbay Terminal nearby. It is meant to be a modern transportation hub with food trucks, pop-up retail shops and a rooftop park. The center is more than 1 million square feet and stretches four blocks, with four stories above ground and two stories below.\n\nColorado\n\nSilverton: A 100-mile ultrarun through the state’s southwestern mountains has been canceled because of this year’s heavy snowfall and avalanche debris. In an announcement this week, Hardrock Hundred Endurance Run director Dale Garland said that conditions on much of the San Juan Mountains course are uncertain. While snow looked to be dropping to manageable levels in time for July’s race, Garland said that unprecedented avalanche debris and high levels in waterways helped lead to the decision to cancel what would have been the 26th run. The race was also called off in 2002 because of wildfires and in 1995 because of heavy late-season snow. Runners from around the world participate in the race over 13 mountain passes. They run through the night and finish in an average of about 41 hours.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStorrs: The Connecticut Repertory Theatre at UConn has teamed up with the school’s interpreting services to make its plays more accessible to the deaf community. UConn Interpreting Services will provide interpreters this summer for performances of the musicals “Mamma Mia!” and “Cabaret.” The two interpreters will stand just off stage right signing the dialogue and lyrics to a section of the audience where those with hearing loss will be sitting, while also trying to convey the emotions in the words and music. UConn recently approved American Sign Language studies as a major, beginning in 2020, which will include a concentration in interpreting. Audrey Silva, the director of UConn Interpreting Services, says the school hopes to eventually offer internships with her office.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: Parts of the Murderkill River turned shades of red Wednesday as scientists studied how a wastewater spill upstream might affect shellfish in the Delaware Bay. Starting around midnight Tuesday, experts with the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and U.S. Food and Drug Administration began dyeing the effluent processed at the Kent County Wastewater Treatment Plant a crimson color to track its path. The study, using a red dye called Rhodamine WT, will provide the data needed to make decisions in the case of a wastewater spill from the plant along the Murderkill. Officials said Rhodamine WT is commonly used in water quality tests and will not harm humans or the environment. No one is sure how brightly red the river will turn or whether the dye will be noticeable as the water reaches the Delaware Bay, which officials say is the point of the effort.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Independence Day is just over three weeks away, and nobody in town seems to know exactly what the July 4 celebrations in the nation’s capital will look like. President Donald Trump has said he wants to reshape the annual event into a “Salute to America” that would feature Trump himself speaking from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. As the date approaches, the actual plan remains a mystery. Nobody outside the White House or the National Park Service seems to have a firm grasp of the plan, and neither of those entities is talking. Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington’s representative in Congress, says the lack of advance planning is striking. And she says the introduction of Trump and his personal security concerns into the mix could sow chaos.\n\nFlorida\n\nGainesville: A California real estate agent and self-proclaimed “super fan” says he’s extended an offer to buy the Florida home of rock legend Tom Petty. Kevin Beauchamp tells The Gainesville Sun he quickly made an offer of $175,000 for the nearly 1,200-square-foot home after seeing the home’s current owner, Brandy Clark, mention on a Petty Facebook fan club that she might sell it. He says he has a contract for the home. Petty grew up in Gainesville. He died of an accidental overdose in October 2017 at age 66. Beauchamp says he is working with Petty fan Joanne Davis and Jeff Goldstein, president of the Gainesville Music History Foundation, to have the property labeled a historic landmark. Clark says the home still has the original pink tile in the bathroom.\n\nGeorgia\n\nFairburn: Marvel fans can now live out a fantasy in the Peach State if they’re willing to shell out almost $1,000 a night. WSB-TV reports the cabin where Tony Stark, better known as Iron Man, lived during the “Avengers: Endgame” film was listed for rent on Airbnb. The three-bedroom cabin is located on a lake in Fairburn, about 30 minutes southwest of Atlanta. It’s listed at about $800 per night. Marvel has not confirmed whether the property listed is the same as the one where Robert Downey Jr.’s character stayed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The state has experienced record-high temperatures since the start of June. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports temperatures reached above 90 degrees Fahrenheit seven times between June 4 and June 9. Officials say the temperatures have either tied or surpassed previous records in Honolulu on Oahu and Kahului on Maui. A National Weather Service forecaster says the temperatures are likely due to higher-than-normal water temperatures combined with lighter trade winds. Honolulu was up to 90 degrees Saturday, tying a 1997 record, and 92 degrees Monday. Officials report a streak of high temperatures for Kahului, which on May 22 reached 96 degrees, a record for that month. Officials say temperatures in Kahului reached 95 degrees twice in the days afterward.\n\nIdaho\n\nCaldwell: Workers at a county jail are notifying federal immigration officials when they are holding foreign-born inmates, including those who are United States citizens. The Idaho Press reports that emails obtained for the month of March through a public records request provided details of how Canyon County jail employees contact Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials about inmates. Jail workers are instructed to notify immigration officials for “all foreign born inmates,” and inmates are held longer than they normally would be at the request of federal immigration enforcement officials, the Canyon County Sheriff’s Office said. “Have just booked in a foreign born,” said one email from a county worker to immigration officials. “(S)tates she is a citizen, she is currently being held on a zero bond until court Monday.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChampaign: The National Weather Service and an outdoor advertising company are teaming up to equip nine digital billboards in central Illinois with the ability to display tornado warnings. Adams Outdoor Advertising says the billboards in Champaign will alert drivers to any tornado warning in effect within 20 miles of each billboard. General manager Reid Reker says the company is providing the warnings as a donation to the community in the interest of public safety. When an alert is activated, each billboard will show only the tornado warning until it has been lifted. John Dwyer of the Champaign County Emergency Management Agency is cautioning people still will need weather radios and phone apps to stay alert to the kind of weather that can rapidly develop into tornadoes even before warnings are issued.\n\nIndiana\n\nRockport: The former drummer of the heavy metal band Five Finger Death Punch has a new gig as a police officer. Jeremy Spencer was sworn in Sunday with the Rockport Police Department. He grew up near that Ohio River community in the city of Boonville, which he left at 19. Spencer joined Five Finger Death Punch in 2005. He was the band’s drummer until late 2018. He tells WFIE-TV he’s always admired police officers’ work, saying, “You just see the impact they have on everyone’s life. It’s so important.” Spencer’s police duties are part-time. He’s splitting his time between Rockport and Las Vegas. He says he hasn’t retired from the music business. Loudwire, an online magazine that covers hard rock and heavy metal music, voted him “Best Drummer of 2015.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The U.S. Department of Agriculture has lowered its estimate of this year’s corn crop to the lowest in four years, saying wet weather has delayed planting and reduced acres planted and the expected per-acre yield. The expected production was cut in a monthly report released Tuesday by 1.4 billion bushels to 13.7 billion bushels, the lowest since 2015. While weather problems also have slowed soybean planting, the USDA didn’t change estimates because farmers have several more weeks to plant. The USDA will release a report June 28 to provide updated farmer surveys more accurately reflecting the number of acres farmers planted. The USDA report also says disputes with China and other nations have reduced corn exports for the current-year crop by 100 million bushels and soybean exports by 75 million bushels.\n\nKansas\n\nWest Mineral: A historic coal mining shovel that was hidden under bramble for more than 70 years has gone on display in southeast Kansas alongside its more well-known successor, an 11 million-pound orange giant known as Big Brutus. The Joplin Globe reports a ceremony to dedicate the Markley shovel is slated for 1 p.m. Saturday at the Big Brutus Visitors Center, a nonprofit museum in West Mineral. Coal mine operator Perry Markley designed and built the shovel in the early 1900s using junkyard parts. The machine was one of the first mining shovels to be equipped with a round dipper stick that allowed the bucket to swivel. It later was used as a prototype to construct other machines like Big Brutus.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Sometimes you have to wait over a century for a good bottle of bourbon. Kentucky Peerless Distilling Company announced Tuesday that it will be releasing its first bourbon in 102 years to the public June22. The bourbon will be released in limited quantities. Started in 1889 by current CEO Corky Taylor’s great-grandfather, Henry Karver, the Peerless brand was once the state’s second-largest bourbon distillery, producing about 200 barrels of rye whiskey and bourbon per day until 1917, when Karver closed the facility at the onset of World War I. The Taylor family resurrected the brand in 2015 with the opening of a new distiller in downtown Louisville. According to a press release, the company used “sweet mash instead of sour, non-chilled filtration, barreling product at 107 proof and bottling it as barrel strength whiskey.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nMooringsport: Sheriff’s deputies say an alligator took a bite out of one of their patrol cars. WBRZ-TV reports deputies were called Monday to Louisiana Highway 1 in Caddo Parish after someone spotted the gator in the middle of the road. The sheriff’s office says deputies were waiting for wildlife removal experts to arrive when the alligator chomped off a piece of the front bumper. Deputies estimate the alligator was 8 feet long. A photo from the Caddo Parish Sheriff’s Office Facebook page shows the reptile in grass next to what appears to be the black rectangular grill of the car. Authorities say the gator escaped before the wildlife removal experts arrived.\n\nMaine\n\nYork: A California woman who was trying to document her first-ever lobster roll literally got a bird’s eye view of the sandwich. Alicia Jessop wanted to snap the perfect picture Friday of her lobster roll from Fox’s Lobster House in York before she took a bite. She says she was focused on framing the sandwich with the Nubble Lighthouse in the background when she felt something rustle her hand. She quickly realized a seagull had knocked the sandwich out of her hand and was already eating it. As she was walking back to the stand to buy another $21.50 lobster roll, she realized she snapped a photo of the exact moment the seagull snatched her food. She posted the picture on Twitter, saying, “This is why we can’t have nice things.” Jessop says the experience and response to her mishap has taught her that “people just need a laugh.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state’s health department says fatal drug overdoses are down for the first three months of the year, compared to the same time last year. In preliminary data released Tuesday, the department says there were 577 total unintentional intoxication deaths. That’s a 15% decrease compared to the first three months of last year. Of the total, 89% were opioid-related deaths, primarily attributable to fentanyl. Steve Schuh, director of the state’s Opioid Operational Command Center, says 16 of 24 local jurisdictions saw declines in the number of opioid-related fatalities in the first quarter of this year. He says the state has never seen that many counties report declines in opioid-related deaths. Still, Schuh says the heroin and opioid crisis in Maryland is by no means over.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nYarmouth: A Massachusetts man who struck a friendship with Anne Frank’s father has donated a trove of letters and mementos he received from Otto Frank to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum ahead of the 90th anniversary of the young Holocaust victim’s birth. Museum historian Edna Friedberg says the pen pal letters exchanged between Ryan Cooper and Otto Frank from 1972 until Frank’s death in 1980 show how Frank worked tirelessly to spread his late daughter’s legacy. Otto Frank was the only person in his family to survive the Holocaust. He had his daughter’s now-famous diary published after the war. The Washington museum says the letters will be made available online and the artifacts possibly displayed later. They include Otto Frank’s coin purse and a family photo of Anne.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Michiganders have a superhuman love for ice cream. The state’s favorite flavor of the sweet summer treat is Superman, according to a WorkWise poll published in May. Superman ice cream is a swirl of red, blue and yellow, the colors on the famous superhero’s suit. The flavors of each color vary. The study is based on which ice cream flavors each state searched on Google most often. Michigan is the only state that prefers Superman ice cream over all others, according to the poll. Cookies and cream is the top-searched ice cream in the county, followed by vanilla and then chocolate. Chocolate is more popular than vanilla ice cream in Michigan, the poll shows.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: The state saw the second-lowest number of fire deaths on record last year, though careless smoking and the lack of working alarms continue to take lives. Thirty-seven people died in fires in Minnesota in 2018, according to the Department of Public Safety State Fire Marshal Division, which released 2018 fire death statistics Tuesday. Last year saw the lowest number of fire deaths since 2009, when 35 people were killed. It’s also a vast improvement since the mid-1970s, when the number of deaths in the state soared to more than 130 each year. The leading cause of fires last year, where a cause could be determined, was careless smoking. Other common causes were cooking and portable heaters. State Fire Marshal Bruce West also notes that this time of year, people should respect their grill and recreational burning materials.\n\nMississippi\n\nBay St. Louis: A California rocket company says it will build and test rockets at a NASA facility here. Los Angeles-based Relativity announced Tuesday that it would invest $59 million, with a plan to increase to 200 workers from 90 current employees. The company will lease space from NASA at Stennis Space Center on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. The facility has long hosted rocket tests. State and local governments are likely to give Relativity more than $4.7 million in aid and tax breaks over the next 10 years as part of the deal. Relativity plans to build rockets through three-dimensional metal printing, completing development by next year. Relativity hopes for an orbital test launch in 2020 and to begin commercial service in 2021.\n\nMissouri\n\nOzark: Bristly cave crayfish are so rare they’ve only been found in caves in nine counties in Missouri and Arkansas. At Smallin Civil War Cave in Ozark, a tour group recently got to see some of the clawed critters, though one of them clearly had a chunk taken out of its back. It’s a creature rare enough that the cave owner decided to rescue it. “I captured it and stuck it in a tub,” said Kevin Bright, co-owner of Smallin Cave. “It had a bite mark on its side, most likely from a raccoon that probably got it. Maybe it got one of its pincer claws on the raccoon’s nose and got away.” The wounded crayfish managed to survive and appears well on its way to eventually shedding its exoskeleton and becoming whole again. The crayfish was released this week into the chilly creek inside Smallin Cave.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A new task force is beginning its work to identify jurisdictional barriers that limit cooperation among local, state, federal and tribal agencies in reporting and searching for missing Native Americans. The Missing Indigenous Persons Task Force also will award a grant to a tribal college to create a database of missing Native Americans. Hollie Mackey, a Northern Cheyenne who is an associate professor at the University of Oklahoma, led the discussion during Tuesday’s meeting in Helena, saying such a coordinated effort is a new undertaking. The task force will study the disproportionate rate at which Native American women and children go missing and ways various law enforcement agencies can work together to find them. The group will report back to lawmakers in September 2020 with policy suggestions.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State Game and Parks Commission officials are urging the public to leave baby wild animals alone even if they appear to be abandoned. Commission officials say lone fawns, birds or mammals may appear to be abandoned or injured, but in many cases the mother is off feeding or drinking and will return. In some cases, other deer will adopt an orphaned fawn. They say it’s also normal for a doe to leave its fawn to keep it from being detected by predators. Predators can see the doe as it feeds, so she often hides the fawn and leaves the area to draw attention away. Additionally, they say wild animals shouldn’t be treated as pets.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The coming of the machines is inevitable. And this city knows it. MGM Resorts International this year plans to install at Sin City resorts an unknown number of automated beverage systems programmed to mix hundreds of different drinks – all at the touch of a button. It’s a job that for many years depended on the hands of living, breathing service workers. But as the incoming technology moves closer to Nevada casinos, rank-and-file union workers can’t say for certain whether machines will force them to abandon jobs they’ve held for years to develop new skills far from the threat of automation. In the offices of MGM, leaders have been reluctant to reveal how many of these systems are coming or how many workers might be displaced. “We are focused on supporting employees,” Brian Ahern, MGM’s director of corporate media relations, said in a statement.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: More than 1,000 graduating high school seniors have participated in alcohol-awareness training on the dangers of underage drinking and impaired driving. Students on Wednesday participated in a virtual impaired driving simulator, programmed for delayed reaction times as the driver navigates different driving conditions, distractions and getting pulled over by an officer. They wore goggles that simulated different blood-concentration levels, allowing students to experience the dangers and consequences of operating a motor vehicle under the influence. They also toured a law enforcement mobile command unit with a drug recognition expert exam area and booking stations. The event was held by the New Hampshire Liquor Commission’s Division of Enforcement and Licensing.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nLong Branch: Most surfers know it’s best to avoid surfing near pipes that dump storm water into the ocean soon after a storm because of the increased chance of getting sick from bacteria that enter the surf. Many do it anyway because the periods just after storms often bring bigger waves, prompting them to hold their nose and brave the “chocolate tube” or “root beer float.” A study of the relationship between heavy rain, outfall pipes and water-borne bacteria is underway at New Jersey’s Monmouth University, where researchers are evaluating water quality at popular surfing beaches along the Jersey shore with an eye toward documenting higher levels of harmful bacteria in the water after storms. The idea is to give surfers and others who use the water more information to make more informed decisions about when to surf and what might be in the water around them.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoswell: This city known for its proximity to arguably the most famous UFO event in the United States now has trademark protection for its alien-inspired logo. The city of Roswell said Tuesday that it received its requested trademark certification from the New Mexico Secretary of State’s Office. The new bright green logo includes the silhouette of a flying saucer within the letter “R.” The trademark will be in effect for 10 years and can be renewed when it nears expiration. Officials say the logo is protected from unauthorized use by other entities or individuals. That will ensure it remains unique to Roswell, providing an identifiable graphic that people will associate with the city. The site of a supposed UFO crash in 1947, Roswell has an annual extraterrestrial festival that draws thousands.\n\nNew York\n\nWatkins Glen: The host of the Woodstock 50 festival pulled out Monday, but organizers say they’re in talks with another venue. The festival has faced a series of setbacks, the latest when Watkins Glen International announced it won’t be the site of the anniversary event in August. Watkins Glen issued a two-sentence statement saying it had terminated the license for the upstate New York festival “pursuant to provisions of the contract.” But later in the day, a principal organizer indicated the show would go on. “We are in discussions with another venue to host Woodstock 50 on Aug. 16-18 and look forward to sharing the new location when tickets go on sale in the coming weeks,” said Gregory Peck, a managing member of organizers of Woodstock 50 LLC.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBoiling Springs Lake: Homeowners in Brunswick County are upset that the value of their property is slated to increase even though their homes no longer have a waterfront view, thanks to Hurricane Florence. WWAY-TV reports the value of homes in Boiling Spring Lakes is expected to increase. County officials say base property rates have increased 10%. Arvil Stephens’ home sits on a peninsula along Patricia Lake, which was drained after Florence’s floodwaters caused dams to breach last year. The county says the home is valued at $501,000 now, compared to $423,000 a few years ago when the lake was full. The county tax office says the appraisals were conducted with the understanding that the lakes would be restored.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Two companies are proposing a $1.6 billion pipeline to move North Dakota crude oil, making it the biggest such project to move oil out of the state since the Dakota Access pipeline that sparked violent clashes between protesters and law enforcement in 2016 and 2017. Houston-based Phillips 66 and Casper, Wyoming-based Bridger Pipeline announced the joint venture called Liberty Pipeline on Monday. It’s designed to move 350,000 barrels of oil daily to the nation’s biggest storage terminal in Cushing, Oklahoma. The exact route of the 24-inch pipeline has not been disclosed, though the companies said the project “will utilize existing pipeline and utility corridors and advanced construction techniques to limit environmental and community impact.” An official also said it wouldn’t cross tribal lands.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The State Medical Board has postponed a vote on adding anxiety and autism spectrum disorder to the list of qualifying conditions for purchasing medical marijuana. Board President Dr. Michael Schottenstein said Wednesday the vote would be delayed to give two new board members time to consider expert reports. A physician panel last month recommended that anxiety and autism be added to the list of 21 conditions for which registered physicians can make a patient recommendation for medical marijuana. The board voted against adding opioid use disorder, depression and insomnia as qualifying conditions, which the physician panel did not recommend after hearing from experts. More than 30,000 people with physician recommendations have registered to buy cannabis, with about half making purchases since some licensed dispensaries opened in January.\n\nOklahoma\n\nHulbert: Self-described “straight country boy” Cody Barlow believes duct tape really can fix anything, including bigots. The 28-year-old college student from Hulbert recently decorated the tailgate of his pickup truck like a pride flag with a bold message: “NOT ALL COUNTRY BOYS ARE BIGOTS.” Barlow’s Facebook post about his truck had been shared more than 135,000 times by Tuesday with comments praising him for being an LGBTQ ally. He says he thinks he can change closed minds and encourage loved ones who feel alone. Now, the “jacked-up” 1991 Chevrolet Silverado he uses to off-road through the woods is plastered with rainbow-colored duct tape. “It fixes everything, even bigots,” he said. Barlow plans to drive his truck in pride parades later this month in Oklahoma City and Fayetteville, Arkansas.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state could become the latest in the nation to prohibit single-use plastic shopping bags. The Senate voted 17-12 to prohibit grocery stores and restaurants from providing plastic checkout bags. Stores will still able to offer recyclable plastic and paper bags for a minimum 5-cent fee. The bill now goes to the governor. Plastic bags are one of the most common types of beach litter. The World Economic Forum reports 8 million metric tons of plastic enter the ocean each year. Republicans took issue with the fee, saying it punished consumers. Some also said single-use bags are more sanitary. California was the first state to prohibit plastic bags, with New York state following suit earlier this year. Hawaii bans all types of single-use bags, both paper and plastic.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: How do you move a priceless, 25,000-pound sphinx? Very carefully. The largest sphinx in the Western Hemisphere is on the move for the first time in nearly 100 years. The Penn Museum in Philadelphia is relocating its 3,000-year-old sphinx of Pharaoh Ramses II from the Egypt Gallery where it’s resided since 1926. The sphinx’s slow, painstaking journey began Wednesday morning. It’s moving about 250 feet to a featured location in the museum’s new entrance hall. Museum officials are using air dollies to move the statue through a series of doorways, windows, hairpin turns and tight squeezes. Museum director Julian Siggers says the sphinx has been the museum’s unofficial mascot for a long time, and its new location will put it “front and center.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: The Navy’s top admiral says an investigation into allegations of mismanagement at the U.S. Naval War College is continuing, and he’s confident the college will be stronger in the end. Adm. John Richardson, the chief of naval operations, says the college in Newport will continue to be a strong, vibrant institution. The college president, Rear Adm. Jeffrey Harley, is under investigation for allegedly spending excessively, abusing his hiring authority and otherwise behaving inappropriately, including keeping a margarita machine in his office. Harley was removed from his post Monday. Richardson says he felt there was “enough actionable information” to reassign Harley.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state is transitioning to a paper-based voting system that is meant to be more secure than the paperless system that’s raised concerns from some in the past. Under the new system, voters will make their selections on a touchscreen. Paper ballots will be printed off, and voters will then feed the paper ballot into a scanner that counts and records the votes. The paper ballots are saved for auditing and verification, according to the South Carolina Election Commission. The Election Commission says the new system is intended to be more secure and provide a paper trail for votes.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: A health board that advocates for Native Americans in the Great Plains will soon operate most of Sioux San Hospital. The Great Plains Tribal Chairmen’s Health Board, on behalf of the Oglala and Cheyenne River Sioux tribes, will take over most of the hospital’s management from federal Indian Health Service, according to a news release from the agency. The transfer is scheduled for July 21. The Indian Health Service will continue to provide health care at the hospital, which serves Native Americans, the Rapid City Journal reports. Charmaine White Face opposes the pending transfer. White Face – a Lakota elder, former Oglala Sioux Tribe treasurer and spokeswoman for the Sioux Nation Treaty Council – says she is concerned that not everyone will receive quality health care. “They’re not a health care management system. They are an advocacy organization,” White Face said of the board.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The University of Memphis says it plans to start a culinary institute. A news release says the university’s Board of Trustees approved the Culinary Arts and Foodservice Enterprise at a meeting last week. The university says the culinary school will be an expansion of the Kemmons Wilson School of Hospitality & Resort Management. The institute is expected to be located at the former L’Ecole Culinaire facility in the Memphis suburb of Cordova. The lease requires State Building Commission approval. At the meeting, trustees also approved doctorate programs in applied physics and health sciences, a master’s program in data science, and a bachelor’s degree in public health.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott has signed into law a measure that’s meant to allow children to run lemonade stands without fear of being shut down by police. The bill signed by the Republican governor Monday was passed this year after Texas police shut down a lemonade stand run by two girls in 2015. Abbott called the measure “a commonsense law” in a video of him signing the bill posted on Twitter. The new Texas law legalizes temporary lemonade stands or other stands selling nonalcoholic beverages operated by minors on private property or public parks. Lemonade stands were previously illegal in Texas because homemade drinks are banned due to health concerns. The new law takes effect Sept. 1.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The largest DNA mapping study in U.S. history is about to launch from Utah with the stated goal of changing the way health care providers approach diseases. In a press conference Wednesday, officials with Salt Lake City-based Intermountain Healthcare announced a “groundbreaking” DNA initiative and project it will undertake with deCODE genetics, a biopharmaceutical company based in Iceland. The five-year study will involve the collection of DNA samples from more than 500,000 participants – most of whom will be Utahns. Individuals will be invited to participate in the study for free, and enrollment is already open. The results of the DNA mapping will be returned to patients if researchers find a gene they know puts their family at risk for cancer or other genetic diseases.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Republican Gov. Phil Scott has signed a bill into law that protects a woman’s access to abortion services. In signing the legislation Monday, Scott said that he has consistently supported a woman’s right to choose and that “the legislation affirms what is already allowable in Vermont – protecting reproductive rights and ensuring those decisions remain between a woman and her health care provider.” The measure is separate from a proposal to amend the state constitution to guarantee a woman’s right to an abortion. Proponents say the two measures are needed in case the U.S. Supreme Court overturns the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide.\n\nVirginia\n\nAlexandria: Virginia Tech says it plans to build a new northern Virginia campus that was instrumental in luring a new Amazon headquarters a few blocks north of the originally planned spot. The Innovation Campus at Virginia Tech will now be located at the current location of the Potomac Yard shopping center in Alexandria. School officials say the original location was not going to be big enough to support both the campus and expected ancillary development. The new location puts the campus just steps away from a planned Metrorail station and closer to the Amazon campus in Arlington County that expects to house as many as 38,000 workers over the next 20 years. Virginia Tech said the 15-acre campus will enroll its first students in 2020.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Tech companies, hospitals and others have pledged nearly $49 million to help construct eight buildings to house the area’s chronically homeless. The Seattle Times reports Swedish Health Services, Premera Blue Cross and Providence St. Joseph Health announced $15 million in donations last month to support a Seattle nonprofit developer. Plymouth Housing has launched a $75 million campaign to double its units in Seattle. It operates facilities for chronically homeless people where they have access to health care, social services and treatment. Amazon and Microsoft have each pledged $5 million for the campaign. Plymouth says the donations will help it leverage up to $250 million in public funds for the project.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nParkersburg: A principal accused of plagiarizing Ashton Kutcher in an address to his school’s graduating class has been suspended without pay for five days. The News and Sentinel reports Parkersburg High School Principal Kenny DeMoss was suspended Tuesday at a Wood County Board of Education meeting. DeMoss apologized for heavily basing his May address on Kutcher’s 2013 Nickelodeon Teen Choice Awards speech. He has said he should’ve cited his sources, but the ideas were his own. A Facebook video highlighting the plagiarism spliced the speeches together. DeMoss said the video excluded a disclaimer that multiple sources informed his speech. Kutcher tweeted Saturday that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and cited Oscar Wilde for the quote. He then quipped that “kids and faculty” should cite their sources.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Voters who appear to have moved within the state will have up to two years to update their voter registration, rather than be deactivated within a month. The Wisconsin Elections Commission voted Tuesday to make the change. Voters who appear to have moved will still receive a postcard, likely in late August, saying that state records indicate they have moved. In 2018, when the mailings were first sent, about 308,000 voters had their registrations deactivated within a month. Many of them showed up to vote only to be told they had to register again. To avoid that, the commission is giving voters much longer to affirm their registration or reregister at their new address. Voters who may have moved will be flagged at the polling booth, giving them a chance to fix the problem there.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Gov. Mark Gordon has appointed eight members of a new advisory group that will develop recommendations to improve state policies related to big game migration on lands that are also suitable for mineral development. The Migration Corridor Advisory Group includes representatives from the oil and gas, mining and agriculture sectors, as well as conservation, recreation and sportsmen groups and a county commissioner. The goal is for the group members to collaboratively develop recommendations in the next three months. Its first meeting is later this month in Rock Springs. Wyoming’s major migration corridors are among the longest in North America and are essential to the health of mule deer.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/06/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/25/disappeared-ducky-ramen-rewards-dorothy-parker-news-around-states/118469094/", "title": "Disappeared ducky, ramen rewards: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: The Alabama Stone has been at the center of a mystery since its discovery in 1817, but a local man with a passion for history believes he’s unraveled its biggest question. Many have speculated about the meaning of the number 1232 scratched into the rock along with a Latin inscription, calling it everything from an enigma to a hoax. “I started looking at it and wondered why they couldn’t figure out what this number is on this stone,” Ken Willis said. “That’s been disputed now for 200 years.” The words seem to read: “HISPAN ET IND REX,” roughly translated to “King of Spain and the Indies,” echoing words carved on Spanish coins. Willis believes the stone is likely both an indication of a land claim left when explorer Hernando de Soto passed through the area in 1540 and a mileage marker, with the oft-debated number an indication of how far the spot was from Spain. Willis credited his work as a bridge inspector for the Alabama Department of Transportation with giving him insight. In modern terms, 1,232 Spanish nautical leagues is almost exactly the distance from Spain to the point on the Black Warrior River where the marker was found. “I like to have fell out of my chair,” Willis said. “I couldn’t believe it. How could I, 200 years later, come up with it? It’s only because of GPS.”\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Additional programs have launched aimed at providing pandemic aid to Tlingit and Haida tribal members and to shareholders of an Alaska Native corporation whose shareholder base is of Tlingit and Haida descent. One of the programs, from the Central Council of Tlingit and Haida Indian Tribes of Alaska, is offering up to $1,000 in aid to tribal members who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The other, from Goldbelt Inc., is making available up to $2,600 per shareholder. Shareholders must be U.S. citizens and be able to show a financial impact from the pandemic to be eligible, KTOO Public Media reports. Nathan Johnson recently applied for one of the $1,000 grants. He used to work seasonal jobs in Angoon, but the pandemic hit the economy there hard, and he moved to Juneau for work opportunities. Grandparents in Angoon have been looking after his three children, whom he wants to bring to Juneau. He has been working at a restaurant and saving for an apartment for his family. He said $1,000 would be a “big help,” and submitting his application felt like a “big mountain off his shoulders.” Funding for the Tlingit and Haida program comes from a federal recovery package passed by Congress earlier this year.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The delivery of a report on the 2020 vote count to state Senate Republicans was delayed yet again Monday after the Donald Trump supporter hired to lead the effort and several others involved contracted COVID-19 “and are quite sick,” the Senate GOP leader said. The unprecedented partisan review from Cyber Ninjas, a small cybersecurity consultant with no election experience, has so far taken more than double the expected 60 days. The report, commissioned by Senate Republicans and funded mostly by Trump allies promoting his unsupported election fraud narrative, will not immediately be made public. Rather, two senior Republican senators will review it along with lawyers and advisers to decide whether the findings are supported by evidence. Republican Senate President Karen Fann said anything lacking sufficient backing will be removed. Election experts have been highly critical of the review, which Fann launched late last year as Trump and his allies hunted unsuccessfully for reasons to block the Jan. 6 certification of Democrat Joe Biden’s victory. Election experts say Cyber Ninjas and its subcontracts are biased and incompetent, and they’re using bizarre, ever-changing procedures that could not produce reliable results. Cyber Ninjas owner Doug Logan has spread false conspiracy theories about the election.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Attorneys for former reality TV star Josh Duggar have filed motions seeking to dismiss child pornography charges against him. The motions ask for the dismissal of the two charges and to suppress evidence in the case, including all statements Duggar made to investigators, the Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The documents, filed Friday, allege that prosecutors failed to preserve potentially exculpatory evidence and that the two acting secretaries of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security at the time of the investigation weren’t properly appointed. The motions to suppress evidence say investigators took Duggar’s cellphone before he could call his lawyer and questioned him without his lawyer present. Duggar, who appeared in TLC’s “19 Kids and Counting,” was indicted in April on two counts of downloading and possessing child pornography, some of which prosecutors said depicted sexual abuse of toddlers. He has pleaded not guilty. Duggar has been confined to the home of family friends who agreed to be his custodian during his release, and he is prohibited from using internet-accessible devices as he awaits trial. “19 Kids and Counting” was canceled following revelations that Duggar had molested four sisters and a babysitter. He also previously apologized for a pornography addiction and cheating on his wife.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSouth Lake Tahoe: An army of firefighters worked Tuesday to try to keep a huge wildfire from pushing toward Lake Tahoe, the blue alpine lake surrounded by resort communities straddling the California-Nevada state line. The Caldor Fire, growing explosively at times, has scorched about 184 square miles and destroyed at least 455 homes since breaking out Aug. 14 in the Sierra Nevada southwest of Lake Tahoe. Just 9% contained and a threat to more than 17,000 structures, the Caldor Fire has become the nation’s No. 1 priority for firefighting resources, said Chief Thom Porter, director of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. “It is knocking on the door to the Lake Tahoe basin,” he said at a Monday briefing. “We have all efforts in place to keep it out of the basin, but we do need to also be aware that is a possibility based on the way the fires have been burning.” Porter said he personally did not believe the fire would get into the basin but could be proved wrong, given the extraordinary behavior of current fires, such as the 1,142-square-mile Dixie Fire to the north in the Sierra-Cascades region. “Mother Nature has taken over and taken fires like the Dixie to places that I never thought was possible,” he said. The Dixie Fire, burning for more than a month, was 41% contained after destroying at least 1,262 buildings.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Drones have become increasingly popular among outdoor hobbyists, prompting state wildlife officials to voice concerns about the stress the buzzing aircraft can cause wildlife, especially as fall hunting seasons begin and animals prepare for winter. The Federal Aviation Administration said there were 1.1 million small hobbyist drones in the U.S. in 2016, a number that is expected to triple to 3.5 million this year. Colorado Parks and Wildlife Field Services Assistant Director Heather Dugan said harassing wildlife with a drone is illegal. “The definition of harassment is causing any change in the behavior of the wildlife,” Dugan said in a news release. “So if the animal runs, if it changes direction, if it stops eating, that’s harassment. Any change in the animal is considered harassment and it’s illegal.” Use of drones is prohibited for hunting before, during or after outings in Colorado, Dugan said. “The bottom line is, if it’s related to a hunt in any way, you can’t do it,” Dugan said. “For scouting, locating, anything. If they fly before they take an animal, they’re illegal. If they use the drone to locate an animal they may have shot and wounded, they’re illegal.” Penalties for violating drone laws can range from $70 up to $125,000 if hunting purposes are involved, with equipment subject to seizure.\n\nConnecticut\n\nBristol: A woman who had a package stolen from her front step discovered the culprit was a black bear. Kristin Levine, of Bristol, posted home surveillance video on Facebook on Monday showing the bear sauntering across her driveway with the Amazon package in its mouth. “Yea so if anyone sees an Amazon package in the Chippens Hill area with my name on it…feel free to bring it back?” Levine wrote in her post. She told NBC Connecticut she received an alert from her security system about five minutes after Amazon dropped off the package and was “taken aback because I wasn’t expecting anyone else in my driveway.” The bear, she said, ended up dropping off the parcel in a neighbor’s yard. It was apparently not interested in the contents: several rolls of toilet paper, she said. “It was hysterical, like I said. I knew nothing in there was going to be irreplaceable, so it was a fun afternoon for sure,” Levine said. Her post on Facebook received numerous comments, including from people comparing the ursine porch pirate to the bear from the Charmin toilet paper commercials.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown: The Indian River School District Board of Education voted “no confidence” in Gov. John Carney’s mask mandate Monday night and voted to submit a petition asking for the emergency order to be reconsidered or revised. The no-confidence vote is a largely symbolic action. Indian River students will still have to wear masks this year. “We are trying to work within the rules that are set in front of us, and we’re speaking out as a board,” Board President Rodney Layfield said. “I think this was what we could do to exercise ... what little local control we have within our district.” The decision seemed to appease the 125 or so people who came to the meeting for the district that serves nearly 10,600 students. They cheered at the no-confidence vote, which came after many took the opportunity to comment in opposition to the mask requirement. The board twice extended the comment period to accommodate speakers. Carney announced Aug. 10 that everyone kindergarten-age and older in public and private schools and child care centers must wear face coverings indoors, regardless of COVID-19 vaccination status. The mandate is based on Aug. 5 guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but Indian River board member Charles Hattier said that “the governor is not following good science.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: As refugees fleeing Afghanistan relocate to the U.S. capital region, a restaurant specializing in Afghan cuisine is trying to help those in need, WUSA-TV reports. Lapis, a Michelin-recognized bistro in D.C.’s Adams Morgan neighborhood, put out a call for donations on its Instagram page, asking anyone who wants to donate supplies to drop them off at the restaurant. “The outpour of love and support is just astonishing,” co-owner Fatima Popal said. “We are truly, truly humbled by not only the donations but the people who are coming through here.” She said many of the volunteers who are spending time in the basement of her family’s business donated items themselves. “We did it because we needed to do something, and we couldn’t sit idle,” Popal said. She said the support has been so overwhelming that keeping track of the number of volunteers and donated items has been hard. A neighbor even donated extra space to help store the donations, which will be delivered to families with the help of resettlement agencies. “It feels really good to me to be a part of the community and support the work they’re doing for our new community that’s immigrating here,” volunteer Miranda Beebe said. “I just knew it was a way we can all pull together and make sure the America we want them to know be represented that way.”\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Walt Disney World will now require union employees as well as non-union and salaried workers to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to keep their jobs at the theme park. The deal was reached Monday with a union coalition, shortly after the Pfizer vaccine earned full Food and Drug Administration approval. It requires the workers to show proof of vaccination by Oct. 22 to remain employed, although they can request exemptions for medical or religious reasons, a union statement said. Any employee who doesn’t comply or request an exemption will be “separated from the company with a ‘yes’ rehire status,” according to the Service Trades Council Union. Before layoffs and furloughs due to the pandemic, the coalition covered about 43,000 of 77,000 Disney World workers. Disney announced last month that all non-union hourly and salaried employees would be required to receive the vaccine within 60 days. The company also asked all employees who were working from home to show proof of vaccination before returning to work. The company will hold on-site inoculation events for employees over the next several weeks, the union statement said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStone Mountain: The board that oversees a park near Atlanta voted Monday for a new logo that excludes the park’s giant mountainside carving of Confederate leaders. It’s another change by the Stone Mountain Memorial Association to address criticism of the park’s Confederate legacy and shore up its finances. The board voted in May to relocate Confederate flags from a busy walking trail up the side of the mountain and create a museum exhibit that acknowledges the site’s connection to the Ku Klux Klan. The previous logo included a picture of the famous carving of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Gens. Stonewall Jackson and Robert E. Lee. The new logo includes an image of a lake inside the park and a side of the mountain where the carving isn’t visible. Critics have called on the board to remove the colossal sculpture from the mountain’s northern face. Completed in 1972, it measures 190 feet across and 90 feet tall. It is the largest Confederate monument ever crafted and has special protection in Georgia law. Work on the Stone Mountain sculpture languished until the state bought the mountain in 1958 for a park. Finishing the monument gained renewed urgency amid resistance from Georgia and other Southern states to the civil rights movement and efforts to end segregation. Today, the site markets itself as a family theme park.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The governor is asking visitors and residents to reduce travel to the islands to essential business only as the state struggles to control COVID-19. Gov. David Ige said Monday that he wants to curtail travel to Hawaii through the end of October. “It is a risky time to be traveling right now,” he said. He said restaurant capacity has been restricted, and there’s limited access to rental cars. Ige stopped short of a mandate, saying it’s a different time now than last year, when strict travel rules that required quarantining essentially shut down Hawaii’s tourism industry. “Last year in March, when I first asked for visitors to postpone travel to the islands, we saw a 60% reduction in the traffic to Hawaii,” Ige said. “And then, certainly, ordering the mandatory quarantine of all incoming visitors reduced travel to the islands by 99.5%, essentially 100% of travelers.” Things are different now with vaccines available and guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention saying fully vaccinated people can travel domestically. Ige said he supports Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi’s announcement to restrict indoor gatherings to 10 people and outdoor gatherings to 25. Blangiardi said the rules taking effect Wednesday would apply to weddings and other events.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Idaho Supreme Court has rejected a new law designed to make it harder for voters to get initiatives on the ballot, saying the legislation was so restrictive that it violated a fundamental right under the state’s constitution. The ruling issued Monday was a win for Reclaim Idaho, a group that successfully sponsored a Medicaid expansion initiative three years ago and is now working to qualify an initiative for the ballot that aims to increase public education funding. Idaho Speaker of the House Scott Bedke said in a statement that members of the House Republican Caucus were disappointed by the ruling. He said the law would have increased voter involvement, “especially in the corners of the state too often forgotten by some.” Reclaim Idaho co-founder Luke Mayville said the ruling means thousands of Idaho residents are “breathing sighs of relief.” Passed earlier this year, the new law required signature-gatherers to get 6% of registered voters in each of Idaho’s 35 legislative districts within a short time span. Opponents said it made Idaho’s initiative process the toughest in the nation, rendering such efforts virtually impossible to achieve. But supporters said the law would protect people with less popular political opinions from being overrun by the majority.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A gunshot detection system that has cost the city tens of millions of dollars and is touted as a critical component of the police department’s effort to combat gun violence rarely produces evidence of gun-related crime, Chicago’s watchdog agency concluded. In a scathing report released Tuesday, the Office of Inspector General’s Public Safety section said the police department data it examined “does not support a conclusion that ShotSpotter is an effective tool in developing evidence of gun-related crime.” And, the office concluded, if the department has information that shows ShotSpotter plays a key role in developing such evidence, its “record-keeping practices are obstructing a meaningful analysis of the effectiveness of the technology.” The inspector general’s office found that between Jan. 1, 2020, and May 31, 2021, just over 50,000 ShotSpotter alerts were confirmed as probable gunshots, but actual evidence of a gun-related crime was found in only about 4,500 instances, or roughly 9%. The report is the latest blow to a system that has come under scrutiny, particularly in Chicago, after it set in motion the fatal police shooting of a 13-year-old boy last March. And an Associated Press review released last week found serious flaws in the use of ShotSpotter as evidentiary support for prosecutors.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A study by Early Learning Indiana sheds light on which areas across the state are lacking accessibility and availability of quality early childhood care and education. Only 25% of children in the state have access to high-quality preschool, it finds. The Closing the Gap report uses new methodology to analyze availability, accessibility and quality of early learning opportunities in each of Indiana’s 92 counties and highlights some disparities between the state’s urban centers and rural communities. Early Learning Indiana President and CEO Maureen Weber said it’s important for all Hoosiers, regardless of socioeconomic status, to have access to and take advantage of early learning opportunities. “We know that access to high-quality early learning services is truly foundational to a child’s success in kindergarten and beyond,” Weber said, “and also has great bearing on family self-sufficiency and community resiliency.” The goal of the study was to provide decision-makers with more than just an overall capacity count, Weber said – Early Learning Indiana wanted them to understand the nature of those seats, both their accessibility and availability.\n\nIowa\n\nIndianola: The Indianola School Board has tabled discussions about dumping the district’s Indian mascot to focus its attention on fighting the spread of coronavirus in school buildings. The board decided at a meeting Monday to postpone acting on any mascot changes until after the November election, in which at least three board seats will be decided at the polls. “This is not our priority,” school board member Carolyn Langenwalter said. “I’m not disagreeing that we should talk about it, but I think it’s something we delay until we get through the pandemic.” The board’s decision comes as schools, cities and athletic teams across the country are changing or reconsidering mascots considered to be culturally insensitive. Last year, the city of Indianola voted to remove Native American imagery from its city logo, including from police cars, badges and patches.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: People who oppose mask requirements or restrictions on public gatherings imposed by counties can challenge them in court and obtain a ruling within 10 days – at least for now – because of a decision Tuesday by the state’s highest court. The Kansas Supreme Court’s ruling could discourage counties from imposing mask mandates to deal with the two-month surge in coronavirus cases tied to the more contagious delta variant. It also could cause school boards to hesitate as well, though most of them are not directly affected. The court granted a stay allowing enforcement of the pandemic-inspired law until it can rule on Republican state Attorney General Derek Schmidt’s appeal of a lower court’s ruling that declared the law unconstitutional. The GOP-led Legislature passed the law in March to restrict the power of Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly and county officials during emergencies. The Supreme Court’s order, signed by Chief Justice Marla Luckert, didn’t explain why it granted the stay, though it could indicate that the justices feel Schmidt’s appeal has merit. The state’s COVID-19 cases have been surging at levels not seen since late January, when vaccines still weren’t widely available, with 1,208 new cases per day for the seven-day period that ended Monday. Hospitals also have been stressed for weeks.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state is seeing record numbers of COVID-19 patients in hospitals and intensive care units as cases are driven up by the fast-spreading delta variant of the coronavirus, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday. More than 20 Kentucky hospitals are confronting critical staffing shortages, and some hospitals are converting space to treat the influx of ICU patients, the governor said. “Our hospitalizations have been doubling just about every two weeks,” the Democratic governor said at a news conference. “And folks, that means we are getting really close to every single bed across the entire commonwealth that we can staff being full.” Some hospitals have begun delaying elective surgeries. Beshear presented grim statistics to show the severity of the surge. The state had 2,596 new COVID-19 cases – a pandemic high for any Monday in Kentucky – and 17 more virus-related deaths. More than 1,890 virus patients were reported hospitalized in Kentucky, including 529 in intensive care units, he said. A record 301 Kentucky virus patients were on ventilators. The surge comes as the Republican-dominated Legislature assumes considerably more control over the commonwealth’s response to COVID-19 after the state Supreme Court on Saturday cleared the way for laws limiting the governor’s emergency powers to take effect.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state is considering which of three areas will become the first site dominated by a river delta in a federally sponsored network to protect, study and teach about estuaries. Nine virtual town hall meetings – three each about the Atchafalaya, Barataria and Pontchartrain basins – have been scheduled in September to tell people statewide about the program and hear their thoughts. Louisiana is among seven coastal states that are not part of the National Estuarine Research Reserve System guided and largely paid for by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It’s the only Gulf Coast state without such a reserve, though variety is more important than state-by-state inclusion. And Louisiana’s will be unique, said Joelle Gore, stewardship division chief of NOAA’s Office for Coastal Management. There’s a small delta in Alaska’s 372,000-acre Kachemak Bay reserve, and Alabama’s Weeks Bay reserve is within the extensive Mississippi River delta region, she said Friday. But “the dominance of that system in Louisiana is unlike any other,” she said. Estuaries are brackish bodies of water usually found where rivers meet the sea.\n\nMaine\n\nBelfast: A 25-foot inflatable duck named Joy disappeared over the weekend, as mysteriously as it arrived, after bringing days of delight to a seaside community. The rubber ducky was removed from the harbor sometime Saturday, likely because of concerns about Tropical Storm Henri, Belfast Harbor Master Katherine Given told the Bangor Daily News. Despite the weather concerns, Given said, people were upset to see the duck leave the harbor. The duck’s arrival there two weekends ago remains a mystery. But Given said she received an anonymous letter from someone claiming to be responsible. “JOY simply is fowl play. In this day in age of such bitter divisiveness in our country, we wanted to put forth a reminder of our commonalities instead of our differences,” the letter said. “Nothing embodies childhood more than being in a warm bath with your rubber ducky – the joy of not having a care in the world other than having to remember to wash behind our ears.” Will the ducky return? That’s not known – but the letter alluded to the duck landing somewhere else after Belfast.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: More than 200,000 residents have gained health insurance coverage during a coronavirus special enrollment period. Maryland Health Connection announced Tuesday that a total of 201,141 people had enrolled since March 2020. The 17-month special enrollment period in response to the pandemic was one of the longest of any state in the country. It was extended several times as the emergency continued and ended Aug. 15. Maryland Health Connection is administered by the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange. More than 1.3 million Marylanders are currently covered through Maryland Health Connection – about 1.2 million in Medicaid and more than 165,000 in private coverage, with nearly 80% qualifying for financial help. That’s up 12% compared to before the pandemic. The next opportunity for Marylanders to enroll in private health insurance through Maryland Health Connection will begin Nov. 1 for the 2022 coverage year.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nMalden: The state Board of Elementary and Secondary Education overwhelmingly approved a measure Tuesday that gives Education Commissioner Jeff Riley the authority to issue a universal mask mandate for K-12 schools. Riley is expected to formally issue an indoor mandate this week and has previously said it would last through Oct. 1, or for about the first month of the new school year. A mandate would mark a shift for the administration of Gov. Charlie Baker, which had previously left face covering decisions up to individual districts. “Ultimately, we believe that vaccinations will be the most important factor in bringing this pandemic to an end,” Riley said. “We know that a return this fall to full-time, in-person instruction is crucial. And after the challenges of last year, it will be incredibly important for this year to get off on a strong start.” He also said it is possible masks “may be required intermittently throughout the year based on the trajectory of the virus.” Students with certain medical conditions or behavioral needs would be exempt from the requirement. Students under age 5 would also be exempted. Under Riley’s plan, middle and high schools would be allowed to lift the mask mandate after Oct. 1 if at least 80% of staff and students were fully vaccinated.\n\nMichigan\n\nAnn Arbor: Hundreds of students at the University of Michigan could be couch surfing when the new school year begins Monday. A developer admits that The One, a new apartment complex in Ann Arbor, is behind schedule and won’t be ready until September, MLive.com reports. Students have been offered a hotel room or cash stipend until their apartments are completed, said Damian VanMatre, vice president of development at Trinitas Ventures, based in Lafayette, Indiana. Students also can break their lease, he said. “Unfortunately, construction was shut down for months in 2020 due to the pandemic, and when construction restarted the general contractor struggled to recover from the delays due to material and product availability along with labor shortages – the same challenges faced by other contractors throughout the United States,” VanMatre said. Some students are complaining that they’ve been offered hotel rooms miles away in Livonia and Canton Township. “The timing overall has created immense mental anguish and stress for students during a notoriously difficult time in every student’s life,” said a letter by students.\n\nMinnesota\n\nFalcon Heights: About 150 vendors will be missing when the Minnesota State Fair returns this week from a one-year layoff due to the pandemic. Many pulled out due to COVID-19 fears, staffing shortages and product supply chain issues. That’s double the number of vendors that usually drop out compared with other recent years, the St. Paul Pioneer Press reports. “Yes, we did lose 150 vendors, but that’s over the past year,” fair spokeswoman Danielle Dullinger said, adding that only one was a food vendor. “I know a lot of state agencies are not able to come this year.” Those agencies include the Office of Higher Education, the Department of Education and the Department of Health. The Department of Natural Resources won’t open its building, but outdoor activities – including the popular fish pond, raptor demonstrations and performances on the outdoor stage – are still planned. On the bright side, Dullinger said, the fair will be adding 61 new vendors to the mix when it returns Thursday. Last week, fair officials announced that they would urge but not require fairgoers to wear masks and be vaccinated before entering. The decision ultimately did cause seven vendors to cancel, Dullinger said. One of those was Education Minnesota, with the teachers union citing “health and safety concerns.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: More than 1,000 out-of-state medical workers began to deploy to 50 hospitals across the state Tuesday to help with staffing shortages amid an unrelenting surge of COVID-19 cases. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said 808 nurses, three certified nurse anesthetists, 22 nurse practitioners, 193 respiratory therapists and 20 paramedics were hired under 60-day contracts that could be extended if needed. The Mississippi Emergency Management Agency awarded contracts to four companies of the 19 that submitted bids when the state sought medical workers earlier this month. Reeves said the contract employees are being deployed within nine business days from when the state Health Department asked MEMA to seek the help. “That, in my view, is an impressive feat,” Reeves said during a news conference Tuesday. Mississippi will pay $80 million for the contracts, and Reeves said he expects the federal government to reimburse the state for the entire expense. The Army and the Air Force are also each deploying medical contingents to work in Mississippi, with 43 people from each branch. The Health Department on Tuesday reported 3,291 new cases of COVID-19 and 111 new deaths, bringing the total since the start of the pandemic to at least 8,158 deaths and nearly 417,000 cases.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Civil rights leaders on Monday warned state lawmakers that attempts to ban critical race theory in schools could scare educators away from teaching about the Holocaust. Rabbis, teachers and others testified during an informational Joint Committee on Education hearing about critical race theory, a framework for examining the effects race and racism have on institutions. Dee Dee Simon, a member of the state’s Holocaust Education and Awareness Commission, said the board is worried that limits on how educators teach about race “would obstruct and/or hinder Holocaust education in the classroom.” “Would it make it illegal to tell students the truth, based on facts, that the Nazis were systematically unfair to the Jewish people?” she asked. “Would it make it illegal to say that the Nazis legislated the persecution of the Jews and that these were race laws?” Of 425 Missouri school districts, three said they used critical race theory or the New York Times’ 1619 Project in curricula, according to a July survey by the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education. Missouri’s GOP-controlled Legislature is not in session, and no bills to ban critical race theory are pending. But Republican lawmakers filed long-shot proposals this year in a show of opposition to the theory.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: U.S. Minerals Inc., accused of exposing employees to elevated levels of arsenic at its Anaconda facility, admitted Monday to violating the Clean Air Act, according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney’s Office. In addition, the corporation has agreed to settle a related civil case regarding violations brought by the Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration. U.S. Minerals pleaded guilty to one count of negligent endangerment, a misdemeanor, under the Clean Air Act as charged in a criminal information. The corporation faces a maximum penalty of five years of probation and a fine as determined through statute. Under the terms of a plea agreement in the criminal case, the government and U.S. Minerals will jointly recommend to the court that the company be placed on probation for five years and pay a $393,200 fine. The agreement recommends probationary conditions in which U.S. Minerals will implement a nationwide environmental health and safety plan that applies to all of its facilities throughout the United States and a medical monitoring program for current and former employees who have been exposed to elevated levels of arsenic during their work at the Anaconda plant, which has ceased operations.\n\nNebraska\n\nRalston: Students and staff at the middle school and high schools in an Omaha suburb are now required to wear masks following new cases of COVID-19 in the district, officials announced. Ralston Public Schools announced the change Sunday, saying the policy applies to staff members and students from seventh through 12th grades, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Masking will be required through Sept. 16, when district officials will review the policy. Masks will be available at the schools for students who do not have them. Superintendent Mark Adler said in a letter to parents that the decision was made after three cases were identified in one classroom at the secondary level. The Ralston district was already requiring students in preschool through sixth grade, staff and visitors to wear masks. “It has been our goal from the beginning of this pandemic to find a way to keep our students in school,” Adler wrote. “Implementing this additional intervention will help us mitigate the spread and not keep students at home or close a classroom or school.” The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska has sharply risen over the past two weeks from more than 374 new cases per day Aug. 7 to nearly 728 new cases per day Saturday, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: It’s all aboard the Virginia & Truckee Railway this weekend – with masks mandatory – for the first time in 18 months on the historic Engine No. 18 and passenger cars offering round-trip rides from Carson City to Virginia City. The V&T Railway typically operates in the summer months and during the December holiday season with a special schedule and Santa Clause on the Polar Express. But the COVID-19 pandemic forced its closure before the 2020 summer season began. Service returns Saturday with an opening ceremony at Eastgate Depot in Carson City. It will run Saturdays and Sundays through Oct. 31, followed by the return of the Polar Express this winter. “We’re very fortunate that our loyal supporters have been patient and persistent in supporting us through this last season,” V&T Commission Chairman David Peterson said Friday. “We can’t wait to get going again.” The train offers scenic views of the Virginia Mountain range on the way to the historic mining town, along with abandoned mine shafts, old mill sites and sometimes free-roaming mustangs. Ticket prices range from $55 for adults to $35 for children ages 2 to 15. Masks are required aboard the train and inside Eastgate Depot.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHancock: The Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire is expanding beyond Portsmouth. The Portsmouth Black Heritage Trail got its start more than 20 years ago and now includes two dozen markers that shed light on the city’s Black history. Now a statewide organization, the Black Heritage Trail of New Hampshire plans to unveil markers this fall in Hancock, Milford, Warner and several other communities. The first unveiling is set for Sept. 18 in Hancock. The marker will describe Jack, a once-enslaved African man who gained his freedom and lived there in the late 1700s and early 1800s. It also will describe the Due family, free people of color who lived around the same time. The marker is at the site of their former home on property now owned by the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests. After the unveiling at 9:30 a.m., a noon celebratory program with music and food is scheduled at the Hancock Congregational Church. Preregistration for the Sept. 18 event in Hancock is required, and space is limited.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBranchburg: Hazing will be met with harsher penalties under a new law named after Tim Piazza, a New Jersey native and Penn State student who died in 2017. Gov. Phil Murphy signed Timothy J. Piazza’s Law on Tuesday at Raritan Valley Community College, not far from where Piazza, who died when he was a 19-year-old sophomore studying engineering, grew up. Pennsylvania also enacted tougher anti-hazing laws in 2018 that permit fraternity houses to be confiscated when severe hazing occurs. “The safety of our students is our top priority, and we must do all that we can to protect them from cruel and dangerous hazing rituals,” said Murphy, a Democrat. “With today’s bill signing, we honor Tim Piazza’s life and make our strongest effort yet to root out hazing to prevent similar tragedies.” The measure requires all public and private middle and high schools, as well as colleges and universities, to draw up anti-hazing policies, along with penalties for violations that could include withholding of a diploma, suspension or expulsion. The new law also establishes that hazing resulting in serious injury or death will be considered a third-degree crime, up from fourth-degree. A conviction will carry a prison sentence of up to five years, a fine as high as $15,000 or both, vs. up to 18 months, a $10,000 fine or both.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: Drone pilots beware. Authorities at one of the nation’s top nuclear weapons laboratories issued a warning Monday that airspace over Los Alamos National Laboratory is off limits. The birthplace of the atomic bomb, Los Alamos lab reported that recent unauthorized drone flights have been detected in restricted airspace in the area. Officials said anyone who flies a drone over the lab likely will lose it. “We can detect and track a UAS (unmanned aircraft system), and if it poses a threat, we have the ability to disrupt control of the system, seize or exercise control, confiscate or use reasonable force to disable, damage or destroy the UAS,” said Unica Viramontes, senior director of lab security. The lab would not release any specifics about how the system works, citing security protocols. They also would not say how many unauthorized flights have occurred in recent months. Lab officials warned of the potential for “collateral interceptions” of normal commercial or hobbyist drone flights, saying pilots should stay well outside the lab’s restricted airspace and the additional no-drone zone designated by the Federal Aviation Administration. According to the FAA, drones are prohibited from flying over sites designated as national security sensitive facilities.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Dorothy Parker died in 1967, but it was not until last year that her ashes found a final resting place. Now, at a memorial ceremony at the Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, her headstone has been unveiled at the family plot where ashes of the writer, humorist and civil rights supporter are buried, the New York Post reports. Born in 1893 in New York, Parker wrote poems, short stories, and theater and literary reviews for magazines like Vogue, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. She was famous for one-liners such as, “The first thing I do in the morning is brush my teeth and sharpen my tongue,” and “Men seldom make passes at girls who wear glasses.” She died without leaving instructions on what to do with her remains but left her estate, along with the right to collect future royalties, to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whom she’d never met. When King was assassinated, her estate transferred to the NAACP, which laid her ashes to rest in a garden outside its Baltimore headquarters in 1988. Before that, her remains had been held for years at a crematorium and in an attorney’s filing cabinet. Parker’s relatives attended Monday’s memorial, where those gathered read from Parker’s work and some poured gin, her beverage of choice, on the grave. The headstone is carved with words from a poem Parker wrote in 1925: “Leave for her a red young rose; Go your way, and save your pity; She is happy, for she knows that her dust is very pretty.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed legislation Monday that would slightly rework the state panel that recommends whether charter schools can open or should be shuttered. Currently, two of the 11 voting members of the Charter Schools Advisory Board are chosen by the State Board of Education. The governor picks nearly all voting positions on the State Board of Education. The bill would have given the education board just one spot to fill, while the superintendent of public instruction or her designate would receive another voting position. Currently the superintendent or her designate is a nonvoting member to the advisory board, which also recommends rules on how charter schools should operate or be monitored. “The State Board of Education is constitutionally and statutorily charged with administering children’s education in state public schools, including charter schools,” Cooper wrote in his veto message. “It is critical that the board have both of their appointments to the (charter schools) board to carry out its constitutional duties.” Both the House and Senate approved the bill by what would be veto-proof majorities, so an override is possible. But Cooper, a Democrat, has been known to consolidate his support before override attempts by Republican legislative leaders.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State wildlife managers are encouraging hunters to take advantage of electronic map tools that can help them identify private land before they venture onto it. Map resources, mobile apps and printable maps can be found on the Game and Fish Department’s website, at gf.nd.gov. “Each have different strengths, such as some require cell service, while others can work offline; others offer the ability to determine who posted the land or a point of contact,” said Brian Hosek, business operations manager. “And you can still pull down that print material for those who do not prefer to use these technologies.” The Legislature passed a law this year making electronic posting equal to physical posting and penalties, as well as defining a fence. It also allows only lawful hunters and anglers to access fenced, unposted land, for hunting and fishing activities only, the Bismarck Tribune reports. About 7,000 landowners have posted 3.75 million acres – about 8.3% of North Dakota’s land area. Penalties for violating the new law include a $250 noncriminal offense for hunters, anglers and others trespassing on posted land, along with misdemeanors for more serious trespassing scenarios, such as property damage or refusing to leave.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A piece of metal that flew off the world’s second-tallest roller coaster and hit a woman in the head while she stood in line came from the back of the ride’s train and was about the size of a fist, an amusement ride safety official said Monday. It’s not known yet what caused the accident a week ago on the 420-foot-tall Top Thrill Dragster roller coaster at Cedar Point, said David Miran, head of Ohio’s amusement ride safety division. Authorities and amusement park officials have not released the condition of the victim, who is a 44-year-old woman from Swartz Creek, Michigan, according to an accident report released by the state. She could be heard screaming on body camera footage released by police. She was treated at a hospital near the park in Sandusky before being moved to a hospital in Toledo. The metal L-shaped bracket that hit the woman Aug. 15 was attached to the back of the train and hovers above the track, Miran said. It’s part of the sensor system that tells the coaster’s computer where the train is on the track, he said. The coaster train was nearing the end of the ride where it slows down when the metal plate broke, park officials said. It’s not clear how far the piece flew before hitting the woman, Miran said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State Attorney General John O’Connor has filed more petitions with the U.S. Supreme Court asking justices to overturn last year’s ruling that the Muscogee (Creek) Nation’s reservation still exists. One petition was filed in the case of former Tulsa police Officer Shannon Kepler, whose state manslaughter conviction was reversed because he is a member of the Muscogee Nation, and the crime occurred on the tribe’s reservation. Other petitions challenge reversals of convictions of first-degree murder and child abuse. “As a result of the McGirt decision, many convictions were vacated, and some were dismissed,” a spokesman for O’Connor said. “We are appealing these cases to try to reinstate these convictions and re-apprehend these criminals.” The state now has at least five petitions pending before the U.S. Supreme Court seeking reversal of the McGirt decision, which has reshaped criminal jurisdiction in most of eastern Oklahoma. In all five cases at issue in the petitions, U.S. attorneys offices in Oklahoma have filed federal charges. In Kepler’s case, federal prosecutors in Tulsa have already tried and obtained convictions. In the case of convicted murderer Jordan Batice Mitchell, federal prosecutors in Tulsa secured a plea deal for second-degree murder in Indian Country.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Two new laws aimed at expanding voter access are under fire from a conservative group that argues the changes will make state elections less secure. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports people affiliated with the group Oregonians for Fair Elections have filed referendum petitions that, if successful, would ask voters to approve or reject the new laws next year. To do that, they’d need to collect 74,680 valid signatures in opposition to each bill by Sept. 24, a tight timeline that could be hard to meet as the state struggles with a resurgence of COVID-19. The first, House Bill 2681, ensured that voters cannot be labeled “inactive” – and so ineligible to automatically receive a ballot – for the sole reason of not voting. It’s an extension of other steps Oregon has taken in recent years. The second bill targeted for reversal, House Bill 3291, implemented a change, already in practice in other vote-by-mail states, that will allow mailed ballots to be counted if they are postmarked by Election Day and reach officials within a week of the election. Ballots in Oregon have traditionally only been accepted if they are received by 8 p.m. on Election Day.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Inmates in state prisons will be counted in their home districts and not where their prisons are located after a divided vote Tuesday by the five-member panel redrawing legislative district maps this year. The Pennsylvania Legislative Reapportionment Commission voted 3-2 for the policy change that was introduced by House Minority Leader Joanna McClinton, D-Philadelphia. “We cannot wait another 10 years. The time to correct this injustice is now,” she said. The vote changes the long-standing policy of counting inmates toward state House and Senate districts where their state prisons are located. The House and Senate Republican leaders voted against the change, while McClinton was joined by the Senate Democratic floor leader and by the commission’s chair, former University of Pittsburgh Chancellor Mark Nordenberg. Appointed by the Democratic-majority state Supreme Court as the commission’s swing vote, Nordenberg said that for months he “did not think I would be where I am today” but had kept an open mind. “When a system holds and counts a person in one place but forces him or her to vote in another, it does create a basic issue of fairness,” he said. But counting inmates in their prison’s legislative districts “distorts the reapportionment process.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s largest health care organization announced Tuesday that it is amending its visitor policy at hospitals and ambulatory care centers in response to an increase in new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Lifespan is now limiting the number of visitors per patient, along with the number of family members or escorts during an emergency intake. Patients in most settings will be allowed a single visitor at a time, up to a limit of two throughout the duration of their stay. Some visitor policies remain unchanged, including exceptions for end-of-life care patients, with two visitors for pediatric patients. Masks are required. Lifespan said it “understands this is difficult for patients and their loved ones, but such measures are necessary to help protect their health and safety as well as that of our health care workers and the general public during the ongoing pandemic.” Lifespan operates Rhode Island, Hasbro Children’s, Miriam, Bradley and Newport hospitals.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A noncommissioned Army officer depicted in a viral video accosting and shoving a man has been convicted of third-degree assault. A magistrate judge found Fort Jackson Army Sgt. Jonathan Pentland guilty of the misdemeanor Monday after a two-day trial, news outlets report. He will have to choose between 30 days in jail or a fine of $1,087. Pentland was suspended from his post prior to the trial. Pentland, 42, is white, and the man shoved is Black. The video of part of their confrontation became a racial flashpoint when it was posted to Facebook in April after Pentland screamed: “You’re in the wrong neighborhood.” But race was never mentioned during Pentland’s trial in Columbia. Pentland testified that he was trying to protect his family from a man acting strangely. The man he shoved, 22-year-old Deandre Williams, said he was trying to avoid a confrontation. “As a young man, if I go on a walk, I shouldn’t feel any form of pressure,” Williams said after the verdict. Prosecutor Paul Walton said Pentland broke the law three times: when he shoved Williams before the video started, again as Williams took an awkward step toward Pentland’s wife, and then when he slapped Williams’ phone out of his hand. “His pride is hurt,” Walton said of Pentland. “He’s a drill sergeant, and he’s used to people doing what he says.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Even as coronavirus numbers climb, lawmakers have tried to pressure Gov. Kristi Noem to call a special session to pass a ban on employers requiring COVID-19 vaccinations. Several Republicans in the state House of Representatives have circulated drafts of bills that would stop employers from mandating vaccinations, stepping up pressure on Noem to call a special session for them to approve the bills. But she has resisted those calls, saying there is not widespread support for a special session. The issue has Noem, who has carved out a nationwide following for her hands-off approach to the virus, being pushed from the right to intervene on the state’s largest employer, Sanford Health. House Speaker Spencer Gosch said late Friday that he wanted the governor to call a special session as he released a draft of a bill that would make COVID-19 vaccination status “strictly confidential medical information” that would be off-limits to employers. The state’s largest employer, Sanford Health, plans to require all employees to get a shot by Nov. 1. Noem’s spokesman Ian Fury cast Noem’s resistance to the idea as keeping with her conservative approach to the pandemic and argued that government should not be dictating whether employers require vaccinations for their workers.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state surpassed 1million coronavirus infections Tuesday as COVID-19 conquers the state again, filling hospitals and spreading rapidly among the unvaccinated and school-age children. The Tennessee Department of Health is currently reporting nearly 6,400 new infections per day. Dr. William Schaffner, an expert on infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, said he never initially expected Tennessee to reach 1 million infections. But coronavirus has proven a “nasty, resistant virus,” and he underestimated how resistant politicians, community leaders and the general public would be to necessary efforts to slow and stop the virus. “It was a sobering realization that we have had so many people infected and, as a consequence, so many people having to suffer hospitalization, severe disease and loss of life,” Schaffner said. “Much of that could have been prevented.” Almost all of Tennessee’s recent infections are among those who have chosen to remain unvaccinated or are too young to be eligible. Ninety percent of all new infections in May, June and July were among unvaccinated populations, according to a recent virus report from the Tennessee Department of Health. Only 41% of residents are fully inoculated – the ninth-lowest rate of all U.S. states, federal data shows.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Republican legislators brought back their voting bill Monday with no changes as some Democrats returned to the state Capitol for the first time since ending their holdout, making it clear that the bill is on track to become law after their 38-day walkout. Dozens of people showed up to testify before lawmakers to seize their last chance for public input on the bill that would tighten voting rules in ways the GOP says will ensure election integrity and that Democrats say amounts to voter suppression for disabled people and minorities. Senate Bill 1 would make mail voting a stricter process, increase liberties for poll watchers, and prohibit 24-hour and drive-thru voting, two ways Harris County – which includes Houston and where 44% of the nearly 5 million residents are Latino and 20% are Black – expanded options for voters and also offered protections against the coronavirus. Candis Houston, who lives in Houston, said she arrived in Austin on Sunday night so she could show up early Monday to testify. She joined about 70 other people who arrived at the Capitol as the sun was rising. “I had ancestors that died and marched for the privilege for us to vote, and anytime I can participate, I am going to be there,” said Houston, who is Black. “We should be encouraging people to vote and not limiting them.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Researchers are planning to use ground-penetrating radar at the site of a former Indigenous boarding school in southern Utah where tribal leaders say there may be unmarked graves. Tribal leaders and historians say there may be at least a dozen Paiute children buried in unmarked graves on school grounds near Panguitch, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Corrina Bow, chairwoman for the Paiute Indian Tribe of Utah, said boarding school officials would take children as young as 6 and force them to work at a farm on the property. “We were informed that there were bodies buried over there,” Bow said. “But we are not sure until someone comes in and verifies it.” Utah State University, which leases the site from the state, plans to survey and map the grounds before conducting radar scanning. The school’s anthropology department also said it would be willing to excavate the site if the tribe wanted. The recent discovery of children’s remains buried at the site of what was once Canada’s largest Indigenous residential school has magnified interest in the troubling legacy in both Canada and the United States. In June, U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland announced that the United States will investigate its past oversight of Native American boarding schools.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state’s high vaccination rate against COVID-19 gives it great latitude in coping with the surge in coronavirus cases caused by the delta variant, Gov. Phil Scott said Tuesday. Scott said he felt people should wear masks in crowded indoor settings among unfamiliar people, but he is not going to issue a formal recommendation or reimpose the state of emergency that would him authorize him to order mask usage. “We are asking Vermonters to use common sense, to be vigilant, to get your vaccinations and continue to use your head and assess your own situation and do the right thing,” Scott said. The rate of growth in new cases of COVID-19 has been slowing, and state experts predict they could begin falling again within the next few weeks. If things change, Scott said, he would be willing to change as well. “Am I concerned about what I am seeing? Of course I am,” Scott said during his weekly virus briefing. “We are ready to pivot, we are ready to do whatever is necessary to keep Vermonters safe when we have to.” But he said he didn’t believe additional recommendations are needed at this time.\n\nVirginia\n\nKing George: Dozens of headstones from a historic African American cemetery in the nation’s capital that were used as erosion control along the Virginia shoreline of the Potomac River are being relocated to a memorial garden in Maryland. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam and Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser attended a ceremony in Caledon State Park in King George on Monday to mark the transfer of the first 55 headstones from Virginia to Maryland, officials said. The grave markers will be part of a memorial garden at National Harmony Memorial Park in Prince George’s County honoring the 37,000 people buried at the original cemetery. The Columbian Harmony Cemetery was established in 1859 and was the most prominent burial site for African Americans in Washington, but it was moved in the 1960s to make room for development. Remains were moved to a memorial garden in Maryland, but the gravestones were sold or given away, officials said. Prominent people buried at the original cemetery include Elizabeth Keckly, a former slave who became a seamstress and trusted confidante of first lady Mary Todd Lincoln; Osborne Perry Anderson, the only African American survivor of John Brown’s raid on Harpers Ferry; Mary Ann Shadd Cary, America’s first African American female newspaper editor; and Philip Reid, a foundry worker who helped build of the Statue of Freedom at the U.S. Capitol, officials said.\n\nWashington\n\nKennewick: Staff at a jail in south-central Washington have come up with an inexpensive but effective way to encourage inmates to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Since the first of the month, the Benton County Jail has been giving away one of its most popular commissary items – ramen noodles – to inmates who sign up for their first COVID-19 shot, the Olympian reports. By Monday, the jail had given out 900 packets of noodle soup to 90 inmates, said Scott Souza, chief of corrections for the Benton County Corrections Department. It’s advertised to inmates around the jail with fliers featuring a larger-than-life photo of the seasoned, wavy noodles and a headline that says: “SOUPS FOR SHOTS.” “To encourage and support COVID vaccination efforts, the Benton County Department of Corrections will be providing each inmate that starts their vaccination series with 10 FREE RAMEN NOODLE SOUPS!!!” say posters around the jail in Kennewick. “We’re doing everything we can do to incentivize vaccination, and we are getting outstanding response,” Souza said. Any inmate, no matter how long their stay, is eligible for the program if they have not yet been immunized. The Benton County jail has shared information about the program with other jails in the state, Souza said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nLewisburg: Gov. Jim Justice won’t be moonlighting as the coach of a boys high school basketball team where he already is the girls coach. The Greenbrier County Board of Education on Monday rejected a motion to hire Justice as the boys coach at Greenbrier East High School. News outlets report the board voted 3-2 to toss a recommendation from county schools Superintendent Jeff Bryant to hire Justice. The Republican governor said during one of his regularly scheduled news conferences on the coronavirus pandemic that the board’s vote “came down with just that ugliness of personal preference or political preference. ... Frankly, the board of education in Greenbrier County made a decision that will ultimately hurt not me but the kids.” The board is looking to replace former NBA player Bimbo Coles, who resigned in July. Much of the debate involved whether Justice could give enough attention to both the boys and girls teams while also being governor, along with paying attention to his family’s businesses. Board member Rick Parker, who voted against Justice’s hiring, had said he planned to base his vote on those concerns. Justice’s second term as governor runs through 2024. Justice served as the boys coach from 2010 to 2017, his first year as governor. He has coached the girls team since 2000, winning a state championship in 2012.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: University of Wisconsin System President Tommy Thompson pushed back Tuesday against Republican lawmakers who claim campuses need their permission to implement COVID-19 policies. Thompson insisted university leaders don’t need legislative approval to manage the schools – a major break from his party’s stance against pandemic protocols. A key Republican lawmaker promised to pursue a lawsuit. But Thompson, a former GOP governor who served as health secretary under President George W. Bush, said he would not cede control of the system to fellow Republicans who run the Legislature. “I’m not going to be intimidated,” he told reporters during a briefing. “Even though I don’t want to pick a fight with the Legislature, I’m going to stand my ground. I’ve kept politics out of (running UW), and everyone agrees with that. I’m still a strong Republican. I just put my Republican bonafides aside when I run the university. I’ve got the right and the authority and the responsibility to do what’s necessary to keep the universities open.” Thompson has called for UW campuses to hold at least 75% of their classes in person this fall. The schools have implemented a range of protocols in recent weeks to meet that goal, including mask and coronavirus testing mandates. The system hasn’t required vaccinations. Thompson instead has created incentives for shots such as tuition remission. He said Tuesday, though, that he may have to “do an audible at the line” if infections keep climbing.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: A judge who writes thrillers in his free time is putting out his third novel this fall after receiving a strong reception for the first two. The last nine months have moved quickly for Paul Phillips, the Gillette News Record reports. A Circuit Court judge by day, he has a lot on his docket from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. But he’s also been writing a series of thrillers under the pen name James Chandler. His first book, “Misjudged,” was published Nov. 10. He spent about four years working on it before he got it published. His second novel, “One and Done,” came out in February. And the just-finished “False Evidence” is scheduled to be released Oct. 12. All three books center on Sam Johnstone, a veteran who takes a job at a law firm in a small Wyoming town hoping for a fresh start. The audiobook version of his first novel was just released last week, read by James Anderson Foster, an award-winning narrator. He said he’s been “pleasantly surprised” by the reception his books have received. Combined, his first two books have more than 8,600 reviews on Amazon. The first book has more than 5,500 reviews and an average rating of 4.3 out of 5 stars, while the second book has about 3,200 reviews and a 4.4 rating.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/25"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/02/28/pachyderm-vacation-rental-cookie-monster-overdoses-stolen-baby-jesus-statue-found-news-around-states/111376276/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:Two legislative committees approved a bill Wednesday that would ban gender therapies for minors such as prescription hormones or gender reassignment surgery. Rep. Wes Allen of Troy and Sen. Shay Shelnutt of Trussville are the sponsors of the Vulnerable Child Compassion and Protection Act. Allen said last week that children who struggle with their gender identity should receive mental health counseling and not medications or surgeries that cause physical changes. The Alabama House Health Committee approved Allen’s bill Wednesday morning, news outlets reported. Later, the Senate Health Committee approved Shelnutt’s bill in a 10-1 vote. Both bills will move on to the full House and Senate for consideration, respectively. Under the legislation, doctors would be charged with a felony for prescribing puberty-blockers or hormones to anyone under age 19. Surgeries on minors would also be prohibited. The bill also states teachers, principals and school counselors would be charged with a misdemeanor if they don’t tell parents their child identifies as transgender. This is the second bill in Alabama targeting transgender issues. Rep. Chris Pringle, R-Mobile, is sponsoring a bill that would prohibit public schools from allowing transgender students to participate on sports team that do not match the gender on their birth certificates.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state approved a regulation change establishing a personal-use salmon dipnet fishery on a portion of the Susitna River. The Alaska Board of Fisheries voted last week to create the fishery that will be available from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Wednesdays and Saturdays between July 10 and July 31, The Anchorage Daily News reported. The Susitna system empties into Cook Inlet and is home to all five species of Pacific salmon. Dipnetters will be able to harvest up to 25 salmon in the new fishery in Southcentral Alaska, though chinook salmon will be off limits. Several groups backed the new fishery, including the Matanuska Valley Fish and Game Advisory Committee and the South Central Alaska Dipnetters Association, which both submitted proposals to the board. Personal-use fisheries are only open to Alaska residents and allow permit holders to harvest up to 25 salmon per head of household each year, with an additional 10 salmon for each additional family member. Personal-use salmon fisheries exist in Cook Inlet on the Kenai River, Kasilof River on the Kenai Peninsula and Fish Creek. There is also a personal-use fishery at the Copper River, which empties into Prince William Sound southeast of Anchorage. The proposal submitted by the Matanuska Valley committee said the new fishery would give area residents an opportunity to harvest salmon closer to home.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Early risers in several Western states reported seeing what appeared to be a meteor streaking across the sky before dawn. The American Meteor Society received multiple reports from Arizona, California, New Mexico and Utah about the fireball. “This does appear to be a bright meteor as observations are spread out from Southern California, southern Utah, and Arizona,” observer Robert Lunsford with the American Meteor Society told KNXV-TV. The phenomenon was captured on video by meteorite hunter Robert Ward in Prescott, Arizona, and posted on the organization’s website. It was also captured by a video camera mounted on Phoenix City Hall. “This is the best time of the month to view meteor activity as the moon will not be a factor at all,” the American Meteor Society said in their Meteor Activity Outlook for the week, noting the moon’s current phase.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State regulators have dismissed one violation and sustained two others against a medical marijuana dispensary in Hot Springs. The Arkansas Alcoholic Beverage Control Board voted Wednesday to sustain two violations against Green Springs Medical dispensary. The Hot Springs dispensary is the state’s most successful since opening May 1, selling more than 1400 pounds of medical marijuana as of Feb. 14, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. The next closest dispensary, the Releaf Center in Bentonville, sold just more than 670 pounds in the same time period. Green Springs Medical had been charged with a series of rule violations, including inadequate labeling and improper signs. The board also decided Wednesday to reduce the facility’s fine from $7,025 to $1,000, noting that the dispensary’s owner has been cooperative with investigators and put in an effort to comply with regulations.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco:A winter with little precipitation has left most of California abnormally dry and officials are bracing for the possibility of an early and more intense wildfire season amid record-breaking temperatures. Drought has expanded to nearly a quarter of the state, mainly in central California, the heart of the state’s agricultural sector, according to a U.S. Drought Monitor map mad public Thursday. The map shows 70% of the state is abnormally dry. February is shaping up to be driest on record for much of the state, with chances of light showers on the horizon on March 1 and then not again until March 10. Sierra Littlefield, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Sacramento, said there is a strong chance the state’s capital will see a completely dry February – something that has never happened. Downtown San Francisco is on its way to its first rain-free February since 1864, said meteorologist Anna Schneider. The dry beginning of the year comes after a wet 2019 that capped mountains with snow, delivering water to reservoirs and helping to boost lush vegetation that can quickly turn into fuel for wildfires during dry, windy conditions. About 75% of California’s annual precipitation typically occurs from December through February, mostly from atmospheric rivers – long plumes of moisture originating far out in the Pacific Ocean. State officials were scheduled Thursday to conduct a survey of the Sierra Nevada snowpack, which supplies about 30% of California’s water. The first reading of the winter there, on Jan. 2, found a snowpack that was 97% of the January average. But that had changed by the end of a largely dry January when the amount of water in the snowpack dropped to 72% of the Jan. 30 average, state water officials said.\n\nColorado\n\nVail: An avalanche took the lives of two people who had turned back to avoid a dangerous area, a report said. The Feb. 15 avalanche north of Vail killed Dillon Block and Cesar Almanza Hernandez, The Vail Daily reported Tuesday. Block, Hernandez and a companion who was not identified were riding in the back country on low-angle slopes and in meadows and were avoiding steeper slopes, the Colorado Avalanche Information Center report said. They were operating snowbikes, which are off-road motorcycles modified for use in the snow. After riding into a creek bottom in the afternoon, the riders entered an open area and turned around to head back. An avalanche started and the third rider was able to ride into nearby trees, but Hernandez and Block were buried in the slide, the report said. Volunteers worked to free Block and Hernandez until responders with Vail Mountain Rescue Group arrived at the scene around 9 p.m. “Given the time elapsed, darkness, increasing snowfall, and no easy way to evaluate the avalanche danger above the site, the group left and returned to the Red Sandstone trailhead,” the report said. A Vail Mountain Rescue Group team returned the next morning to recover the bodies.\n\nConnecticut\n\nStamford: A man who got into a fight while leaving his son’s hockey game last month has asked for leniency. Matthey Zolin, 51, made a brief appearance before a judge at a Stamford courthouse where his attorney applied to a diversionary program for first-time offenders that will result in his charges being expunged, the Greenwich Time reported Wednesday. The Greenwich resident was arrested on Jan. 31, along with another father, after the two began fighting while exiting a game where their sons played against each other. Both men were charged with misdemeanor third-degree assault and interfering with police. Officials said the altercation became physical after one of the two said something denigrating about the abilities of the other’s son. Prosecutors have made no objection to Zolin’s application to enter the diversionary program. If he is granted acceptance and successfully completes the program, the charges against him will be expunged and his criminal record will remain clean.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover:Two more wells near a military base have elevated levels of chemical contaminants, according to state environmental officials. Delaware’s environmental protection department was recently notified by officials at Dover Air Force Base that the wells near the base might have levels of perfluorooctane sulfonate, or PFOS, and perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, above federal advisory levels of 70 parts per trillion. The notifications come after high levels of PFOS and PFOA were found in four other wells near the base last summer. One of those wells had a PFOS level of 168,000 parts per trillion and a PFOA level of 2,460 parts per trillion, according to a document provided to The Associated Press. The Air Force is continuing to provide alternative water supply to those properties. The owners of the more recently tested wells, which provide water to a single commercial business, also are being provided bottled water. Officials said Tuesday that samples taken at 10 other wells indicated PFOS and PFOA levels below the EPA’s health advisory level. PFOA and PFOS are among a class of man-made compounds known as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. The compounds have been used in a variety of consumer and industrial products, including nonstick cookware, stain- and water-resistant fabrics, food packaging and, notably, firefighting foam that has been used at military bases across the country.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:A landlord facing ongoing lawsuits with the district’s attorney general has been arrested for failing to pay for repairs, according to court documents. The documents said Mehrdad Valibeigi with the Bennington Corporation has been charged with contempt of court and is being held in the D.C. jail after Valibeigi failed to make a payment required by the judge’s order. A spokesperson for Attorney General Karl Racine said his office first filed a complaint against Valibeigi in October 2018 for allegedly collecting rent, but failing to maintain his apartment buildings and make necessary repairs. The AG requested a Receiver for the 35 units that comprise the Bennington Apartments, located at 4480 C Street, 4459 Benning Road SE and 4569 Benning Road SE in Ward 7. Court documents showed Racine also asked for restitution for those tenants, as well as penalties for the owner. Tenants quoted in the initial complaint said nails were coming out of their ceilings, roaches had consistently been a problem for decades and mice found their way into apartments through multiple holes in the walls and sinks. Documents state Valibeigi was supposed to deposit $25,000 into an account for the Receiver to fund repairs by November. He paid $5,000, but still has not paid the rest, according to the documents. The judge said in the most recent January hearing that if Valibeigi did not fulfill the court’s order to pay the remaining $20,000 by Feb. 24, he would be arrested. Racine’s office said Valibeigi failed to comply and was taken into custody on Monday, where documents stated he will be held until he has paid the outstanding amount. Court documents showed that a status hearing is scheduled for Feb. 28.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: The government of the United Arab Emirates has granted a $3.5 million gift to help kick off a major coral reef restoration program in the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary. The grant, announced Wednesday by officials of United Way of Collier and the Keys, is the first funding commitment of the $100 million Mission: Iconic Reefs program announced last December by The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and its Keys sanctuary. The program, to be funded by public and private resources, calls for restoring seven iconic coral reef sites off the Keys consisting of nearly 3 million square feet of the Florida Reef Tract, about the size of 52 football fields. The effort is likely to take two decades and is to be accomplished in two phases, Sanctuary officials said. Since the 1970s, tropical cyclones, heat-induced coral bleaching, cold snaps and disease events have reduced coral coverage in the Keys. Over the past 15 years, pioneering restoration efforts involving growing and transplanting corals have proved successful in the Keys, setting the stage for the large-scale restoration effort. Running from Key Largo to Key West, the Sanctuary includes Carysfort Reef, Horseshoe Reef, Cheeca Rocks, Sombrero Reef, Newfound Harbor, Looe Key Reef and Eastern Dry Rocks. The $3.5 million coral restoration gift is part of a $10 million pledge from the UAE to communities in Florida for recovery activities following Hurricane Irma. The United Way helped to secure the UAE financial gift for the Keys coral reef project.\n\nGeorgia\n\nJuliette: Officials in a Monroe County said they will pay to test water wells for coal ash contamination. County Manager Jim Hedges told WGXA-TV that the county will pay $10,000 to test about 55 private wells across the county. The tests come after environmental group Altamaha Riverkeeper tested wells of residents around Juliette and found chemicals they said indicate contamination from the coal ash pond at Georgia Power Co.’s Plant Scherer. Georgia Power, a unit of Atlanta-based Southern Co., said its own testing of wells around the coal-fired power plant showed no contamination above federal or state limits. The company plans to extract water from the coal ash, cap the pond in place and monitor it for future contamination. Juliette residents came to the state Capitol Monday to lobby for a bill that would require Georgia Power to dig up the coal ash and bury it in a lined landfill. Hedges said the results should come back within 7 to 10 days. Residents are also lobbying to be connected to a water system, but county officials said that could cost $20 million and take two years to complete. Beyond the county testing, Duke University Professor Avner Vengosh, who studies coal ash contamination, is scheduled to visit Monroe County to study 10 to 12 private wells within 2 miles of Plant Scherer. The county will pay travel costs for Vengosh and a student.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. military authorized the transport of World War II aircraft on government ships and planes for use in the 75th anniversary commemoration of the end of the war, officials said. Up to 24 privately owned aircraft will be transported to Oahu for the events between Aug. 29 and Sept. 2, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Tuesday. The transport of the vintage planes will be conducted by Air Force cargo planes or ships including an aircraft carrier or other flattop vessel, officials said. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a Jan. 27 memo that he wants a coordinated effort for a “lift of opportunity” to bring the planes to the commemoration. “As we approach the 75th anniversary of V-J Day (Victory over Japan) on Sept. 2, 2020, I am encouraging all services to seek opportunities to honor this important milestone,” Esper said. Elissa Lines, executive director of the Pearl Harbor Aviation Museum, said 19 aircraft owners have applied to participate. The aircraft include a B-25 Mitchell bomber, A-26 Invader, SBD Dauntless dive bomber, P-40 Warhawk, TBF Avenger torpedo bomber, P-51 Mustang, F4F Wildcat, C-47 transport, PBY Catalina, F-8 Bearcat, and T-6 Texan, she said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Roughly a month after one of Idaho’s newest Fish and Game commissioners had to step down because of his political affiliation, a panel of lawmakers has approved a bill to remove the commission’s bipartisan membership requirements. The commissioners set hunting and fishing regulations, seasons and other wildlife policy. They’re appointed by the governor, and Republicans have held a majority on the commission for years. The remaining spots sometimes go to commissioners who are unaffiliated, rather than Democrats. The bill, which would end the current rule that no more than four members of the seven-member commission be from the same political party, was approved by the House Resources and Conservation Committee on Tuesday, The Times-News reported. Idaho Wildlife Federation executive director Brian Brooks opposed the bill, noting the commission was created by the state’s first voter initiative in 1938, which specifically called for a bipartisan approach to prevent undue political influence on resource issues. He said politicization is one of the biggest concerns for Idaho hunters. It passed 14-4, and now heads to the full House. Former commissioner Bradley Melton was appointed in September but stepped down in January after it was revealed that he had changed his political affiliation from Republican to unaffiliated shortly before he applied for the post. At the time, Gov. Brad Little thanked Melton for his candor and service, and said the next appointment would be made “in accordance with the spirit of the law.” Rep. Paul Shepherd, a Republican from Riggins – the same region that Melton represented on the commission – said Tuesday that the best candidates for the job shouldn’t be disqualified because of their party affiliation. Rep. Fred Wood, who previously served on the commission, said appointments are made based on experience with and views on the environment, and party affiliation doesn’t factor in.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A program that honors women veterans and their service wants to send those in Illinois to Washington, where they will tour war monuments for a day and be celebrated for their service upon their return home. Operation HerStory is seeking 100 women that served during World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and periods in between 1940 to 1975 to participate in the Honor Flight. The program has partnered with organizations, including Honor Flight Chicago, which is a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing veterans with honor and closure. It will be the first all female Honor Flight in the state, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. The trip was announced at the Pritzker Military Museum and Library on Tuesday. John Ptak, president of Honor Flight Chicago, said that although the nonprofit has brought more than 8,700 veterans to Washington, fewer than 200 of the participants have been women. Almost 40 have signed up already, said Ginny Narsete, the founder of Operation HerStory and a retired master sergeant in the Air Force. The flight departs the morning of Oct. 7, returning later that day. The women will tour the Women In Military Service for America Memorial and the Vietnam Women’s Memorial. Narsete said she doesn’t know what’s next for the program after the trip, but she hopes it will help the veterans to accept the honor and recognition they deserve.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:The City-County Council forged ahead with its new tenant rights initiative on Monday night despite recent legislative effort at the Statehouse to undercut the effort, which seeks to protect residents from retaliatory landlords and educate tenants about rental rights. The first part of the proposal, which passed with an 18-5 vote, appropriates $250,000 to establish a tenant information hotline and provide legal assistance for renters in need. The council’s five Republicans voted against it. The second proposal strengthened protections for renters, requiring landlords to notify tenants of their rights and responsibilities and fining landlords who retaliate against tenants. That proposal passed 19-4, with Republican Michael Paul-Hart crossing party lines to vote in support. But the initiative might be partially moot if the state legislature approves new language added to a bill earlier on Monday, drawing scorn from Mayor Joe Hogsett’s office and Democratic councilors. The amendment to Senate Bill 340 prevents cities from regulating landlord-tenant relations without approval by the General Assembly. It would nullify the requirement to notify tenants of their rights and would also eliminate the fines for retaliation. The move came after concern from the Indiana Apartment Association and other groups, once again highlighting the contrast between a heavily Democratic state capital in a largely Republican state. Yet the public voiced strong support for the council’s efforts on Monday night to combat an issue they highlighted as a crisis.\n\nIowa\n\nSioux City:A mother has complained to the local school board after she said her sixth-grade daughter suffered a broken arm and elbow at the hands of two classmates carrying out a viral online prank. The woman said Monday night during a school board meeting that her daughter had been injured on Feb. 7, when two West Middle School classmates cajoled her into a jumping contest, then kicked the girl’s feet out from under her midjump, causing her to fall on her shoulder, the Sioux City Journal reported. Called the “skull breaker challenge,” the prank was made popular on the social media platform TikTok and has led to reports of children across the country suffering serious head and other injuries. The woman complained that a physical education teacher who was in charge was distracted by his cellphone when the incident happened and that school officials didn’t report the incident to the girl’s parents or seek immediate medical care. “She has no motion in her fingers, no motion in her wrist,” the mother said. “She may never play volleyball again.” School board members did not respond to the complaint during the meeting. Sioux City Community Schools Superintendent Paul Gausman did not immediately return a message left Wednesday seeking comment.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A mother is suing a suburban Kansas City school after a teacher was caught on surveillance video last year kicking her daughter, who was in kindergarten. The woman filed the lawsuit last month against the Shawnee Mission School District and the case was moved to federal court this week, the Kansas City Star reported. She contended that the district was negligent in its hiring, training and supervision of the first-year teacher, Crystal Smith, who was fired after the abuse came to light. The mother, who is identified only by her initials in the lawsuit, said her daughter got upset last February because she found some of her artwork crumpled on the floor at the Bluejacket-Flint Elementary School in Shawnee, and that her daughter approached the school librarian to show her the damage. When her daughter crawled into a bookshelf, Smith “yanked her out” and pinned her arms behind her back, causing her pain. Smith then asked the librarian to contact the principal for help, and when the librarian’s back was turned, Smith kicked the girl while she was lying on the floor, according to the suit. The mother said she learned about what happened when she picked up her daughter after school, and that she then confronted the teacher, who told her the girl wasn’t being truthful. She said she then spoke with the principal and requested that school surveillance video be reviewed. She says she received a letter from the principal nearly a week after the incident that said the teacher had admitted grabbing and kicking the girl. The girl’s mother says that if her daughter hadn’t told her what happened, it might never have come to light and her daughter could have suffered “more abuse at the hands” of the teacher. Her lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount in damages. A district spokesman said the school system doesn’t comment on pending litigation.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The Kentucky House voted Wednesday to create a tax on vaping products and increase taxes on snuff and chewing tobacco. The bill passed the House on a 75-17 vote and now goes to the Senate, media outlets reported. It’s estimated to raise $50 million of new tax revenue over the next two fiscal years. It aims to reduce vaping and smokeless tobacco use in a state with one of the nation’s highest cancer rates. The bill would add vaping products to the list of smokable tobacco products such as cigars that are subject to a wholesale tax, with that rate increasing under the measure. The legislation also doubles the per-unit tax on nonsmokable and chewable tobacco products, but does not affect the tax rate on packs of cigarettes. An organization representing 400 vape shop owners recently told legislators the bill would hurt their small businesses and discourage adults from vaping as a way to quit smoking cigarettes. The bill’s supporters, including organizations like the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky, said the price increase on e-cigarettes will help curb the increased use of highly addictive vaping products by youth in the state.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge:Ronnie Anderson, the longest serving Farm Bureau state president in America, will retire this summer after 31 years of leading the largest agriculture network in Louisiana. Anderson won an astounding 31 straight elections before deciding he won’t seek reelection during the annual Louisiana Farm Bureau Convention in June. “It’s the right time for me,” Anderson said. The Louisiana Farm Bureau has been a powerful political force under Anderson, which elevated its influence in agriculture advocacy. Anderson has also served on the LSU Board of Supervisors in all but two years since former Gov. Mike Foster appointed him in 1997, hiring presidents and football coaches. He has engaged with governors, members of Congress and American presidents in his role as state president and as a member of the American Farm Bureau board in shaping agriculture policy. Anderson’s former first assistant, Jim Monroe, said Anderson has been able to maintain the confidence and support of Farm Bureau members for so long because of his ability to connect with them in a way the members trust. Monroe retired last year after serving 30 years as assistant to the president, the highest-ranking full-time staff position within the Farm Bureau Federation. The president serves as a full-time volunteer. Monroe was succeeded by Kyle McCann. The Louisiana Farm Bureau has grown from about 67,000 members in 1989 to more than 148,000 under Anderson’s watch. Anderson, 71, grew up on a dairy farm in East Feliciana Parish and returned to join the family business after graduating from LSU.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The rate of newborns in Maine who experience health problems because they’re exposed to opioids in the womb is nearly five times the national average, according to a report released by the state health department. Maine’s incidence of the health problems was a little more than 33 per 1,000 live births in 2018, according to the report, provided to the Maine Legislature by the Maine Department of Health and Human Services. The national rate was seven per 1,000 live births. The finding was one of many in the annual report from the Maine Maternal, Fetal and Infant Mortality Review Panel that spoke to health challenges for mothers and babies in the state. According to the report, the percentage of women who smoked during pregnancy in Maine was nearly 12%, almost twice the national average of 6.5%. Slightly more children were also born to women with diabetes, and the percent of births to women who were overweight or obese was also about 5 percentage points higher than the national average, the report stated. The high rate of babies exposed to opioids before birth is a function of the state’s crisis, Stephen Meister, president of the Maine chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said Wednesday. The rates of smoking and obesity reflect longstanding challenges in Maine, he said.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:A statue of an infant Jesus stolen from St. Paul’s by-the-Sea Episcopal Church is again in the church’s possession after it was missing for nearly a year. “We were very grateful,” said Father Matthew D’Amario, who noted the statue was returned in mid-January “surprisingly undamaged.” D’Amario said the statue, part of the church’s Nativity scene, had been stolen once before ahead of his tenure at the church. That time, it was inexplicably recovered from the ocean near the Inlet. In the latest incident, church staff reported the statue missing on Jan. 4, 2019. Video footage showed it was stolen on Dec. 31, 2018, according to police. Police later identified 43-year-old Cameron Coke of Towson, Maryland, as a suspect. Coke’s trial, on fourth-degree burglary and theft, was set for Jan. 8 but was postponed. Patrol officers stopped Coke as he was driving to the Inlet parking lot because of erratic driving, according to police. During a search of his vehicle, the statue was found. Officers determined Coke was under the influence of a narcotic, found cocaine in his possession and arrested him on charges including drugs and possession of paraphernalia. Coke told officers that he was involved in the theft and that he intended to return the statue to either St. Paul’s or Ocean City police, according to OCPD. Coke is scheduled to appear in Ocean City District Court on April 17, where he will be tried for burglary and theft..\n\nMassachusetts\n\nPlymouth: A 17-year-old boy is responsible for recently spraying red paint all over Plymouth Rock and several other sites in the historic Massachusetts community, police said Thursday. The teen faces 11 felony counts of vandalism and one misdemeanor count of trespassing, Plymouth Police Chief Michael Botieri said in a statement. The suspect’s name was not released because he is a juvenile, but the chief did say he is a resident of the town, which this year is marking the 400th anniversary of the Pilgrims’ arrival. The rock symbolizes the spot where the Mayflower Pilgrims disembarked in December 1620. The suspect was identified by detectives who reviewed hours of surveillance video from the area, the chief said. In addition to Plymouth Rock, the National Monument to the Forefathers and the Plymouth Maiden statue were found defaced on Feb. 17. Most of the places were defaced with the number and letter combination 508 MOF. Botieri told The Patriot Ledger the boy offered no explanation for what was written. The vandalism has since been cleaned up. The Feb. 17 vandalism is not connected to vandalism to the town’s 9/11 Memorial discovered last Sunday, the chief said.\n\nMichigan\n\nCorunna:The former home of a man accused of murder and cannibalism sold at auction for more than $20,000 over the asking price. The home of Mark D. Latunski, located at 703 Tyrrell Road in Bennington Township, had four bidders come forward Feb. 26 in Shiawassee County Circuit Courthouse in Corunna to place offers on the house. Shiawassee County Sheriff’s Sergeant Douglas Chapman told MLive the highest bid came in at $101,733.28 – $21,001 over the minimum asking price. Property records showed the home has a market value of about $93,000 and was originally purchased in May 2001 for $80,000, according to MLive. The name of the highest bidder was not revealed because the deed is not yet registered, MLive reported. Latunski is facing murder charges for the alleged killing and cannibalizing of 25-year-old Kevin Bacon in Latunski’s basement around Christmas Eve. Bacon’s naked body was found hanging from the ceiling by his ankles on Dec. 28. acon’s reported roommate, Michelle Myers, told police he connected with Latunski on Grindr, a dating app for gay, bi, trans and queer people, and met up with him Dec. 24. He was officially reported missing Dec. 25 by his family after he did not show up to Christmas breakfast at his parents’ home. Latunski reportedly admitted to police he stabbed Bacon twice in the back of the neck before stringing him up and slicing his throat. He confessed he then castrated Bacon and took his testicles and cooked and ate them. Michigan’s Center for Forensic Psychiatry deemed Latunski incompetent for trial Feb. 24. He was found incompetent for trial Thursday by a judge. He was referred to the State of Michigan’s Forensic Center for treatment in the Saline.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSauk Rapids:The Sauk Rapids-Rice school board has decided to enter into negotiations with Thief River Falls public schools Superintendent Brad Bergstrom to become their superintendent in July. The board made the decision Wednesday night after the second of two daylong interviews with two finalists. Robbinsdale Area Schools Director of Community Education Kristine Wehrkamp toured the district Monday, and Bergstrom followed the same schedule on Wednesday. Following the interviews, the board unanimously decided to select Bergrstrom, citing his experience and collaborative approach to leadership. Both finalists answered similar questions, first at a public interview at the Sauk Rapids Government Center and then, after a break for dinner, at a special meeting of the school board. Board members had received feedback from students and staff members who had met with the finalists as they toured the district. Bergstrom is in his fourth year as superintendent at Thief River Falls. He was a director of human resources, a high school principal and an area learning center director in the Austin school district. Earlier in his career, he was a teacher and a dean of students in Fergus Falls and Birchdale. He also coached hockey. Bergstrom will start contract negotiations with the district, and, if approved, will start July 1. He will replace Aaron Sinclair, who announced his resignation in December.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford:The University of Mississippi has apologized to dozens of African Americans who were arrested in 1970 for protesting racial inequality on the mostly white campus where Confederate images were a deeply ingrained part of campus culture. “I am sorry it took us 50 years to do this,” Provost Noel Wilkin said Tuesday during a conference called “Black Power at Ole Miss: Remembrance, Reckoning, and Repair at Fifty Years.” The university also awarded a diploma to one of the people who was arrested. Linnie Liggins – now married and known as Linnie Liggins Willis – had completed her coursework before her arrest but the university at the time refused to give her the diploma she had earned. She has worked as executive director at Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority in Toledo, Ohio. On Feb. 24, 1970, 40 members of the Black Student Union presented a list of demands to the university’s chancellor, Porter L. Fortune Jr., The Daily Mississippian reported. They wanted the university to hire more black faculty members, begin a black studies program and eliminate Confederate imagery at a time when many white students still waved rebel flags at football games. Also in February 1970, a group of black students burned a Confederate flag and danced on tables in the cafeteria to the music of B.B. King. The next day, almost half of the black students at the university participated in a protest during a campus concert of Up With People, a international traveling group that sang upbeat songs, including at least one tune about racial inclusion. A photo published in the student newspaper at the time showed that some of the protesters stood on stage with their fists in the air – a symbol of the black power movement. During and after the concert, 89 people were arrested and sent to a local jail or to the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman. They were released the next day. Eight of the students were suspended from the university: Donald Ray Cole, John Donald, Theron Evans Jr., Paul D. Jackson, Linnie Liggins, Kenneth Mayfield, lva Ruth Peyton and Henriese Roberts. The arrests happened less than eight years after Ole Miss enrolled its first black student under a federal court order and with protection of U.S. marshals. Five of the eight suspended students returned to campus for the conference Tuesday.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican lawmakers on Wednesday took steps to resurrect a Missouri voter photo identification law that was gutted by the state Supreme Court. The court last month permanently blocked a central provision of the 2016 law that required voters who lacked a photo ID to make a sworn statement in order to cast a regular, nonprovisional ballot. In response, Republicans are trying to pass a new voter ID bill that is similar to the 2016 law but doesn’t include the sworn statement provision that the judges found objectionable. House members on Wednesday gave initial approval to the measure, which would give voters only two options, instead of three: either show a photo ID to cast a regular ballot or else cast a provisional ballot. Provisional ballots would be counted if voters return to their polling places on the same day with a valid photo ID or if their signatures match the ones on file with election authorities. To cast provisional ballots, voters would need to sign sworn affidavits that include their birth dates, addresses and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers, and that swear the information is correct. Missouri is one of several states where Republican-led legislatures have passed voter photo ID laws touted as a means of preventing in-person voter fraud, which studies have shown is rare. Democrats generally oppose such laws, arguing that they are really meant to disenfranchise voter groups that tend to support their party, including the poor, elderly and disabled as well as transient college students and minorities who are less likely to have photo IDs.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings:The Trump administration said Wednesday a resumption of coal sales from public lands that had been blocked under former President Barack Obama will result in a negligible increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Critics accused the administration of producing a flawed analysis of the federal coal program that ignores its broader impacts. A federal judge last year had faulted the administration for failing to consider potential damage to the environment when former U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke in 2017 lifted a moratorium on coal sales imposed by his predecessor. U.S. District Judge Brian Morris in Montana stopped short in his April 2019 ruling from halting coal sales but said the Department of Interior had to conduct an environmental review of its decision. The Trump administration review focused on potential emissions from only four coal leases in Utah and Oklahoma that were sold after the moratorium was lifted. That’s a small piece of a federal leasing program that accounts for about about 40% of U.S. coal production, primarily from Western states that also include Wyoming, Montana and Colorado. Burning that fuel accounts for about 11% of annual U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to previous studies. Interest in federal leases has slackened considerably over the past decade as many utilities switched to natural gas or renewables and demand for coal plummeted. In documents released Wednesday, administration officials acknowledged Zinke’s order had hastened the resumption of federal coal sales before a three-year review begun under Obama was complete. But they argued those sales would have resumed regardless. Companies have mined about 4 billion tons of coal from federal reserves in the past decade, contributing $10 billion to federal and state coffers through royalties and other payments.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The condition of two of the people who tested positive for COVID-19 in Omaha after being evacuated from a cruise ship in Japan has improved significantly, officials said Wednesday. Two of the 15 people being monitored at the University of Nebraska Medical Center were being cared for at the Nebraska Biocontainment Unit because of the severity of their symptoms. Health officials said Wednesday, those two people improved enough to be transferred to the National Quarantine Unit where the other 13 people are being treated. Two of the 15 have tested negative for the virus and could be released from quarantine March 2. The people who tested positive for COVID-19 will have to test negative for it twice before they can be released.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: There were more than 4.1 million passengers at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas last month, according to new numbers released by the airport Thursday. The airport reported that the number of arriving and departing passengers in January was a 6.6% increase over the same month in 2019. It’s the 11th moth in a row where more than 4 million people passed through the airport, and a record for January travel. Most of January’s passengers, or about 3.8 million, were flying on domestic trips. McCarran saw a 7% increase in arriving and departing passengers on domestic flights up from 2019.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu is ordering flags to be flown at half-staff on Saturday in memory of an Air Force pilot from Hudson who recently was killed in Afghanistan. Capt. Ryan Phaneuf and another airman died Jan. 27 in a plane crash. Phaneuf, who was 30, was a 2007 graduate of Alvirne High School. Sununu will present the New Hampshire Medal of Honor to Phaneuf’s parents and wife at his memorial services on Saturday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMargate:Lucy the Elephant, a six-story National Historic Landmark in Margate, is being offered up for overnight stays March 17-19 on the house-sharing website Airbnb. The one-night stays for two people are being offered for $138 – a price that pays homage to the number of years Lucy has been around – and booking is set to begin March 5 on a first-come basis. The pachyderm-shaped dwelling has an entrance in her back legs that takes guests to a remodeled living quarters. But, Lucy’s caretakers said she doesn’t have running water, so Airbnb is placing a heated bathroom trailer with a shower, sink and toilet for guests on the site. The promotion with Airbnb and the Save Lucy Committee is designed to encourage more visitors to the shore and to the elephant, which is one of the oldest surviving roadside attractions in America. Airbnb will make a donation to help support the committee, which has restored the wooden landmark and maintains her for the more than 130,000 visitors she receives in a year. The listing said Lucy has been a home before, as well as a tavern in a previous life.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: A grandfather’s effort to euthanize the family duck drew police after residents reported multiple shots fired. Santa Fe police initially confiscated a handgun from Lorenzo Pacheco, who had fired four shots at the bird, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. His granddaughter, Kaelyn Pacheco, said in a phone interview Wednesday that officers showed compassion toward the man after learning he had carried out the shooting in an act of mercy. Police arrived just before a burial for the bird was about to start. Kaelyn Pacheco said the duck, a family pet, had become paralyzed and couldn’t walk, and it also had an eye infection. A police report of the incident said Lorenzo Pacheco “felt bad and did not want to break the neck of the duck and thought using a firearm would be more humane.” He placed the duck in an enclosed area and fired four shots, the report said. Officers went to Lorenzo Pacheco’s home, where he showed them the pistol he had used to shoot the duck. According to the report, the officer “collected the weapon for safekeeping and placed it into safekeeping.” Lorenzo Pacheco said in an interview that police returned his gun to him Tuesday after determining there was no cause for a charge of negligent use of a firearm.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: Drivers who get five camera-issued red light tickets or 15 camera-issued speeding tickets in a 12-month period will have to take a traffic safety course or risk losing their vehicles under a bill signed by Mayor Bill de Blasio on Wednesday. The law will take effect on Feb. 26, 2021 and will apply to tickets incurred after Oct. 26 of this year. The vehicles of drivers who exceed the ticket limit can be impounded unless the drivers take a safe driving course overseen by the city Department of Transportation. City officials estimated that the new law will affect about 3,000 to 6,000 vehicles, a fraction of the nearly 2 million vehicles registered in the city. The mayor and City Council will decide after three years whether to renew the law. De Blasio, a Democrat has sought to reduce traffic fatalities through measures such as lowering speed limits and adding speed cameras. But at least 20 pedestrians have been killed by motor vehicles on city streets this year, including a 10-year-old girl who was struck by a school bus on Tuesday.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A female wrestler has made history by winning a state high school wrestling championship. The North Carolina High School Athletic Association said on its website that junior Heaven Fitch of Uwharrie Charter became the first female to win one of the association’s individual state wrestling championships. She won the 106-pound weight class in the 1A division on Saturday. A photo released on the association’s official Twitter account showed her beaming, standing next to three boys who finished behind her in the tournament. She had a 54-4 record for the season and won Most Outstanding Wrestler for the 1A division. Fitch beat Robbinsville’s Luke Wilson to win an eight-person bracket that included seven male wrestlers, said James Alverson, assistant commissioner for the high school association. Overall, she was one of three female wrestlers in the tournament, he said. Last year, she became the first female wrestler to place, coming in fourth in her division.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: The risk of spring flooding in the Red River Valley has been reduced slightly because of limited precipitation in the last few weeks, although National Weather Service forecasters said Thursday there’s still a lot of moisture in the system. The latest outlook showed a 50% chance that the Red River in the Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, area will reach just under 35 feet, or 17 feet above flood stage. That could lead to some road and bridge closures, but most structures would not be threatened. There’s a 5% chance the river could top 39 feet, down 5% from the last report. Fargo city leaders said earlier this week they would fill 250,000 sandbags in case that happens. The weather service said precipitation totals since Sept. 1 remain at record highs in many areas along the Red River and the snowpack is at or above normal and could lead to a high runoff. However, the forecast no longer indicates a cooler and wetter late winter and early spring period. Conditions could change quickly depending on the rate of thaw and spring rains, the report said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Transgender females would be banned from competing in Ohio high school and college girls and women’s sports under a bill introduced Wednesday by House Republicans. The legislation would apply to all public schools and colleges and any private schools or colleges that are members of a state or national athletic association. The bill prohibits biological males from competing in girls or women’s sports. It comes as three high school girl runners in Connecticut are suing to block a policy that allows transgender athletes to compete in girls sports. Currently in Ohio, transgender girls can participate in sports after they have completed a minimum of one year of hormone treatment related to gender transition, under Ohio High School Athletic Association rules. Alternatively, transgender girls can compete if they demonstrate to OHSAA officials “by way of sound medical evidence” that they don’t possess physical advantages over girls of the same age. Similar bills have been introduced in Alabama, Arizona, Idaho and Mississippi. The Ohio bill sponsors are Rep. Jena Powell, of Arcanum in western Ohio, and Rep. Reggie Stoltzfus of Paris Township in northeastern Ohio.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman:Dozens of University of Oklahoma students staged a sit-in for a second day Thursday outside OU’s administrative offices following two instances of professors using racial slurs in the classroom. OU’s Black Emergency Response Team, known as BERT, gathered Wednesday morning in Evans Hall and called for the resignation of OU provost Kyle Harper, mandatory equity training for faculty, semester-long diversity training and a new multicultural center on campus. Some students spent the night in Evans Hall and the group said it would remain there “until these demands are met.” The sit-in comes days after interim OU President Joseph Harroz Jr. announced that a history professor read from a historical document in class that used the N-word repeatedly. Earlier this month, an OU journalism professor stepped down from teaching the course for the rest of the semester after telling students during class that the N-word is no more offensive than the term “boomer.” The university said in a statement late Wednesday that leaders had met with the students to discuss their concerns. “We identified areas of agreement that will move our university forward,” the OU statement said. “We have agreed to continue these discussions. We will also advance these conversations with other student, faculty, and staff leadership.”\n\nOregon\n\nNewport: A body found in Newport Bay has been identified as that of a fisherman who has been missing for nearly three weeks, the Newport Police Department said Thursday. Norman Grant was reported missing on Feb. 9 and hadn’t been seen since the evening of Feb. 8, Chief Jason Malloy said in a statement. Cellphone records and video from local surveillance cameras put Grant’s last known location near a fishing boat that he worked on called the F/V Prolifik. The boat was moored at Hallmark Fisheries. Grant’s body was discovered about 80 feet south of the Hallmark Fisheries dock when another boat ran into something under the water on Feb. 26. A subsequent inspection of the boat found clothing entangled in the vessel’s prop and a diver was called in. No cause of death or other details about the case have been released.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nWest Newton: A mother wearing a Cookie Monster costume apparently overdosed on heroin while sitting in her running car, shortly after she had dropped off her 9-year-old son at a babysitter’s home. Rachel Love Martin, 38, of Westmoreland County was charged Wednesday with child endangerment. It’s not known if she has retained an attorney. The babysitter called police to her home because she was concerned Martin might have been under the influence of drugs, authorities said. Police found Martin slumped over the steering wheel of her car, and emergency responders soon gave her Narcan, a drug used to revive people suffering from a drug overdose. Meanwhile, police found Martin’s son wasn’t wearing any shoes or socks when he was dropped off, just a pair of pants and a T-shirt at a time when temperatures were in the low 40s, authorities said. It’s not clear why Martin was wearing the Cookie Monster costume, authorities said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nWarwick: Firefighters are sharing nearly $500,000 in retroactive payments to end the last outstanding grievance stemming from recent contract negotiations. A panel of arbitrators ruled that the city should retroactively pay firefighters an extra 2.25% for work performed during the budget year that ended June 30, The Providence Journal reported. The decision will cost the city $478,456, according to Mayor Joseph J. Solomon. The firefighters union negotiated a new three-year agreement in January, partially retroactive, for the period from July 1, 2019, through June 30, 2022. That agreement had not resolved the firefighters’ wages for the fiscal year that ended on June 30. The union had previously sought a 4% raise for wages during that period, and later it sought 3%, according to Solomon. Solomon had hoped to settle the matter by giving the firefighters 1.5% but he said the arbitrators’ decision is “fair and reasonable.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A law banning sex education teachers from mentioning any relationships other than heterosexual – unless the talk involves sexually transmitted diseases – is fueling a climate of state-sanctioned discrimination, a federal lawsuit said. The National Center for Lesbian Rights and Lambda Legal said the lawsuit filed Wednesday seeks to overturn the Comprehensive Health Education Act of 1988 as an unconstitutional violation of the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution. The law, which mandates how sex education classes are taught, also subjects students to bullying and violence and stigmatizes a group that’s already at a heightened risk of suicide, the lawsuit contends. State Superintendent of Education Molly Spearman, named as a defendant in the lawsuit, agreed that the law is on shaky ground. She requested an opinion on its constitutionality from South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson. That opinion said “a court would likely conclude” that the law violates the equal protection clause requiring that people in similar circumstances be treated the same under the law. Parents can have their children opted out of the school sex education curriculum, said Ryan Brown, a spokesman for the state Department of Education.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state Senate on Wednesday unanimously approved a proposal to start four schools based around Native American language and culture.The House will next consider the proposal, which aims to address high drop-out rates in some Native American communities in the state. The schools would teach an Oceti Sakowin curriculum centered on Lakota, Dakota, and Nakota language and culture. It is pushed by a group of educators who are planning to open the schools in Native American communities. When Sen. Troy Heinert, a Democrat from Mission, introduced the bill, he had hefty opposition from Gov. Kristi Noem and education groups. But he was able to win the Republican governor’s support through a rewrite of the bill. He also won the support of the Republican-dominated Senate. Education groups oppose the proposal, saying that the current school system can accommodate innovative programs. The schools were originally called charter schools in the bill, but the term was switched to “community-based schools.” The schools would need to apply to school districts to start within the district, and they would receive funding based on the number of students enrolled in the schools. They would purchase or lease school facilities independently from the school districts.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Meharry Medical College and health care provider Remote Area Medical are offering free dental care at an event this week. They will provide free cleanings, fillings, extractions and dental X-rays on Saturday on Meharry’s campus in Nashville during Oral Health Day. Services will be provided to up to 600 uninsured or underinsured middle Tennessee residents, according to a news release from the school. There will also be free kidney screenings provided by the Tennessee Kidney Foundation, the release said. Remote Area Medical is a nonprofit provider of mobile medical clinics that delivers free dental, vision and medical care to people in need. To receive treatment, patients must be at least 18 years old. They will be seen on a first-come, first-served basis. Services are free, and no insurance or identification is required. Check-in is at Henry A. Moses Ph.D. Alumni Hall on Meharry’s campus. Tickets will be distributed beginning at 6 a.m. Services will be available at 7 a.m. No children will be permitted. Care will be provided by Meharry dental students, Meharry School of Dentistry alumni and volunteer dental students and providers.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Emergency crews rescued stranded drivers from the roofs of their vehicles on Thursday after a water main broke and flooded a Houston freeway. The flooding submerged vehicles on an eastern section of Loop 610, a highway that circles the city. Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez tweeted early Thursday afternoon that all occupants were out of flooded vehicles. There were no reports of injuries. Drivers in the low-lying city are used to navigating flooded roadways during storms, but the water main-caused flash flood caught many by surprise on a sunny day. The fire department said on Twitter that it had rescued three people and searched and cleared 12 vehicles. Houston officials said the 8-foot water main burst as a contractor doing exploratory work for a city water line project moved soil from the line. The city said contractors are in the area to isolate the break and make repairs. City officials said they had received reports about low water pressure across a large swath of the city but that once the valves are closed, pressure should be restored. Gonzalez said some nearby businesses were reporting that they had no water service.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Leaders of a new Salt Lake City Olympic bid committee vowed Wednesday to be transparent and frugal as they design a plan based around existing venues and experience from hosting the 2002 Winter Olympics but that will also include new, modern ideas. The committee held its first meeting as it sets out to assess whether Salt Lake City should bid for the 2030 or 2034 Winter Olympics. There’s no timeline for that decision. Committee chair Cindy Crane told board members that every conversation they have about the Olympics should be considered public as the part of a completely open process. Crane, a former CEO of a major utility company, said after the meeting that the remark was made to establish ground rules and was not a direct reference to a bribery scandal that nearly derailed the plans for the 2002 Winter Olympics hosted by Salt Lake City. But, she said, “The strength of our operating principles are to make it very, very clear that those days are well behind us and not in our path forward.” The bribery scandal broke in 1998, three years after Salt Lake City was chosen over cities in Canada, Sweden and Switzerland. Salt Lake’s bid committee doled out $1 million in cash, scholarships, medical care, gifts and other favors to International Olympic Committee members and their families. That included ski trips, NBA tickets, plastic surgery, knee replacements, violins and housing and salary for children of IOC members, according to report by an ethics panel. It led to the expulsion of six IOC members, the resignation of four others and severe warnings for several others, though none faced criminal charges. U.S. prosecutors brought criminal charges against two Salt Lake bid leaders, but both men were acquitted by a judge halfway through a federal trial.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier:The state House advanced a bill to tax and regulate marijuana sales in the state, after the Senate passed legislation last spring. Current Vermont law that went into effect in 2018 allows for the possession of small amounts of marijuana for recreational use, but it does not include a mechanism to tax and sell marijuana. The House vote on the tax-and-regulate legislation late Wednesday was approved 90-54. Rep. John Gannon, a Democrat from Wilmington, called Vermont’s existing law “awkward” because it legalized recreational pot but did not create “safe and legal access to it.” He told lawmakers that the question before them was whether cannabis, which was already legalized in Vermont, should be regulated. A House amendment has proposed a 14% excise tax on retail sales of marijuana products and a 6% sales and use tax for a total rate of 20%. The bill establishes a license for current medical dispensaries to start selling marijuana in February 2022. Other retailers would need to apply for licenses and could start selling it in July 2022. Cultivators, wholesalers and product manufacturers would need to apply for other licenses available. The program for licensed cannabis establishments would be administered by an independent Cannabis Control Board within the executive branch, which would be responsible for establishing rules, compliance and enforcement. The use of cannabis in public places would be prohibited unless specifically authorized by law. Republican Gov. Phil Scott has said he was concerned about highway safety, and said he wanted to see an effective way to test for impairment.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: An animal control company said it removed an 8-foot-long beehive from someone’s apartment. Virginia Wildlife Management and Control said in a statement that it removed the hive from the ceiling of a living room in Richmond on Monday. The space was in between tenants at the time. The company said the hive produced about 80 to 100 pounds of honey, although only about 15 to 20 pounds was able to be salvaged. Rich Perry, owner of the wildlife control company, told The Charlotte Observer that the hive was large enough to support 100,000 to 150,000 bees. But he said it wasn’t fully occupied Perry said it was extremely unusual to find such a large hive inside a building. He said the hive of Italian bees was likely to be at least 2 years old. He said the bees probably got in through holes in the siding and found a home between rafters and sheet rock.The company said it has a “no kill” policy with bees. But he said the company could not find the queen after an extensive search and that the hive could not be saved.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: A measure prohibiting homicide defendants from claiming as a defense that panic brought on by a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity has been passed by state lawmakers. Nine states – California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey New York and Rhode Island – have legislatively banned the use of gay or transgender panic as a legal defense. The Washington measure, passed by the Senate on a bipartisan 46-3 vote Wednesday, is named after Nikki Kuhnhausen, a transgender teen who was killed last year, The Columbian reported. Kuhnhausen, 17, disappeared in early June and her remains were discovered Dec. 7, southeast of Battle Ground. A Vancouver man has been charged with second-degree murder and malicious harassment, which is a hate crime in Washington. Authorities said Kuhnhausen was strangled after her assailant learned she was transgender. He has pleaded not guilty. There was no immediate indication if he will attempt to use a “panic” defense. The bill, which passed the House earlier this month on a 90-5 vote, would block a defendant from using a defense based on discovery or disclosure of the victim’s actual or perceived gender identity or sexual orientation and would prevent a claim of “diminished capacity” because the defendant did not fully comprehend the nature and gravity of the alleged crime. The legislation now goes to Gov. Jay Inslee for his signature.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Investigators are seeking help from the public as they try to determine the cause of separate fires on the same day at adjacent businesses in southern West Virginia. A medical building under renovation and a gun shop were destroyed in the Feb. 10 fires in Williamson, the state fire marshal’s office said in a news release Thursday. Although firefighters battled a fire at the Williamson Health and Wellness Center, crews discovered the gun shop had been broken into and items had been removed. The second fire at the gun shop occurred about four hours later with flames shooting through the roof, the statement said. The state fire marshal’s office is working with Williamson police in the investigation. Although the statement said it’s not known how the fires started, it said a $5,000 reward is being offered for information leading to an arrest and conviction.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison:The number of abortions performed in Wisconsin increased for a second straight year in 2018 after eight years of declines, the latest report from the state Department of Health Services showed. Abortions increased 7% in 2018 over 2017, the report said. There were 6,042 abortions in Wisconsin in 2018, up from 5,640 the year before. That’s nearly double the rate of increase between 2016 and 2017 when abortions went up 3.7%. The growth is due to there being 539 more medication abortions in 2018 compared with 2017. Planned Parenthood opened a clinic in Sheboygan in May 2018 that offered medication abortions. The latest report showed that women ages 20 to 24 had 30% of the abortions in 2018, the most of any age group. The total number of abortions had dropped steadily from 2009 until 2017. Anti-abortion groups Pro-Life Wisconsin and Wisconsin Right to Life both decried the increase. Republicans who control the Legislature passed a number of bills restricting abortion access in recent years. Democratic Gov. Tony Evers last year vetoed for Republican-backed bills designed to limit the number of abortions.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Federal investigators want help from the public as they try to find out who poisoned a golden eagle and ravens in southwest Wyoming four years ago. They’re offering a reward of up to $2,000 for information leading to a conviction. The golden eagle and four ravens were found dead southwest of Wamsutter in 2016. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service said Tuesday investigators also found poison-laced baits in the remote area of interspersed private and U.S. Bureau of Land Management lands. Investigators said the case is unrelated to the 2018 poisoning deaths of three dogs, a bald eagle and dozens of other birds in the Dubois area. The Fish and Wildlife Service and Wyoming Game and Fish Department are offering rewards up to $7,000 in that case. Golden eagles are federally protected under the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. A person who kills one illegally can get up to a year in prison and a $100,000 fine.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/02/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/10/04/chinese-laundry-phone-booth-advice-balloon-fiesta-news-around-states/119016838/", "title": "Chinese laundry, phone booth advice: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Amid a national debate over the use of pandemic relief funds, state lawmakers swiftly approved a plan Friday to tap $400 million from the American Rescue Plan to help build two supersize prisons, brushing off criticism from congressional Democrats that the money was not intended for such projects. The Legislature gave final approval to the $1.3 billion prison construction plan and to a separate bill to steer $400 million of the state’s $2.1 billion from the rescue funds to pay for it. With legislative leaders standing behind her, Gov. Kay Ivey signed the bills into law soon afterward. The Republican called the construction plan “a major step forward” for the prison system, which faces various federal court orders and a lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice. “This is a pivotal moment for the trajectory of our state’s criminal justice system,” Ivey said. Alabama’s plan to use almost 20% of its American Rescue Plan funds for prison construction drew criticism from Democrats including U.S. Rep. Terri Sewell, who argued that was not the intent of the relief program. But state Republicans argued that the expenditure addresses a public safety need and is allowed under a provision to replace lost revenue and shore up state services.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state on Saturday activated emergency crisis protocols that allow 20 medical facilities to ration care if needed as Alaska recorded the nation’s worst COVID-19 diagnosis rates in recent days, straining the state’s limited health care system. The declaration covers three facilities that had already announced emergency protocols, including the state’s largest hospital, Providence Alaska Medical Center in Anchorage. The state’s declaration also includes the other two hospitals in Anchorage and facilities across the huge but sparsely populated state. “Today’s action recognizes that Alaska has an interconnected and interdependent health care system, requiring the need for activation of the state’s decision-making framework,” the state health department said in a statement announcing the activation. “I want to stress that our health care facilities in Alaska remain open and able to care for patients,” said Adam Crum, the state’s health commissioner. According to data collected by Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, 1 in every 84 people in Alaska was diagnosed with COVID-19 from Sept. 22 to Sept. 29. Fairbanks Memorial Hospital, which was covered by the state’s announcement, on Friday activated its own policy because of a shortage of beds, staff and monoclonal antibody treatments, along with the inability to transfer patients. “The move to Crisis Standards of Care is not something we take lightly,” Fairbanks Chief Medical Officer Dr. Angelique Ramirez said in a statement. “This is in response to a very serious surge of COVID in our community.”\n\nArizona\n\nChandler: A helicopter and a single-engine plane collided in midair Friday near a suburban Phoenix airport, sending the helicopter crashing into a field and killing both people on board. The plane landed safely, and the flight instructor and a student inside were not hurt. The collision happened in the city of Chandler near its municipal airport, said police Sgt. Jason McClimans. He said no one on the ground was hurt. The Chandler Fire Department received reports of a fire in a brush field next to the airport shortly before 8 a.m. Crews found a large plume of smoke and the wreckage of the helicopter on fire but were able to extinguish it relatively quickly, fire officials said. They inspected the helicopter and found the bodies of the two people on board. The chopper was operated by Quantum Helicopters and the plane by Flight Operations Academy. Both are flight schools, according to McClimans, of Chandler Police. Richard Bengoa, owner of Flight Operations Academy, said the four-seat plane is used mostly for flight training. Though officials did not allow Bengoa to get close to the plane, he said it appeared from a distance that its landing gear had been damaged. He said he had no information about how the collision happened and was not allowed to speak with the instructor or student.\n\nArkansas\n\nBella Vista: The Bella Vista Bypass opened to the public Friday, marking the end to a decades­long plan to link sections of an interstate in northwest Arkansas and southwest Missouri. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson and Missouri Gov. Mike Parson marked the occasion with a ribbon-cutting ceremony Thursday. The new roadway allows travelers to bypass Bella Vista, Arkansas, and connects 265 miles of Interstate 49 between Fort Smith, Arkansas, and Kansas City, Missouri. Discussions began more than 25 years ago for the project, and construction began in February 2011. According to the Arkansas Department of Transportation, construction included six projects that totaled more than $220 million. “Whenever you look at what’s happening in northwest Arkansas and southwest Missouri, our economy is boosting. But if we do not have this kind of investment in infrastructure, then we can’t keep growing our economy,” Hutchinson said. “While this won’t guarantee we’ll continue to prosper in the future, it sure means we’re not going to stymie the growth we already have.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nYosemite National Park: A century-old building originally used as a laundry by Chinese workers at Yosemite’s iconic Wawona Hotel has been restored and turned into a visitor’s attraction, recognizing Chinese Americans’ contributions to the early history of the national park. Officials unveiled a new sign Friday marking the Chinese Laundry Building in Yosemite Valley, the Fresno Bee reports. New exhibits inside tell the story of Chinese workers who helped build Tioga Road and Wawona Road, critical infrastructure that made tourism to the park possible. The building – later used as a storage facility – is part of a cluster of structures that will make up the new Yosemite History Center, which will tell the histories of immigrants who made the park what it is today, said park ranger Adam Ramsey. “Chinese people have been a big part of communities throughout the Sierra Nevada for a really long time, and it’s about time that we started sharing that history here in Yosemite,” Ramsey said. According to research conducted by park ranger Yenyen Chan, in 1883 Chinese workers helped build the 56-mile Tioga Road in just 130 days. The stunning route across the Sierra Nevada reaches 10,000 feet in elevation and serves as one of the park’s main roads. Chinese workers were also employed in Yosemite as cooks, laundry workers and gardeners.\n\nColorado\n\nAurora: A majority of officers from a suburban Denver police department that had faced investigations and community outrage over its run-ins with people of color reported disapproving of the police chief who has committed publicly to reforming the force and its reputation. Members of the Aurora Police Department’s two labor unions, the Aurora Police Association and the local chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police, voted in a poll last week that asked: “Do you feel confident in the leadership of Chief Vanessa Wilson?” The response was 442 votes against her to 16 in favor, the Sentinel Colorado reports. The vote comes less than a month after Attorney General Phil Weiser announced several Aurora officers and paramedics were indicted on manslaughter and other charges in the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man who was put in a chokehold and injected with a powerful sedative. Weiser also announced last month that a civil rights investigation found the department’s patterns and practices indicated a history of racially biased policing. Doug Wilkinson, head of the Aurora Police Association, said the union vote was prompted by Wilson reopening an investigation into a May traffic stop of a Black man who said he was tackled and stunned with a Taser by police, who had “already been cleared of wrongdoing.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State officials announced a settlement Friday with Eversource over the electric utility’s response to last year’s Tropical Storm Isaias, which left thousands of people without power for days. Under the deal, Eversource has agreed to return $103.4 million to consumers and provide more accountability during future storms, Gov. Ned Lamont and Attorney General William Tong announced. Eversource also has agreed not to apply for a rate increase until at least January 2023, for rates that would not go into effect until at least January 2024, Gov. Ned Lamont’s office said. The storm hit Connecticut on Aug. 4, 2020, with rain and high winds, leaving roughly 800,000 utility customers without power at its peak. Local officials complained that an inability to contact the utility made it difficult to tell residents when or where crews would be coming to restore power. Many towns did not see a utility truck for more than two days, and some people were in the dark for over a week. Under the agreement, $65 million in Eversource funds are to be immediately returned to customers in the form of credits on their December and January bills. The company said $10 million will be used to assist customers who are having difficulty paying their utility bills. The average customer will see a total credit of $35, the governor’s office said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A Dover man who pointed a gun at counterprotesters during a campaign rally for a Republican U.S. Senate candidate last year has been convicted of two felonies. A jury convicted Michael Hastings on Thursday of first-degree reckless endangering and possession of a firearm during commission of a felony for pointing a gun at a group of protesters while attending a Lauren Witzke rally. The incident, which was caught on video by a protester, happened during a September 2020 rally in Wilmington. Witzke, who condemned the behavior, later lost to incumbent Democratic Sen. Chris Coons. “Pointing a loaded gun at anyone is always dangerous, full stop,” Delaware Attorney General Kathy Jennings said in a statement. “The defendant’s actions seriously endangered his fellow citizens who were exercising their right to free speech, and he now faces the consequences.”\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The first Women’s March of the Biden administration headed straight for the steps of the Supreme Court on Saturday, part of nationwide protests that drew thousands to Washington to demand continued access to abortion in a year when conservative lawmakers and judges have put it in jeopardy. Demonstrators filled the streets surrounding the court, shouting “My body, my choice.” Before heading out on the march, they rallied in a square near the White House, waving signs that said “Mind your own uterus” and “Abortion is a personal choice, not a legal debate,” among other messages. Some wore T-shirts reading simply “1973,” a reference to the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Elaine Baijal, a 19-year-old student at American University, said her mother told her of coming to a march for legal abortion with her own mother in the 1970s. “It’s sad that we still have to fight for our right 40 years later. But it’s a tradition I want to continue,” Baijal said of the march. The demonstrations took place two days before the start of a new term that will decide the future of abortion rights in the United States, after appointments of justices by President Donald Trump strengthened conservative control of the high court. “Shame, shame, shame!” marchers chanted while passing the Trump International Hotel, at which some booed and waved their fists.\n\nFlorida\n\nSurfside: Personal property recovered from the destroyed units of a condo building that collapsed, killing 98 people, will be divided into two categories: soft material and hard material, according to a plan outlined before a judge overseeing litigation from the tragedy. Only the hard items collected from the rubble where the Champlain Towers South building once stood will be returned to survivors and family members of those killed, officials said in court documents. The moisture-absorbing soft items, including clothing and bedding, would cost millions of dollars to decontaminate per EPA guidelines, they said. Photos are the exception to the rule, as Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava has made those a priority to return to survivors, said Michael Goldberg, a lawyer appointed to manage the legal interests of the Champlain Towers South. About $750,000 in cash was recovered from the ruins. Family members and survivors will be reimbursed somewhat quickly for cash that is easily identifiable because it was in a wallet or purse with an ID. The actual paper bills will be transported to the U.S. Treasury in Washington, where they will be destroyed since they are contaminated. They’ll be replaced with checks, according to court documents. But “we are going to have claims for cash that far exceed what is coming back,” Goldberg said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Ahmaud Arbery’s mental health records can’t be used as trial evidence by the white men who chased and killed the 25-year-old Black man as he was running in their neighborhood, a judge ruled Friday. The decision by Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley further limits defense attorneys’ efforts to portray Arbery as an aggressive young man with a troubled past when the case goes to trial soon, with jury selection scheduled to start Oct. 18. The judge ruled that Arbery’s medical privacy, even in death, trumped the rights of the men standing trial to a robust defense. And he concluded that a registered nurse’s “highly questionable diagnosis” that Arbery suffered from mental illness during his first and only visit to a mental health services provider in 2018 could unfairly prejudice a trial jury. “There is no evidence that the victim was suffering from any mental health issue, or had otherwise decompensated, on February 23, 2020,” the date Arbery was killed, the judge’s ruling said. Prosecutors say Arbery was merely jogging on that date when father and son Gregory and Travis McMichael armed themselves and chased Arbery in a pickup truck in their neighborhood just outside the port city of Brunswick, about 70 miles south of Savannah.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige said Friday that he would extend emergency orders requiring masks and regulating travel amid ongoing concerns about high numbers of COVID-19 infections. Ige said his new proclamation would stay in effect for 60 days. The rules mandate masks in indoor public spaces. To avoid 10 days of quarantine upon arriving in the islands, travelers must show proof of vaccination or a negative result from a coronavirus test taken within 72 hours of their flight to Hawaii. The governor said he was concerned that the seven-day average of new daily cases continues to exceed 300. He noted that while that’s down from late August, when the figure approached 900, it’s still higher than last year’s peak. He said he was watching closely whether hospitals have enough beds and staff to care for the sick, noting that Hawaii’s geographic isolation means patients can’t drive to neighboring states for health care if local hospitals are full. Earlier this year Ige had hoped to lift restrictions once 70% of the state’s population was vaccinated against COVID-19, but he said “everything changed” with the spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the virus. As of Friday, 68% of the state’s population was fully vaccinated.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin has made public a collection of documents to journalists shortly after a judge again ordered her to reveal the records. The public records included feedback from the public regarding her newly created Education Task Force, which was tasked with investigating alleged “indoctrination” in the state’s public school system – something McGeachin said was necessary to “protect our young people from the scourge of critical race theory, socialism, communism and Marxism.” Several journalists first requested copies of the public records months ago. But McGeachin’s office mostly denied the requests, telling some reporters it would cost them hundreds of dollars to access the materials and citing exemptions to Idaho’s public records law that didn’t apply to the documents. McGeachin also falsely claimed in public Facebook posts that the journalists were only seeking the records to encourage employers to retaliate against anyone who expressed concerns about the state’s public education system. In July, the Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin for the documents on behalf of Audrey Dutton and Clark Corbin with the Idaho Capital Sun, Blake Jones with Idaho Education News and Hayat Norimine with the Idaho Statesman.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The death of an Illinois State Police trooper on an expressway has been ruled a suicide, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s office said Saturday. An autopsy found District Chicago Trooper Gerald Mason, 35, died of a gunshot wound to the head, the medical examiner’s office said. The 11-year state police veteran died Friday afternoon shortly after the shooting on the inbound lanes of the Dan Ryan Expressway on the city’s South Side, authorities said. “He was an amazing District Chicago trooper,” Illinois State Police Director Brendan Kelly said during a news conference Friday evening. The trooper’s mother, Linda Mason, told the Chicago Sun-Times her son had wanted to be an officer since he was a toddler. He was a Chicago native who dedicated his life to policing, she said. “He was a sweetheart, and he loved everybody,” she said. “He just wanted to protect people and make this city and state better.” On Thursday, the Illinois State Police announced it would more than double patrols in the Chicago area beginning Friday in response to a surge in shootings on expressways over the past two years. There have been more than 185 shootings on expressways in the region this year, according to the agency, compared to a total of about 130 shootings last year and just over 50 in 2019.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Republican lawmakers gave final approval Friday to their party’s redrawing of the state’s congressional and legislative districts, brushing aside objections that the maps give them an excessive election advantage and dilute the influence of minority and urban voters. The Indiana Senate and House both voted by wide margins without any Democratic support to advance the redistricting plan to Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb for his signature. Political analysts say the new maps that will be used through the 2030 elections protect the Republican dominance that has given them a 7-2 majority of Indiana’s U.S. House seats and commanding majorities in the Legislature. Republicans maintain they followed federal and state laws to match population changes recorded by the 2020 census while avoiding splitting counties and cities among multiple districts as much as possible. Democrats and civil rights groups countered by pointing to the fragmenting of Fort Wayne’s large Black and Latino communities among three likely Republican Senate districts that will have rural white voters making up the majorities. Critics also argued that the cities of Evansville, Lafayette and West Lafayette were divided among rural, Republican Senate districts while their populations were enough for them to have districts of their own that would be competitive.\n\nIowa\n\nCedar Rapids: A University of Northern Iowa biology professor who required that masks be worn in his classroom and threatened lower grades for students who refused has been relegated to online teaching and stripped of his eligibility for merit pay. UNI professor Steve O’Kane Jr. had circulated a resolution among his colleagues saying faculty should be allowed to manage their classrooms, pushing back against a state law banning mask mandates. Regents President Mike Richards in May barred administrators from requiring masks or vaccines. He’s maintained that position despite the more contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. O’Kane received a disciplinary letter from UNI College of Humanities, Arts and Sciences Dean John Fritch, The Gazette of Cedar Rapids reports. Besides the loss of merit pay and removal from in-person classes, the letter requires O’Kane to complete training addressing his professional responsibilities as a faculty member – including following university policies – by Nov. 30. Despite the letter’s warning that he could be fired if he fails to comply with university policies on face masks, O’Kane said he will require masks again in the spring if he’s allowed to return to in-person teaching.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Residents can now register to vote at the state agencies where they receive public benefits under an agreement with civil rights groups that brings Kansas back into compliance with federal election law, the governor said Friday. Kansas’ Department of Health and Environment and Department for Children and Families have expanded opportunities for residents wishing to register or update their voter registration. The agencies have also committed to providing resources to help them register. “Every lawfully eligible Kansan deserves an equal opportunity to cast his or her ballot in every election,” Kelly, a Democrat, said in a news release. “By sharing resources and expanding opportunities to get registered to vote, we will encourage more voices to be heard at the polls and more Kansans to exercise this important right.” The National Voter Registration Act, passed in 1993, requires voter registration assistance at state agencies providing public assistance benefits. Although the agencies may have been in compliance in the past, previous administrations allowed them to abandon those obligations, Kelly’s office said. To address those deficiencies, Kelly’s office has been working since November 2019 with voting rights advocacy nonprofit Loud Light, represented by the think tank Demos, the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas, and the ACLU’s national Voting Rights Project.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Fresh off landing a record-shattering economic development deal with Ford Motor Co. that put Kentucky at the forefront of the green energy movement, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear on Friday launched a reelection run that will be tied to his aggressive actions to combat COVID-19 in his rapidly reddening state. Still two years away from voters delivering a verdict on his pandemic-plagued term, Beshear filed paperwork allowing him to raise and spend money on his 2023 reelection bid. The 43-year-old governor faces a bruising campaign in a state dominated by Republicans eager to rip into his coronavirus-related restrictions during much of the pandemic. In a social media post, the governor said: “There are so many challenges facing our Commonwealth. Kentuckians are counting on me to deliver, and I won’t let them down.” Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman will be Beshear’s running mate again in 2023, said Eric Hyers, the governor’s 2019 campaign manager and adviser to his reelection effort. Several Republicans are weighing bids to unseat Beshear in 2023, including former United Nations Ambassador Kelly Craft, Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, state Sen. Max Wise and state Rep. Savannah Maddox. State Auditor Mike Harmon already announced he’s in the race.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The state’s largest health system is ratcheting up pressure to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Ochsner Health told employees it will charge them a monthly premium of $200 if a spouse or domestic partner covered under an Ochsner health plan is not vaccinated, The Times-Picayune/New Orleans Advocate reports. Ochsner has said all employees must be vaccinated by Oct. 29 to keep their jobs. President and CEO Warner Thomas said the surcharge for unvaccinated spouses and partners is part of an effort to keep health premiums low for employees. As a self-insured organization, Ochsner bears the cost of COVID-19 treatment for patients who are on its insurance plan. Unvaccinated people account for the vast majority of the health system’s COVID-19 patients. The vaccine fee for spouses and domestic partners will begin in 2022 and could deduct up to $2,400 yearly from the employee’s paycheck. Meanwhile, Louisiana is trying to encourage more people to get COVID-19 shots by offering them a cash incentive. Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Friday that the state’s “Shot for 100” program, which has been offering $100 cash cards to college students who get vaccinated, is expanding to offer the money to anyone who gets newly immunized against COVID-19.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Gov. Janet Mills’ administration submitted an application to the federal government Friday to lease about 15 square miles for a floating offshore wind research area. The Democratic governor has touted the project as the nation’s first such site in federal waters and a chance to chart a new course for renewable energy. Maine wants to deploy a dozen or so wind turbines on floating hulls designed by the University of Maine. The research site would be located almost 30 miles offshore. The Governor’s Energy Office submitted its application to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management. The project “will help establish the best way for our state to embrace the vast economic and environmental benefits of offshore wind,” Mills said. Members of the state’s fishing industry have pushed back at plans for offshore wind off Maine. In response, Mills signed off on a prohibition of offshore wind projects in state waters in July.\n\nMaryland\n\nBowie: Six Flags America is scaling back hours during its annual Halloween events after a series of fights broke out over a recent weekend at the amusement park in the suburbs of the nation’s capital. A melee prompted the park to close an hour early Sept. 25, and the park said it would begin closing its gates at 9 p.m., news outlets report. Patrons won’t be allowed to reenter the park after 6 p.m., and no new entries will be allowed after 7 p.m., Six Flags said in a statement. Prince George’s County police confirmed that officers stationed at the park in Bowie responded to the fights and that several victims have filed reports but said no arrests had been made. Police and park officials said they meet regularly to discuss safety and security plans at the park and were reviewing plans late last week.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: More than a year after they graduated, hundreds of Boston University alumni returned to campus Sunday for a belated commencement ceremony. The university hosted an outdoor graduation event for the Class of 2020, which never had an in-person commencement because of the pandemic. Nearly 2,000 graduates were expected to return for the ceremony at Nickerson Field, school officials said. The ceremony makes good, 17 months later, on the university’s promise that the May 2020 event had been postponed but not canceled because of COVID-19. The school said it’s enforcing public health measures including mandatory mask-wearing indoors. The university requires COVID-19 vaccination for all students and staff and said it’s “strongly encouraged” for visitors. Victor J. Dzua, president of the National Academy of Medicine, was slated to deliver a commencement address. The ceremony was one of several events planned as part of the university’s alumni weekend. Anyone who earned a degree from September 2019 through September 2020 was eligible to register for the belated commencement. The Class of 2021 had its own in-person commencement this year, although it was scaled back to meet city and state gathering limits.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: The grand prize winner of ArtPrize is an old phone booth on a pedestrian bridge. Not just any phone booth, “Before You Go” allows people to listen to advice about life recorded by more than 100 local residents and others. The mother-son team of Monica Pritchard and Christian Reichle won the $50,000 prize Friday. “I’ve just had a passion for telling peoples’ stories in terms of business, and I’ve been sharing that with my son,” said Pritchard, who works as an executive sales coach. “Christian helped me make it come alive.” Pritchard said she and her son didn’t enter the competition to win it. “You pour your heart into something, and you don’t know how it’s going to go,” Reichle said. “To have the reception that we had, and then to win, is huge.” ArtPrize ended Sunday, but people still can experience “Before You Go.” The phone line where the messages are recorded can be accessed by calling (888) 665-2036. For 18 days, a variety of art was displayed in parks, museums, galleries, vacant buildings and other venues.\n\nMinnesota\n\nIsabella: The last remaining closure order related to wildfires in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness has now been lifted, according to Superior National Forest officials. A hot and abnormally dry summer caused extreme fire danger and prompted a complete closure of the popular wilderness area in northern Minnesota for a couple of weeks after wildfires broke out. The last remaining closure related to the John Ek and Whelp fires has now been lifted. Cooler conditions and recent rainfall have helped keep the fires in check. “We have not seen any smoke from the fire for a couple of weeks now, and we feel comfortable lifting this closure as this fire is unlikely to spread much, if at all,” said Patty Johnson, the forest’s East Zone fire management officer. The BWCA received 3 to 6 inches of rain in September, which is about normal for the month. But officials say over the longer term, the region remains in drought conditions, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Fire crews have now removed all pumps, hoses and other equipment that had been staged for the John Ek fire. Meanwhile, to the south and outside the wilderness boundary, the Forest Service has scaled back the closure area around the Greenwood fire, which has reached 80% containment.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The leader of a pediatricians’ organization is urging school districts to keep mask mandates in place to slow the spread of COVID-19. “Many school boards in Mississippi are removing mask requirements,” Dr. Anita Henderson of Hattiesburg, president of the Mississippi Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said Thursday on Twitter. “Kids under 12 cannot be vaccinated and only about 30% of all 12-17 year-olds in Mississippi are fully vaccinated. Now is not the time to let our guard down.” The Mississippi State Department of Health has reported nine pediatric deaths from COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. The state saw a significant surge in COVID-19 cases, deaths and hospitalizations starting in July, but numbers have decreased in recent weeks. In central Mississippi, the Madison County School District removed most of its mask mandate as of Sept. 24, making masks optional in most places but still required on buses. The district has about 13,000 students. The Rankin County School Board voted Sept. 22 to remove a mandate, saying that masks are now “not required but highly recommended” in the district with more than 18,000 students. The change in the central Mississippi district came weeks after some parents protested the mandate at a school board meeting.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Several thousand Missourians who previously were not eligible for Medicaid are expected to seek the health care coverage now that voter-approved expansion of the program has taken effect. Friday marked the day the health care program began processing applications. Voters approved Medicaid expansion in August 2020. The constitutional amendment passed with 53% of the vote. Previously, the state’s health care program did not cover most adults without children, and its income eligibility threshold for parents was one of the lowest in the nation, at about one-fifth of the poverty level. The expansion is expected to add Medicaid eligibility for up to 275,000 low-income Missourians. It wasn’t immediately clear how many people have applied for Medicaid under the expansion. A spokeswoman for the Missouri Department of Social Services said enrollment information for October won’t be posted until November. The expansion was the subject of a court case that wound up in the Missouri Supreme Court, where a July decision paved the way for the plan to move forward.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Most of the state’s Republican lawmakers are urging their leadership to appoint a special committee to investigate the security of the state’s voting system. The effort is led by GOP legislators who are pushing false theories of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, the Montana State News Bureau reports. Republicans hold a two-thirds majority in the Legislature. The letter, signed by 86 of the state’s 98 GOP lawmakers, was sent Wednesday to Senate President Mark Blasdel and House Speaker Wylie Galt and asks for a response by Oct. 6. Blasdel declined to comment Friday, and the bureau could not reach Galt for comment. The letter proposes forming a committee, whose membership also would be two-thirds Republican, to conduct hearings about the election process and security and decide if any new laws are needed. “Many of our constituents have reached out to us with questions about Montana election security,” the letter said. “All Montana voters must have absolute faith in our state, county and local elections.” Montana House Minority Leader Kim Abbott, D-Helena, said the Republican letter offers no evidence that there are any problems with the state’s election system. County election officials run fair and secure elections following state laws, Abbott said Friday.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A state contractor that places Omaha-area children in foster homes, checks on their welfare and ensures their needs are met has been temporarily barred from taking any new cases because it’s struggling to fulfill the requirements of its contract. The Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services set the 60-day restriction on Kansas-based St. Francis Ministries on Thursday. State officials also granted the provider a probationary license as a child placing agency. The department said state child welfare workers will handle new cases in Douglas and Sarpy counties during the probationary period. The state will rely on existing staff members to manage cases and hire additional workers. State officials have said St. Francis has failed to meet several of its contractual obligations over the past two years and has faced major financial problems. State officials negotiated a new contract with the provider in January, about three weeks before St. Francis was expected to run out of money. St. Francis initially won the Nebraska job by offering to do it for $197 million over five years, less than 60% of the bid from PromiseShip, the Omaha-based agency that held the previous state contract. Nebraska lawmakers and child advocates raised concerns at the time, but state officials gave reassurances.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: People who are healing and some still struggling gathered Friday to remember those who died and were injured during the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history four years ago on the Las Vegas Strip. “I was wounded. Those physical wounds have healed,” said Dee Ann Hyatt, whose daughter also was hurt and whose brother died in the Oct. 1, 2017, shooting. “But the lasting scars for our family remain.” Hyatt spoke to several hundred people during a sunrise ceremony at the Clark County Government Center in Las Vegas. She remembered her slain brother, Kurt von Tillow, a trucker from Northern California, before a screen at an outdoor amphitheater that displayed photos of the dead. Fifty-eight people were killed that night, and two others died later. More than 850 were injured. “We continue to live the impact of all that happened that night, four years later,” Hyatt said. “People thrive and people struggle to live with the physical and mental pain, and our lives are forever changed.” The morning memorial featured a song, “Four Years After,” sung by Matt Sky, that was composed for the anniversary by Mark R. Johnson and released with multi-Grammy award winner Alan Parsons.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A proposed rule that would severely limit remote instruction options for schools won’t go before the state Board of Education until November, but state officials already are advising districts to follow it. School districts currently can shift to fully remote or hybrid instruction for all students due to COVID-19 outbreaks. But under an administrative rule proposed by the Department of Education, schools would be required to provide in-person instruction five days per week except in cases of inclement weather or when a parent requests remote learning for an individual student. In an email to school leaders last month, Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut instructed schools on how to comply with what he called the “recently advanced” rules, without describing the current rules. Schools are permitted to offer remote instruction to individual students who have contracted COVID-19, are required to quarantine because a household contact is infected or have other family circumstances that prevent in-person attendance, he said. “I think there’s a little bit of a shift that’s taking place because we’re not in the same circumstances we found ourselves in last year, so people have to shift their mindsets,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nLeesburg: A corrections officer at a state prison in southern New Jersey was arrested Friday on charges he beat and humiliated inmates without provocation or justification, according to federal prosecutors. John Makos, 41, a Millville resident who works at Bayside State Prison in Leesburg, was charged with conspiracy to deprive the inmates of their civil rights. He has been suspended from his job. From April through December 2019, prosecutors said Makos conspired with others at the prison to assault and punish certain inmates in a cruel and arbitrary manner by using excessive force that caused physical injury and pain. Prosecutors said Makos and at least one other corrections officer established an ad hoc regime of physical punishments for actual and perceived violations of the prison’s rules and customs and meted out the punishments in a cruel and degrading manner, at times with the aid of other inmates. Certain prisoners were singled out for brutal beatings, humiliation and assaults that only ended when the prisoner was close to passing out, according to a criminal complaint. In what was known to inmates as the “fence treatment,” prosecutors said Makos handcuffed a prisoner to a fence in the back area of the prison’s kitchen and the other arm to a swinging door, so the inmate would appear to be crucified.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Hundreds of hot air balloons created a colorful tapestry against a blue sky Saturday, kicking off a nine-day annual event that was canceled last year due to the pandemic. The 7 a.m. mass ascension was the first of five scheduled for the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, which draws visitors from around the world. Two balloons hit power lines Sunday and caused a brief outage for more than 1,000 Public Service Company of New Mexico customers, who the company said were without electricity for a couple hours. No injuries were reported. Organizers of the fiesta said more than 540 balloons were registered this year. The 2019 event drew nearly 600 balloons from across the U.S. and 17 other countries. Organizers said they wouldn’t be checking for COVID-19 vaccination cards but noted precautions were being taken to preserve social distancing and provide access to hand sanitizer and hand-washing stations. Indoor dining for balloon pilots and VIPs was canceled. More than 80 balloons in special ornate or cartoonish shapes were disbursed throughout the launch field, rather than clustered together, encouraging crowds to spread out, fiesta spokesman Tom Garrity said. Scheduled events included a chain saw carving display, fireworks, sky divers, musical stage performances and a strolling mariachi band.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor on Friday denied an emergency appeal from a group of teachers to block the city’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate for public school teachers and other staff from going into effect. The teachers had filed for the injunction with Sotomayor on Thursday, in an effort to keep the mandate from going into effect Friday. Under the mandate rules, the roughly 148,000 school employees had until 5 p.m. Friday to get at least their first vaccine shot. Those who didn’t face suspension without pay when schools open Monday. Georgia Pestana, the city’s corporation counsel, said in a statement: “We are gratified by Justice Sotomayor’s decision. She made the right call on the law and in the best interest of students and educators.” Vinoo Varghese, an attorney for the teachers, said in an email: “We are disappointed, but the fight for our clients’ due process and those similarly situated will go on.” An original deadline earlier last week was delayed after a legal challenge, but a federal appeals panel said Monday that New York City could go ahead with the mandate in the country’s largest school district.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Legislative leaders and Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper announced agreement Friday on an energy bill that aims to meet Cooper’s goals on greenhouse gas reductions and gives dominant utility Duke Energy the ability to seek multiyear rate increases. The measure, which is expected to clear the Republican-controlled Legislature this week, removes most of the prescriptive actions that House Republicans laid out in an earlier version of the bill that passed the chamber in July. Instead, the new bill, largely negotiated between the Cooper administration and senators from both parties, directs the state Utilities Commission to come up with a roadmap by the end of 2022 on how to move toward goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions that align with Cooper’s Clean Energy Plan. That plan seeks to reduce carbon dioxide levels from energy producers by 70% compared to 2005 levels by 2030 and achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. The House plan would have contributed to a 62% reduction in power-sector greenhouse gas emissions by the end of the decade, according to an estimate by the commission’s public staff.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum and health officials said Friday that hospital capacity is reaching critical levels and urged residents to take action to help ease the crisis. State officials are urging the public to take a range of steps to help reduce hospitalizations, from avoiding high-risk activities to practicing defensive driving. The Bismarck Tribune reports COVID-19 hospitalizations in the state surpassed 160 on Friday for the first time in nearly 10 months, and the percentage of staffed hospital beds in North Dakota that remained available fell below 10%. “We all need to do our part to avoid hospitalization and prevent further strain on these facilities and their staff as we work through this incredibly challenging time,” said Burgum, a Republican. Hospital capacity has been a concern the past couple of months because of the spread of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus. The 161 patients listed on the Health Department’s virus dashboard Friday was the most since mid-December. The most recent state data showed 214 available staffed inpatient beds and 15 available intensive care unit beds statewide. North Dakota’s six largest hospitals on Friday reported 43 patients had been sent to other facilities, sometimes hundreds of miles away.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state doubled the amount of money for its new Vax-to-College program Friday to $2 million and plans to expand the age range to include children 5 and older once a COVID-19 vaccine is authorized for them at the end of the month. “This is the time for younger Ohioans to get the facts and to make the choice to get the COVID-19 vaccine to help protect themselves and others,” Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, the state health director, said during a press conference. The announcement comes as health officials across Ohio have been sounding the alarm about the rate of younger patients becoming sick and hospitalized with the disease. The overwhelming majority of those patients are unvaccinated. Vanderhoff detailed the changes in the new program in an effort to boost the number of vaccinations, which include increasing the number of $10,000 scholarships to 150 and the hope of expanding the age group to include younger Ohioans. Unlike under the Vax-a-Million program introduced in the spring, winners can put the money toward anything from college to trade school to other advancement opportunities. The program had initially targeted residents ages 12-25 who received vaccines but is now awaiting the FDA emergency use authorization for the Pfizer shot expected in late October to include 5- to 11-year-olds.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Students scored lower on standardized tests in 2021 following a year of disruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Oklahoma State Department of Education. The department reported 22.1% scored proficient in math, 24.8% in English language arts and 29.7% in science. The last testing, in 2019, found 31.9% proficient in math, 33.4% in English language arts and 34.5% in science. “The effects of the pandemic will be seen and felt for years to come,” said State Superintendent of Public Instruction Joy Hofmeister. “There is no quick fix.” The education department said Thursday that the number of students taking the tests declined following a year in which schools statewide adopted online classes or a blend of online and in-person classes due to the pandemic. The federal education department waived its requirement that at least 95% of students take the tests. The state education department reported 92% of students were tested in math, 92% in ELA and 91% in science. “We are asking schools and districts to engage in a deeper exploration of their data to understand who tested and who did not test while considering local context and variables,” said Maria Cammack, deputy superintendent for the state department.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s attorney general filed lawsuits Friday against two counties that had adopted ordinances that sought to nullify new statewide gun safety laws and declared themselves “Second Amendment Sanctuaries.” In her lawsuits against Yamhill and Harney counties, Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum asked the circuit courts in those jurisdictions to declare the ordinances “invalid and void” because they conflict “with paramount state law.” “Gun safety laws exist to help keep guns out of dangerous hands and keep people safe. A county commission simply doesn’t get to override state law in this way,” Rosenblum said. The ordinances, passed by county commissioners in the two counties earlier this year, did not apply to local, federal or state firearms regulations that were in effect as of last February. But they did encompass a bill passed by the Legislature and signed by the governor June 1 that mandates the safe storage of guns and bans them from the Oregon State Capitol and Portland International Airport. The new law, which went into effect Sept. 24, also allows public school districts, community colleges and universities to set their own policy banning guns.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The deadline passed Friday for Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration to comply with a subpoena from a Republican-controlled state Senate committee pursuing what the GOP calls a “forensic investigation” of last year’s presidential election, as a state court sorted through three legal challenges. Wolf’s administration and Senate Republicans remained silent in the matter Friday. The court was expected to set up an expedited briefing schedule in one or all of the cases. Challengers, including Senate Democrats and state Attorney General Josh Shapiro, have sought broadly to block the subpoena, saying it is an abuse of legislative power, and in particular have challenged its request for the driver’s license numbers and partial Social Security numbers of roughly 9 million registered voters. Republicans maintain they are attempting to find and fix problems in last year’s presidential election and this year’s primary election. Democrats accuse them of helping perpetuate baseless claims that former President Donald Trump was cheated out of victory. It’s not clear whether Wolf’s administration can be forced to comply with a Senate subpoena. Democrat Joe Biden beat Trump in Pennsylvania by more than 80,000 votes, according to certified results.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Gov. Daniel McKee said Friday that the administration would try to find new assignments for health care workers employed by the state who are refusing a COVID-19 vaccination. The state’s health care worker vaccine mandate took effect Friday, the day after a federal judge tossed a constitutional challenge to the requirement filed by four people who work in the health care field. Workers who don’t comply are at risk of losing their state licenses and jobs. McKee said during an appearance on WPRO radio that there are a “small amount” of holdouts, but he doesn’t want to put people out of work. “We might be able to put them in another department,” he said. “We don’t want people to be without pay or without health care coverage, and we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that doesn’t happen.” He said he would also encourage hospitals and other health care organizations to take the same approach. He stood by the mandate. “We’ve made a policy that we feel as though is in the best interest of the safety of the people in the state of Rhode Island,” he told the station. Some unvaccinated workers will be allowed to work an extra 30 days beyond Friday’s deadline if their absence would compromise patient care.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHunting Island: A 950-foot-long fishing pier at one of the state’s most popular parks – partially destroyed by Hurricane Matthew and closed for five years – has reopened, restoring an important public access to the Atlantic Ocean. The pier at Hunting Island State Park, 15 miles east of Beaufort, is in effect a sidewalk that extends three football fields from shore. It offers visitors front-row access to great fishing, wildlife viewing and solitude. When Matthew made landfall in October 2016, it caused extensive damage to Hunting Island, including the pier, making it unsafe and prompting its closure. “We’ve been waiting for this to open,” said Brian Gilfedder of Beaufort, who was fishing on the pier with his wife, Mary Lou, on a recent sunny afternoon. The new pier is wonderful, the Gilfedders said, echoing others who were fishing or just sitting on a bench, drinking in the ocean, last week as feeding dolphins thrashed in the shallows nearby. “When it was closed, we couldn’t fish,” said John Freeman, a St. Helena Island resident who lives at Eddings Point and been fishing from the pier for years. From the pier, visitors can see waves rolling in from the Atlantic Ocean onto the barrier island. Also visible from the pier: Fripp Island and “Little Hunting Island,” the product of a hurricane that breached a lagoon, cutting the beach in two.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Friday that she will relaunch the state’s review of social study standards after it was mired in controversy. The Republican governor said she has “set aside” the standards proposed by the Department of Education and told the department to restart the process, saying everyone who has expressed concern about the process, including Native Americans, will be included in the do-over. “Our kids deserve to learn both America’s and South Dakota’s true and honest history, taught in a balanced context that doesn’t pit our children against each other on the basis of race, sex, or background,” Noem said in a statement. New standards are released every seven years. The governor’s plan calls for a new workgroup of people from across the state to develop the standards. Members of the previous working group – appointed by the Department of Education – said in August that they were caught by surprise on Friday when the department released a document with significant changes that cut references to Native American history and culture. Conservatives have also criticized the Department of Education’s proposed standards.\n\nTennessee\n\nMurfreesboro: About 1,450 people jailed illegally as minors can claim part of an $11 million class-action settlement, but fewer than 200 people have filed eligible claims. The lawsuit revealed the Rutherford County Juvenile Detention Center regularly locked up children for misdemeanor charges, including truancy, school fights and disobeying parents, plaintiffs’ attorney Kyle Mothershead said. The suit started by challenging the incarceration of children arrested at Hobgood Elementary School in Murfreesboro before expanding to include other youth jailed at the detention center on minor charges. Tennessee law strictly prohibits the pretrial incarceration of children unless they are charged with a violent felony, weapons offense or probation violation, according to the complaint filed in July 2017. Under the terms of a June 2021 settlement, eligible plaintiffs will get $4,800 per illegal incarceration and $1,000 per arrest. The original plaintiffs will receive a larger settlement. They include Kazmere Watts, who’ll receive about $31,000 after he was incarcerated for seven days for a school fight. He punched another student, but that student wasn’t seriously injured. “That was the first time I ever got into trouble,” said Watts, who was a freshman in 2014. “I wasn’t trying to hurt him. You’re a kid. You do foolish stuff.”\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A man seen on surveillance video wearing an American flag bandanna when he threw a Molotov cocktail into a county Democratic Party headquarters was arrested, a fire official said. Ryan Faircloth, 30, was booked Friday in the Travis County jail. He was charged with arson and possessing a prohibited weapon – the Molotov cocktail – according to Austin Fire arson investigator Capt. Jeffrey Deane. Investigators received multiple tips after releasing the surveillance video. One of the tips led to Faircloth’s social media. Information found online and other evidence led arson investigators and the FBI to make the arrest, Deane said at a news conference. “This person was not happy with the current political climate. He blamed this office and who they represent for a lot of the issues that he saw as problems with the country,” Deane said. “He was forthcoming and confessed to that.” Deane also said Faircloth left a note at the scene. He declined to give specifics on the contents of the letter but said the suspect alluded to possible plans for future attacks, which led investigators to act quickly to get him off the streets. It was unclear whether Faircloth had an attorney who could comment on his behalf.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints urged members Saturday to listen to the faith’s leaders when they seek “pure truth” and expressed gratitude for those who have followed church guidance on the pandemic, which includes getting COVID-19 shots. President Russell M. Nelson acknowledged at a church conference that the world is “still dealing with the ravages of COVID-19 and its variants.” And while he didn’t mention vaccines specifically, he thanked members for following the advice of church leaders, medical experts and government officials. The Utah-based faith has repeatedly encouraged its 16 million members worldwide to limit the spread by getting vaccines and wearing masks. “Contrary to the doubts of some, there really is such a thing as right and wrong. There really is absolute truth – eternal truth,” Nelson said from inside a mostly empty conference center in Salt Lake City. “One of the plagues of our day is that too few people know where to turn for truth. I can assure you that what you will hear today and tomorrow constitutes pure truth.” The two-day conference was taking place again without full attendance due to the pandemic, but for the first time in two years, leaders were back at the faith’s 20,000-seat conference center, with several hundred people watching in person.\n\nVermont\n\nCharlotte: A $6 million gift is going to the Vermont Land Trust to help diversify farm ownership, make farming more economically viable, and promote farming practices that contribute to clean water, healthy soil, and climate resilience, the High Meadows Fund, Vermont Land Trust and Vermont Community Foundation announced. A fund will be created with $2 million to expand land ownership and access among people who have been historically marginalized or oppressed based on their race or ethnicity, the groups said Thursday. According to the 2017 U.S. agriculture census, just 17 of the nearly 7,000 farms in Vermont are owned by Black people. “A gift of this kind could help all of us, particularly those who have been historically marginalized or oppressed,” Lydia Clemmons, president and executive director of the Clemmons Family Farm in Charlotte, said in a statement. A total of $4 million will go toward expanding the land trust’s work “to put hundreds of farmers onto the land operating successful businesses over the next 10 years,” the groups said. The Vermont Land Trust and a diverse group of farmers and community leaders will be holding discussions on how to design and increase the $2 million fund to expand land ownership and access, the groups said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A child under the age of 10 died of COVID-19 on Wednesday in eastern Virginia – the second fatal juvenile case of the week in the region, health officials confirmed. A health department spokesperson, Larry Hill, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch he could not provide any further information about the child, whose death occurred just two days after that of 10-year-old Teresa Sperry. According to officials, they are the 12th and 13th juvenile deaths in the state since the beginning of the pandemic. Sperry, who was from Suffolk, started exhibiting severe symptoms Sept. 26 but was sent home from Sentara Obici Hospital after a chest scan came back clear. The next day, Sperry stopped breathing, her family told The Virginian Pilot. She was taken back to Sentara Obici Hospital in Suffolk. She was then transferred to Children’s Hospital of The King’s Daughters in Norfolk, where she died. Sperry’s death was officially recorded Thursday by the Virginia Department of Health but was widely reported by local news outlets Wednesday. Sperry’s mother, Nicole, wrote on Facebook that her daughter was tasked with walking sick children in her class to the clinic at Hillpoint Elementary School. Nicole Sperry said she attributes her daughter’s death to parents allowing their sick children to attend school.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: State correctional facilities will no longer place people in custody in solitary confinement as a punishment, after state officials determined it is not effective. The Washington Department of Corrections made the announcement Thursday, saying the policy has been in effect for the past two weeks, The Seattle Times reports. Corrections Secretary Cheryl Strange called it a historic moment in the department and a “key step in becoming a human-centered organization by advancing proven correctional practices and methods that support individuals in change.” She also said the practice has not been effective at deterring negative behavior. The agency collected data on the practice of isolating incarcerated people for punishment. It found that of 2,500 incidents in which people were subjected to disciplinary segregation from Sept. 1, 2019, through Aug. 31, 2020, most – 57% – were disciplined for nonviolent infractions. People who received disciplinary segregation on average spent from 11 to 16 days in isolation. Many had already been subjected to administrative segregation, which involves isolating a person for the safety of themselves or others, while their disciplinary hearing was pending. Most received credit for that time served in administrative segregation – which will remain in effect, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Two fathers are suing state officials over a law that allows charter schools to open without the approval of local voters, the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. The lawsuit filed this past week in Kanawha County Circuit Court claims the law is unconstitutional and asks the judge to stop a newly created West Virginia Professional Charter School Board from authorizing any schools. The suit comes after Republican state lawmakers in March amended an earlier charter school law, making it easier for them to win approval. The amendments created the Professional Charter School Board, which can approve both online charters that operate statewide and brick-and-mortar charter schools operating in individual districts. Those schools can be approved even in counties where the local boards of education are opposed to them. The Professional Charter School Board is unelected. Instead, members are appointed by the governor and then confirmed or rejected by the state Senate. The four proposed board members are currently awaiting confirmation, even as they review applications to open new schools. The two fathers who are suing over the new law are both public school teachers and teachers’ union members. Defendants in the case include Gov. Jim Justice and the leaders of the House of Delegates and Senate.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The former state Supreme Court justice leading Assembly Republicans’ probe of the 2020 election has sent subpoenas to election officials in Wisconsin’s five largest cities and the state elections administrator demanding information about private donations used to run voting operations. Michael Gableman sent subpoenas to election officials in Milwaukee, Green Bay, Madison, Kenosha and Racine as well as Wisconsin Elections Commission Administrator Meagan Wolfe. The subpoenas seek documents related to grants from the Center for Tech and Civic Life, which gave more than $10 million to more than 200 Wisconsin communities last year to help cover election costs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of the money went to those five cities, drawing criticism from Republicans that the money was meant to boost turnout in Democratic areas. The subpoenas command the officials to appear before Gableman in Brookfield on Oct. 15 with their documents. A recount and court decisions have affirmed that President Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump in Wisconsin by almost 21,000 votes. Only four voters out of roughly 3 million who cast ballots have been charged with fraud.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Books about sex, LGBTQ issues and how to have a baby have public library employees in a deeply conservative city facing possible prosecution after angry local residents complained to police that the material is obscene and doesn’t belong in sections for children and teenagers. For weeks, Campbell County Public Library officials have been facing a local outcry over the books and for scheduling a magician who is transgender to perform for youngsters – an act canceled amid threats against the magician and library staff. The books are “This Book is Gay” by Juno Dawson, “How Do You Make a Baby” by Anna Fiske, “Doing It” by Hannah Witton, “Sex is a Funny Word” by Corey Silverberg, and “Dating and Sex: A Guide for the 21st Century Teen Boy” by Andrew P. Smiler, according to Susan Sisti, a local pastor who has been raising concerns about those and other books in the library. “It’s really easy to go into the library and look around a little bit and find a filthy book that should not even be in a public library,” said Sisti, pastor of Open Door Church in Gillette. Now, after a complaint filed with the sheriff’s office, prosecutors are reviewing the case. They will seek appointment of a special prosecutor to weigh in as well before deciding whether to pursue charges, County Attorney Mitchell Damsky said Friday.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/10/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/12/09/paula-cooper-executioner-within/93650408/", "title": "Indiana killer Paula Cooper: The Executioner Within", "text": "Robert King\n\nrobert.king@indystar.com\n\nThis 13-chapter story, told as a real-life novel, raises questions about race, justice, poverty and abuse.

In the front seat next to her was a digital recorder. And a gun.\n\nShe picked up the recorder and clicked it on.\n\n\"This is Paula Cooper.\"\n\nA short introduction, a simple statement. Even though nothing had been simple about being Paula Cooper.\n\n\"I believe today is the 26th; 5:15 will be my death.\"\n\nShe saw it clearly now, even in the pre-dawn gloom. She'd spent so much of her life searching for peace. But early on the morning of May 26, 2015, the end was in sight. She would reach it before sunrise.\n\nShe just had a few things left to say.\n\n—\n\n\"My sister. My queen. My everything.\"\n\nEvery morning she spoke to Rhonda. Why should this morning be different?\n\n—\n\n\"My mother, I felt like you didn't love me. You didn't care about me. You cut me off. You judged me. You didn't want me at your church. You hurt me about the man I loved. But I still love you.\"\n\nOthers had forgiven Paula. Yet she never felt it from the woman who mattered most.\n\n—\n\n\"To Monica, I'm so sorry. This pain that I feel every day. I walk around. I'm so miserable inside. I can't deal with this reality.\"\n\nMonica had been like a godmother in the fairy tales — someone to fill the void in the absence of a mother's love.\n\n—\n\n\"LeShon, I love you. … You showed me how to love.You showed me how to be a woman.\"\n\nLeShon looked beyond Paula's past. As if it had never occurred.\n\n—\n\n\"Michael, I'm so proud of you. And thank you for apologizing.\"\n\nMichael was her first love. She wanted a life with him; he wanted something else.\n\n—\n\n\"Meshia … you helped me when I was down, but I explained to you better than anybody how I feel.\"\n\nMeshia knew Paula's pain; she'd just been unable to stop it.\n\n—\n\nThese were the people Paula loved most. And to each one she had revealed part of herself, but never the whole. It was a select list from a life populated by characters: Her brutal father and her innocent victim; the judge who condemned her and the man who forgave her. There were friars and a bishop and a pope; jailers and journalists; people who were zealous to save her life and people eager to end it. There were too many to consider, really. And the sun would be up soon. She could wait no longer.\n\n\"Forgive me,\" she said in a recording that would soon become part of a police investigation. \"I must go now.\"\n\nHer coda finished, Paula stepped out of the car and into the shadows. She took a seat against a blighted tree. She felt the breeze in her hair. She felt the gun in her hand.\n\nShe was familiar with death. She'd seen it up close. She'd been condemned to it, resigned to it and reprieved from it. She had debated its merits and come to terms with it. Never had she stopped thinking of it.\n\nBut the question that would vex those she was leaving behind was maddeningly simple.\n\nWhy, after all she had endured and all she had survived, after all she had done and seemed capable of doing, had she chosen to die now?\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe garden spot in the woods — where her father grew vegetables and beat his daughters — was only an occasional venue of torture.\n\nMore often, for Paula Cooper, it happened at home.\n\nAs a child, Paula went to bed night after night next to her sister, listening to their parents argue, listening to her father make threats to come after them. Sometimes her mother would talk him out of it. Sometimes the man's wrath ebbed and they fell asleep. Sometimes they would be jarred awake at 3 o'clock in the morning, her father standing over them, ready to beat them.\n\nPaula believed there were other kinds of families out there. She watched the people on \"The Cosby Show,\" and they seemed to have such a nice family. But that was television. This was real. This was her family. And it looked as if there was no escaping it.\n\n—\n\nPaula was born in Chicago to Herman and Gloria Cooper on Aug. 25, 1969. Her sister, Rhonda, was three years older. Early on, the family lived in Michigan City, but by the time Paula was old enough for school they had moved to Gary.\n\nThe girls attended Bethune Grade School, a stone's throw from home. They went to nearby New Testament Baptist Church, where Paula sang in the choir and helped with the little children's Bible classes.\n\nBy the late 1970s, Gary's downward spiral from a midcentury boomtown was picking up speed. Manufacturing jobs were disappearing. White families were fleeing to the suburbs. Crime was rising. Like many black families still in the city, the Coopers were left in the wake of all this.\n\nGloria worked as a lab tech at a hospital. She had an assortment of health problems, none of them helped by the drugs and booze she added to the mixture.\n\n\"One day my mother be nice, the next day she be angry,\" Paula would tell Woman's Day, years later, when her story was national news. \"And the next day she be real strange-acting.\"\n\nHerman worked for U.S. Steel and worked construction, but his employment was sporadic. He had a girlfriend on the side and would be gone for long stretches. When he returned, chaos followed. Herman and Gloria were a volatile pair, drinking hard and arguing often, creating an atmosphere that was not just unstable, but dangerous.\n\nThe result, as Paula would say later, was that the girls had to \"fend for themselves.\" Sometimes, on evenings when Herman was gone and Gloria worked late, Paula took meals with the next-door neighbors, who allowed her to stick around and watch TV. Most of the time the girls had food and nice clothing. But, as Rhonda would say later, \"we hardly ever had any love.\"\n\nExcept from each other.\n\nIn the middle of all the darkness, Paula and Rhonda clung tightly to each other. They found moments to giggle together, play pranks together and share secrets.\n\nMore than just a sister, Rhonda became Paula's caregiver. Yet, through their early years, they were unaware of an important family secret: Rhonda was the child of a different father. It was a secret Gloria took great pains to hide, even though she allowed Rhonda's father, Ronald Williams, to visit occasionally. She said he was her uncle.\n\nBefore Herman came along, Ronald and Gloria were engaged. They broke it off, as Williams would later tell a courtroom, because he felt Gloria had a \"split personality.\" In short, he thought she was crazy.\n\nLiving with Herman Cooper didn't help.\n\nHerman beat everyone in the house. He beat Gloria in front of the girls. He beat the girls together. He beat them separately, sometimes in front of their mother. Sometimes Gloria seemed to egg on the violence.\n\n\"We did everything we was supposed to do, but it just wasn't never good enough for her,\" Paula told Woman's Day many years later. \"… She get mad at us and he'd beat us. 'Be a man,' she'd tell him. 'Take care of it,' she'd say. And he'd take care of it.\"\n\nThe girls grew up unable to remember a time before the abuse. When they were little, Paula would later say, Herman beat them \"for the things little kids do.\" When they were older, Rhonda remembered, he beat them for forgetting to take out the trash, for not doing the dishes and for skipping school.\n\nHerman employed an assortment of tools for punishment, whatever he could get his hands on — shoes, straps, sticks, a broom. Sometimes he used an electrical cord from an air conditioner.\n\n\"He'd triple it up and go to work,\" Paula would say later. \"It got to the point I was so used to it I didn't cry anymore.\"\n\nTo heighten the pain, Herman sometimes ordered the girls to remove their clothes before a beating. Questioned later, he denied that he ever abused the girls at all.\n\n—\n\nThis stark picture of Paula Cooper's childhood emerges from several sources; the courtroom testimony from Rhonda and her father; testimony from Dr. Frank Brogno, a clinical psychologist who discussed what he learned from examining Paula. Some of the glimpses into the darkness come from now-yellowed news clippings. Others come from anecdotes Paula shared with friends and loved ones and the few journalists she favored. Finally, there's the freshest source of insight into Paula's world — more than 100 personal letters she wrote to a treasured friend that were reviewed by IndyStar.\n\nTaken together, they amount to a catalog of horrors. Her father's beatings, Paula said, left her \"close to death so many times.\" With no apparent means of escape, she seemed to stop fearing death at all. \"I just cried,\" she wrote, \"until all my tears were gone away.\"\n\n—\n\nIn 1978, when Paula was 9, the tears were still flowing. Her parents separated, but it was often fuzzy as to when they were back together and when they were apart. Once, when Herman returned home to find the doors locked, he forced his way in. According to testimony Rhonda gave in court, Herman entered their home, beat up their mother and raped her in front of the two girls.\n\nThe incident seems to have been a tipping point. Not long after, Gloria began telling her daughters the world had nothing to offer them. Instead, she said, they'd all be better off going to heaven. On this point, Rhonda would say later, Gloria began pressuring her daughters. Eventually, the girls came to believe, like their mother, they had nothing to live for.\n\nGloria phoned Ronald Williams, Rhonda's father and steady friend. It was late. She'd been drinking and taking pills. She was crying. Herman had been giving her problems, she said, and things weren't good at work.\n\nShe was thinking of killing herself.\n\nWilliams had heard this kind of talk from Gloria before. Always, he had been able to console her, to talk her back from the precipice. He reminded her that she had Paula and Rhonda to think about. What would happen to them? His question made Gloria think. But only for an hour.\n\nShe called Williams back. Between her tears and her wailing, Gloria said: \"I finally found out what I'm going to do with the kids.\"\n\nWilliams was alarmed. He demanded to know what she meant.\n\n\"I'm going to take them with me,\" she replied. \"I'm going to let you speak to your daughter and Paula for the last time.\"\n\nThe girls took the phone in turns. They were crying, too. Rhonda said they were going to heaven with their mother.\n\n\"Don't do nothing drastic,\" Williams told them. \"Let me speak to your mother, OK.\"\n\nThe phone went dead.\n\nWilliams panicked. Gloria and the girls had recently moved. She hadn't shared their new address. He didn't know where to find them, how to stop her.\n\nHe called the operator and asked for his last call to be traced; it was no good. He called Gary police. Without an address, they could do nothing.\n\nThere was nothing anyone could do. Williams waited. For three weeks, he waited. He feared what had become of them.\n\nHad Gloria killed them all?\n\n—\n\nAfter she hung up the phone, Gloria decided not to act right away; she'd wait until morning. When she awoke, Gloria took the girls out to the car in the garage. She put them in the back seat and started the engine. The garage door remained closed.\n\nFrom there, accounts differ. Williams testified that a friend told him neighbors noticed something and called the fire department. Rhonda testified that, as the fumes gathered, the girls drifted off to sleep. They thought they were going to heaven; instead, they woke up in bed. How they got there isn't clear. Rhonda said Gloria had changed her mind. When the girls awoke, she said, their mother was coughing on the lawn.\n\nFrom then on, Williams tried to coax Gloria into letting him have the girls. Rhonda was his daughter, and he was fond of Paula, too. Gloria would have none of it.\n\n\"I'd rather see them both dead,\" she said.\n\n—\n\nThe girls survived their first brush with death. But Paula and her sister were being shaped in a world without hope. And now their mother had planted a seed: The ultimate escape was death.\n\nRhonda looked around at this nihilist world and began seeking a way out. Several times she tried to run. Soon, she began taking Paula with her. \"I couldn't take it no more in that house,\" she would say, \"and I didn't want her to, either.\"\n\nBy 1982, when both girls were teenagers, they made an unsuccessful attempt to run and were sent — together — to the Thelma Marshall Children's Home in Gary. Within a short time, they were returned to the Coopers. For Paula, it was the beginning of a cycle — of running and being returned home. For Rhonda, that cycle ended only when she learned Ronald Williams was her biological father. At her first opportunity, she left the Coopers to live with him.\n\nIf the move helped Rhonda, it had grievous consequences for Paula, then 13. Her sister had been the most stable person in her home. Now she was gone. Paula came to believe her parents blamed her for Rhonda's departure. Now that her father's anger had one less target, Paula's beatings grew more frequent and more brutal. Even as her parents divorced, Herman never quite left the picture. And his handiwork began to show.\n\nAt school, Paula revealed to an administrator a rash of injuries — a bruise on her thigh, a welt on her arm, a rug burn on her elbow.\n\nWhen a welfare caseworker visited the Cooper home, Herman and Gloria cursed at her. They blamed Paula's problems on interference from the courts, from the school psychologist and from the welfare department itself. When the caseworker recommended family counseling, Gloria said she'd rather go to jail.\n\nAt various times, Gloria and Herman seemed to vacillate between wanting Paula and considering her a curse. Paula began running away on her own. After one attempt, welfare officials wanted to send Paula home, but her mother objected. If Paula returned, Gloria vowed to leave.\n\nOn another occasion, when Rhonda made a rare visit to spend a weekend with Paula and her mother, arguments ensued and Williams returned for Rhonda. He couldn't find her there, but he found Paula. She was crying so loudly he heard her without going in. Gloria, who stood in front of the house fuming about Paula, simply said: \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\"\n\nPaula emerged and, seeing Williams, ran to him and jumped into his arms. He asked her if her mother would really hurt her.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWilliams told her to get in the car. Gloria charged out toward them and began to threaten Paula. \"I'm going to kill you and if I don't (Herman) will.\"\n\nWilliams considered it serious business to take Paula. He lived in Illinois and assumed it would be a crime to take a child across the state line without permission of the parents. He took her anyway. Gloria and other family members threatened to phone the police.\n\nAt his home, Williams asked Paula what she wanted to do. They talked about the logistics of her staying with him without her mother's permission. It would be impossible for her to go to school. Then there was the trouble Williams might face. With tears, Paula looked at Williams and said, \"It's best for me to go home … I don't want to get you in no trouble.\" Paula's respite lasted only a few hours.\n\nEven though he wasn't keeping Paula, Williams couldn't fathom returning her home. Instead, he just let her walk away. She was young, no more than 13, but Williams believed she was safer on the streets of Chicago than at home. Under scrutiny for making such a choice, Williams later told a courtroom he thought Paula was in danger there. \"I would rather see her in the street as a slut than for her mother to blow her brains out.\"\n\nFor several days, Paula survived on her own. Inevitably, she wound up back home.\n\n—\n\nBy 1983, when Paula turned 14, she stayed away from home as much as possible. She was smoking cigarettes and drinking. She smoked marijuana almost daily. Tall, but heavy, she took speed to lose weight. She tried cocaine. She skipped school routinely. She was sexually active. Years later, she would warn others against making similar choices. But for the moment, it was her life.\n\nAnd it was a rootless life. She spent six months at a children's home in Mishawaka and three months in a juvenile detention center. She was removed from one home after only six days after she threatened a staff member and another resident — with a knife.\n\nWith each new address, Paula changed schools. She attended four high schools without ever finishing the 10th grade. Her schoolwork, decent at first, nosedived. She called a teacher \"crazy,\" resulting in a suspension. She struggled to keep friends. She developed a reputation as a bully. All the while, Paula struggled to wake up in the mornings. When she was evaluated for the problem, a doctor at a local hospital asked if she ever thought of killing herself.\n\n\"Yes,\" she replied.\n\nFor that answer, she was sent to a mental hospital. Released four days later, she returned home.\n\n\"I told people I needed help and to talk, but all they did was move me from home to home,\" Paula would write a few years later. \"I didn't care about life or trouble or consequences at all.\"\n\n—\n\nPerhaps the pinnacle of Paula's abuse came, ironically, after her father visited Gary police seeking advice on how to deal with a wayward child. Paula was 14, and Herman Cooper couldn't keep her reined in. Frustrated, he asked the police what he should do with her. It was a family matter, they said; he should do what he thought was right.\n\nFor Herman Cooper, that meant one thing: another beating. But for what he had in mind this time, he'd need some privacy. He took Paula to a woody patch near a spot where he kept a garden. Paula had been there before; so had Rhonda.\n\n\"If you scream where I take you,\" he told Paula, \"no one will hear you.\"\n\nSeveral times in her life, Paula thought her father was going to beat her to death. This was one of them. \"He just kept beating me and beating me,\" she would tell the clinical psychologist, for what seemed like half an hour. Instead of the cord or a broom or a stick, this time Herman beat her with his bare hands.\n\nWhen he was done, Herman put Paula in the car to take her home. But as they drove through the darkening streets of Gary, Paula knew she couldn't go back there. Not when the possibility of more punishment lay ahead in the Cooper house of horrors.\n\nAs Herman pulled the car up to the house, Paula jumped out and took off running into the night. Running and screaming. Herman gave chase, but porch lights began to click on. Up and down the street, neighbors stepped out to investigate the commotion. The neighbors had seen this show before; it never seemed to end. This time, though, Herman retreated.\n\nPaula ran until she wound up where the night had begun — at the police station. She told officers there about the beating, told them she couldn't go home. At least not while Herman was around. The state pulled her away from the Coopers. It isn't clear from the record where she was placed. But soon, she was sent back home.\n\n—\n\nIn the summer of 1984, when Paula turned 15, she felt as lonely as ever.\n\nAdrift, Paula briefly took up with a guy she hoped might offer her a haven. Later, she would tell others he was a rough character who dealt drugs and treated her poorly. The one thing he did for Paula was leave her pregnant.\n\nMany teenage girls would consider pregnancy a tragedy; Paula saw it as a blessing. She had almost forgotten how to care about anyone. She wanted a family, wanted someone to belong to. The child growing inside her represented someone she could love, someone who would love her in return.\n\nAnd then it was gone.\n\nGloria had been dead set against the pregnancy; she wanted Paula to end it. Paula refused and ran off — perhaps to seek help from a woman she knew in Chicago. Her mother tracked her down and, as Paula would write years later in a letter and tell friends, forced her to have an abortion.\n\nPaula was several months into the pregnancy; the procedure nearly killed her. \"She took something that would have completed my life,\" Paula would write later, \"and after that I felt I had no one.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nRuth Pelke was gentle, an old woman with silvery hair and horn-rimmed glasses. As her stepson Robert and his wife pleaded for her to leave Gary, she listened.\n\nRobert pledged to do everything necessary to make her house ready for sale — the legal stuff, the touch-up jobs, whatever. She listened as they talked to her about how dangerous her neighborhood had become.\n\nBut Ruth didn't really need reminding. Her Glen Park neighborhood was still one of the better places to live in Gary, although that wasn't saying much, given the city's downward lurch. There were abandoned houses now. There were burglaries. Her own home had been hit five times in recent years, including when her husband, Oscar, was still alive. Now, at 78, she was widowed and alone, and things were only getting worse. But Ruth had been in Glen Park for 41 years; it was home. She still had some good neighbors. Just as important, she had a mission.\n\nFor decades, she'd opened her home and heart to the neighborhood children. She'd taught them the Bible using felt cutouts of Bible characters that she stuck to a flannel board. She'd given the kids candy when they memorized Scripture. She'd driven them to church. She believed these were children who needed hope, and they could find it in Jesus. No, she finally said that night after her stepson's plea — she wouldn't be leaving the home in her neighborhood.\n\n\"I'll stay here until I go there,\" she said.\n\nRuth Pelke was pointing a finger to heaven.\n\n—\n\nThe next day, Tuesday, May 14, 1985, Ruth's doorbell rang.\n\nShe answered it and found three teenage girls standing on her porch. She didn't recognize them, but she opened her door. One of the girls said, \"My auntie would like to know about Bible classes. When do y'all hold them?\"\n\nRuth wasn't up to teaching anymore, but she wanted to help the girls. \"Come back on Saturday,\" she said. And closed the door.\n\n—\n\nThe girls — Karen Corder, Denise Thomas and Paula Cooper — walked back across the alley. Sitting on a porch, April Beverly was waiting.\n\nThe foursome — all ninth- and 10th-graders at Lew Wallace High School — left school at lunchtime that afternoon with no intention of going back. The girls walked the 10 blocks or so to an arcade near 45th and Broadway where they spent what little money they had on games and candy. When their money was gone, they headed back to the house where April was staying with her sister.\n\nThey were a ragtag bunch.\n\nAt 16, Karen Corder — known to her friends as \"Pooky\" — was the oldest. More than two years earlier, she'd given birth to a baby boy whom she'd delivered in a toilet. She'd managed to keep the pregnancy secret from her parents until the child was born, according to court records.\n\nAt 15, April Beverly was seven months pregnant. She was part of a divided family with 11 children, and she bounced between two homes, her father's and her sister's. Her mother was dead, her father had remarried. On occasion, April benefited from the kindness of the old lady across the alley. She'd listened to Ruth Pelke's Bible lessons. And the old woman had brought food over to April and her siblings when she was concerned they might be hungry.\n\nAt 14, Denise Thomas was the youngest of the four and the smallest. The others were mature young women — at different places on the spectrum of teen motherhood. Denise still looked very much like a little girl. In the context of this group, some would later describe her as a tag-along.\n\nAnd, of course, there was Paula Cooper. At 15, she was only months removed from an unwanted abortion that had nearly killed her. She was tall, somewhat heavy and had the bearing of a girl beyond her years. She would be described as the \"prime mover\" of the quartet — the ringleader. But it was a label she'd never cop to.\n\n—\n\nTo date, the sum total of their illicit behavior was strictly small-time. Karen had tried her hand at shoplifting. Paula, Karen and April had pulled off a burglary a few days before that netted them $90. Mostly, the girls were truants. And on this Tuesday afternoon away from school, their immediate priority was to raise some money so they could go back to the arcade.\n\nTheir first attempt was a harebrained scheme April cooked up to get some cash from a woman up the street. All four girls had gone to the woman's door. April introduced Denise, the small one, as her daughter. April claimed the woman's husband had taken $20 from Denise and they'd come to collect it. For added zest, April threw in this detail: The woman's husband had been naked when he stepped into the street to take Denise's money.\n\nThe woman didn't go for it.\n\nAfter that failure, April turned her focus to Ruth Pelke. She seemed to recall the lady keeping a jar of $2 bills. She thought the woman might even have some jewelry. The question was how to get to it all.\n\nAs they sat on the porch at her sister's house, April asked Paula to come inside — she might know where there was a gun. For the girls, a gun crime would be a considerable step up the criminal ladder. But the gun wasn't where April thought it was; she couldn't find it. Then it occurred to April: Something else might do.\n\n\"I have a knife you could scare the lady with,\" she said.\n\nSoon, April produced a 12-inch butcher knife. It was sharp and had a curving blade that graduated to a fine point. It was a cooking tool, but also a potentially lethal instrument. Paula took the knife and hid it in her light jacket. Out on the porch, she and April explained to the other girls: This was their new weapon of choice. And Karen came up with another approach to getting inside the old lady's home: They would ask her to write down the time and place where the Bible classes would be.\n\nIn all this planning, Paula and the other girls would forever swear, the subject of killing the old woman never came up. The most they would admit, according to Corder, was that they'd knock out the woman and rob her. Still, the reality of what they were planning — to con their way into her house, pull a knife and take the old woman's valuables — was fraught with danger.\n\nAs their scheme unfolded, April stayed back again, resting on her sister's porch; she didn't want the old woman to recognize her. Karen, Paula and Denise crossed the alley.\n\nThey rang the bell, and soon Ruth Pelke appeared at the door. This time, when she answered, Karen said: \"My auntie wants to know where the Bible classes are held at. Could you write it down for me?\"\n\nRuth said she no longer taught the classes, but she knew of a lady. \"I'll look up her telephone number for you.\" She invited the girls to come in. And she turned to walk to the desk on the far side of the room.\n\n—\n\nRuth Pelke looked for all the world like the kindly grandmother drawn up in children's books. She was also a woman whose Christian faith was essential to who she was. She went to church on Wednesday nights and twice on Sundays. She visited church members who were too old or too sick to get out. She sang in the choir. She hosted missionaries in her home on their trips back from foreign lands. She took her own missionary journeys, going deeper into the heart of Gary to share her faith with children.\n\nWhat followed — recorded in statements to police, testified to in court, reported in newspaper accounts and, in brief instances, described in letters Paula would write years later — was a scene that would shock Northwest Indiana and the rest of the state.\n\nAs Ruth Pelke crossed her living room to the desk where she kept phone numbers, she felt a pair of arms wrap around her neck.\n\nPaula had put her jacket on the couch and run up on Ruth, grabbing her from behind. For a moment, the teenager and the old woman struggled. Ruth still tended a garden and did a little work outside the house to keep fit, but she was in no shape for a chunky 15-year-old girl who now had her in a headlock.\n\nPaula threw Ruth to the floor.\n\nOn a table nearby sat an item some would describe as a vase but others likened more to a triangular snow globe. One of the girls picked it up and hit Ruth Pelke over the head. Prosecutors would allege it was Denise Thomas; Paula took the blame.\n\nPaula demanded to know where Ruth kept her valuables. She threatened to cut her with the knife. \"Give me the money, bitch,\" she said.\n\nRuth looked up and said simply: \"You aren't going to kill me.\" She began hollering for help. Paula's anger rose now. Then she looked at Ruth's head. Blood was streaming from the place where she'd been hit with the vase. Paula saw the blood and reacted in a way she would struggle to explain for the rest of her life.\n\nTo police investigators, she would say she entered \"a blackout stage.\"\n\nTo a judge, she would say, \"Something clicked in on me.\"\n\nTo a psychologist, she said the sight of the blood altered her perception of whom she was attacking: \"I saw somebody else inside of that body.\"\n\nSeveral friends and supporters who heard similar explanations from Paula concluded that, in this moment, Paula no longer saw the meek and mild Bible teacher in front of her. They believed Paula saw the woman who watched her suffer so many beatings and did nothing to stop them, the woman who took away the baby she'd wanted to love. They were convinced that, in the defenseless woman pinned to the floor, Paula saw her mother.\n\nWhatever she saw, Paula reached for the knife. She grabbed it by the handle and began slashing. She sliced open the old woman's cheek. She stabbed at her head, without deep penetration. Ruth fell back, flat on the floor. And Paula went to work, cutting her arms and legs.\n\nThe other girls stood by in disbelief.\n\nKaren Corder, the oldest, told Paula to stop.\n\nDenise Thomas, the youngest, cried and screamed for Paula to quit. Later, she would claim she yelled, \"I'm getting out of here,\" only to be met with a withering threat from Paula: \"Leave and you're dead.\"\n\nPaula's barrage was relentless. She stabbed the old woman in the belly and, finally, thrust the blade deep into the side of Ruth's chest. With that, Paula stopped; she pulled back from the carnage.\n\n\"I can't take it no more,\" she said.\n\nPaula looked at Denise; she told her to come hold the knife. But Denise refused. She looked at Karen, communicating the same message. Karen knelt beside the wounded woman. The blade remained lodged in her chest. And Karen held it in place.\n\nApril Beverly, who concocted the robbery scheme, initially held back. After the others went inside, she had come up to Ruth's porch and acted as lookout. Now she entered the house. The old woman was lying on her back, her dress covered in blood, her arms and legs still moving. Karen, she noticed, held the knife as it protruded from the woman's side. To April, it appeared that Karen wasn't just holding it: She was wiggling the knife back and forth. Out of some morbid curiosity, she would tell police later, Karen pushed the blade farther into the hole to see how deep it would go. At one point, she concluded, \"The bitch won't die.\"\n\nKaren estimated she held the knife in Ruth Pelke's side for upwards of 15 minutes; Paula thought it closer to 30.\n\nRuth Pelke moaned through most of this. The old woman's torn and tortured face was too much for the girls to bear. One of them went to the bathroom and got a towel to cover Ruth's face — and try to smother the last breaths of life from her. Paula and Denise said it was Karen; Karen said it was Paula.\n\nIn her dying moments, Ruth Pelke managed to share a few last words. Denise heard her saying the Lord's Prayer.\n\n\"Our Father, which art in heaven …\"\n\nPaula had stalked in and out of the room, and the last words she heard from Ruth were something else. Words that would haunt her the rest of her life.\n\n\"If you kill me,\" she heard Ruth say, \"you will be sorry.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula and Denise began tearing the house apart, rifling through drawers, ripping items off shelves and upending furniture.\n\nFor Paula, it was a mad search for some reward for the awful business she'd just concluded. There had to be some money somewhere. Maybe some jewelry. But as she continued her desperate search, a nervousness began to grow inside her. Whether it was regret for the killing or the chilling final words of her victim, she felt uneasy. And she didn't like it. As they were going through the upstairs rooms, Paula tried to pull herself away. But the only place to go was back downstairs, where the source of her angst lay dead on the floor. She resumed the treasure hunt and soon managed to turn up some cash — all of $10. She came across a key and thought it might start the old woman's Plymouth in the garage. She ran out to give it a try. Nothing.\n\nApril joined in the search and quickly turned up another key. This time when Paula tried it, the engine stirred to life. April went inside to fetch the other girls.\n\nBy then, Karen and Denise were alone with Ruth Pelke's body. Karen had watched the rise and fall of the old woman's chest until it grew shallower. Finally, it stopped. Maybe April sensed some new panic; she sternly warned the other girls: \"If you tell anyone, I'll kill you.\"\n\nThe girls had spent roughly an hour in the old woman's house. They hadn't found a jar of $2 bills. They hadn't found a trove of jewelry. But it was time to go. Someone might come looking. Before they could leave, Karen grabbed one last item.\n\nShe knelt down again beside Ruth. The butcher knife was planted firmly in the left side of her chest, just below her breast. Karen grabbed the handle. She pulled it out. As they headed out to the car, Karen carried the knife at her side. She climbed into the back of the car and dropped it to the floor. The blade was still coated in blood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper was 15. She was too young to drive. But with her three accomplices as passengers, she managed to steer Ruth's car out of the neighborhood and onto 45th Avenue. They were just down the street from Lew Wallace High School. School was out now and, almost immediately, they saw a classmate walking along the street. Almost reflexively, they waved to Beverly Byndum. And Beverly waved back.\n\nThis was the paradox they now faced. They were teenagers in possession of a car, the apex of adolescence. Yet they had acquired it in the most horrific way imaginable. Years later, Paula would say things just \"got out of control.\" But here she was — a killer. Now that the deed was done, now that they had a few bucks, Paula and the others seemed in no mood to enjoy it.\n\nBefore they arrived at the video arcade, Karen asked Paula to let her out of the car; she wanted to go back to April's house. Paula let her go, but not before asking her to perform a little task: Go back to the old lady's house and get the jacket Paula had left inside.\n\nNext, Denise said she wanted to go home. She asked Paula to let her out at a convenience store and she would make her way from there.\n\nWhen Paula and April pulled up to Candyland Arcade, they were alone. For a few minutes, they just sat there, talking about what they'd done. April hadn't witnessed everything that went on inside the house. It's not clear how many of the missing details Paula shared.\n\nPaula said she needed to use the restroom, and she ventured into the arcade. When she returned, five girls from school were standing around the car. One of them was Beverly Byndum, whom they had passed on the street. Her sister, Latesha, asked where they had come by the car. Paula said it was her sister's.\n\nWithin minutes, Karen walked up to the arcade out of breath, as if she had been running to catch up with the crew. Wherever she had been, she hadn't stayed long. Paula pulled her aside and asked if she'd gone back to the house, if she'd picked up the jacket. No, Karen replied. It was probably the last place on Earth she wanted to go. And she didn't hang around long enough to talk further about it. In a few minutes, she caught a bus for home.\n\nWhether Paula remembered it or not, she had left more than her jacket in the house. Inside one of its pockets was a newly filled prescription for birth control pills — her pills. She had picked them up earlier that morning before school. It was just one of the clues she had left for investigators to find.\n\nPaula and April looked around at the girls and asked if anyone wanted a ride home. Eagerly, their friends piled into the Plymouth. Latesha Byndum was among those who jumped into the back. As she did, she felt her foot brush across something on the floor. She reached down to pick it up. It was a knife. And there was blood on it. There was also blood on her shoe. Latesha looked at Paula and April in the front seat and asked, \"What you all do? Just kill somebody?\"\n\nThe girls looked back at Latesha.\n\nNo, they replied.\n\nAnd, in a response that would reverberate across the community, Paula and April laughed.\n\n—\n\nPaula and April dropped off their passengers at various addresses around Gary. But details about where and how they spent their next two days are choppy and imprecise.\n\nProsecutors would characterize their time in the car as a joy ride. But from this point on, Paula and April seemed to have a different sense of what to do next.\n\nApril wanted to go to a park in Hammond; she wanted to see her brother Tony; she wanted to see her boyfriend. When she found $40 in Ruth Pelke's glove box, she wanted to spend it. When they picked up April's boyfriend and he brought some alcohol, she drank it.\n\nPaula wanted to go to a girl's home where she had lived for a time; she wanted to pick up some friends there. But she quickly decided she and April needed some time to focus on what to do next. When April found the money, Paula thought they should save it for gas. While April got drunk, Paula wanted nothing to drink. She was too nervous.\n\nMost symbolic of their division, perhaps, is what happened to the money from Ruth's glove box. The girls wrestled over it, and one of the $20 bills was torn. Paula gave up the fight. April could keep the money and do with it what she wanted.\n\n—\n\nOn Wednesday morning, the day after the crime, Robert Pelke phoned Ruth's house to check up on her. She didn't pick up the phone, and he decided to check on her in person. Just three days before, he and a large portion of the extended Pelke family had taken Ruth out for a Mother's Day dinner. Just two days earlier, Robert and his wife had pushed Ruth to think about selling her house and leaving Gary. Robert rang the doorbell, with no idea how prescient that conversation had been.\n\nThere was no answer, so Robert opened the mail slot on the door and called inside. There was only silence. But through the mail slot, something caught Robert's eye: The dining room was torn apart. He went to fetch a spare key Ruth kept hidden outside. Looking around the place, he noticed Ruth's car was missing from the garage, and he assumed Ruth must be gone, too.\n\nHe found the key, unlocked the door and stepped into the house. The place appeared to have been ransacked. Pictures that had adorned the walls were now scattered about the floor. Cushions from the couch had been pulled up and cast about. And then his eyes turned to the dining room floor.\n\nThe cloaked figure of a woman lay there motionless. Her dress was caked in blood. Her arms were slashed. A towel masked her face.\n\nRobert knelt down next to her. He pulled the towel away and called her name. Still, there was no movement. He touched her, and the body was cold. He knew she was dead.\n\nRobert got up and went for the phone. In an age when every phone was a landline, Ruth's had been ripped from its place on the wall. He stepped outside and began going door to door, looking for someone who would let him use their phone. But at house after house, he found nobody. Finally, Robert looked farther up the street and saw a man and a woman getting out of a car. He approached them and asked them to call the police.\n\nHis stepmother had been murdered.\n\n—\n\nRobert's son, Bill Pelke, arrived home just after 3 o'clock from his shift at Bethlehem Steel and soon received a phone call. It was one of his uncles. Nana, he said, was dead.\n\nNana was the term of endearment everyone in the family used for Ruth. Bill had grown up listening to her Bible stories. He'd loved her flannel board tales of the three men in the fiery furnace, of Noah and the ark and his favorite — Joseph and the coat of many colors.\n\nEven as a 37-year-old man, he still loved to go to Nana's house for the holidays, to warm himself beside her fireplace and congregate there with the rest of the family. His grandfather had passed almost two years before, but Nana was still a magnet. She could still bring the family together. And now, suddenly, she was gone.\n\nAt such moments of shock, the brain's processor goes into hyperdrive. And some key facts rushed through Bill's head: Nana had been 78; she was the oldest Pelke; she'd had a good life; it must have been her time. But that instant of comfort evaporated quickly. He sensed something else in his uncle's voice that was borne out in his next words: There'd been a break-in at Nana's house. He didn't know if there was a connection.\n\nBill hung up and turned on the television, wondering if there might be some news about it. Sure enough, his father appeared on camera. He was saying something about it being a terrible murder. For Bill, everything else was a blur; he had to go. He had to be with his family.\n\nAs it turned out, Ruth Pelke had been dead for a full day.\n\n—\n\nBy that spring of 1985, crime was a painful reality in Gary. Its murder rate was among the highest in the country. It was on its way to becoming the murder capital of the United States.\n\nGary was a city in decline; poverty was growing like a cancer. But the violence was being spread through an influx of gangs with names such as The Family and the Black Gangster Disciples.\n\nYet as accustomed to crime as the city had become, the murder of Ruth Pelke shocked and angered people in a whole new way. There was the innocence of Ruth herself — the elderly Bible teacher. As one observer put it, she was a grandma to the neighborhood. The killing's effect also might have been amplified because it happened in Glen Park, which a prosecutor later described as a \"last bastion\" of the white population in a city from which white residents had disappeared.\n\nOn the day after the discovery of Ruth's body, The Post-Tribune in Gary devoted two front-page columns to the story: \"Bible teacher, 77, murdered in her home.\" It had her age wrong, but the dominant image on the page was a picture of Ruth — silver-haired and smiling behind her horn-rimmed glasses from another era.\n\nThe newspaper reported that neighborhood children \"were visibly upset and shaken by the murder.\" They spoke of Pelke as \"meek and mild,\" serving cookies during summer Bible classes and giving out boxes of candy to the children who memorized Scripture.\n\nAs for who might be responsible, the initial story carried some important nuggets: Police were searching for a 15-year-old girl who'd been seen driving Pelke's blue Plymouth. They weren't releasing her name, but the girl was a student at Lew Wallace High and lived in Gary's Marshalltown neighborhood.\n\n—\n\nPaula Cooper lived in Marshalltown.\n\nAs they combed through Ruth's house, police found the jacket with the prescription in the pocket. Eyewitnesses had seen Paula and the other girls in a car that matched the description of Ruth's missing Plymouth. And on the day Ruth's body was discovered, Gloria Cooper phoned police to report her 15-year-old daughter missing; she'd been missing since the day before.\n\nThe ink was barely dry on the newspaper stories when Karen Corder, walking around school on Thursday, two days after the crime, began looking for someone on whom she could unload her conscience. She had opted out of the joy ride and gone home and had a couple of restless nights' sleep. She found a gym teacher who'd been nice to her and said they needed to talk; she'd witnessed a murder. Soon, police were at the school. They took Karen and Denise into custody. And Karen was telling her story about the crime.\n\nIn the two days since the killing, Paula and April — with April's brother, Tony — had driven aimlessly from Gary to Hammond and to various parts of Chicago's South Side. They'd had no real sense of direction.\n\nTony pressed on in Ruth's Plymouth until the gas needle dropped well below empty. Then he pushed it some more. Finally, the car died. Their money gone, they found a phone and called April's sister. Thursday night, with the police dragnet closing around them, she took the girls to see the Gary police.\n\n—\n\nDetective William Kennedy Jr. had been looking for Paula Cooper and April Beverly for the better part of two days. When his phone rang around midnight, the news was good: They'd turned themselves in.\n\nIn addition to being a cop, Kennedy worked security at Lew Wallace High School. He'd seen Paula Cooper walking the halls. He never knew her name, but they'd exchanged hellos. Now, he was tidying up the loose ends of a case for murder against her.\n\nWhen he arrived at the station, Paula's parents were waiting. Kennedy asked Herman and Gloria Cooper if Paula could make a formal statement about the crime. Herman, speaking for everyone, declined. They were interested in talking to a lawyer, and he seemed annoyed at the article in the morning paper, which he felt pointed a finger at Paula even if it didn't name her.\n\nThe Coopers met briefly with Paula, then returned to the waiting room. Soon, Rhonda arrived at the station. She'd read the papers. She knew Paula was in jail. And she was upset. She wanted to see her sister.\n\nGloria was OK with that but urged her to persuade Paula to talk about what she'd done. When the police wouldn't let Rhonda see her sister without a parent, Gloria agreed to go with Rhonda.\n\nAfter so many years of turmoil and strife, Gloria and her two daughters were together again — for a moment alone in a police interrogation room. What they said isn't clear. But when Kennedy, the detective, rejoined them, Gloria gave Paula a nudge.\n\n\"Say something,\" she said.\n\nPaula hesitated. She said she didn't want anyone looking at her. So Kennedy turned 45 degrees and looked at a wall. Paula began to speak. She kept speaking for 15 minutes. She laid out the essential elements of Ruth Pelke's murder, described the girls' desire for money and a car, described how they came up with the Bible class as their way in. She described how she got the knife and stabbed the old woman more times than she could remember. She talked about the aftermath, when they took the car and gave rides to their friends. At one point, according to the account the detective would later make from his \"mental notes,\" Gloria Cooper asked Paula in front of the detective: Were you and Karen basically responsible for the lady's death?\n\nPaula's answer: \"Yeah, you could say that.\"\n\nWhen Paula was done, Kennedy left the room. Her mother and her sister left, too. As Paula stood alone in the interrogation room, April Beverly was giving a statement in a room nearby. When Kennedy returned to Paula, she was newly animated. She began unloading a rapid-fire addendum to her confession to the detective.\n\n\"April is lying. She's lying on me, so I'm going to tell you where the murder weapon is. It's at the McDonald's in Hammond on Calumet Avenue, next to the police station. Her brother threw it out the car right by the drive-thru window side. It was by a tree right there.\"\n\nFor Paula, this was the start of one of the great grievances of her life — her claim that the other girls lied. A few details aside, their stories largely matched up. But in the discrepancies, Paula saw injustice. And correcting the narrative to fit her exact version of the truth would become an obsession.\n\nThe legal ramifications of what she'd shared, in her two statements, were that Paula had essentially confessed to the key elements of the murder. She had gift-wrapped a case for the authorities. She also had put herself in the cross hairs of a zealous prosecutor. She had no idea just how precarious her own life had become.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nJack Crawford — with a swooping, blow-dried haircut that gave him an appearance not unlike the televangelists of the era — came before a bank of reporters with material certain to make a splash.\n\nA rising star in Indiana's Democratic Party, Crawford had swept into the Lake County prosecutor's job years before, having pledged to get tough on crime. Since then, he had pursued the death penalty more than any other prosecutor in the state. In the first five months of 1985, he'd already won four death penalty convictions.\n\nNow, flanked by a pair of cops, Crawford came before the gathered media with an announcement sure to make headlines: For the first time in Lake County, his office was charging four girls with murder. He would seek the death penalty against the oldest — 16-year-old Karen Corder — and if the other girls were moved out of juvenile court, he'd likely seek death for them, too.\n\n\"I've been a prosecutor for seven years,\" Crawford told the media, \"and we've never had a case like this before.\"\n\nAs zealous as he was, Crawford privately acknowledged that same day that his chance for death sentences had already taken a big hit. That's because the clerk's office announced that the judge handling the Ruth Pelke cases was Superior Court Judge James C. Kimbrough Jr.\n\nKimbrough was a former public defender and NAACP lawyer who'd grown up in the civil rights heartland of Selma, Ala. More important than all of that, everyone around the courts — from prosecutors and public defenders to reporters and clerks — knew Kimbrough hated the death penalty. Hated it for its unfairness. Hated it for its inability to deter crime. And in a county where other judges had shown themselves willing to brandish the ultimate weapon, Kimbrough hadn't sent anyone to the electric chair during 12 years on the bench. Only once had he come close: Kimbrough sentenced a man to death who had been convicted of a double murder. Soon, though, the judge reversed himself and gave the man a new trial. Eventually, he was set free.\n\nSo, at word of Kimbrough's assignment, Jack Crawford and his team murmured that the path to a death sentence was a steep one. \"We certainly thought we had an uphill climb,\" he would say later.\n\n—\n\nIn the Lake County Juvenile Detention Center, Paula Cooper's life behind bars was getting off to a rough start.\n\nShe was no stranger to jail, having spent three months in the same detention center two years earlier after she ran away from home. She was a bit weepy then, even tender, the guards remembered. But this 15-year-old version of Paula Cooper was angrier, explosive and cocky. She acted as if she owned the place. She was a handful.\n\nTwo weeks after the crime, Paula took a seat next to two of her friends in the jail during \"quiet hour.\" Soon they grew noisy. A guard told them to shut up and disperse; Paula refused. The guard ordered her back to her cell. But as she stepped into the hall, Paula struck the guard across the bridge of the nose. She fought until reinforcements arrived to pull Paula off. As they were dragging her away, Paula issued a warning: They'd better transfer the guard or she would get a knife and come after her.\n\nThe dust-up prompted a transfer for the girls — from the juvenile center to the Lake County Jail. It also made the local papers, which didn't help the cause of saving their lives.\n\nBy the end of July 1985, the cases against all four girls were formally moved to adult court. Crawford, after sifting through the ample evidence, made his purpose clear: He would seek the death penalty against all four.\n\nThe case had pricked the public's consciousness of crime at a new level.\n\nCrawford's decision made news on the Chicago television stations; it made headlines across Indiana. The public defender assigned to represent Paula, Kevin Relphorde, was incredulous. \"They must be the youngest females in the country facing the death penalty,\" he told reporters.\n\nBy then, Paula and Karen, sharing a cell in the Lake County Jail, had been locked up two months. They began telling jail staff they were considering suicide. On cards they were given to report health problems, they wrote things such as \"Give me the electric chair\" and \"Give me that shock. I want to die.\"\n\nAs a precaution, jail officers took their personal belongings and stripped them to their underwear; they were on suicide watch.\n\nPaula and Karen responded by banging on the bars and making noise. To calm them, a nurse broke out the oral sedatives. Karen took hers; Paula refused. The guards teamed up to hold down Paula so the nurse could give her a shot. But as they tried to restrain her, Paula jumped up and hit one guard in the shoulder.\n\n\"Oh you tough, huh?\" the guard replied. \"You stabbed an old lady.\" It was less than professional, but it was a gut reaction.\n\n\"Yeah, I stabbed an old lady,\" Paula replied. \"And I'd stab that bitch again. I'd stab your fucking grandmother.\"\n\nThe jail incidents were part of a pattern to be repeated in years to come. Paula didn't respond well to restraints; she bucked authority. In such instances, she could be aggressive and hostile. A psychologist noted her tendencies and something else plain to see: Battered and badgered as a girl, she was now mistrustful and suspicious.\n\nSoon, Paula's interaction with the jail staff would grow more complicated. By August 1985, about the time she turned 16, Paula began receiving a series of private visitors. Two were male corrections officers. Another was a male recreational therapist. They weren't visiting just because of their jobs.\n\nThey were coming for sex.\n\n—\n\nOutside the jail, the stories about the angry young prisoners seemed only to add to the public's contempt. And as the details of their crime emerged, they were already easy to hate. Especially the girl who had wielded the knife — Paula Cooper.\n\nPaula had not just killed Ruth Pelke; she had stabbed her 33 times, according to the coroner. Some of the cuts on her arms looked like saw marks, as if the knife had been pulled back and forth. In other instances, the 12-inch knife had been wielded with such ferocity that the tip of the blade went through Ruth's body, pierced the carpet on which she lay and chipped the wood flooring beneath. Worst of all, it appeared Ruth Pelke survived the torturous assault for more than 30 minutes. The Post-Tribune called it \"possibly the most brutal killing in Gary history.\"\n\nIf all that wasn't bad enough, two of the girls had bragged about the killing at school. As defendants go, they were about as unsympathetic as they come. With guilt hardly in doubt, letters began appearing in the Gary newspaper debating the punishment. Some asked for mercy; others wanted severe justice. One letter directed at Paula appeared under the headline, \"She should pay.\"\n\nAll of it left Kevin Relphorde, Paula's lawyer, searching for a viable strategy to save Paula's life. The evidence was overwhelming, and the prosecutor was determined, which made a plea deal unimaginable. Paula's childhood had been bad, but it didn't seem to add up to an insanity plea. Her youth and relatively clean prior record were assets, but they looked meager compared to the brutality of the crime. Then there was the jury. Any panel drawn from across Lake County would be mostly white. And Paula was a black teenager who had killed an old white woman. All of it added up to a grim outlook.\n\nAs best as Relphorde could figure, the only thing Paula had going for her was the judge. Relphorde knew of Kimbrough's opposition to the death penalty. Ultimately, he suggested to Paula a stomach-churning strategy: Plead guilty.\n\nRelphorde was a part-time public defender who'd never handled a death penalty case. But he figured Paula's chances were better in the hands of a liberal judge than with 12 angry jurors.\n\nAs risky as it sounded, Relphorde wasn't the only person who sized things up the same way. David Olson, who was Karen Corder's attorney, came to a similar conclusion. He'd had a nightmare about Karen, he told the Post-Tribune in March 1986, and awoke fearful of \"losing her.\" His fears were amplified when he attended the trial of Denise Thomas, the first suspect to answer for the death of Ruth Pelke.\n\nJust before the case against Thomas went to trial, in November 1985, prosecutors withdrew the death penalty charge, concluding she'd been more of a bystander to the crime.\n\nBut that didn't stop the jurors from reacting strongly to the horrific details of Pelke's death. They quickly found Denise guilty. Olson didn't want to risk that with death on the line for his client. So in March, 10 months after the crime, Karen went before Kimbrough with a guilty plea. Her sentencing would follow two months later.\n\nHow well Paula understood the risks of her plea — and how much say she had in it — is now a matter of dispute. Relphorde said he met with Paula regularly to talk strategy and that the plea was ultimately her decision. Years later, Paula would recall only three brief meetings with her attorney, who she said assured her the judge opposed the death penalty and would be sympathetic to a black girl. If she pleaded guilty, she said she was told, she wouldn't get a death sentence.\n\nOn April 21, 1986, Paula appeared in court to plead guilty to murder.\n\nHerman Cooper came to the courtroom that day; so did Paula's sister, Rhonda. But Gloria Cooper, Paula's mother, was nowhere to be found. She had moved to Georgia and stopped answering the calls of Paula's attorney.\n\nWhen the hearing began, Kimbrough asked Paula more than once if she knew she could be sentenced to death. Each time, Paula answered yes. To the most important question — How do you plead? — she never hesitated: Guilty.\n\nFor the record, Paula retold the story of the crime — the scheme to get into the house; what she did to Ruth; how the girls took the car.\n\n\"We went to commit a robbery, you know,\" she told the judge.\n\nWas there any discussion in advance about what you'd do with Mrs. Pelke? he asked.\n\n\"No. It wasn't a discussion to go and kill anyone, you know.\"\n\nKimbrough accepted the plea. Paula's life was now in his hands. But she would have to wait months for an answer. Relphorde left convinced Paula had made her best play: \"We were basically throwing ourselves on the mercy of the court.\"\n\nPaula's strategy seemed to appear sound when, in May 1986, Kimbrough spared Karen Corder's life, giving her 60 years in prison. In fact, three of the girls had escaped with their lives. Denise Thomas, found guilty at trial, received a 35-year sentence. April Beverly, who conceived the robbery but waited outside during the killing, pleaded guilty in exchange for a 25-year prison term.\n\nOnly Paula's fate remained unresolved.\n\nLost in the news of Corder's reprieve, perhaps, was some language the judge used in reference to Paula. It seemed ominous. Kimbrough said it had been \"conceded by all that Paula Cooper was the leader of this group of four young ladies. That Paula Cooper was the dominant factor in the crime.\" He said Corder was \"operating under the substantial domination of Paula Cooper.\" Despite such words, the prevailing view in legal circles was that Kimbrough would spare Paula's life.\n\n—\n\nAs her judgment approached, there were hints that Paula Cooper's case was starting to resonate beyond Indiana. Jack Crawford's first clue came when his secretary stepped into his office with an unusual message: \"There's a man outside who says he's from the Vatican. He's dressed like a monk and wants to talk to you about Paula Cooper's case.\"\n\nCrawford took a look. Sure enough, in a brown tunic bound at the waist with a cord, there stood a Franciscan friar. He told Crawford he was from Rome. He offered a letter validating his credentials. And he brought a simple message: Pope John Paul II and the Vatican weren't pleased with Crawford's decision to seek the death penalty.\n\nCrawford was Roman Catholic. He'd gone to Notre Dame. He knew the church's opposition to the death penalty. But, as he explained to the friar, this was a legal decision, not a religious one. The friar left unsatisfied. He would not be the last Franciscan to stand with Paula.\n\nMore surprising than the friar's appearance was the visit Crawford received in June 1986 from Paula's attorney, Kevin Relphorde.\n\nIt was just weeks before Paula's sentencing, and Relphorde had few cards to play in Paula's defense. This time, though, it appeared he might have a game changer.\n\n\"You can't execute Paula Cooper,\" he said.\n\n\"Well, why is that, Kevin?\" Crawford asked.\n\n\"She's pregnant.\"\n\n—\n\nThe sex scandal at the Lake County Jail erupted in June 1986.\n\nFor months, corrections officers Vernard Rouster, 25, and Parmaley Rainge, 27, had been coming to see Paula for sex, officials discovered. So, too, had Michael Dean Lampley, a recreational therapist from a mental health center. Their encounters occurred even as a 40-year-old female corrections officer and a police patrolman were supposed to be maintaining security for the state's highest-profile murder suspect.\n\n—\n\nOne of the guards admitted the sex began when Paula was still a week shy of 16 — the age of consent in Indiana. That people working in the jail were having sex with a captive wasn't illegal in Indiana in 1986. After the revelation, the jail workers resigned their jobs and the therapist was fired, but no one was prosecuted. Supervisors on the jail floor were suspended — for 15 days.\n\nFor all of its tawdriness, the scandal had the potential to affect Paula's case. State law prohibited the execution of a pregnant woman; punishment would have to wait. And while a death penalty appeal was certain to outlast a pregnancy, the strange episode raised the possibility of a sentencing delay.\n\nKimbrough ordered a medical exam for Paula. Quickly, the matter was put to rest: She wasn't pregnant. But, in a sign of the times, public discussion about the scandal seemed to focus less on the culpability of the jailers than on the promiscuity of the 16-year-old girl in jail.\n\nJames McNew, a deputy in Crawford's office who prosecuted the case, told the Post-Tribune he suspected Paula Cooper tried to get pregnant to stir up sympathy and avoid death.\n\nHowever it came about, the sex scandal prompted a change in state law: It became a crime for jailers to have sex with their prisoners. Soon, though, the jailhouse sex scandal would become little more than a footnote before a judgment heard around the world.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nBill Pelke sat on the wrong side of the courtroom.\n\nHis grandmother was the murder victim. Unwittingly, Bill took a seat on the side of the murderer. He was unfamiliar with the trappings of the courtroom. And unlike some in the community — in his own family — Bill carried no blood lust into the chamber. He thought people who committed murder should die. And Paula Cooper had killed his beloved Nana. But he wasn't fuming about it.\n\nBill had stayed away from the previous court hearings, but decided this was one he shouldn't miss. It was July 11, 1986. And for Paula Cooper, it was judgment day.\n\nCourtroom 3 of Lake Superior Court was a small space. The gallery, oriented outside a circle where the business of the court was conducted, had seats for just 43 onlookers. This day, it was packed to overflowing. People stood, straining to hear, just outside the public entrance. Lawyers and other court personnel did the same just outside the doors normally used by the judge and juries. All wanted to know the fate of a 16-year-old girl who faced a potential death sentence.\n\nInto this cauldron, Paula Cooper entered under the escort of a jail matron. She didn't need to look around to see she had few friends in the room. Her sister and her grandfather were there, but neither of her parents was present. Her mother had moved to Georgia, her father to Tennessee. As Paula entered, the matron said something that made the young defendant smile. The gesture surprised Bill Pelke; it struck him as unbefitting for the moment. When this day is done, he thought to himself, she's not going to be smiling.\n\nDeputy Prosecutor James McNew began the proceedings by calling Bill's father to testify. Robert Pelke hadn't missed a hearing — for Paula or any of the other girls. He had been the family spokesman, and he wanted a death sentence for Paula. He described going to Ruth Pelke's home when she hadn't answered the phone, finding her home in disarray and her body on the floor. He described her bloody dress and the towel wrapped around her head. When the attorneys finished questioning him, Robert asked to read a statement to the court.\n\nThis, Robert Pelke said, was a crime that deserved the maximum sentence the law would allow. He quoted the Bible about submitting to authorities and God's vengeance and punishing evildoers. He said Paula gave Ruth no second chance, and he saw no reason to give Paula one.\n\n\"Paula reveled in her doings and enjoyed it,\" he said. He spoke of ridding society of those who would prey upon the innocent. \"This is a tragedy that should never have happened,\" he said, \"and a tragedy that family and friends will never forget.\"\n\nNext, one of the girls from Lew Wallace High School testified about seeing Paula and the others on their joy ride and about finding the bloody knife on the floor of the car.\n\nA crime lab technician discussed grisly photos from the scene — pictures of Ruth Pelke, of the knife-torn carpet and the gouge marks in the hardwood floor.\n\nThe prosecution introduced into evidence the autopsy report, which expressed the damage done by the 33 stab wounds. There was also an anatomical diagram noting the points where Ruth had been wounded — so many it looked like a star chart.\n\nJailers who had been attacked and threatened by Paula detailed her bad behavior; they recounted her admission about stabbing \"an old lady.\"\n\nEntering into evidence the grisly details of the crime and the accounts of Paula's callous behavior was part of the prosecution's effort to build a case that the only just punishment was death.\n\nIn Paula's defense, only three witnesses spoke.\n\nRhonda Cooper gave a picture of how she and Paula grew up terrorized in the home of Herman Cooper. She testified to the beatings, to their father's raping their mother in front of them, to their mother's suicide attempt and to their attempts to run away.\n\nRonald Williams, Rhonda's biological father, testified that he wanted to take Paula away from the misery, but her mother refused. He spoke of Gloria's threats against Paula and of the suicide attempt.\n\nDr. Frank Brogno, a Gary psychologist who examined Paula, described how Paula's abuse left her angry and confused, depressed and hostile. He said she was prone to confusion and bizarre thinking, even drifting into fantasies. Still, he said, Paula knew right from wrong. There was still hope for her, but also a real danger she could become a sociopath.\n\nMcNew, on cross-examination, ripped into the doctor. He pointed out how Brogno had testified in Karen Corder's case that Paula was the \"prime mover\" in the crime.\n\n—\n\nRelphorde made a plea for Paula's life, saying she had gone to Ruth Pelke's home to rob, not kill. He said the other girls were intensely involved in the crime and their lives had been spared. The death penalty, he said, was applied at the whim of prosecutors. He said Ruth Pelke, a woman of faith, wouldn't want Paula to die. In the end, he said, Paula was the handiwork of an abusive home and a system that failed her.\n\n\"I don't think Paula was born violent,\" he said. \"I think Paula was a product of what was done to her.\"\n\nMcNew, closing the prosecution's case, checked all the boxes needed for a death sentence: Paula wasn't crazy. She wasn't doing someone else's bidding. She'd struck the death blows. She had a criminal record, as far as a juvenile goes, for skipping school and running away from home. And Paula's abusive childhood? To use that for an excuse, McNew said, was to insult everyone who has endured similar treatment and found a way to overcome the horrors. Giving Paula the death penalty, McNew said, would have a sobering effect on others who might be considering crime. But McNew said there was one reason, above all, for a death sentence.\n\n\"I am not seeking a deterrence to crime when I ask the death penalty on Paula Cooper. I seek justice for the family of Ruth Pelke.\"\n\n—\n\nWith the attorneys done, Kimbrough asked Paula if she had anything to say. And Paula did not shrink from the moment.\n\nShe hadn't wanted a trial, Paula began; she only wanted to tell the truth. \"Now my family life, it hasn't really been good. … Nobody understand how I feel.\"\n\n\"This man,\" she said, pointing to the prosecutor, \"sit here and say he want to take my life. Is that right? I didn't go to Mrs. Pelke's house to kill her. It wasn't planned. I didn't go there to take somebody's life. It happened. It just happened. Something. It wasn't planned. We didn't sit up and say we was going to go and kill this innocent old lady. I didn't even know the lady. But everybody put the blame on me.\"\n\nShe said Jack Crawford had described her in the newspaper as the ringleader. \"I wasn't the ringleader. I didn't make those girls go,\" she said. \"They went on their own.\"\n\nLooking around at the people in the courtroom, Paula seemed disgusted. \"Well, where was all these people at right here when I needed somebody? Where was they at? They turned their backs on me and took me through all this. All I can say is now, look where I am now, facing a possible death sentence.\"\n\nShe pointed at the Pelke family and repeated her plea that killing wasn't her intention. \"I hope you all could find some happiness in your hearts to forgive me. And I know your mother was a Christian lady, and she is in heaven right now. I read my Bible. How do you think I feel? I can't sit here and tell you I understand how you feel because I don't.\"\n\nShe acknowledged that \"sorry\" would never be good enough.\n\nPaula looked to Judge Kimbrough. But, as Bill Dolan would report in the Post-Tribune the next day, the judge \"didn't return her gaze.\" \"I don't know what the decision is going to be today, or whenever you make your decision. I know justice must be done. And whatever the circumstances, or whatever your decision is, I will accept it, even if it is death.\" She acknowledged she couldn't change what happened: She hoped to get out one day and start life over, maybe even finish school.\n\n\"Will I have a chance?\" she asked. \"Will I get a chance?\"\n\nFor a couple of minutes, Paula rambled. She repeated that she hadn't forced the other girls to act; she felt it important everyone know she wasn't a gang member. Then she reined it back in for one final thought: \"I am sorry for what I did. And I know my involvement in this case is very deep. But all I can ask you is not to take my life. That is all I can ask you. That is all I can ask is to spare my life.\"\n\nSuddenly, a commotion broke out in the courtroom. There was shouting in the gallery. \"My grandbaby, my grandbaby.\"\n\nBill Pelke looked at the wailing man near him and saw the tears run down his cheeks; the visage burned into Bill's memory. He watched the man as the bailiff escorted him out of the courtroom.\n\nIt was Paula's grandfather, making one final plea on Paula's behalf.\n\nNow it was up to the judge.\n\n—\n\nJudge James C. Kimbrough had been wading through the sordid details of Ruth Pelke's murder for more than a year. He'd parsed the depressing narrative, and people had speculated whether he had a death penalty in him, especially for a girl. Now they were about to get their answer.\n\nThere was no doubt about Paula Cooper's guilt. Kimbrough dispatched that with his first breath. The murder had been disturbing: Paula had inflicted the 33 stab wounds in the body of 78-year-old Ruth Pelke.\n\nThose were the strikes against her.\n\nBut the defendant had no prior criminal history, and she was 15 at the time of the crime.\n\nThose were factors to consider on her behalf.\n\nThe other requirements for the death penalty, Kimbrough said, didn't work in the defendant's favor. She acted of her own free will. She wasn't under the influence of drugs. Her mental problems didn't rise to the level of incompetence. But all those things, Kimbrough said, were legalities. Ultimately, he said, death penalty cases boil down to a \"political utterance.\"\n\n\"This case has received an unusual amount of publicity,\" Kimbrough said. \"There is worldwide interest in the outcome of these proceedings today. And the court is certainly aware of that interest.\"\n\nWhen he left law school in 1959, Kimbrough said, he had been \"totally against\" the death penalty — and most of the country shared the view.\n\nNearly 30 years later, he said, public sentiment had changed, perhaps because of the violent activities of people such as Paula Cooper. Now, the vast majority of the public favors the death penalty, Kimbrough said, Normally, he wrote out his sentences in advance. But this case had challenged him to the point he'd been unable to do so.\n\nKimbrough praised the deputy prosecutor for speaking \"eloquently\" — he said McNew brought the matters into focus \"better than all of the turmoil that I have been through in the last several months.\"\n\nHe criticized state law for being too general when it came to giving minors the death penalty. It left him unsure what to do on that fundamental question. \"I don't know what the right political answer to that question is.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough, in a moment of vulnerability judges don't always reveal, showed some insight into his restless mind. \"I don't believe I am ever going to be quite the same after these four cases. They have had a very profound effect on me. They have made me come to grips with the question of whether or not a judge can hold personal beliefs which are inconsistent at all with the law as they were sworn to uphold. And for those of you who have no appreciation of it, it is not a simple question. It is not a simple question for me.\"\n\nKimbrough interrupted his confessional to take issue with something Robert Pelke said: \"I do not believe the failure to impose the death penalty today would be unbiblical. … I don't profess to be an expert in religion. But I know the Bible has passages which are merciful, and do not demand or mandate an eye for an eye.\"\n\nReturning to his inner turmoil, Kimbrough said he'd concluded that a judge must decide a case based on facts, regardless of whether it satisfies him. \"I will tell you, very frankly now, on the record, that I do not believe in the death penalty.\"\n\nThis seemed to launch Kimbrough on a rant. \"Maybe in 20 years, after we have had our fill of executions, we will swing back the other way and think they are unconstitutional. Maybe.\"\n\nAt about this point, Jack Crawford, sitting at the prosecutor's table, was ready to give up hope for a death penalty. He turned to McNew, he remembered later, and whispered into his ear.\n\n\"He's not going to give it.\"\n\nThen Kimbrough directed his eyes to the girl awaiting his judgment.\n\n\"Stand up, Paula.\"\n\nShe had stabbed Ruth Pelke 33 times, he said. He was concerned about her background. She had been \"born into a household where your father abused you, and your mother either participated or allowed it to happen. And those seem to be explanations or some indication of why you may be this type of personality that you are.\"\n\n\"They are not excuses, however.\"\n\nHowever.\n\nThat word caught Crawford's attention. So did the fact that Kimbrough's shoulders seemed to slump, as if the weight of the moment was getting to the judge. Crawford leaned in and whispered again to McNew.\n\n\"I think he's going to give it. I think he's going to give it.\"\n\nKimbrough continued.\n\n\"You committed the act, and you must pay the penalty,\" Kimbrough said. Briefly, he trailed into some legalese about the charge. Then he gathered himself for the final judgment.\n\n\"The law requires me, and I do now impose, the death penalty.\"\n\n—\n\nThe courtroom erupted.\n\n\"What did he say?\"\n\nPaula Cooper looked at Kevin Relphorde for help; amid the chaos, she wasn't sure what had just happened. She looked back for the judge; he had already left the bench. She asked Relphorde what had happened. He delivered the verdict again: He gave you the death penalty.\n\nThe smile Paula wore into the courtroom was gone, indeed. Bill Pelke took note of that. Instead, he saw a river of tears streaming down her cheeks. As she was led from the courtroom, the tears soaked the top of her blouse.\n\nJust like that, Paula Cooper — at 16 years, 10 months and 16 days — became the youngest person ever sentenced to death in Indiana; she was now the youngest female on death row anywhere in the United States. In this age before the cellphone, news reporters from national outlets raced out of the courtroom to the nearest bank of pay telephones. It took a few hours, but the verdict soon circled the globe.\n\nIn the hallway outside the courtroom, Rhonda Cooper yelled in anguish at members of the Pelke family and the prosecutors nearby.\n\n\"Are you satisfied now?\"\n\nThey seemed satisfied.\n\nStrangely, one of the most unsatisfied people in the building was the source of the commotion: Judge Kimbrough.\n\nAfter delivering the verdict, he darted out of the courtroom and into the hallway leading to his chambers. There, between the two rooms, he spotted William Touchette, a public defender who handled appeals. Kimbrough told Touchette to follow him.\n\nTouchette (pronounced TOO-shay) had been among those outside the courtroom straining to hear the proceedings. Like so many local lawyers, he was friendly with the judge; they'd socialized outside of work. He followed Kimbrough into his chambers.\n\nThe judge was angry. As angry as Touchette had ever seen him. Angry that the defense hadn't given him enough to spare Paula Cooper's life. Then Kimbrough uttered seven words Touchette would never again hear from a judge.\n\n\"I want you to get me reversed.\"\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nPaula Cooper's death sentence was one of Indiana's biggest news stories in 1986. It garnered network television news coverage. Once it hit the international news wires, it was picked up by newspapers in Europe, where it inspired protests.\n\nBut Monica Foster, working for a nonprofit death penalty defense group in Downtown Indianapolis, somehow missed all that. To her, it was as if the Paula Cooper case had never happened.\n\nIt wasn't that Foster was uninterested in current events or that she was dull. In fact, Foster was a wunderkind. She'd graduated from high school at 16, college at 19 and law school at 22. She'd come to work for the Indiana Public Defender Council, researching and offering advice to lawyers with death penalty cases, even before finishing her law degree. But at 27, she had a tendency to get absorbed in her work. And when that happened, the outside world ceased to exist.\n\nSo when William Touchette, the Lake County attorney preparing Paula Cooper's appeal, called the council looking for some help, Foster knew nothing of the case. Without hesitation, Foster agreed to be Touchette's local connection to Paula, who was being held at the Indiana Women's Prison on the city's east side. Foster even said she'd donate her time, seeing the client on evenings and weekends, as a sideline.\n\nFoster didn't realize she'd just signed on to the case that would become the most noteworthy of her career.\n\nWhen the case file arrived in her office, Foster began reading about Paula Cooper. Right away, she was puzzled.\n\nHere was a black girl from Gary who had been sentenced to death by a black judge whom even Foster knew to be one of the most liberal, anti-death penalty jurists in the state. The girl had brutally murdered an elderly woman during a robbery, but Foster told the people in her office that to get a death sentence from this judge Paula Cooper had to be some kind of rabid animal.\n\n\"She must be frothing at the mouth.\"\n\nFoster decided to go to the prison and see Paula Cooper for herself.\n\n—\n\nPaula had arrived at the Indiana Women's Prison — America's oldest women's prison — five days after her sentencing.\n\nEstablished shortly after the Civil War, it was originally in the countryside east of Indianapolis. Over time, brick storefronts and wood-frame houses sprang up around the prison's series of boxy brick buildings — situated around a grassy courtyard — and now the prison was landlocked in the middle of an urban neighborhood.\n\nAwaiting Paula was a cell tucked away on the second floor of the segregation unit. It was stark: block walls and tile floor; aluminum sink and toilet; a desk and a chair; all of it packaged in a space slightly bigger than a walk-in closet.\n\nShe had one window to the outside world. Depending on which side of the hallway she was assigned at the time, it featured either a view of the courtyard or, just beyond a fence topped by razor wire, the backside of a row of decaying houses.\n\nPaula's cell had two metal doors. One was made of bars, the other was solid. Most of the time, the solid door remained open, allowing her to talk through the bars to passing guards and nearby prisoners. But when the solid door was closed, it was as if she was locked in a vault. Worse, the prison had no air conditioning. As summer temperatures outside climbed into the 90s, the only air moving through the wing was pushed by a floor fan at the end of the hall. Most of the time, the place felt like the inside of a cook stove.\n\nHere, Paula Cooper spent 23 hours a day. In the remaining hour, she had 30 minutes to shower and 30 minutes for recreation, which meant a short walk to a larger room where she could play Ping-Pong or cards with other prisoners. Meals were delivered to her cell.\n\nShe was 16 years old and, in the grand scheme of things, set apart from the rest of the human race.\n\nThe treatment was harsher than what Paula's three co-defendants in the murder of Ruth Pelke faced. They were housed elsewhere in the prison, with the general population. They had greater freedom of movement, time outdoors and an ongoing interaction with other people. Paula was allotted 10 hours of visits per month, but she wasn't sure who would fill the time. Her sister had moved to Minnesota. Her mother had moved to Georgia. Her father had moved to Tennessee. Paula was as alone as she could be.\n\nYet she faced a struggle greater than isolation and heat. She lived in fear that the executioner was coming for her any minute. Whatever she'd been told about the appeals process hadn't registered. She thought she was about to be taken away and killed. She existed moment to moment, in dread the guards were about to drag her away to the electric chair. In letters, she would describe her situation in the bleakest of terms — \"a mental hell.\" Paula needed hope. She needed a friend. But who?\n\n—\n\nMonica Foster entered the security checkpoint at the Indiana Women's Prison and was shown to the glass-walled consultation room. In short order, she watched as a guard escorted her client in to meet her.\n\nPaula Cooper was nothing like she expected. Monica came looking for the heartless killer who had murdered an old woman in cold blood, fought the guards at the county jail and been given a ticket to the chair by the most liberal judge in Lake County.\n\nInstead, Foster found a girl, sobbing uncontrollably, who had been on suicide watch. Foster tried to calm her. After some questioning, she gathered the reason for the emotional meltdown: Paula thought they were coming any time now. To kill her.\n\nFoster's blood boiled. She realized that, since the sentencing, no one had explained to Paula the years of appeals; the good chance for a reprieve; and, should all else fail, the notice she would receive well ahead of an execution. Foster felt sorry for Paula. She explained the process. Above all, she told Paula she'd never be ambushed by the executioner.\n\nPaula went back to her cell in a little better shape, but Foster left the prison rattled. She couldn't believe how she had misjudged her client. She realized that her role in this case was about more than legal counsel. She would need to offer her client a shoulder to cry on, an ear to listen.\n\nFoster began going to the prison on weekends, sitting and talking with Paula for hours. She listened to Paula talk about being depressed, and she tried to buck her up. She listened to Paula's troubles with the prison administration and offered advice on ways to get along. She listened to Paula describe the abuses of her childhood, and Foster shared some of the tougher aspects of her own. The conversation wasn't always heavy. Sometimes they talked about places they dreamed of going and about men Foster was dating. Paula, in particular, was quick with a jab about Foster's romantic failures. Even in a maximum security prison, with one of them facing death, they spent a good deal of time laughing. And Foster found Paula's laugh to be infectious. That she could laugh at all impressed Foster. The girl seemed to have some kind of resiliency. After a while, Foster could deny it no longer: She liked Paula Cooper.\n\n—\n\nBill Pelke felt no such affection.\n\nIn the 18 months since Paula Cooper killed his grandmother, Bill had lost the ability to think of Ruth Pelke as the sweet person she'd been; he could only see the murder victim. He couldn't remember the warmth of Ruth's home; he could only think of it as a crime scene. When Paula Cooper received her sentence, Pelke felt justice had been served. His father, Robert Pelke, warned him that the justice wouldn't last. On a trip to Florida they took to get away from it all, Robert Pelke said Paula would probably never see the electric chair. \"Some do-gooder will probably come along and help get her off death row,\" he'd said. Bill struggled to imagine it; he just tried to get on with his life.\n\nBut moving on wasn't easy. And at 39, Bill already had other things on his mind that bothered him. He'd dropped out of college and wound up in Vietnam during the height of the war. As a radio operator, he was supposed to take cover during the fighting and call in air support. But he still carried shrapnel in his side from the wounds he suffered. Worse than that, he carried memories of the Army buddies who'd never come back. The experience left him sick of death. When he returned home, he'd married and started a family, but his marriage failed. So many things in his life hadn't gone as he'd planned. One afternoon in November 1986, all of this seemed to coalesce in Bill's mind.\n\nBill worked in a steel mill as a crane operator. He sat 50 feet above the manufacturing floor in the cab of his crane, moving heavy loads as the need arose. But on this Sunday night shift, things were slow; his mind began to drift. He wondered why life was so hard, why God had allowed Ruth to suffer such a horrendous death. He wondered why his family — his good family — was made to suffer in the wake of the crime. It was an unlikely perch for prayer, but Bill closed his eyes and began seeing images in his mind. He saw the courtroom where Paula had been sentenced to death. He remembered the outburst of her grandfather and the tears streaming down the man's face. He remembered Paula's reaction and the tears streaming down hers, how they soaked her blouse.\n\nA hard realization hit Bill: Ruth wouldn't have wanted these things. She had invited Paula and the girls into her home to help them find faith. It occurred to Bill that Ruth would be more interested in Paula's salvation than her execution. He was certain, too, that Ruth would have hated seeing Paula's grandfather in anguish.\n\nBill thought of the Bible stories Ruth had taught and the lessons he'd learned from a lifetime in church. He remembered Jesus taught that you shouldn't forgive someone just seven times, but 70 times seven — in other words, forgiveness should be a habit. He remembered being taught that the measure of forgiveness we show others is the measure by which we shall be judged. He remembered hearing about Jesus on the cross, offering salvation to the man dying next to him, offering grace to those who sought his death. \"Forgive them,\" Jesus had said, \"for they know not what they do.\"\n\nAnd then Bill realized something: Paula hadn't known what she was doing. Nobody in their right mind would take a 12-inch butcher knife and stab someone 33 times. It was crazy. Senseless.\n\nIn his mind, Bill began to see a new image: It was the picture of Ruth, the one published countless times since her death — silver hair, horn-rimmed glasses, sweet smile. Except now, he saw her face in the picture with tears running down her cheeks. Bill felt certain Ruth wanted someone from her family to show love to Paula and hers. Bill wasn't capable of it right then, but he thought he should try. He was a blue collar guy — a steelworker — and now he was at work crying a river of his own tears. From his seat in the cab of the crane, Bill prayed: \"God, give me love and compassion for Paula Cooper and her family.\" In return, he promised God two things. First, Bill would give credit to God for giving him the ability to forgive Paula whenever success came his way. Second, he'd walk through whatever door opened as a result of forgiving Paula.\n\nEventually, the sweet memories of Ruth would come back to Bill. He would be able to put aside the horror story. First, though, he felt he had to take a greater leap of faith. He had to get in touch with his grandmother's killer. He had to reach out to Paula Cooper.\n\nTo empower the journalism behind IndyStar, please consider a subscription.\n\nThe next day, Bill phoned Paula's attorney. He wanted her prison address, and he was willing to do whatever it took to help save Paula's life. Kevin Relphorde's response wasn't encouraging: \"It's kind of late for that.\"\n\nUndeterred, Bill took the address and sat down at a desk in his Portage home to write perhaps the most intense letter of his life. He told Paula he had forgiven her; he wanted to visit her; there were Bible verses his grandmother would want him to share. He also wanted to meet her grandfather, he of the tearful courtroom outburst.\n\nBill dropped the letter in his mailbox and, at some level, thought that would be the end of it. But in the days following, he found himself checking his mailbox almost daily. Ten days after he sent his letter, an envelope showed up. The return address said: \"Ms. Paula Cooper.\"\n\nThe envelope was thick. Inside, he found a letter dated Nov. 10, 1986, six pages of a teenage girl's loopy cursive, written in pencil, on pink stationery. The contents were far from a schoolgirl's bubble gum dreams. It was a snapshot of Paula's mind on death row. Her thoughts darted back and forth — between apologies and self-pity, between empathy for those who hated her and preachiness about why they should forgive her. Much of the letter was frenetic. Sentences ran on and on like the transcriptions of a nervous talker. Her misspellings and limited punctuation seemed to reflect the erratic schooling of someone who'd been on the run since eighth grade. But it also bore the hallmarks of a mind in overdrive, overloaded with conflicting emotions. Here are some excerpts. Periods have been added for clarity.\n\nBill 11/10/86\n\nHello how are you? fine I truly hope. me I'll survive, I received your letter today & it was nice of you to write me. one of Ms Pelkes friends wrote me also, I answered it back also. Im not the mean type of person your family thinks I am but I can except that. I really do. your cousin Robert was something else & what he said about not knowing if Ms Pelke would forgiving me. Ive read my bible & I know it says the way you judge others the Lord will judge you the same way. Ive prayed for your family. a lady in a wheel chair use to visit me at the jail. she said God would be pleased if I prayed for all of you, I am doing fine. They treat me ok & I am always isolated 23 hrs a day. thats how it is on death row, it is a mental hell because no one cares except for themselves. I am thankful to the Lord for them letting the others have a little time, because I've had hell all my life. so it really doesnt matter if I live or die because Im ready any time they come …\n\nIn his initial letter, Bill expressed a desire to save Paula from her death sentence. But in her reply, Paula told Bill he need not write, travel or speak on her behalf; she just wanted his forgiveness. She seemed proud of her performance in court — how she looked his family in the face and apologized. She seemed to excuse her parents for missing her sentencing. Although they had beaten and neglected her, Paula said, her actions affected them, too.\n\nAt various times, her words ranged from fatalistic to self-pitying:\n\nI cant stay here like this & I don't want to be here, I deserve a chance one that Ive never had before. but one day Ill be free even if its when Im dead…\n\nI cry every time I think of your grand mom. the others think it's a joke because you all let them be free. Im not an evil person, or what ever you think of me to be, Im just some one who is real angry, angry with life & all the people around me …\n\nIve never done anything wrong before except ask for help, I was turned away & introduced into a life of drugs, sex & crime, but now its too late for help. Im dying inside because of this but I only hope for the best for others.\n\nIn closing, she made it clear she wanted more interaction with Bill, even if she was passive about it. She would put him on her list of allowable prison visitors; she would write him whenever he wrote her; she offered her grandfather's phone number and address. In a dark world, it was as if she had seen a flicker of light.\n\nWell, Ill go now, Ill continue to pray for all of you.\n\nTake care\n\nPaula\n\nTheir first exchange was the start of a surprising correspondence that would span years and delve into the core themes of Paula's life — searching for forgiveness; grappling with remorse; her closeness with death; her search for peace.\n\nThe letters also chart the course of a relationship that many people would struggle to understand, especially Bill Pelke's father.\n\n—\n\nAfter a second exchange of letters with Paula, Bill felt compelled to share with his parents the news of his surprising correspondence: His father had once warned of a do-gooder who would get Paula off death row. Now it appeared Bill wanted to be that do-gooder.\n\nAt first, his parents were speechless. \"We don't understand why you are doing this,\" his mother, Lola, said. Surprisingly, his father acquiesced.\n\n\"Do what you got to do,\" Robert said.\n\nBill wrote Clarence Trigg, the superintendent of the Indiana Women's Prison, a letter that spent most of a page describing Ruth Pelke's faith and her commitment to sharing it. He concluded with a request:\n\nClarence, if Ruth Pelke could speak with you right now, I am sure she would say, \"Please let Billy see Paula.\"\n\nThank you for your consideration\n\nIn the name of Jesus and His Love\n\nWilliam R. Pelke\n\nBut the prison doors weren't about to open to Bill anytime soon. Corrections officials didn't know what to make of his request — a murder victim's grandson seeking an audience with her killer. They suspected he had another motive, such as revenge.\n\n—\n\nThe aftermath of Paula's case was confounding in other ways. Since giving Paula a death sentence, Judge James C. Kimbrough had been very public about his discomfort with his own ruling. Based on the law and the case in court, he said Paula qualified for the death penalty. But he hadn't been able to square it with his own opposition to capital punishment. The decision was costing him sleep. In an interview with the (Gary) Post-Tribune, published Aug. 4, 1986, a reporter noted the judge's nervous appearance.\n\nHe fidgeted in his chair. His gaze varied — at times less steady and slanted toward the desktop. He removed his glasses, toying with them.\n\nFriends who knew Kimbrough said the judge was different than he'd been before the Paula Cooper sentencing. The man they knew as friendly and jovial, even gregarious, was more reclusive, less outgoing. \"It weighed heavily on his mind,\" said Earline Rogers, a state legislator and a friend. \"That was something he felt legally he had to do but, personally, he would not have taken that path.\"\n\nSome in the legal community began to think there was a good chance Paula's death sentence would be overturned. But Kimbrough wouldn't live to find out.\n\nOn April 30, 1987, less than a year after his judgment of Paula, Kimbrough drove his car into the back of a semi and was killed. He had been drinking. The tragedy cast a pall over the Lake County courts, but it also landed hard at the Indiana Women's Prison. When Monica Foster told Paula her judge was dead, Paula was inconsolable. Days later, in a letter to Bill Pelke, she shared her thoughts about the judge.\n\n\"all I could do was cry, even though Kimbrough sentenced me to die. I felt a closeness to him as if he were my father. I have been sentenced to die many times by a lot of people and it's only words. We are all on Death Row and the last day of April his death sentence was completed & it should teach a lot of people we all have a date that is already planned & the way it will happen.\"\n\nPaula's own father had been cruel; at least Kimbrough had agonized over the punishment he gave.\n\nThe letter about Kimbrough was the 20th she'd written to Bill Pelke in less than six months. She was surprising herself at her output: \"I didn't even know I had a good handwriting or a great vocabulary until I was locked up.\"\n\nBy then, she was 17 and a condemned killer with hours to contemplate her past, present and future. Several themes recurred in her writing.\n\nLife on death row. She struggled to sleep, to breathe, to deal with the noise. \"To be on death row is worst than when I was in a mental hospital. At least it was quiet.\" She had ailments from toothaches to a bad back. Mostly, she was confused and on edge. Life on the row made her feel like \"a walking time bomb.\"\n\nMemories of the murder. Her thoughts were plagued by it. She described what she did to Ruth Pelke as \"awful.\" She wished she could erase it. \"Every day,\" she said, \"I see my nightmare.\"\n\nDeath. It was constantly on her mind, whether by execution or by her own hand. She alternated between dread of the electric chair — \"I hope it never happens to me\" ­— and anticipation of it — \"sometimes I wish they would just go ahead & do it. They continue to put this death threat on my life and I'm tired of it.\"\n\nSuicide. She seemed to ponder the merits of killing herself. She wasn't sure what it would solve but, in words that seemed to echo from her mother, she said, \"there isn't anything here for me.\" She talked about hanging herself but acknowledged she couldn't follow through. \"I know that if I do that I might go to hell (and) I don't want that to happen.\"\n\nMeanwhile, people from across the country wrote her. Some, including a death row inmate in North Carolina, wanted a romantic relationship. Some wanted answers to the plague of juvenile crime. Others sent her Bibles and tried to save her soul. Yet her faith — another frequent topic — had grown cold. As a child, she read her Bible often, she said, but \"my faith started to shatter because of a lot of feelings, hopes and unanswered prayers. I love the Lord but we aren't rea", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/12/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/09/28/prairie-power-beer-pig-bystander-honor-news-around-states/50782545/", "title": "Prairie power, beer pig: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: A coastal environmental group filed suit Monday trying to block a decision by Alabama Power Co. to leave millions of tons of coal ash along a riverside in the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, where opponents say a spill could devastate a huge ecosystem. The federal lawsuit by Mobile Baykeeper was filed by the Southern Environmental Law Center, which announced plans to sue the electrical utility in July. The group wants to force Alabama Power to give up what it contends is an illegal plan to permanently leave more than 21 million tons of coal ash in an unlined pit at Plant Barry, located north of Mobile along the Mobile River. Environmentalists argue the ash pond is polluting groundwater and could destroy a verdant, biologically diverse region should it be breached by heavy flooding, a hurricane or some other disaster. “Plant Barry is the only coal ash lagoon of a major utility left in a low-lying coastal area of the Southeast that is not already cleaned up or on track to be recycled or removed to safe storage, away from waterways,” Barry Brock, director of the law center’s Alabama office, said in a statement. Alabama Power declined to comment on the lawsuit. Plant Barry opened in 1965 about 25 miles north of Mobile. The company contends moving the material farther away from the plant site would pose a hazard in itself.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A U.S. Coast Guard ship on routine patrol in the Bering Sea came across a guided missile cruiser from China, officials said Monday. But it turned out the cruiser wasn’t alone as it sailed about 86 miles north of Alaska’s Kiska Island on Sept. 19. The patrol boat, known as a cutter called Kimball, later discovered there were two other Chinese naval ships and four Russian naval vessels, including a destroyer, all in single formation. The Honolulu-based Kimball, a 418-foot vessel, observed as the ships broke formation and dispersed. A C-130 Hercules provided air support for the Kimball from the Coast Guard station in Kodiak. “While the formation has operated in accordance with international rules and norms, we will meet presence with presence to ensure there are no disruptions to U.S. interests in the maritime environment around Alaska,” Rear Adm. Nathan Moore, Seventeenth Coast Guard District commander said. The Coast Guard said Operation Frontier Sentinel guidelines call for meeting “presence with presence” when strategic competitors operate in and around U.S. waters. The Kimball will continue to monitor the area. The Chinese and Russian formation came a month after NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned about China’s interest in the Arctic and Russia’s military buildup there.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A massive expansion of the state’s private school voucher system will likely go into effect after public school advocates failed to gather enough signatures to block the law, a conservative think tank that supports the expansion said Monday. The Goldwater Institute, a conservative and libertarian public policy think tank in Phoenix, said Save Our Schools Arizona “submitted just 88,866 signatures, according to petition sheets made available by the Secretary of State’s office.” That’s “significantly short of the requisite 118,843 signatures needed to overturn the reform via ballot referendum.” Although Save Our Schools Arizona said it “will await accurate numbers” from the Secretary of State’s office regarding its challenge to the law, the head of the grassroots group acknowledged it’s probably well below the threshold. Monday’s developments appear to be a major victory for “school choice” advocates in Arizona and across the nation who argue that parents should be able to use public tax dollars to send their children to schools that best serve their needs. Voucher opponents say they drain money from long-underfunded public schools that serve the vast majority of children, sending public money to unaccountable private and religious schools and mainly benefiting the wealthy.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Deer season for archery is underway in western Arkansas, though drought may have affected the population and growth of deer this summer. A healthy population of deer and bear has been noted by those in the field during the opening days since the season began Saturday. Lack of vegetation can affect growth of deer during a drought. Young bucks may have smaller antlers, wildlife experts say, should the drought persist. That has not been the case in Arkansas this year. But the deer harvest this year in western Arkansas should be strong because the drought did not start until mid- to late June, said Ralph Meeker, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission’s statewide deer program coordinator. The does were able to produce enough milk for fawns that can adapt. The number of deer harvested could increase because visibility increases for hunters when drought causes foliage to die off, taking away the cover for the deer. But the deer so far are healthy, Meeker said. Antler growth has not been affected, he has observed. “Whitetail deer are a very adaptable species,” Meeker said. “We had a good growing season before the drought started in mid to late June. Fawn production was phenomenal.” The bear population – for which archery season is underway – has also reportedly increased this year in western Arkansas.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Beyond what they learn academically in kindergarten, students learn everyday routines: how to take care of class materials and how to be kind to their peers, according to Golden Empire Elementary School kindergarten teacher Carla Randazzo. And nearly two-thirds of students at the Sacramento school are English learners. “Those kids just start out having to climb uphill,” she said. “They need a lot of support to be successful.” Randazzo always thought it was “peculiar” that kindergarten is not mandatory in the state. For now, though, California won’t join 20 other states with mandatory kindergarten. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, vetoed legislation Sunday night that would have required children to attend kindergarten – whether through home-schooling or public or private school – before entering first grade at a public school. As he has with other recent legislative vetoes, Newsom cited the costs associated with providing mandatory kindergarten, about $268 million annually, which he said was not accounted for in the California budget. Newsom had supported similar legislation in the past. Proponents of mandatory kindergarten say it could help close the academic opportunity gap for low-income students and students of color, as well as help children develop important social skills before the first grade. Kindergarten enrollment in California dropped nearly 12% in the 2020-21 academic year compared to the previous year, according to the state Department of Education.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: A bystander who intervened during the rough arrest of an elderly woman with dementia has been recognized as the only one who “did the right thing.” Reidesel Mendoza had stopped his car to confront the police officers arresting 73-year-old Karen Garner on June 26, 2020, because “the way they were handling that situation was not the right way,” he said in an interview Sept. 17, after receiving a citizenship award for his actions that day. Garner was accused of leaving Walmart without paying for $13.88 worth of merchandise, but staff stopped her and retrieved the items before she left. Garner was walking home when Officer Austin Hopp stopped her, soon forcing Garner to the ground and trying to arrest her. Mendoza saw how Hopp and two other officers were treating Garner and decided he needed to intervene. “Do you have to use that much aggression?” Mendoza could be heard saying in Hopp’s body camera footage. Hopp told him: “Get out of here; this is not your business ... this is what happens when you fight the police.” Mendoza continued to speak up. The award was presented in part by the Community Trust Commission, formed by the Loveland City Council to aid in rebuilding trust with the community and its police department. Interim Loveland Police Chief Eric Stewart applauded Mendoza’s courage in stepping up that day and said the public plays a key role in successful policing. “We certainly didn’t do a great job that day,” Stewart said. “I’m sorry we let you down that day.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nWaterbury: Ian Hockley testified Tuesday that he was ridiculed online as a “party boy” and an actor after posting a video of the memorial service for his 6-year-old son, who was killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook school massacre. Hockley is the latest family member of the 26 victims of the shooting to testify at the defamation trial of Alex Jones, in which a jury is deciding how much the conspiracy theorist must pay for spreading the lie that the shooting was a hoax. Hockley, who lost his autistic son, Dylan, in the shooting, testified that he became the target of conspiracy theorists because he smiled during what he found as an uplifting memorial service. “That is what that video started to attract is people saying this must be fake,” he said. “ ‘He’s an actor. He’s smiling. Oh, you’re out of character’ – all of those things started to appear until we took our video down.” Earlier in the trial, other victims’ relatives gave often emotional testimony describing how they endured death threats, in-person harassment and abusive comments on social media by people calling the shooting a hoax. Some moved to avoid the abuse. The jury of six will determine how much in damages Jones and Infowars’ parent company, Free Speech Systems, should pay relatives of five children and three adults killed at the school for saying the shooting didn’t happen and inflicting emotional distress. An FBI agent who responded to the shooting also is a plaintiff.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A man was killed when he was pinned beneath a truck, police said. Officers were called to Beehler Court in the Wilmington area Sunday for a report of a person hit by a vehicle, New Castle County Police said in a news release. When officers arrived, they found a 46-year-old man pinned beneath a Ford F-350 pickup truck, police said. Officers and paramedics tried to resuscitate the man, but their efforts were unsuccessful, and police said he was pronounced dead on the scene. The initial investigation revealed that the man got out of the truck while it was still in gear, and he was hit by the truck, then became pinned beneath it, police said. His body was turned over to the Delaware Division of Forensic Sciences.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: First lady Jill Biden paid tribute Friday to Jacqueline Kennedy, a predecessor 60 years ago, for her pivotal role in preventing the teardown of historic buildings on iconic Lafayette Square near the White House. Biden helped the White House Historical Association, an organization that Kennedy helped spearhead, unveil a medallion of the former first lady, designed by American artist Chas Fagan, in front of the association’s office on the square. The wife of President John F. Kennedy is widely credited with ushering in an emphasis on historic preservation at the White House during her 1,036 days as first lady. Lafayette Square, just north of the White House, over the years has become a gathering place for protesters, from suffragists in the early 20th century to Vietnam demonstrators in the 1960s to Americans speaking out for policing reform in 2020. In quieter daily times, it is a city oasis for tourists and for office workers on lunch breaks. The bas relief of Kennedy sits in a new garden at the front of the association’s office, known as Decatur House. It includes one of her best-known quotations: “The White House belongs to the American people.” Jill Biden said Kennedy worked to save the park and surrounding historic townhouses “because we all deserve to experience our rich history, the full, complex and beautiful story of who we are.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: Prosecutors in the penalty trial of school shooter Nikolas Cruz began their rebuttal of the defense case Tuesday by showing the jury swastikas he drew on a gun magazine and his boots, his online racism and misogyny, and his online searches for child pornography. Prosecutors are trying to show that Cruz’s murder of 17 people at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School four years ago was driven by antisocial personality disorder – commonly known as being a sociopath – and not fetal alcohol spectrum disorder as the defense contends. Cruz, 24, pleaded guilty last October to the Feb. 14, 2018, murders – the trial is only to decide whether he is sentenced to death or life without the possibility of parole. Detective Nick Masters, an online investigator, then testified about racist and sexist searches and comments Cruz made starting about eight months before the shootings. Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer only allowed prosecutors to present a fraction of the searches and comments Cruz made, saying more would be excessively prejudicial. Jurors were told Cruz wrote that “the Nazi party will rise again.” He made searches and comments using a racial slur directed against Black people. He wrote that he punched his widowed mother and called her a slur used against women. He wrote that “women are less important than a dog.” He also made comments extolling animal abuse, saying he had killed 12 cats and writing: “I am glad when animals die. It makes me happy.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: State regulators began hearings Tuesday on Georgia Power Co.’s request to raise rates by 12% over the next three years, setting up clashes over how much profit the utility should earn, how much solar panel owners should be paid and how rates should be structured. The five elected members of the Public Service Commission are scheduled to decide in December on the company’s request to collect a cumulative $2.8 billion more from its 2.3 million customers beginning in January. Changes are likely before any vote. The company says it needs more money to improve the grid, retire old coal plants, acquire electricity from new sources and upgrade customer-facing computer systems. A residential customer who uses 1,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per month pays Georgia Power an average of $128 a month now, the company has said. Under the plan, that would rise by $14.32 a month in 2023, reaching a total of $16.29 more over the three-year period. That’s nearly $200 a year more by 2025. However, electricity bills are likely to go up even more. Commissioners have already approved plans for the company to increase rates by $3.78 a month when the first of two new nuclear units being built at Plant Vogtle starts generating electricity, likely early next year. A bigger increase could follow the second new reactor coming online, possibly in 2024.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A man pleaded not guilty Monday to charges he kidnapped and sexually assaulted a 15-year-old girl and forced her to smoke meth. Duncan Mahi, 52, also requested a trial by jury. Judge Wendy M. DeWeese maintained bail for Mahi at $2 million and set his trial date for Feb. 7. According to an indictment filed Wednesday, Duncan forced the girl to tie up her boyfriend at a Anaehoomalu Beach in Waikoloa, put a knife to her throat and kidnapped her. He’s charged with 11 counts, including kidnapping, terroristic threatening, robbery, sexual assault and methamphetamine trafficking. If found guilty, he could face life in prison without the possibility of parole because he was convicted twice for two separate 2018 cases of terroristic threatening. Police issued an Maile Amber Alert, similar to the Amber Alert for missing children in other states, shortly after the girl’s kidnapping on Sept. 16. Police said the girl managed to get free one day later after she convinced Mahi to take her to a restaurant in Hilo to get something to eat, and people recognized her from the alert.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Universities across the state are warning staffers not to refer students to abortion providers, and at least one public university is barring employees from telling students how to obtain emergency contraception or birth control as well. It’s the latest restriction in a state that already holds some of the strictest abortion laws in the nation. “This is going to have a very broad impact,” said Mike Satz, an attorney and former faculty member and interim dean at the University of Idaho’s College of Law. “It’s going to have a very strong chilling effect on free speech, and it’s going to scare people. I’m afraid it’s going to scare people from going to school here or sending their kids to school at Idaho institutions.” The prohibition against referring students to abortion providers or “promoting” abortion in any way comes from the “No Public Funds for Abortion Act,” passed by Idaho’s Republican-led Legislature in 2021. Boise State University, like the University of Idaho, told faculty members in a newsletter earlier this month that they could face felony charges for violating the law. Idaho State University did not respond to messages asking if it had issued similar guidance. The law also bars staffers and school-based health clinics from dispensing or telling students where to obtain emergency contraception, such as the Plan B pill, except for in cases of rape.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Tuesday that the state’s relatively low jobless rate will help him keep his promise to pay off coronavirus-era debt in the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund by year’s end. The Democrat announced he will transfer $450 million from the account set aside to pay jobless benefits toward the debt that ballooned to $4.5 billion during business closures forced by COVID-19. That decreases the remaining balance of the federal loan to $1.8 billion, which Pritzker pledged will be eliminated by the new year. Illinois joined dozens of other states in borrowing money to pay unemployment claims, which in Illinois surged in spring 2020 to levels not seen since 1982. “With the COVID-19 pandemic came a disaster of a different kind,” Pritzker said at a Chicago news conference. “All across the United States, to make sure eligible individuals could get access to unemployment benefits, extraordinary measures were taken by state unemployment trust funds because nearly none … were funded enough to cover that kind of an emergency.” The General Assembly, controlled by Democrats, and Pritzker agreed last spring to use $2.7 billion in federal pandemic relief funds to more than halve the debt. Republicans argued for paying the entire balance with federal money while it was available.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Satanic Temple is suing the state on claims a near-total abortion ban violates the rights of its Hoosier members who want abortions after their birth control failed. A lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana by the Massachusetts-based religious association says it brought the lawsuit on behalf of anonymous women from Indiana who say they became pregnant by accident despite using contraceptives. Gov. Eric Holcomb and Indiana Attorney General Todd Rokita are listed as defendants. The new law bans abortions except in cases of rape or incest up to 10 weeks post-fertilization, when pregnancy poses a risk to the life or long-term health of the mother, or in cases of fatal fetal anomalies. Enforcement of the law was put on hold last week by a Monroe County judge who found that it may violate the Indiana Constitution. Rokita has already appealed the judge’s decision. The Satanic Temple has more than 11,300 members in Indiana, according to its lawsuit. The group “venerates, but does not worship,” the allegorical Satan as featured in the 17th-century epic poem “Paradise Lost” by John Milton. Members follow a set of tenets including the belief that a person’s body is subject to their will and their will alone, the lawsuit says, and that beliefs should “conform to one’s best scientific understanding of the world.”\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Cattle producer Bryan Sievers thinks the black-eyed Susans, purple coneflowers and native grasses in his eastern Iowa prairie can help warm homes and tackle water pollution, erosion and other pressing environmental problems in the state. Thanks to a five-year, $80 million federal grant, Sievers will work with Missouri business Roeslein Alternative Energy, Iowa State University and a dozen other groups to test whether U.S. farmers can make money turning prairies and manure into renewable fuel. Sievers and his partners plan to mix harvested prairie, cover crops and conservation grassland with cattle manure in an anaerobic digester to make renewable natural gas that will go into a pipeline that feeds homes and businesses or be compressed to power trucks and other vehicles. The project is one of 70 that the U.S. Department of Agriculture recently awarded $2.8 billion, a total the federal agency nearly tripled after receiving about 450 requests. The projects seek to create new carbon markets that pay farmers for work to reduce the environmental impact of commodities like corn, soybeans, beef and pork. Sievers and his partners expect their project will help pave the way for more on-farm digesters that can reduce odor from cattle, pig and other livestock operations; cut harmful methane, carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions; and encourage farmers to plant prairies, conservation reserve grasses and annual cover crops on marginal farmland, as well as buffers along rivers, lakes and streams.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: A man was sentenced Monday to 18 months in prison for his role in a hoax phone call that led police to shoot and kill an innocent man in 2017. Shane Gaskill was sentenced after pleading guilty in May to wire fraud, KSN reports. He was originally placed on probation but faced renewed prosecution after violating the terms of his probation. Prosecutors said Gaskill got into an argument in December 2017 with Ohio gamer Casey Viner over a $1.50 bet. Using an old Wichita address Gaskill had given him, Viner persuaded Tyler Barris in Los Angeles to call Wichita police and say a kidnapping and shooting had happened at the address, prosecutors said. It’s called “swatting,” a form of retaliation in which someone makes a false report to police to send first responders, including SWAT teams, to someone’s address. Andrew Finch, 28, who lived at the address, was shot and killed by police after he opened the front door to see what was going on outside. Barris was sentenced to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty to 51 counts of making fake emergency calls and threats around the country, including the one that led to Finch’s death. Viner served 15 months in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and obstruction of justice.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a woman who shoplifted about $80 worth of items from a Walmart self-checkout station should not face a felony that carries five to 10 years in prison – a punishment that Attorney General Daniel Cameron defended. All seven justices instead agreed with the Kentucky Court of Appeals, which had said it was “inherently unfair to convict somebody of a class C felony for theft of goods worth $80,” and the high court sent the case back to Pulaski Circuit Court, where a jury had initially found Chasity Shirley guilty of “unlawful access to a computer.” Shirley, 34, will now likely receive a directed verdict, which would see her felony conviction dismissed in court. While shopping in 2018 at a Walmart in Somerset, Shirley pulled what retailers call a “switcheroo” by switching the bar codes from a toothbrush holder with those from a more expensive children’s rug and slipcover before checking herself out of the store. A loss-control associate caught her, and the cost difference between the item she paid for and the two items she tried to take was $80.80. She also allegedly “pushed and elbowed” a loss prevention manager as she exited the store but was later found not guilty of a fourth-degree assault charge at trial, the Kentucky Supreme Court noted.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A social services nonprofit long called the Kingsley House renamed itself Tuesday, dropping the name of a Victorian clergyman who is perhaps best remembered as the author of a children’s fantasy novel but held profoundly racist views. For 126 years it was Kingsley House, named both for author and social reformer Charles Kingsley and for the founder’s son Kingsley Warner, who died as a toddler. Now the nonprofit will be called Clover. Officials knew Charles Kingsley had been a chaplain to Queen Victoria, tutor to the boy who became King George V, and had written about 20 books. “And he was quote-unquote a social reformer who helped create the settlement house movement,” said Keith Liederman, CEO of Clover, shortly before Tuesday’s announcement. The Rev. Beverly Warner of New Orleans’ Trinity Episcopal Church founded Kingsley House in 1896 as a settlement house, an inner-city institution dedicated to fighting poverty. The organization’s programs now help children in need, families and community. Its prominence made it a stop in Democrat John Edwards’ unsuccessful campaign for president in 2007. Its community outreach was why former Presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush visited there in 2006 to announce $9.7 million in grants to help victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Congressional candidates in a hotly contested race snipped at each other Tuesday about a contribution from the leader of a conservation group that has discouraged consumers from buying lobster. Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden is defending his seat in Maine’s 2nd Congressional District against Republican former U.S. Rep. Bruce Poliquin and independent candidate Tiffany Bond. Poliquin’s campaign on Tuesday called on Golden to return a contribution of $667 from Julie Packard, the executive director of Seafood Watch. The group based at the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California that Packard helped found added American and Canadian lobster to its “red list” of seafood species to avoid this summer because of the risk fishing gear poses to endangered whales. Poliquin’s camp said that listing has caused economic hardship for fishermen in Maine, where most of the nation’s domestic lobster comes to the docks. “Seafood Watch’s warning to consumers to avoid Maine lobster, on top of forty-year high inflation and fuel prices, have gouged Maine lobstermen’s paychecks,” said Roy Matthews, a Poliquin spokesperson. Golden’s campaign said he has no intention to return the money and cited Golden’s opposition to new National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration whale protection regulations as evidence that he has the fishing industry’s interests at heart.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A judge granted an emergency petition Friday filed by the Maryland State Board of Elections to enable the counting of mail-in ballots earlier than they were during the state’s July primary. Montgomery County Circuit Court Judge James Bonifant granted the petition, which will allow local elections officials across the state to begin canvassing mail-in ballots on Oct. 1. Bonifant wrote that with so many mail-in ballots, local boards of election would not be able to verify the vote count within 10 days of the general election as required. “There is no doubt that the increased number of mail-in ballots will have an enormous affect on the process of this election,” Bonifant wrote in his ruling. “Mandatory deadlines will be missed if the Court takes no action.” The state elections board said the ruling provides election officials with additional time to canvass and tabulate mail-in ballots to ensure that all critical election-related deadlines established by law are met. “It also enables elections officials to return to a well-established process of canvassing mail-in ballots prior to Election Day, which was allowed in the 2020 General Election,” the board said in a statement.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nProvincetown: A Harwich pig that had long been overshadowed by a diva sibling has risen to celebrity status and beer label glory. A stirring portrait of Bartholomew, a 200-pound half-Julianna, half-mini pig, now graces the cans of a new offering from the Provincetown Brewing Co. The high hog honor has not affected Bart one bit. “He’s kind of like an old man in a sport coat with sneakers on,” owner Emma Bankman said. “He doesn’t care what anyone thinks.” “Bartholobrew,” billed as “a classic wheat ale with sweet, caramelly notes,” is the frothy result of a summer-long pet label contest to benefit Provincetown’s Carrie A. Seaman Animal Shelter. Sherry Brec, CASAS board president, said there were more than 65 animal entries, and the donate-to-vote system generated more than $17,000 for the no-kill facility that places dogs and cats with folks on the Outer Cape. Meanwhile, in Harwich, Bartholomew has finally eclipsed the renown of his domineering half-sister Matilda. According to Bankman, Matilda has long been the boss hog in the house and often shuts the door on Bart, leaving him outside. And Matilda even tried to nose in on Bart’s bowl of celebratory Bartholobrew, a sudsy incursion that was nipped in the bud by an alert Bankman.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: General Motors is stepping back a bit on a return-to-work policy after a backlash from salaried employees. CEO Mary Barra sent out a note to the salaried workforce Tuesday offering an apology of sorts for the timing of putting out a new policy late in the day Friday saying employees would have to return to working in the office three days a week. She said in the update that GM’s plan still will include a more regular in-person presence, but it will not implement any changes to its return-to-the-office policy this year as the company continues to listen to worker feedback. The plan still will ask employees to work in-office three days each week. “The initial letter was a notification, and the purpose of the update is to provide clarification and additional details,” GM spokeswoman Maria Raynal said Tuesday. “The timing has shifted slightly; however, the overall plan has not changed.” In Tuesday’s note sent to employees, Barra wrote: “We want to take the opportunity to address some of the questions, concerns, and misconceptions that we’ve heard. We acknowledge that the timing of the message, late on a Friday afternoon, was unfortunate. It was also unintentional.” GM will communicate more information on its plan next month, Barra said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Republicans attacked Democratic Gov. Tim Walz on Monday after a judge took the rare step of disputing the administration’s claim that the judge prevented the state from cutting off payments to Feeding Our Future, which is the target of a $250 million federal fraud case. The GOP candidates for governor, attorney general and state auditor – Scott Jensen, Jim Schultz and Ryan Wilson – said Walz and other top Democrats should have done more to stop the alleged fraud before it became what federal prosecutors last week called the largest pandemic-related fraud in the country. But the warring political sides disagree on how far Ramsey County District Judge John Guthmann went toward compelling the Minnesota Department of Education to resume payments to Feeding Our Future. A court statement issued late Friday said the judge “never issued an order” for the state to resume payments, but the department produced a hearing transcript showing the judge threatened to hold one attorney in contempt if the state failed to restore the flow of funds. The Republican candidates largely accepted the judge’s version of events. Jensen called for an independent investigation to report back before he and Walz hold their next debate Oct. 18.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The federal government wants to work with officials in the city to reach a legal agreement that ensures Jackson can sustain its water system in the future, Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan said Monday. Federal attorneys also sent a letter to city officials Monday threatening legal action if Jackson does not agree to negotiations related to its water system. Regan returned to Mississippi’s capital city Monday to meet with Jackson officials about the city’s troubled water system. At the meeting with Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba and U.S. Assistant Attorney General Todd Kim, Regan said the federal government would work with the city to “deliver long overdue relief for Jackson residents.” “The people of Jackson, Mississippi, have lacked access to safe and reliable water for decades. After years of neglect, Jackson’s water system finally reached a breaking point this summer, leaving tens of thousands of people without any running water for weeks,” Regan said. “These conditions are unacceptable in the United States of America.” In a Monday letter sent to city officials and obtained by the news station WLBT-TV, Kim and attorneys for DOJ’s Environmental Enforcement Section said they were “prepared to file an action” against the city under the Safe Drinking Water Act but hoped the matter could be resolved through an “enforceable agreement.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: As abuse allegations mount against a Christian boarding school, the way “troubled” children are often whisked away to facilities far from home is under fire. Within what’s known as the secure transport industry, it’s called “gooning.” Brawny men show up under the cover of darkness and force a teenager into a vehicle, taking them against their will to a boarding school, foster home or treatment center. They might be restrained with handcuffs or zip ties. They could be blindfolded or hooded. Criminal charges are rare because the little-known industry is virtually unregulated. In Missouri alone, more than 100 Christian boarding schools promise hope for wayward teens. The former doctor at Agape Boarding School, in Stockton, which serves about 60 teenage boys, was charged last year with multiple counts of sexual abuse of children, and five staff members are charged with abuse. In nearby Humansville, Circle of Hope, a Christian boarding school for girls, closed amid an investigation in 2020. The husband-and-wife co-founders were charged with 99 abuse counts last year, including sexual abuse. The allegations of wrongdoing at Agape and Circle of Hope led state Rep. Keri Ingle, a Democrat, to sponsor a measure signed into law last year that requires more rigorous oversight in Missouri. Now, Ingle said she’ll seek stricter regulations on companies transporting the kids against their will.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: Authorities said Tuesday that they were investigating the shooting of a 6-month-old dog by a woman who skinned the animal and posted pictures of herself with the pelt, apparently believing she had killed a young wolf. The animal was among more than a dozen dogs that local residents reported abandoned last week on national forest land in northwestern Montana near Kalispell, according to the Flathead County Sheriff’s Office. The hunter who shot one of the dogs posted images of herself smiling on social media in front of the animal’s head and hide, which were taken by the sheriff’s office and turned over to a state wildlife biologist, said Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks spokesperson Greg Lemon. The biologist determined the remains belonged to a domestic dog about 6 months old, Lemon said. Officials were investigating if the woman was properly licensed to hunt wolves, he said. The sheriff’s office is investigating both the shooting of the dog and the abandonment of the other dogs but declined Tuesday to release any further information. Lemon said accurately identifying animals before they are shot is a core tenet of hunting. “The vast majority of hunters are very deliberate about when they pull the trigger that the animal in their sights is the animal they are licensed to hunt,” he said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: With Memorial Stadium on the cusp of its 100th anniversary, the University of Nebraska athletic department on Thursday set the stage for a massive renovation that will make the venue more fan-friendly for decades to come. University leaders also announced a new multimedia rights deal that would bring in more than $300 million over 15 years and said that alcohol would be sold at men’s and women’s basketball games at Pinnacle Bank Arena starting this season. The athletic department must get approval from the university Board of Regents, which is expected to approve the plans. The next board meeting is Friday. Nebraska is scheduled to open a $160 million football facility next year, and the Big Ten’s billion-dollar-a-year media rights deal announced this summer will bring unprecedented windfalls to league members. The announcements came less than two weeks after Nebraska began its search for a new football coach following the firing of Scott Frost. Athletic director Trev Alberts said discussions about stadium upgrades and the rights deal have been going on for months, and the timing is coincidental. The Cornhuskers have played in Memorial Stadium since 1923, and incremental improvements have been made over the years, including luxury suites in 1999 and an expansion to more than 85,000 seats in 2013.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A dolphin habitat at a hotel on the Las Vegas Strip has been temporarily closed after the third mammal death at the attraction in five months. Officials at the Mirage Secret Garden and Habitat said an 11-year-old bottlenose dolphin named K2 died Saturday. The cause of death remains unclear, but officials told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that the mammal had been receiving treatment for a respiratory illness. They say Maverick, a 19-year-old bottlenose dolphin, died Sept. 2 following treatment for a lung infection, while 13-year-old Bella died in April after undergoing treatment for gastroenteritis. According to the international organization Alliance of Marine Mammal Parks and Aquariums’ website, a bottlenose dolphin’s life expectancy is about 28 to 29 years. Mirage interim President Franz Kallao said officials were working closely with veterinary and pathology experts to determine the cause of death for K2, who was born at the Secret Garden. “We are also working with additional outside veterinary, water quality, behavioral, animal welfare, and environmental experts to help us conduct a thorough review and inspection of both the animals and the facility,” Kallao said.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDover: A local woman who found herself with an unexpected inheritance and the desire to “do the most good” with the money is helping to make housing for domestic abuse survivors possible. She received more than half a million dollars following the sale of real estate her late uncle’s family business owned. Knowing her family was financially comfortable and living within their means, she did something unexpected: She became an angel investor with a $500,000 investment into Dover Housing Authority-owned property. This income assures the future of the Haven at the Falls project to house domestic abuse survivors, said Ryan Crosby, executive director of the authority. The investment will serve as seed funding to build the affordable housing units. The proposed six-unit apartment development is planned in the Dover Housing Authority’s Whittier Falls neighborhood. The new project was born out of a partnership between the Dover Housing Authority and Haven, a domestic and sexual violence prevention agency. “Our angel investor is a lot like me – frustrated with how little affordable housing there is and how little there is we can do about it,” Crosby said. “This investment allows us to both make a direct, measurable impact in that fight. We both share the belief that housing is a human right.”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: After months of calls to eliminate a state-mandated expensive teacher licensing test blamed for worsening the teacher shortage, Gov. Phil Murphy did away with it – sort of. The Murphy administration said the educative Teacher Performance Assessment would no longer be required in New Jersey, but it must be replaced by a similar test to be used to certify graduates. Murphy issued a conditional veto Thursday to legislation that shifts the burden of certifying teachers from the state’s shoulders to the colleges that train them. Starting in spring 2024, colleges and universities will be required to use their own tests as a final step to certify graduates before they may join the workforce. The conditional veto was welcomed by many of the state’s education-related groups, including the state superintendents’ association, teachers’ unions and school principals’ associations. Some said Murphy waited too long to make a decision about the test. The New Jersey Education Association, the state’s largest teachers’ union, welcomed the move to remove the edTPA but indicated in its statement that the decision could have come earlier and that it continues to delay teacher candidates who are otherwise ready to start working.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Legislators are reconsidering how they evaluate complaints of sexual misconduct against colleagues, amid outrage about the handling of a complaint against an influential senator. A panel of leading lawmakers met Monday to discuss possible changes to ground rules for harassment investigations at the Legislature. “It has become clear that our anti-harassment policy is not working,” said Democratic state Rep. Daymon Ely of Corrales, co-chairman of a legislative ethics committee. “This is intended to start a discussion.” Harassment complaints against lawmakers are often assigned for an initial investigation to a panel of four legislators, which may deadlock on a 2-2 vote. Ely proposed the changes that would assign an outside expert to break any tie vote, with public notice of the outcome. Ely outlined proposals that would remove secrecy provisions that currently prevent people who complain of harassment by legislators from publicly discussing any investigation that has been dismissed without a finding of probable cause. “How do we fix that so that we have closure for those people?” said Democratic Sen. George Muñoz, of Gallup. “It can’t come out in a tie. There has to be closure for both sides.”\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State investigators have substantiated more than 1,600 instances of corporal punishment in New York schools over the past five years, The Times Union in Albany reports. A substantial number of the complaints were in New York City public schools, according to the newspaper. Other incidents included a substitute teacher in Watertown who was fired and arrested for grabbing a student by the throat and forcing him against a wall and a teaching assistant in Syracuse who was transferred and retrained for spanking a nonverbal student. Corporal punishment is generally banned and can be classified as child abuse. In all, the state Education Department documented nearly 18,000 complaints of corporal punishment in public and charter schools from 2016 through 2021, according to the Times Union. The newspaper said it found that school districts have underreported cases of corporal punishment to the federal government and that state Education Department records are not readily available to the public.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Four people pleaded guilty Monday to misdemeanors for their roles in absentee ballot fraud in rural North Carolina during the 2016 and 2018 elections. The convictions stemmed from an investigation that in part resulted in a do-over congressional election. Superior Court Judge Paul Ridgeway accepted the plea agreements, which resulted in no active prison or jail time, in Wake County court. Cases against six other defendants remained pending, with hearings scheduled through the end of next month, Wake County District Attorney Lorrin Freeman said. All 10 defendants, according to indictments handed up in 2019, had a common involvement with Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr., a longtime political operative in rural Bladen County. Dowless also was indicted on more than a dozen state charges, with his case scheduled last year to go to trial last month. He rejected a plea agreement and looked forward to his day in court, according to a friend. But he died in April after being diagnosed with lung cancer. Freeman said at the time that the prosecution of the other cases would continue. Dowless worked in the 2018 congressional race for then-Republican candidate Mark Harris, who appeared to have received the most votes in the general election for the 9th District seat in south-central North Carolina. But allegations against Dowless surfaced, and testimony and other information revealed at a State Board of Elections hearing described him running an illegal “ballot harvesting” operation.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A prison guard was fired over the suicide of a man who was serving life sentences for killing four people. Sgt. Deandre Adams violated corrections policy in failing to adequately check on Chad Isaak, according to a termination letter from the warden at North Dakota State Penitentiary. Adams was fired Thursday. Warden James Sayler noted that Adams had received two previous written reprimands, for failing to report that he had left a missing inmate in a recreational area and for not intervening when two prisoners were potentially exchanging contraband, the Bismarck Tribune reports. “Your credibility, professionalism, and the trust I had in you as a sergeant are irreparably damaged,” Sayler wrote. “This level of trust, which is expected of every team member, is something I no longer have in you, due to your misconduct.” Isaak, 48, died July 31. An investigative report from the state Highway Patrol released last month found that Adams said he failed to adequately check on Isaak twice. It also said Isaak had covered his cell with cardboard. Adams knew inmates were not allowed to cover their cell windows but allowed it as a “courtesy in case they were naked in their cells,” the report said. “He stated they could enforce it but that they would just get more window coverings.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state has officially signed off on its biggest package of incentives tied to job creation – potentially totaling as much as $650 million over 30 years for Intel for its $20 billion investment in Licking County. The Ohio Tax Credit Authority on Monday approved the incentive package, one of six projects the panel approved. As is the case with most projects that come before the authority, there was little discussion about the Intel project before the four members approved it. The $650 million approved Monday is part of a total incentive package from Ohio to Intel that is expected to top $2 billion. Unlike the other state incentives for Intel, the one approved by the authority is based on how many jobs it creates. The incentive begins in 2024; Intel has said in anticipates production of semiconductors to begin in 2025. Intel announced in January its plan to create 3,000 jobs as part of its $20 billion investment in New Albany, the biggest single economic development project in state history. Those jobs will have an annual payroll of $405 million, according to Intel. Intel has said it expects to start recruiting this fall from college campus as it anticipates ramping up hiring in advance of the opening of the two plants.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s Pardon and Parole Board voted 4-1 Tuesday to deny clemency for a man sentenced to die for killing his 9-month-old daughter in 2002, moving him a step closer to his scheduled lethal injection next month. Attorneys for Benjamin Cole, 57, did not dispute that Cole killed Brianna Cole by forcibly bending the infant backward, breaking her spine and tearing her aorta, but they argued that he both is severely mentally ill and has a growing lesion on his brain that has continued to worsen while he has been in prison. Cole has refused medical attention and ignored his personal hygiene, hoarding food and living in a darkened cell with little to no communication with staff or fellow prisoners, his attorneys told the panel. “His condition has continued to decline over the course of this year,” Cole’s attorney Katrina Conrad-Legler said. The lesion on Cole’s brain, which is separate from his diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia, has grown in size in recent years and affects the part of his brain that deals with problem-solving, movement and social interaction, Conrad-Legler said. Cole declined to speak to the panel. Attorneys for the state and members of the victim’s family told the board that Cole’s symptoms of mental illness are exaggerated and that the brutal nature of his daughter’s killing merits his execution.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Two ships that have been abandoned in the Columbia River for years are being removed, and the U.S. Coast Guard is working with state agencies to clean up the fuel and oil that leaked from the vessels. The ships – a Navy tug called the Sakarissa and a Coast Guard cutter called the Alert – first arrived in Portland in 2006 and were brought near Hayden Island in hopes that they could be turned into a museum. But the funding for that project dried up, and they have been abandoned for more than a decade.Both of the ships sunk two years ago. Bill Ryan with the Oregon Department of State Lands said it’s not yet clear why the Alert sunk, but the Sakarissa foundered after someone salvaging metal cut through a pipe, causing it to flood. The Coast Guard raised the 100-foot Sakarissa from the river last week and towed it to a repair service to remove the remaining oil waste from the ship. Metro Council, a regional government agency that serves three counties in northwest Oregon, is spending $2 million to have the ships removed, and the Coast Guard is spending more than $1 million to clean up. The state estimates that there are more than 300 vessels abandoned around Oregon. Removing them all would cost an estimated $40 million.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Mayor Jim Kenney signed an executive order Tuesday banning guns and deadly weapons from the city’s indoor and outdoor recreation spaces, including parks, basketball courts and pools. The order is the latest attempt by Philadelphia officials to regulate guns inside city limits – something made difficult by Pennsylvania’s preemption law that bars municipalities from enacting or enforcing their own stricter gun regulations. Attorneys for the city said the executive order is the city managing its facilities as a property owner, making it different from previous legislation passed by the City Council and struck down in court. The ceremonial signing also comes the day after Kenney spoke at the funeral for Tiffany Fletcher, a 41-year-old mother of three, who was struck and killed by crossfire earlier this month outside of the city recreation center where she worked. A 14-year-old, who was firing at another group of teens, has since been charged in Fletcher’s shooting death. “I watched (parks and recreation workers) yesterday line up on Lehigh Avenue like police officers burying one of their own. … I saw what I usually see when a police officer or firefighter dies in the line of duty. They were all out there lined up like they were on the front line, and they are,” Kenney said, fighting back his emotions.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBarrington: The owner of the historic Belton Court mansion has applied to demolish the deteriorating buildings on the 37-acre property. While the demolition permit has not been granted, there is little Barrington can do to prevent issuing the demolition permit once all the requirements are met, including such items as a plan to dispose of asbestos. Barrington Town Manager Phil Hervey said the mansion, once occupied by the Zion Bible College, was the centerpiece of the town’s 2016 master plan, as well as zoning rules passed specifically for the property that would allow it to become age-restricted housing. He is trying to set up a meeting with the project’s managers to discuss the demolition, but no date has been set. “We cannot prevent the teardown,” Hervey said. “If it meets the technical requirements, I don’t see any way to not issue it at a certain point.” The property has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1976. It was once an 800-acre estate, the country house of Frederick Peck, designed by the Providence architecture firm Martin & Hall. The property is owned by a Chinese investor and holdings company who bought it atpublic auction in 2011 for $3.85 million after town officials backed out of a plan to purchase it from the Zion Bible Institute for $5.2 million. Barrington College occupied the campus in the 1950s until it was bought in 1985 by the Zion Bible Institute, which vacated the property in 2007.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Conservative lawmakers voted Tuesday not to make changes to the state’s abortion laws after this summer’s U.S. Supreme Court decision, meaning rules on abortion likely will not become more restrictive. South Carolina was for decades at the forefront of passing more restrictive abortion laws that challenged Roe v. Wade, before the landmark case was overturned this summer. But the state that helped lead the nation through requiring ultrasounds, parental consent and 24-hour waiting periods before abortions is at an impasse during a special session. The Senate could only muster enough votes to tweak South Carolina’s current six-week ban – which isn’t even in effect at the moment because of a state Supreme Court challenge. The House started its session Tuesday by rejecting a proposal by Democratic Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter to have the right to abortion placed before voters in a constitutional amendment. “Why are you afraid to let the people decide?” Cobb-Hunter asked. “Are you afraid you are going to be proven wrong? I think that’s it.” The rejection of the Senate’s version allows a group of three lawmakers from each chamber to work on a compromise between the Senate bill and the House version, which banned almost all abortions with exceptions for pregnancies caused by rape or incest or that threaten the life of the mother up to 12 weeks after conception.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: For the first time this year, anthrax, a serious bacterial disease, has been found in a herd of livestock in western South Dakota. State Veterinarian Dr. Beth Thompson confirmed the presence of the disease in a press release from the South Dakota Animal Industry Board on Tuesday. The disease was found in several deceased cows that belonged to a herd of 160 unvaccinated cattle in Meade County. South Dakota State University’s animal disease laboratory confirmed the disease from samples submitted over the weekend. Anthrax is a pervasive disease that can devastate herds of livestock in a short amount of time, “and much of South Dakota has the potential of experiencing an outbreak,” Thompson said in the release. Cattle that catch anthrax may sudden perish without any visible symptoms. Russ Daly, state public health veterinarian with SDSU, said the general public is not at risk of infection, but farmers need to avoid making direct skin contact with carcasses containing anthrax. Drought, floods and winds can spread anthrax spores to grazing livestock. Spores can also persist indefinitely in contaminated soil and may vegetate in grazeland, which could further spread the infection among South Dakota’s cattle.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state’s textbook commission may need additional staff and its own attorney to deal with the aftermath of a new, controversial Tennessee law requiring schools to catalog and publicize a list of all available library and classroom materials. Textbook and Instructional Materials Quality Commission chair Linda Cash told a legislative subcommittee on Tuesday the law has added a lot of work “to people who already have a full load.” Cash suggested the commission should have an independent attorney who can answer commission questions, as the commission is currently seeking legal answers from the Tennessee Attorney General’s Office. “The way that we’re designed currently, it’s hard to get an opinion,” Cash said. The commission faces a Dec. 1 deadline to issue statewide guidance on the library materials law, which the General Assembly passed this year in response to pushback from conservatives alleging students were being exposed to “inappropriate” school materials. The commission must provide schools’ guidance on determining what is age-appropriate, which is not settled in state law, in addition to establishing an appeals process for local decisions on contested materials.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton ran out of his house and jumped into a truck driven by his wife, a state senator, to avoid being served a subpoena to testify Tuesday in an abortion access case, according to court documents. A process server wrote in an affidavit that he was attempting to deliver the federal court subpoena Monday at Paxton’s home and ultimately had to leave the document on the ground. He said the Republican avoided him for more than an hour from inside his house, then dashed toward the truck, and the couple drove off. Paxton, who is facing a variety of legal troubles as he seeks to win a third term in November, said he avoided the server out of safety concerns and said the news media should be ashamed for reporting on what happened. “It’s clear that the media wants to drum up another controversy involving my work as Attorney General, so they’re attacking me for having the audacity to avoid a stranger lingering outside my home and showing concern about the safety and well-being of my family,” Paxton wrote on Twitter on Monday night. On Tuesday, a judge hearing the lawsuit by nonprofit groups that want to help Texans pay for abortions out of state granted Paxton’s request to quash the subpoena.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: State wildlife officers are launching a new drone team to help prevent vandalism and provide law enforcement on public lands. Five Division of Wildlife Resources officers completed various licensing and training requirements with the Federal Aviation Administration to become certified law enforcement drone operators and staff the first Unmanned Aerial Systems team. “Using drones will help us more effectively solve wildlife crimes, and having trained law enforcement drone pilots will also allow us to assist other law enforcement agencies with search-and-rescue efforts or any other investigations,” DWR Captain Wade Hovinga said. The specialized drone officers function similarly to a K-9 officer team, called in to help with situations like search-and-rescue operations, searching for evidence of illegally taken wildlife, assisting biologists with wildlife surveys and investigating hunting-related shooting incidents. “Utah conservation officers are public servants, and these new tools will help us better serve the public, whether we’re solving poaching crimes or locating lost hunters,” Hovinga said. DWR officers patrol Utah’s mountains, lakes and unpopulated areas, often on foot or on off-road vehicles or even on horseback, investigating wildlife-related violations.\n\nVermont\n\nNorthfield: A student at a military college who sued top Pentagon officials after he was deemed unfit for service because he tested positive for HIV has settled his lawsuit and plans to pursue his dream of becoming an Army officer, his lawyers said Tuesday. “I am incredibly grateful to be back on track to obtain a contract with the ROTC and then commission as an officer,” Eddie Diaz, a student at Norwich University, said in a statement released by Lawyers for Civil Rights. “I just want an opportunity to serve my country, and I believe that should be available to all eligible Americans.” The plaintiff in the lawsuit filed in Burlington in May was listed as John Doe, but Diaz is now using his real name publicly. Diaz, 21, of Revere, Massachusetts, said in the complaint that he tested positive for HIV in October 2020 during his sophomore year at Norwich, the nation’s oldest private military college. He was deemed unfit for service and dropped from the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps and the Vermont National Guard in violation of the U.S. Constitution and federal law despite being “healthy, asymptomatic and on a treatment regimen that renders his viral load undetectable,” according to the suit. Military officials never asked him how he manages his HIV or spoke to his treating physician, and he was never examined by a military doctor, the suit said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The Albemarle-Charlottesville Historical Society is creating a database with the information it has uncovered about enslaved people in the area so descendants can make connections. The goal is to allow descendants’ voices to guide the process for creating some kind of memorial for the site, The Daily Progress reports. Charlottesville native Diane Brown Townes knew some of her family history from records kept in an old tattered family Bible passed down for generations, and she knew she had ancestors who were enslaved in the region. But until recently, she had no idea some of her people may be buried in unmarked graves in a city park she’d spent lots of time in over the years or that she’s been living next door to relatives without knowing it. The Charlottesville officials believe there are at least 43 enslaved people buried at Pen Park in unmarked graves. The graves are adjacent to a cemetery belonging to the Gilmer family, which owned a tobacco plantation on the land where the city-owned park and golf course are today. The Albemarle-Charlottesville Historical Society started researching the probable identities of the people buried in the park last year. Members have been able to identify and connect with several area residents likely to have ancestors buried in the park. “For me, it’s finally being able to understand your feeling, a sense of being. I really never felt connected to history. I was always taught dates from a more white, patriarchal perspective,” Townes said.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The National Transportation Safety Board and the U.S. Navy have started efforts to recover the wreckage of a floatplane that crashed in the Puget Sound earlier this month, killing all 10 people on board. A barge that’s been equipped to conduct the recovery entered the shipping channel Monday, KING-5 News reports. It was expected to drop anchors near the suspected wreckage location before a team arrived at the barge Tuesday. The U.S. Navy will use a remotely operated vehicle Deep Drone 8,000, a barge and a crane in recovery efforts. The remotely operated vehicle will collect smaller pieces of wreckage into baskets for the crane to lift, the NTSB said. Some items from the plane have already been recovered, including foam fragments, a seat cushion, a seat belt, dispatch paperwork, flooring structure remnants and some personal items belonging to the victims, according to the NTSB. The plane was traveling from Friday Harbor on San Juan Island to the Seattle suburb of Renton when it crashed Sept. 4. Only one body was found, identified as Gabby Hanna, of Seattle. Officials say determining the probable cause of the crash could take 12 to 24 months.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A protester who was forcefully removed from the House of Delegates gallery after allegedly disrupting debate on a bill to ban abortion earlier this month was arrested more than a week after she and others rallied against the ban at the state Capitol. Lindsey Jacobs, a 38-year-old lawyer from Morgantown, was arrested Friday and charged with three misdemeanors: obstructing an officer, willful disruption of governmental processes, and disorderly conduct against “the peace and dignity of the state,” according to a copy of the arrest warrant. Jacobs, who runs advocacy programs for a nonprofit legal services organization, was removed from the House chamber’s gallery Sept. 13 while listening to lawmakers discuss legislation that bans abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with few exceptions. Republican Del. Margitta Mazzocchi said people who want to protect against pregnancy can buy emergency contraceptives – known as “Plan B” pills – over the counter. “Not if you’re poor,” Jacobs shouted down at lawmakers, followed by shouts from others sitting in the gallery. Jacobs said she became frustrated listening to Mazzocchi’s speech because she felt like the lawmaker was overlooking that the pills cost between $40 and $50, an amount she said is “cost-prohibitive for a lot of people.”\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: All records from the closed Republican-ordered investigation into the 2020 presidential election in the state are being uploaded to a website “for all to see,” an attorney told a judge Tuesday. The investigation was led by former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who was fired in August by Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos. He fired Gableman just days after Vos won his primary over an opponent whom Gableman and ex-President Donald Trump endorsed. But the office Gableman led still exists after he was fired. American Oversight, a liberal watchdog group, has filed four open records lawsuits against Gableman, Vos and the office seeking records created during the investigation. On Tuesday, during a hearing over a lawsuit American Oversight filed seeking to stop the deletion of records, attorney James Bopp said that all electronic and paper records from the office have been turned over to the Assembly chief clerk’s office. The files are being uploaded to a website that will soon be available “for all to see,” said Bopp, who represents the office, which he said has no employees. Hundreds of pages of documents have already been made public as the result of other American Oversight lawsuits. Bopp said the data yet-to-be made public that’s being processed now includes text messages on cellphones used in the course of the investigation.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Gov. Mark Gordon plans to propose spending $25 million in federal pandemic relief on affordable housing projects, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The governor’s office plans to submit its proposal to a legislative committee for a grant program aimed at funding “shovel-ready” projects with the American Rescue Plan Act money, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/09/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/05/19/clinics-kids-ban-pens-changes-benefits-news-around-states/116366192/", "title": "Clinics for kids, ban on pens: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: After COVID-19 disrupted two school years, lawmakers on Monday voted to delay an upcoming state requirement for third graders to pass a reading test before moving up to the fourth grade. The House of Representatives voted 68-27 for the bill by Sen. Rodger Smitherman, D-Birmingham, that would delay the promotion requirement, now set to take effect next year, by two years. The bill now goes to Gov. Kay Ivey. The high-stakes promotion requirement is set to take effect at the end of the 2021-2022 school year, but supporters argued it would be unfair to force the requirement on students who were out of the traditional classroom for long stretches during the pandemic. The bill would move the implementation to the 2023-2024 school year. “These kids have had 14 months of not normal schooling. All they are asking for is a little compassion,” said Rep. Barbara Drummond, D-Mobile. “I have never ever had a bill where I’ve had so many educators call me.” The bill passed with bipartisan support. During an earlier committee meeting, members of both parties described the difficulties students and parents had in keeping up with schoolwork during the pandemic when classrooms were closed.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: Nearly half of residents 16 and older are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, while more than half have received at least one dose, state public health officials said. Data from the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services shows that 46.9% of state residents had received both doses, while 52.6% had received at least one dose, the Peninsula Clarion reports. These rates were above the national average, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These milestones were reached days after Alaska opened up vaccination appointments to children 12 and up following the CDC’s approval of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine for that age group. Anchorage revoked its mask mandate on Friday ahead of its planned expiration date, the same day Juneau’s mask order was eased to allow fully vaccinated people to go in indoor public areas or at crowded outdoor events without a mask. Alaska’s average daily case counts are now trending down significantly statewide, though a few regions are still in the highest alert category based on their current per capita rate of infection, the Anchorage Daily News reports.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The coronavirus pandemic seems to be in a new phase in the state, as vaccinations have increased, and policies have relaxed. After more than a year of several surges in cases, hospitalizations and deaths, trends have been remaining steady at far lower levels than previous months. More people are getting vaccinated against COVID-19 and safely taking off their masks. “We’re at the beginning of the end,” said Dr. Joe Gerald, an associate professor of public health at the University of Arizona’s Mel & Enid Zuckerman College of Public Health. Gerald said he foresees cases continuing at a moderate level through the summer before tailing off in July or August but doesn’t think there is a strong likelihood of a massive outbreak like those last summer and winter. Dr. Joshua LaBaer, executive director of the Arizona State University’s Biodesign Institute, has an optimistic view of the pandemic’s trajectory. “I actually feel like we do see the end in sight,” he said. “ It would take a lot for us to get to a point where we would see a surge like before.” That’s because vaccinations are increasing, with about 44% of all Arizonans having received at least one dose, although vaccine administration is at a pace much slower than previous months as demand wanes. Health experts have said it will take at least 70% of the state’s population to get vaccinated in order to reach what’s known as herd immunity, where enough people are immunized to prevent future outbreaks.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: City officials are looking into why sales taxes were higher than anticipated for all but the first two months of COVID-19’s onset. Sales taxes collected in May 2020 through March 2021 have consistently outpaced monthly totals for the year prior. In 2020, the revenues resulted in roughly $1.8 million more from the three city sales taxes than in 2019. The total sales taxes, which include a 1.25% county sales tax, were more than $1 million above budget, according to City Administrator Carl Geffken. “Has it become part of the underlying amount of sales tax we’re going to receive, or is there an issue, a topic, an item – something – that’s going to make all of this sales tax revenue that we’re not anticipating to come in, is it going to make it a one-off?” Geffken said. Fort Smith Finance Director Andy Richards has reached out to the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration for further details about the source of the increased sales taxes. Tax revenues were expected to fall during March and April 2020, when businesses including bars, restaurants, salons and barbershops were either shut down or greatly limited in their service to prevent the spread of COVID-19. But nonessential retail was never restricted in Arkansas as much as in states with full lockdowns.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPalm Springs: Riverside County will remain in the orange tier for another two weeks after its COVID-19 metrics ticked up slightly and remained above the threshold for lifting more business restrictions, according to data released by public health officials Tuesday. The county reported a case rate of 2.8 new daily cases per 100,000 residents, compared to last week’s 2.7. The county’s coronavirus test positivity rate is 1.6%, and its positivity among at-risk populations is 1.9%, Public Health Director Kim Saruwatari said during a Board of Supervisors meeting. Last week’s positivity rate was 1.6%, and positivity among at-risk populations was 1.8%. In order to move into the least-restrictive yellow tier, a county needs to report fewer than two daily new cases per day, a positivity rate less than 2% and less than 2.2% positivity among at-risk populations, for two consecutive weeks. The county has been in the orange tier of the state’s four-tiered, color-coded reopening framework since April 6. The state plans to eliminate the tier system and fully reopen its economy June 15 if there is enough vaccine supply for all eligible residents ages 16 and older and if hospitalizations rates remain stable and low, especially among fully vaccinated Californians, according to the state’s COVID-19 website.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis announced that some cities will begin to accept state-issued digital identification during traffic stops. A major goal of the digital ID program is to reduce how much time officers spend on the side of the road during traffic stops, the Colorado Public Radio reports, to limit the chance of being hit by passing cars. The Colorado State Patrol was an early adopter of the digital ID allowance. Stops are, on average, 10% shorter when someone uses a digital license, trooper and spokesperson Josh Lewis said. The digital ID works through a smartphone app called myColorado that people can show when they are pulled over, according to state Digital Transformation Director Russell Castagnaro. He said 150,000 people have signed up for a digital ID so far, and 78,000 have used it in the past year. Denise Maes, the public policy director for the ACLU of Colorado, voiced concern about rights to privacy and advised that people should know they do not need to give their phone to an officer. Troopers are trained not to handle people’s phones if they elect to use the digital ID, Lewis said. Rather, people should show the ID on their phone to the officer.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: As other governors have announced plans to end a $300-a-week supplemental unemployment benefit to encourage people to find work, Connecticut is offering a $1,000 signing bonus. Starting May 24, up to 10,000 people considered to have been unemployed on a “long-term” basis will be able to sign up on the state Department of Labor’s website and ultimately get paid the bonus after they’ve spent eight weeks in their new full-time job. “You see the big athletes get a signing bonus. Why don’t you get a signing bonus as well?” asked Gov. Ned Lamont, a Democrat, who announced the new initiative Monday. He said he didn’t consider ending the federal supplement, as many states are doing. He acknowledged there are still residents afraid to work because of COVID-19 and thought it was fair to keep the $300 benefit in place. “But that said, I wanted to do everything I could to incent people to get back to work, make it easier for them to be able to get back to work. If it’s child care, if it’s transportation, if it’s clothing, maybe the $1,000 helps.” he said. “It makes it a little easier for them to get back in the game.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Health and community leaders gathered Sunday to help vaccinate newly eligible teenagers at The Warehouse teen center in an effort to combat vaccine hesitancy and close disparities in Black and brown communities. The event aimed to inoculate some of Delaware’s first eligible teens after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on May 10 authorized the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for use in people 12 to 15 years old. Teenagers and parents expressed their relief and gratitude about receiving the vaccine and encouraged others to sign up for the shots. While she was initially hesitant to get the vaccine, 17-year-old Anaya Patterson was persuaded to do so after hearing from her vaccinated friends and family who remained healthy after getting their shots. Patterson, a board chair at The Warehouse, hoped to do the same and set an example for other teens by getting vaccinated at the event. “I think that I could also be that motivating force for everyone else who is hesitant on getting it,” she said. “I just want to be healthy and leave this all behind me.” Dr. Yvette Gbemudu, chief medical officer at the Henrietta Johnson Medical Center, acknowledged the vaccine hesitancy among Black and brown communities and said she hoped the event would alleviate some of those worries.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser has loosened mask restrictions in the district Monday following last week’s change in guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, WUSA-TV reports. The new recommendation from D.C. Health and Bowser’s office says those who are fully vaccinated do not have to wear a mask indoors or outdoors, except in certain settings. D.C.’s updated mask guidance went into effect immediately. Bowser also said businesses have the right to require patrons to wear masks when they enter an establishment. She said district officials will still require masks in Metrorail and MetroBus areas, schools and child care centers, homeless shelters, schools, health care settings and correctional facilities. Bowser said COVID-19-related mandates for summer camps and recreation centers have also been updated.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: City commissioners are likely to devote the bulk of millions of dollars in federal funding to replenishing public-sector revenue losses accrued during the height of the pandemic last year. They also hope the funding can chip away at homelessness and augment affordable housing and human services. Commissioners will get their midyear budget update Wednesday when city staff present an itemized preliminary budget and preplanning efforts to spend the $46.2 million coming as part of this year’s congressional pandemic relief package. Funds cannot be dispersed until the city’s application to the U.S. Treasury is approved. It will be released in two chunks over the next year, 50% in the next month or so and the rest no more than one year after the first allocation. Budget staff have identified how it could best be spent in the community while also replenishing city coffers after a tough budgetary year. Last year, staff predicted $23.4 million in lost revenue linked to the coronavirus’ impact, mostly due to drops in sales and gas tax, utility collection, recreation and other service, public transit and flights. Staff is recommending $28.2 million in relief money go toward addressing those losses in the general fund and covering losses in capital funding, taxes and other fees.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: People held in a metro-area jail are being denied access to pens, effectively eliminating their ability to communicate with their lawyers by mail, according to a filing in federal court. Civil rights groups sued Clayton County Sheriff Victor Hill and several of his high-ranking subordinates in July, alleging that overcrowding, a lack of personal protective equipment and limited access to cleaning and sanitation supplies were putting people in the county jail at risk of exposure to the coronavirus. A judge in December approved class-action status for the lawsuit, meaning it would include all current and future detainees. After lawyers began communicating by mail with a large number of detainees, jail officials abruptly changed policy to declare pens contraband, confiscated all detainees’ pens and stopped selling them through the commissary, according to a filing Thursday in federal court. The “unprecedented policy” has no legitimate purpose, keeps people held in the jail from being able to communicate confidentially with their lawyers by mail and makes it difficult for the lawyers to gather necessary information from their clients, the filing says. It also violates the constitutional rights of the lawyers and their clients and “supports an inference of unlawful retaliation for protected speech,” the filing says.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The University of Hawaii will soon require students to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to attend in-person classes or be on campus. The rule will take effect when at least one of the three COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized for emergency use receives full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. That could happen this summer. “It is clear that a vaccinated campus is a safer campus for everyone, and a fully vaccinated student community enables the best opportunity for a healthy return to high-quality face-to-face teaching, learning and research,” University of Hawaii President David Lassner said in a statement. The University of Hawaii System’s enrollment is about 49,600 across 10 campuses. Students can request exemptions from the requirement for medical or religious reasons. Those who are not vaccinated will be able to enroll in online courses. Other schools in Hawaii have not made the vaccine a requirement yet. “We evaluate potential policy on our own schedule and will be in communication with our students, faculty and staff as we move into summer,” Hawaii Pacific University spokesman Stephen Ward said. Gov. David Ige said the state is not yet considering requiring vaccines for younger students.\n\nIdaho\n\nMoscow: The Idaho State Board of Education approved the budgets for the state’s four-year higher education institutions Monday, keeping tuitions mostly flat and including few significant increases in fees or other costs. It’s the second year the board has opted not to raise tuition at the University of Idaho, Idaho State University or Boise State University for Idaho students seeking a bachelor’s degree, the Moscow-Pullman Daily News reports. That move has drawn broad support from university leaders. Brian Foisy, the vice president for finance and administration at the University of Idaho, said his school is also keeping tuition flat for out-of-state undergraduates and for graduate students. “The only increases are a 3.9% professional fee increase for the College of Law and a relatively minor increase in our overall student activity fee,” Foisy said. “These are actually not proposals that come forward from the administration of the university but actually proposals that come from the students themselves.” Tuition and fees for undergraduates seeking bachelor’s degrees at the University of Idaho total $8,340 for in-state students and $27,576 for out-of-state students. Foisy said that’s significantly lower than average student-borne costs at similar schools.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The state is now officially allowing vaccinated people to go without masks in both indoor and outdoor settings, aligning with new federal recommendations issued last week. People who have received a full COVID-19 vaccine series can resume daily activities without wearing a mask, including many indoor activities considered high risk, such as dining, seeing a movie or attending a crowded worship service at a local church, the Illinois Department of Public Health determined Monday. Masks are still recommended in medical settings and on public transportation. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the new guidelines were a step in the right direction toward normalcy for the state but also supported those who are still cautious about taking off their masks before the pandemic is fully in the rear view. Dr. Ngozi Ezike, IDPH’s director, reminded people that the pandemic still isn’t quite over and implored them to get vaccinated and join others in taking off their masks. “While more than 64% of adults in Illinois have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, we need to increase that number,” Ezike said. “To slow down disease spread and the development of even more deadly variants, we need as many people as possible to be vaccinated.”\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Lawyers for Gov. Eric Holcomb are deriding the state attorney general’s arguments that he can block the governor from asking the courts to stop a new law giving legislators more authority to intervene during public emergencies. Holcomb’s lawyers maintain in a new court filing that Attorney General Todd Rokita is making “absurd” arguments that he alone has the legal authority to represent the state in court and can decide whether the new law is constitutional. The legal dispute between the two Republicans stems from Holcomb’s lawsuit arguing that the law passed this spring by the GOP-dominated Legislature is unconstitutional because it gives lawmakers a new power to call themselves into a special legislative session during emergencies declared by the governor. Holcomb’s lawyers said in Monday’s Marion County court filing that the governor’s office was created by the state constitution to head the executive branch, while the attorney general was created by state law and can’t supersede the authority of the governor or the courts. Rokita’s office didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Tuesday.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: For its annual Day of the Dead holiday program, the Des Moines Art Center this year will be remembering the names, faces and stories of Iowans who lost their lives to COVID-19. The center is seeking submissions for its “Día de los Muertos: Recuerdo” (“Day of the Dead: I Remember”) program, which will span six weeks beginning in mid-September. “The COVID-19 pandemic has left many communities all over the world grieving,” Museum Educator Mia Buch said in a news release. “We intend to honor the lives of those lost in Iowa by making their stories a part of our yearly Day of the Dead celebration, where the traditions of the Latinx community provide ways to come together and bring us closer to our loved ones who have passed.” The 21st annual celebration will be mainly virtual but will include traditional dance, food, music and art. There also will be a memorial slideshow of honoree submissions, and the art center will select four for feature videos to be posted on its website and social media channels. Honorees will be considered regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation, the art center said in its release. The honoree submission form, available online, is due by Aug. 1. Submissions for the feature honoree videos are due by May 31.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Schools are stepping up efforts to administer COVID-19 vaccines to newly eligible 12- to 15-year-olds as more districts relax mask rules or face pressure to do so. Hundreds of students from public and private schools gathered Monday to get immunized at Topeka High School. “We were surprised that so many people were here,” said Richard Bolejack, as he took his daughter, a freshman at nearby Shawnee Heights High School, to the vaccine clinic. “We were like, ‘Wow,’ because we didn’t think that would be the case.” The students were joined by Gov. Laura Kelly, who touted the effort as the state aims to increase its vaccination rate. School districts from Manhattan to Olathe are conducting similar clinics, and the Kansas Department of Health and Environment and the Kansas National Guard are chipping in support as needed. But the governor pointed to a statewide drop in demand, stressing that the next frontier would be making COVID-19 shots available at doctor’s offices throughout the state. “We thought it very important to take the vaccines to the people, rather than expecting them to come to something like this,” Kelly said. “They made it very clear that wasn’t going to happen anymore.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Cutting off the extra federal payments going to unemployed Kentuckians would hurt the state’s economy as it recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday. The Democratic governor said he’s willing to consider ending the weekly $300 federal unemployment payment eventually but quickly added: “That doesn’t mean we will.” The extra money is set to expire in September. The Bluegrass State’s most powerful Republican, U.S. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, criticized the extra federal benefits Monday. He said governors are “having to clean up this mess” as many businesses struggle to find workers. Meanwhile, two GOP state lawmakers urged Beshear to terminate the supplemental payments, saying the benefit is contributing to a labor shortage. Beshear said he’s trying to “thread the needle” of maintaining the extra federal payments that pump tens of millions of dollars into the state’s economy each week while encouraging people to go back to work as the economy fully reopens. Much of the extra money is spent at grocery stores and other retail businesses, the governor said. “An immediate termination of those extra benefits would hurt our economy and hurt a lot of groups – restaurants and others – that have suffered during this pandemic,” Beshear said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A federal appeals court on Monday declined to review last year’s decision by a federal judge that expanded early voting and mail balloting in Louisiana during last fall’s presidential election. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans said the case is now moot, rejecting arguments from two key state Republican officials that the ruling by U.S. District Judge Shelly Dick in Baton Rouge was wrong and could set the stage for more such orders. The ruling from a panel of three judges said in part that “even assuming that issues similar to those that arose in this case as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic may come up again in future cases, there is no indication that the parties in those cases will be unable to use the tools available to obtain meaningful review.” State officials agreed to expand voting opportunities during summer elections to prevent the spread of the coronavirus but were unable to reach accord on the fall elections. Dick ordered similar expansions for November and December balloting. Her Sept. 16 order was the result of a lawsuit filed by voting rights advocates, including the Louisiana State Conference of the NAACP and the Power Coalition for Equity and Justice.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state might extend the ability of its residents to use telehealth services beyond the coronavirus pandemic. Many people have transitioned to telehealth during the pandemic, in part to avoid crowded doctor’s offices. Democratic Sen. Heather Sanborn of Portland has proposed a bill to guarantee Maine health care providers have a right to provide telehealth services in the future. Sanborn’s proposal would also allow health care licensing boards to create rules and practices for health care workers. She said it’s time for the state to “make it clear that telehealth is a proper form of health care delivery and ensure that people across our state can continue accessing these critical services no matter where they live or what the circumstances are.” The proposal would add language to health care licensing board statutes to guarantee providers have a right to provide it, Sanborn said. The measure is expected to be considered in committee.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: Outdoor stages, family entertainment, local art, diverse food and beverages will return to downtown this year for the National Folk Festival. The Sept. 10-12 event will mark the 80th National Folk Festival and the third time the event takes place in Salisbury. Organizers hope the in-person celebration taking over downtown will also be a strong sign of the city’s continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, which previously delayed the anniversary festival in 2020. Festival organizers announced the event’s first six performers this week: Balla Kouyate & Famoro Dioubate, the Del McCoury Band, Grupo Rebolu, the Savoy Family Cajun Band, Shemekia Copeland and the Sri Lankan Dance Academy of NY. “These artists hint at the extraordinary diversity of cultural traditions that will be featured at this year’s National Folk Festival – the event’s 80th anniversary – and each represents the highest level of achievement and excellence,” said Lora Bottinelli, National Council for the Traditional Arts executive director. “There are no repeats from 2018 or 2019, and it’s all free!”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state’s three casinos continued their pandemic recovery in April. The nearly $85 million in gross gambling revenue at the casinos was up slightly from the $84 million in revenue in March, according to data released Monday by the state gambling commission. Massachusetts collected more than $24 million in taxes from gambling in April – the most since before the start of the pandemic. Revenue was up at both Encore Boston Harbor and the Plainridge Park slots parlor in Plainville but declined slightly at MGM Springfield month over month. The state’s casinos are still operating under capacity limits meant to control the spread of the coronavirus. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission plans to meet before the end of this month to discuss loosening occupancy and mask-wearing rules. Massachusetts casinos were closed in March 2020 because of the pandemic but were allowed to reopen last July under strict capacity limits.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: The state will reinstate a requirement that people receiving unemployment benefits show they are actively searching for work, effective May 30, but has no plan to end a $300 weekly federal supplement going to 816,000 jobless residents. All seven of the state’s Republican U.S. House members wrote a letter to Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Monday urging a halt to the extra payment, which is on top of maximum state benefits of $362 per week. “We call on you to end participation in this program to get our state’s economy back on track and ensure our employers have access to the talent they need to return to normal,” they wrote, echoing a call that at least one small-business group made last week. But Lynda Robinson, spokeswoman for the state Unemployment Insurance Agency, said it does not plan to end any federal unemployment programs, including for self-employed or gig workers who began qualifying at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The work-search requirement, which was waived starting in March 2020, will be restored. Claimants will have to conduct at least one work-search activity for each week they certify for benefits.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: With masks off for many and summer on the horizon, a return to travel is expected to help fuel the economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. America’s $1.1 trillion travel industry was among the sectors hit hardest by the pandemic, suffering a never-before-seen 42% decline in revenues in 2020. In Minnesota, the $16.6 billion leisure and hospitality industry took a $7.1 billion hit in 2020, with the largest decline in lodging, where revenues fell 37%. On the upside, an Explore Minnesota Tourism survey found that 6 in 10 Minnesota tourism and hospitality businesses surveyed had already returned to pre-pandemic business levels or expect to get there by the end of the year. The overall forecast is that 2021 will see an 80% increase in revenues from 2020. That means travelers who are aching to get out of town but not yet ready to get on an airplane are in a prime position to feed the state’s economic recovery.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: If COVID-19 were a fire, it’s not down to the embers yet. “There’s still some flame,” Mark Horne, Mississippi State Medical Association president, said during a livestreamed discussion Friday. Daily COVID-19 cases reach have average roughly 200 to 230 cases, State Epidemiologist Paul Byers estimated. While that’s much lower than the numbers when the coronavirus surged in winter, thanks to vaccines, coronavirus variants still pose a problem, among other issues. State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs predicted the state would likely soon see a bump in cases, but not to the extent of the winter months. “In a way, we’re halfway through the pandemic; it’s just gonna go slowly,” Dobbs said. “I really do believe you’re likely to get COVID or the vaccine.” Getting vaccinated, all three officials agreed, is the key to keeping healthy and returning to the state closer to normal. The Mississippi State Department of Health reported 608 newly confirmed virus cases Tuesday, including more than 400 identified over the past several months and added to the overall tally. The health department also reported 11 coronavirus-related deaths Tuesday. Since the virus hit the state in March 2020, a total of 315,634 cases and 7,268 coronavirus-related deaths have been reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The city is ditching its indoor mask rule – but not until summer break begins for the area’s public school students. The City Council voted Monday to drop the requirement after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued new guidance last week that Americans who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 need no longer wear face masks. Springfield-Greene County Acting Health Director Katie Towns said waiting until 11:59 p.m. May 27 for the change to take effect “will allow children not yet eligible for a vaccine to continue to be protected with masks.” She said that “we need to spend these next two weeks working hard to improve our vaccination rates while we wrap up school.” Towns told the council that Greene County’s rolling seven-day coronavirus infection rate has declined 93% since its wintertime peak. “These lower numbers give us confidence in our ability to continue to respond to COVID-19,” she said, citing health department efforts such as contact tracing investigations to slow the spread of the disease. Missouri’s major cities and many nearby counties, including Kansas City, St. Louis and St. Louis County, all ended mask mandates Friday.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: The state posted 148 new COVID-19 cases Tuesday, bringing Montana’s total active confirmed reports to 974. Cascade County reported 27 new cases Tuesday. The county continues to lead the state in active reports, now with 225 active cases. The county has recorded 8,780 recoveries and 169 deaths. The state has 108,285 recoveries, 1,602 total deaths and 5,175 active hospitalizations from the coronavirus, according to the state website covid19.mt.gov. The state has administered 1,345,671 tests for the coronavirus, which is 1,671 more than Monday. The first case of COVID-19 in Montana was reported March 11, 2020. To date, there have been a total 774,587 total doses of COVID-19 vaccine administered in the state and 370,768 residents fully immunized against COVID-19. Yellowstone County added the most new cases in the state with 36 new reports, bringing its total to 151 active cases. Gallatin County added 23 new cases for a total of 75 active cases in the county. Missoula County now has 46 active cases of the virus after adding 14 new cases Tuesday.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Lawmakers rejected state-mandated coronavirus protections for meatpacking workers Tuesday, with opponents arguing that slaughterhouses have already taken precautions and that the pandemic is nearly over. Lawmakers voted, 25-18, to sideline the measure for the rest of the year, even though supporters said it was necessary to ensure that all plants are keeping their employees safe. “It’s not whether or not a plant cares about their employees,” said Sen. Tony Vargas, of Omaha, who sponsored the bill. “There is a need for consistency.” The bill faced an uphill battle because of opposition from Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts, who said Monday that it wasn’t needed. Lawmakers narrowly advanced the measure through an initial vote earlier this month, but supporters at the time fell three votes short of the 30 they would have needed to override a veto. Nebraska’s meatpacking companies complained that the bill imposes unrealistic mandates on the industry, including a requirement to maintain a 6-foot distance between employees in break and locker rooms. “It’s just not workable,” said Sen. Julie Slama, of Peru. But Sen. Ray Aguilar, of Grand Island, said he’s spoken with workers who are still fearful about working in plants and want protections in place for one more year, as the bill would have mandated.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state jobless office said Monday that it has signed on with an identity verification system that requires an additional step to let new regular unemployment insurance applicants securely provide personal information online. The Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation said the system, called ID.me, is meant to ensure security and streamline claims. Beginning Tuesday, applicants for regular claims will be required to use the new system if told to do so by the unemployment office, according to the department. Department employment security chief Lynda Parven said the system has been used for Nevada’s Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program and now for regular applications. It is required under the federal Continued Assistance for Unemployed Workers Act of 2020. She called providing benefits to legitimate claimants the top priority. Parven said the credential service provider is federally certified and already being used by more than 25 states, the Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security Administration, Department of the Treasury, and retail and service organizations.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state is getting nearly $10.7 million in federal grants through the federal pandemic relief package signed into law this March to support efforts to combat substance use disorder and increase access to mental health services, New Hampshire’s congressional delegation said Tuesday. The funding comes in addition to $16.3 million provided in the emergency COVID-19 relief package that was signed into law in December for substance use disorder treatment and mental health care. The funds are coming from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. “The pandemic has placed an enormous strain on Granite Staters and underscored the urgent need to provide support for those grappling with mental health challenges and substance use disorders,” U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan said in a statement.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy remained firm Monday that face coverings would still be required indoors at public places for the foreseeable future even after New York officials said they will lift the state’s mask mandate this week. At a briefing just an hour after New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo made his announcement, Murphy said lifting the requirement for vaccinated residents would be impossible to police and could lead to a new wave of COVID-19 cases, since the majority of New Jerseyans are still not fully inoculated. “We need to know unequivocally that doing so will not lead to a backslide in our progress,” he said. It leaves New Jersey among a shrinking pool of states that still require virtually all residents to wear masks inside restaurants, stores and other businesses. Murphy said several times Monday that he will lift the mandate “in the not-so-distant future” but did not offer a timeline or what benchmarks need to be met. “This is not always-and-forever, folks,” he said. “We just need a little more time on the clock.” Republicans were quick to blast the Democratic governor. “Instead of following the science here in New Jersey, we have a governor who continues to restrict personal freedoms to cater to the irrational fears of a timid liberal constituency,” said state Sen. Michael Testa, R-Cape May.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: All new Dona Ana County employees will be required to be vaccinated against COVID-19 as a condition of employment. The policy was announced Saturday in a return-to-work memorandum from county manager Fernando Macias, a copy of which was obtained by the Las Cruces Sun-News and verified as authentic by county attorney Nelson Goodin. The memo says county employees will resume working on site effective June 1, with all locations adhering to the New Mexico Department of Health’s public orders pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic, including changes to the state’s mask mandate Friday that drop mandatory face coverings for fully vaccinated individuals in most situations. Because the county’s mask mandate was enacted in an ordinance, Goodin said the Board of County Commissioners would consider the first reading of a new ordinance mirroring the new mask mandate for publication at their open meeting next week. With 90% of the county’s employees now vaccinated against the disease caused by the coronavirus, Macias wrote to the rest of the workforce: “I strongly encourage you to do so as soon as possible.” The memo doesn’t say whether new employees may request accommodations for the vaccine requirement under the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Andrew Giuliani, the son of former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, announced Tuesday that he is seeking the Republican nomination for governor, potentially setting up a battle with third-term incumbent Democrat Andrew Cuomo. “Giuliani vs. Cuomo. Holy smokes. It’s Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier,” the 35-year-old said in an interview with the New York Post. He also posted a video on Twitter that assailed Cuomo for, among other things, barring gatherings and closing businesses and schools as the coronavirus began killing thousands of New Yorkers last March. “At the first sign of a problem, they chose to shut us down. They take away our freedoms. They quarantine healthy people,” he said. The younger Giuliani served as a White House aide under former President Donald Trump and has more recently been a commentator for the conservative network Newsmax. He has never run for public office. Andrew Giuliani first came to public attention at his father’s 1994 mayoral inauguration when, at age 7, he mimicked his father’s gestures at the podium and repeated some of his words. The spotlight-stealing antics were lampooned by Chris Farley on “Saturday Night Live.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Young drivers whose attempts to get their provisional license were stymied by COVID-19 pandemic delays in the past year would get a timing break under legislation headed to Gov. Roy Cooper’s desk. The Senate agreed unanimously Monday evening to House changes to a bill that would cut the amount of time drivers must hold a learner’s permit before seeking a license that lets them drive unsupervised. The time would be reduced from 12 months to six, but the shorter window would only last for those applying for the “Level 2” license through the end of the year. Bill supporters are seeking Cooper’s signature to make it become law. Original bill sponsor Sen. Vickie Sawyer of Iredell County said the measure still assists those teenagers who couldn’t advance because driver’s education classes were postponed as school activities were shuttered. The young motorists who benefit from the proposed change would still have to log 60 hours behind the wheel with a supervising parent, be at least 16 years old and pass a road test to qualify for the provisional license. Earlier versions of the bill would have reduced permanently the wait time to either six or nine months.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s top oil regulator says crude production grew in March and should keep rising throughout the summer, following a lackluster start to the year. The state’s daily oil output increased 2% to 1.108 million barrels per day in March, according to figures released Friday. State Mineral Resources Director Lynn Helms attributed the uptick to oil companies bringing more wells online that had already been drilled but not yet fracked, a necessary step before a well starts producing oil. Fracking, also known as hydraulic fracturing, involves injecting water, sand and chemicals down a well at a high pressure to form cracks in rock to release oil. At the height of the oil industry’s woes earlier in the coronavirus pandemic, just one crew was working in the state to bring newly drilled wells online. Now there are nine, The Bismarck Tribune reports. Eighteen rigs were drilling for oil in North Dakota on Friday, up from the single digits last summer. Helms described the turnaround as “a nice, gentle recovery.” Oil production in March was nearly 25,000 barrels per day more than in February. Natural gas production grew by 6% in March to 2.879 billion cubic feet per day. The industry captured 94% of the gas it produced and is meeting the 91% target set by state regulators to help alleviate the wasteful flaring of excess gas.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: The state no longer requires fully vaccinated people to wear masks indoors in most situations, under a revised health order released late Monday afternoon. The revised order sets separate face covering and social distancing rules for people based on their vaccination status. The order will expire June , along with all other remaining health orders except those for nursing homes, assisted living facilities and data collection. The order, retroactive to 4 p.m. Friday, aligns Ohio with new guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which said last week that vaccinated people can return to many of their pre-pandemic activities. People who are not fully vaccinated against COVID-19 – defined as two weeks past the first dose of a single-dose shot or the second dose of a two-dose regimen – are still required to wear facial coverings and keep social distancing indoors; outdoors when unable to consistently maintain a distance of 6 feet from others outside their family or household; and on public transportation or in taxis or ride-sharing vehicles. Everyone, regardless of vaccination status, is still required to wear a mask on planes, trains, buses and other public transportation under the order. Businesses can set their own policies. The K-12 school mask mandate remains in place.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state will end a $300-a-week supplemental unemployment benefit next month, Gov. Kevin Stitt announced Monday. To incentivize unemployed people to return to work, Stitt said the state will offer a $1,200 stipend for the first 20,000 workers who get off unemployment and work at least 32 hours per week at a qualifying job. Claimants can begin applying June 28. “As Ronald Reagan once said, the best social program is a job,” Stitt said at a trucking company in Oklahoma City, flanked by several employers who said they are having a hard time finding workers to fill jobs. “These Oklahoma companies are open for business and ready to grow.” The additional $300-a-week federal supplement, along with pandemic unemployment assistance for gig workers and contractors, will end June 26, Stitt said. About 90,000 Oklahomans currently receive the additional benefit, according to the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. Chad Warmington, the head of The State Chamber, an association of businesses and industries in Oklahoma, said many of his members complain that some unemployed residents are making more in jobless benefits than they would at a job.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A bill that would reinstate Oregon’s moratorium on foreclosures for those experiencing financial hardship during the coronavirus pandemic passed the state Senate on Monday. The bill, which would allow homeowners to put their mortgage in forbearance at least through June 30, passed on a 19-9 vote and now moves to the House. The previous state moratorium expired at the end of 2020, but many homeowners continued to struggle to catch up on mortgage payments. The bill could be extended until the end of the year if Gov. Kate Brown lengthens the statewide emergency period. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the state’s existing housing crisis has only been exacerbated. In late April, more than 30,000 Oregon homeowners said they were not caught up on their mortgage payments, based on the U.S. Census Bureau’s most recent Household Pulse Survey. Lawmakers have pushed the housing crisis to the forefront during this year’s legislative session. Last week, they passed a bill that extends the time renters have the time to pay back rent, from July until the end of February 2022. That legislation is now on the governor’s desk.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The president of the state’s largest teachers union expressed support Monday for in-person instruction in the fall, calling it a “top priority” now that many teachers have been vaccinated and older children have become eligible for COVID-19 shots. “As more students are vaccinated over the summer, we believe that in-person instruction is achievable in a way that keeps everyone safe,” said Rich Askey, president of the Pennsylvania State Education Association, which represents 178,000 active and retired educators, health care workers and others. “Educators and support professionals look forward to working with school district leaders, parents and community members to get students on a pathway to achievement as we emerge from this pandemic.” Askey’s statement came days after the leaders of the nation’s two major teachers unions, including PSEA’s parent union, the National Education Association, called for a full return to in-person learning. Most Pennsylvania schools have already resumed at least some in-person instruction, though some are sticking with virtual learning at least through the end of the current academic year. In March, the state prioritized teachers for the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine in a bid to help schools reopen.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s economy is growing as it emerges from the coronavirus pandemic, but it still trails the region and nation, according to a new report. Rhode Island’s gross domestic product is projected to have grown by 3.5% in the first quarter, but that lags New England, with projected growth of 5.2%, and the nation, at 6.4%, according to a report published Tuesday by the Center for Global and Regional Economic Studies at Bryant University and the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council. Rhode Island’s “growth gap” existed before the pandemic but only widened over the past year, the report said. The state regained some jobs but has not made up for losses suffered at the start of the pandemic, according to the report. “We’ve come a long way from our economic freefall last spring,” RIPEC President and CEO Michael DiBiase said in a release, “but the briefing reveals stubborn structural weaknesses that are slowing our recovery and make the Ocean State more vulnerable in the future.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Gov. Henry McMaster has signed into law a bill that forces death row inmates for now to choose between the electric chair or a newly formed firing squad in hopes the state can restart executions after an involuntary 10-year pause. Two inmates who have exhausted their appeals immediately sued, saying they can’t be electrocuted or shot because they were sentenced under a prior law that made lethal injection the default execution method. South Carolina had been one of the most prolific states of its size in putting inmates to death. But a lack of lethal injection drugs brought executions to a halt. McMaster signed the bill Friday with no ceremony or fanfare, according to the Legislature’s website. It’s the first bill the governor decided to deal with after nearly 50 hit his desk Thursday. “The families and loved ones of victims are owed closure and justice by law. Now, we can provide it,” McMaster said on Twitter on Monday. Last week state lawmakers gave their final sign-offs to the bill, which retains lethal injection as the primary method of execution if the state has the drugs but requires prison officials to use the electric chair or firing squad if it doesn’t.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The number of state residents receiving an initial dose of a COVID-19 vaccine has slowed dramatically in recent weeks, prompting medical experts and community leaders to turn to personal conversations to battle misinformation around getting a shot. Just over 4,000 people across South Dakota received their first shot last week, according to the Department of Health – a big drop-off from 26,000 in a week at the end of March. At that point, the state seemed to defy a trend of skepticism in states dominated by Republican politics. South Dakota had boasted one of the nation’s highest vaccination percentage rates; just weeks later, its ranking has tumbled to 24th. “Demand just plummeted,” said Julia Yoder, a spokeswoman for the Brookings Health system who has also been overseeing mass vaccination sites for Brookings County. “Before you couldn’t keep enough in stock, and then it went to crickets. We couldn’t convince people to sign up.” South Dakota appears to have run into what Alan Morgan, the head of the National Rural Health Association, called a “rural wall” of vaccine hesitancy. He said much of the messaging has not been “relevant” to rural communities, adding that “politicians, government officials and movie stars” are not the best messengers to reach rural communities.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Federal support will leave the COVID-19 vaccination site at the Pipkin Building on Wednesday. In six weeks of a federal partnership, the site never lived up to its capacity to administer 3,000 shots a day, or 21,000 each week. Weekly vaccine allocations locally are also set to decline from 60,000, officials said Tuesday, a response to decreased demand. “At any time, if we get a tremendous increase in uptake of vaccinations, we have the ability to flip the switch and to build that capacity back up,” said Gina Sweat, director of fire services at Memphis Fire Department, adding the caveat that a return of federal resources would be unlikely. Help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency arrived April 7. Within the first two weeks of operation, the site nixed appointments in favor of walk-ins but never doled out 3,000 shots a day. In the final four weeks, most days the site never broke 1,000 shots. “I think the closest we came to that was about 2,500 a couple of days,” Sweat said. On Monday, one of FEMA’s last days at the site, 791 doses were administered, city data shows. The Pipkin site will still remain open for vaccinations. Beginning Thursday, the Pipkin site will be open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Saturday. Appointments are not required.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The state on Monday joined the growing number of its counterparts that will stop paying the federally funded $300 in extra pandemic-related weekly unemployment aid, as businesses that scaled back or shuttered during the pandemic are reopening. The extra benefits in Texas will end June 26, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said in a letter to the Biden administration. He joins at least a dozen other governors, all Republicans, who are opting out of the additional federal unemployment benefits this summer. The money is part of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion relief measure approved in March and is set to expire in September. But business groups urged Abbott to opt out early, arguing it was hampering the Texas economy’s rebound. Other expanded unemployment benefits in Texas, including one making gig workers and the self-employed eligible for assistance for the first time, will also end in June. Factors besides the extra money help explain why people who are out of work might be reluctant to take jobs. Government surveys show that some still fear exposure to the coronavirus. Many women, especially working mothers, also left the workforce to care for children still in online school for at least part of the week.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Zion National Park has increased the ticket price for a ride on one of its highly popular shuttles from $1 to $2 per person, per day, in a pandemic-related move. After receiving public comment, the park went ahead with the increase to help cover staffing and operational costs associated with the ticket system. With the pandemic raging last summer, the national park used a ticketing system through Recreation.gov to control crowds and maintain social distancing. The ticket system provides predictable access to the Zion Canyon Scenic Drive, which covers the park’s main canyon and handles the vast majority of the 4 million-plus visitors who come to the park each year. Officials say they expect the ticket system to remain in place through the summer and potentially into the fall, and staff is needed in multiple locations to take tickets, answer questions, keep lines short and maintain social distancing and other pandemic guidelines, according to an April press release from the NPS. “Visitation has increased dramatically from early pandemic levels, necessitating reestablishment of visitor services and work can no longer be delayed on critical park projects, and it is therefore no longer financially feasible to absorb operational costs associated with the ticketing system,” according to the release.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott is asking all Vermonters to show their appreciation for emergency medical service workers by getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Scott has declared this week as EMS week. More than 100,000 requests for EMS response are answered yearly across the state, the Republican governor said Monday. “Add to that the unprecedented challenges required of the state’s individual emergency responders and 168 licensed ambulance and first responder services during the pandemic, and you come up with 2,800 of our fellow Vermonters who deserve every moment of the EMS Week recognition that started on Sunday,” he said in a statement. More than 30 EMS-led vaccination clinics are planned around Vermont this coming weekend, providing the Johnson & Johnson vaccine to anyone at least 18 years old, according to the Health Department. A list of walk-in clinics is available on the Health Department’s website.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state is expecting a half-billion-dollar budget surplus by the end of June, blunting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy, and officials are awaiting a $4.3 billion federal deposit in the state’s coffers any day. Secretary of Finance Aubrey Layne told legislators Monday that he expects state revenues to exceed expenses by more than $500 million in the fiscal year that ends June 30, the Richmond Times Dispatch reports. Layne also expects Virginia to receive its share of federal aid from the latest congressional relief package in one lump sum soon, leading to a special legislative session to determine how to spend it. That federal money doesn’t include $6.6 billion that the federal government is sending to the state for specific categories of programs, such as support for education, child care, transportation and public health. “I don’t think anyone 14 months ago would have thought we’d be in as good a position as we are,” Layne told the House Appropriations Committee. A year ago, state revenues plunged by $700 million in April, compared with the same month in 2019, as Northam and the Assembly froze more than $2 billion in new spending in the budget they’d adopted March 12, 2020, the same day the governor declared a public health emergency.\n\nWashington\n\nBremerton: Kitsap County health officials are teaming up with businesses, community organizations and just about anyone who’s up for hosting a COVID-19 vaccination clinic to immunize a broader swath of the population. “We’re going to take the vaccines to people where they are,” said Dr. Gig Morrow, Kitsap Public Health District health officer. Already gone are the days when a limited supply of COVID-19 immunizations included long lines at mass vaccination clinics around Kitsap. Roughly half the county’s population 16 and older is now fully vaccinated. But health officials know there are others willing to get vaccinated if it were convenient. Morrow said the health district is working with a local auto dealership to offer COVID-19 shots, and Peninsula Community Health Services will soon offer them aboard Washington State Ferries’ Bremerton run. No appointment is necessary, and the shots are free. To top it off, the health district has partnered with Crane’s Castle Brewery in East Bremerton to offer shots to those having a pint of beer from 4 to 8 p.m. Thursday. The Washington Liquor and Cannabis Board has temporarily suspended a ban on free alcohol to allow establishments to give away a drink for those who get a poke in the arm.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice said Monday that he plans to reach out to leaders in the Legislature to decide how to allocate the latest in federal pandemic relief funding. Justice said his staff is working on a spending plan for $678 million from the package signed into law by President Joe Biden. He said House and Senate input will be sought next week. The funding represents half of what the state will receive to offset economic setbacks from the coronavirus pandemic. Because West Virginia’s current unemployment rate is not significantly higher than its pre-pandemic level, the state will receive the rest of its nearly $1.4 billion allotment next year. An additional $516 million is going to every county and some larger cities. The money can be used by state and local governments for relief from the public health crisis. Under guidance the Treasury Department released along with the numbers, it also can be used to offset harm to workers, small businesses and affected industries; to invest in water, sewer and broadband systems; and to replace lost public-sector revenue. Essential workers also can qualify for premium pay under the program. Officials cannot cut taxes, pay down debt or bolster the state’s rainy day fund with the relief package.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican legislators want to end the $300-per-week federal unemployment supplement, which they said Tuesday hurts businesses that are struggling to fill vacancies as customers return amid a loosening of coronavirus restrictions. Republican Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and Sen. Howard Marklein, chairman of the Legislature’s budget committee, called on Democratic Gov. Tony Evers to support the bill they unveiled with the support of a couple of Wisconsin business owners. Evers, who could veto the bill, signaled his opposition. His spokeswoman Britt Cudaback said that “if Republicans are interested in putting this pandemic behind us, they’ll stop playing politics with our economic recovery” and approve Evers’ state budget proposal. Democrats have generally been supportive of the additional unemployment payment, saying other barriers to work are fueling the worker shortage, not the $300. They also point out that Wisconsin’s unemployment rate of 3.8% is below the national average of 6% and near what it was before the pandemic hit. The bill comes after the state chamber of commerce, more than a dozen trade groups, more than 50 local chambers of commerce and others called on Evers to return the state’s unemployment payments to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Tickets to the College National Finals Rodeo are on the table as an incentive for COVID-19 vaccine recipients, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Casper-Natrona County Health Department is holding a “COVID Block Party” on Friday outside Eastridge Mall, giving the rodeo tickets to those who get their shots at the event. A raffle will also offer chances at tickets to performances by ZZ Top and Foreigner, as well as to Casper Comic Con, the newspaper reports.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/19"}]}

That's the district having asked voters for a combined 54.9-cent tax increase per $100 of accessed property value, fueling expansion and keeping up with operating needs.\n\n\"Enrollment issues continue to be the main reason more funds are needed,\" wrote the district having ballooned some 59% from 2001 to September 2023. And, the district said, \"population studies show that the enrollment will continue to increase significantly over the next 10 years.\"\n\nBut voters said no.\n\nTuesday's polls showed 54% of the vote coming in against the ask looking to prepare for key district expansions. Nearly 7,900 votes were tallied in the unofficial results.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nThe last such ask came in 2018, while a 2020 request had to be postponed by the pandemic. On the operating side, the district cited main concerns in security needs, growth outpacing revenue, alongside ongoing curriculum, facility maintenance, technology needs and more.\n\nAppo referendum to come:What you need to know about 6 upcoming school referendum votes across Delaware\n\nAnd ahead of the referendum, Cape told voters it needs to secure new district office space so the high school can complete an expansion, as well as to secure new land for future expansion, a natatorium and a bus maintenance facility.\n\nLooking ahead, the high school is already over-capacity. The district did not get state approval for Cape Henlopen High School's expansion project in 2023, but plans to resubmit this year. It says the school needs additions and renovations, allowing for more classroom space, storage, athletic facility improvements, additional parking and more.\n\nFor now, the district will have to return to the drawing board on this request.\n\nIt’s really been a season for referendums. In February, nearly 4 out of every 5 Brandywine voters approved an operational referendum. Then, Red Clay Consolidated School District's voters loudly supported both an operations and capital-projects ask at roughly 71% approval each, just one day before Colonial schools would also approve two similar requests.\n\nNow, two districts haven't seen the same results in March. Cape Henlopen voters just gave their answer, while Smyrna schools saw funding requests rejected on March 9, with over half the votes coming against each ask.\n\nAppoquinimink asks voters to return to the polls to consider its referendums on April 23.\n\nGot a story?

The district now hopes it can come up with the latter funds on its own.\n\nDivorcing those two measures means voters are asked to pay a little less — somewhere under $20 per year — than in the last referendum, officials say. The failed referendum's maximum property tax increase for construction was 35 cents per $100 of assessed value.\n\nThe district says it needs the added space to house its student population. The district is one of the fastest-growing in Delaware, and school officials expect numbers to keep growing. Current district-wide enrollment is 10,885 students — a 188-pupil bump since the last official count in the fall, according to a district spokesperson.\n\nThose inside Sussex Central High School, which this year enrolls about 160 more students than its current building is meant to hold, say that the lack of space inhibits daily operations. That includes traveling through hallways and getting lunch on time, referendum advocates say.\n\nThe referendum would fund a new Sussex Central High School building, which would hold 2,200 students versus the current building's 1,500-student capacity.\n\nThe near 310,000-square-foot building, which officials approved in May, would be built next to the school's current location. Officials expect the new building, should voters decide to pay for it, would reach capacity after its first decade.\n\nThe measure would also add eight classrooms to Indian River High School, making room for 250 more students; and four classrooms to Selbyville Middle School, making room for 125 more students.\n\nJim Fritz, the lone naysayer in the vote to re-introduce the referendum, said he supports funding for construction because he believes the district's schools need more space. But he did not agree with the upcoming referendum only asking for construction expenses.\n\nIn February's two-pronged referendum, voters rejected construction costs by about 660 votes. They rejected paying for operating expenses by about 710 votes.\n\nFollowing the vote, the district's teachers union also raised concerns about exactly what the referendum asked for.\n\nIndian River Education Association President J.R. Emanuele called on the board to \"find out why people voted against the referendum, not to just go back with the same questions, and hope and pray for better results.\"\n\n\"A different approach needs to be taken,\" Emanuele said.\n\nA 'security nightmare'\n\nThe district has yet to decide the date of the next referendum. Residents could head back to the ballot box as soon as April.\n\nOfficials think they can make the case. They argue that nine of the district's 16 schools already exceed capacity, meaning the student population is more than 90 percent of the building occupancy. That includes the three schools to be expanded via the February referendum.\n\nAccording to district and state data, Lord Baltimore Elementary School is at 96 percent capacity with about 680 students. Long Neck Elementary School is at 91 percent with about 760 students. Georgetown Elementary School is at 96 percent with about 840 students. Millsboro Middle School is at 94 percent with about 750 students. Georgetown Middle School is at 94 percent with about 790 students.\n\nThree schools are over 100 percent capacity. The current Sussex Central High School is at 111 percent capacity with more than 1,660 students. Selbyville Middle School is at 102 percent capacity with about 740 students. East Millsboro Elementary is at 101 percent capacity with about 865 students.\n\nIndian River High School is over capacity at 95 percent with 950 students, and is estimated to reach more than 100 percent capacity by 2022.\n\nIndian River School District isn't the only school system grappling with increased enrollment.\n\nThe Cape Henlopen School District, which sits northeast of Indian River, has seen a near-1,500-student increase in enrollment since 2001. Like Indian River, the district expects enrollment to keep growing.\n\nIn March, Cape Henlopen was able to get voter approval to add elementary schools and a middle school, as well as additional space for its high school, within the next several years.\n\nMeanwhile, Sussex Central High School, Selbyville Middle School and North Georgetown Elementary School can expect \"portable classrooms,\" which resemble double-wide trailers, on their campuses next year. Officials say the units, meant to hold classes, will help alleviate cramming in school buildings. Indian River High School could need the units by 2023, Steele said.\n\nCape Henlopen has planted several of the units on its own campuses in recent years. Each two-classroom unit costs about $130,000 per five-year lease, not including electrical and pavement costs, officials say.\n\nThe district plans to add four units at Sussex Central next school year, then another four units the following school year. The district is also considering adding a permanent structure at Sussex Central to provide that added space, if costs are similar.\n\nThe district also plans to add one unit to Selbyville Middle School and one unit to North Georgetown Elementary School next school year.\n\nNorth Georgetown Elementary is not one of the district's nine schools that exceed capacity. The district said it expects the elementary school to be at or over capacity by next year. Its current capacity is around 85 percent with about 770 students.\n\nThe district plans to transfer about 150 students to North Georgetown Elementary from the Georgetown Elementary kindergarten center to free up space at the latter campus.\n\nIndian River officials are wary. Some warn that the units, on top of adding expenses, could be in poor condition. Students may have trouble walking from one classroom to another in rain or snow, they say.\n\nFritz said the units do not account for the crowding in cafeterias and gyms, and create a \"security nightmare\" for students walking from one trailer-like unit to another.\n\n\"We've tried very hard to increase the security (in our buildings),\" Fritz said. \"If you're going to have portable classrooms, you're really going to throw that out the window.\"\n\nThe district would still have had to add some \"portable classrooms\" if voters approve the referendum. But it would not have had to rent as many or keep them as long, officials say.\n\n'Not a case of just wanting a new building'\n\nShould this referendum follow the failed one, the new high school would cost $140.84 million. The additions to Indian River High School and Selbyville Middle School would cost $14.29 million and $3.38 million, respectively. The district would incur 40 percent of the project costs, while the other 60 percent would be funded by the state.\n\nAlso under the former referendum, Sussex Central High School's current location would be converted to Millsboro Middle School's new location to allow for more students. That middle school would be converted to a new elementary school.\n\nThe district would also redraw attendance areas in Georgetown, Millsboro and Long Neck to \"alleviate overcrowding.\" The district said that those changes would not be funded through the referendum and that it will instead use \"minor capital improvement funds.\"\n\nShould voters approve the measure this time around, Steele hopes to finish construction in four years. He said he plans to put away about $300,000 per year during that time to cover the tentative infrastructure's operational expenses that would not be covered by the tax increase.\n\nTo do it, the district will likely maintain current budget cuts and possibly add new ones. Officials have yet to decide which programs or expenses to further cut. School officials plan to start working on next fiscal year's budget in April.\n\n\"We've already done a good job of tightening the belt,\" Steele said. \"I'm not sure if there's much more we can do.\"\n\nWhen asked what operations could be cut, Steele said \"anything you can think of.\" He referred to reductions as \"no-waste.\"\n\n\"There's just a lot of things you could look at (to) adjust things to work a little better, more efficiently,\" Steele said. \"If you've got a lot of little things that you tighten up just a little bit, it can add up to a lot in the end.\"\n\nOn top of saving, Steele also hopes that the district's increasing population will bring in more tax revenue. The area includes some of the fastest growing municipalities in Delaware, based on residential building permits issued in recent years.\n\n\"That's something that we're banking on (to continue),\" Steele said. \"It doesn't matter if they have school kids or not. It's just going to help our school operating expense.\"\n\nShortly after the referendum failed, Steele said that residents could have voted against it due to referendum \"fatigue.\"\n\nThe district has had similar referendums in recent years, including one that passed in March 2017 to fund additional school services and address enrollment growth.\n\nBefore that, the district failed to pass that same referendum in November 2016 after the district's chief financial officer was put on leave and a subsequent state audit, released less than a week before the vote, revealed several instances of \"inappropriate\" spending on items such as designer bracelets.\n\nSince then, the district has implemented transparency efforts, including a budget oversight committee formed when Steele became superintendent in 2017.\n\nSome district residents are still skeptical of how the district spends its money, and have been resistant to raising property taxes — especially as more revenue funnels into the district from new property development.\n\nBut school officials insist that won't be enough.\n\n\"It's not a case of just wanting a new building,\" Fritz said. \"It is a need. ...

School referendums splinter communities", "text": "Matthew Albright, and Saranac Hale Spencer\n\nThe News Journal\n\nVoters are set to consider three referendums statewide that would would raise almost $500 million.\n\nSchool district officials say they're forced to ask for money because of the state's complex funding system.\n\nThe regular referendums have sparked tension among voters who are asked to fund education.\n\nSpring is the time of year when education turns into politics, when school districts give residents a choice: Vote to raise property taxes or face teacher and program cuts.\n\nNobody — not seniors, not parents, not even school officials who say the money is desperately needed — like asking for a tax hike.\n\nSchool supporters and parents bemoan the fact that educators and parents are forced to campaign for referendums, rather than focus on teaching children.\n\nWhat's frequently misunderstood by citizens is that referendums are often intended only to keep the status quo, supporters say. But Delaware's complex school funding system has made it difficult to convince voters the increases are necessary to cover growing student enrollment and maintenance costs.\n\n\"There's so much time and energy that has to be poured into it, it's just hundreds and hundreds of man hours,\" said Eve Buckley, a Christina School District parent who is one of the volunteer leaders in an effort to pass that district's referendum on Wednesday. \"And it's time you're using just in hopes of staying where we are, maybe getting a little better, not providing some big new idea. The process is a real drain.\"\n\nBrandywine and Cape Henlopen also are seeking voters' approval that day. The three referendums combined would raise almost $500 million.\n\nThe success of those votes comes down to whether district officials can coax enough parents with children in public schools to go to the polls. They must outnumber those who don't feel they have a stake in the schools or who feel districts should do more to prove they deserve a tax increase.\n\n\"If I go to my boss and haven't done what I'm supposed to ... I don't ask for a raise,\" said Susan Welsh, who wants to see Christina begin to improve student test scores and find efficiencies before she votes in favor. \"I love my child enough to vote 'no' and hold them [the district] accountable to raising the ranking before I give them a raise.\"\n\nDistrict supporters say referendums aren't a luxury. They are a necessity.\n\nMoney that pays for schools is a mix of state, federal and local funds. While the state's portion grows as districts enroll more students, the local portion comes from property taxes that don't increase to match growing costs.\n\nIf districts don't get the money to cover those costs, the results can be demoralizing, Buckley says.\n\n\"You want to think you're part of a community that is at least reasonably supportive of public education, and then something like what happened last year takes place,\" she said. \"And then you start to worry about this negative feedback loop, where people think the district isn't worthy, so then we have to cut budgets. And that means the schools suffer, and the perception only gets reinforced.\"\n\nActing Christina Superintendent Bob Andrzejewski says its dangerous to leave districts without a steady, reliable base of funding.\n\n\"There are no reruns when it comes to education,\" he said. \"If a student misses out on important educational services because there's no money, you can't go back and make that up later.\"\n\nChristina is seeking about $16 million, which would amount to roughly $192 a year more in taxes for the average homeowner, according to the district. That money would be used to plug some of the holes left after the district slashed $9 million from its budget last year and would also add some new programs.\n\nBrandywine is asking taxpayers for money to cover operating expenses, for work on school buildings and to put synthetic turf on its athletic fields. It estimates that an average home-owner would pay an extra $243 per year for the next three years and $206 per year after the $1.7 million turf project will be done. The district needs $19.3 million for the building projects and $9.5 million for operating expenses.\n\nThe referendum in Cape Henlopen is a little different – it is asking voters for money that would be used strictly for building two elementary schools and doing work on two others, which is the last phase in a 20-year, long-term plan that the district committed itself to in 1999. The total cost for the project is $154.5 million, but local taxpayers are being asked to shoulder $48.4 million of it.\n\nSwaying the public\n\nThe base of the bloc that typically votes against referendums is believed to be older residents who don't have children, don't directly benefit from the tax increases and are often on fixed incomes.\n\nOlder residents vote more than younger residents. And low-income families are less likely to vote than more affluent families, who may not send their children to traditional public schools, Buckley said.\n\nThat stacks referendums against the districts.\n\n\"It's a huge challenge, no question,\" Buckley said.\n\nIn Christina's first referendum last year, when voters slapped down a tax increase by an almost three-to-one margin, turnout in more affluent suburban areas dwarfed turnout in poorer urban areas.\n\nSTORY: Robocalls used in Christina schools referendum\n\nSTORY: Wilmington redistricting plan advances on shaky ground\n\n\n\nIn five polling places in Wilmington, there were a total of 258 votes. At a single suburban polling place – McVey Elementary, just off the University of Delaware campus – more than 556 people voted.\n\nThe vote failed 2,119 – 6,076.\n\nWhen Christina took a second shot with a smaller referendum last year, the district made more energetic efforts to get the word out to voters, and turnout evened out somewhat. The referendum failed again, but this time by less than 900 votes out of more than 11,000.\n\n\"The support's there,\" said Brian Stephan, a parent with two children in Christina and co-chair of the district's referendum steering committee. \"It's just tapping into it and letting them know where to be and what you're voting for.\"\n\nPart of the problem, supporters say, is that the state's school finance system is so complicated.\n\nStephan points out that school referendums are the only time residents get to choose whether to tax themselves. For other taxes, elected representatives choose when to raise rates; citizens vote those representatives out if they don't like their choices.\n\n\"It's the one chance that people get, so they tend to vent some of their frustrations,\" he said. \"It doesn't just become about school taxes, it's all taxes. And that makes it hard for us.\"\n\nReferendum opponents do frequently bring up other tax proposals.\n\n\"The governor wants to put more money in for the gas tax, he wants to give more money to the casinos,\" said Marie Lulfs, a 76-year-old Christina resident. \"Everybody wants more money, and where are they getting it from? The taxpayer.\"\n\nWhat's at stake\n\nNobody knows the impacts of a failed referendum quite like Christina parents and teachers.\n\nAfter voters twice rejected tax increases last year, the district made more than $9 million in cuts, laying off 78 teachers and 14 aides.\n\nStephan's daughter's first-grade class has 37 students, far more than last year.\n\n\"That has been an extreme challenge for her teacher and for her,\" Stephan said. \"You can just tell when she comes home from school.\"\n\nSupporters like Stephan say it is hard to make voters understand that operating referendums don't necessarily mean a district is seeking new goodies. In some cases, like Christina's, they are simply asking for enough money to preserve the level of services.\n\nAbout 55 percent of Christina's budget comes from state funding, while 38 percent comes from local property taxes (the rest comes from federal sources).\n\nThe state's share of school taxes grows as the district adds students, but the property tax revenue doesn't always do so.\n\nUnlike many states, school taxes don't automatically adjust for inflation. So when costs of things like fuel and electricity go up, the money a district gets from property taxes buys less and less.\n\nIf more of the budget goes toward overhead, there is less available for educational programs.\n\nThat argument hasn't convinced some referendum opponents.\n\n\"They got $20 million five years ago – it didn't do anything,\" said Welsh. \"So what's this $16 million going to do? There's no proof in the pudding.\"\n\nA better system?\n\nMichael Griffith, who studies school finance issues at the Colorado-based Education Commission of the States, said local school funding mechanisms vary widely from state to state. When it comes to picking the best method, he said figuring out \"the one true religion is probably easier than this.\"\n\nMost states require voter approval for school tax increases, he said. But many allow districts the choice to occasionally raise taxes by a small amount, usually tied to an inflation rate, without going to voters.\n\n\"If you believe in public education, as we do, the quality of our childrens' educational experience should not depend on a vote,\" Andrzejewski said. \"There are very few states left in the country that require referendums for operating expenses.\"\n\nAndrzejewski, who was previously Red Clay superintendent and has worked on several referendums, argues the state should move to a similar system. Delaware's vo-tech school districts, he points out, are given the ability to raise taxes up to a certain cap before getting the General Assembly's approval.\n\n\"There is a politically accepted, viable model that Delaware already has,\" Andrzejewski said. \"School board members are elected officials just as the General Assembly is. They should be trusted to make a prudent financial decision on behalf of the community.\"\n\nFor taxpayers, Andrzejewski said a system like this would allow districts to raise taxes gradually over time, instead of periodically hitting them with one big increase all at once. Inflation rates are typically under two percent; by contrast, Christina is looking for a 21 percent increase in its tax rate.\n\nThere are two big caveats, Andrzejewski says.\n\nFirst, school board members should be required to get financial training and should be penalized if they don't.\n\nAnd second, districts should still be required to go to referendum for major new programs or building campaigns.\n\nAre schools 'electioneering?\n\nAnother problem is Delaware districts are sometimes accused of employing underhanded tactics to get the votes they need.\n\nThe same day Christina's first referendum failed in 2015, Red Clay passed one. Almost immediately, some residents cried foul.\n\nMany Red Clay schools held parent engagement events on the night of the vote in their buildings, which serve as polling places. Several older voters said those events crowded parking lots, denying them parking spaces that were close enough for them to make it in to vote. It also boosted turnout among parents.\n\nAn ACLU of Delaware lawsuit over those claims is still making its way through the courts. Red Clay maintains that it took sufficient steps to provide enough parking and argued it frequently holds events at schools to keep parents engaged in their kids' education.\n\nSTORY: Christina School District takes third try at referendum\n\nSTORY: UD to make SAT optional\n\nState Sen. Karen Peterson, D-Stanton, received numerous complaints from constituents.\n\n\"Last year's Red Clay district referendum was the poster child for what's wrong with the whole system,\" Peterson said. \"There was so much electioneering that went on inside the polling places that it was just an absolute disgrace.\"\n\nPeterson says this isn't the first time a district has been accused of electioneering, referencing a so-called \"Pizza-gate\" incident a few years ago in which Smyrna schools threw pizza parties at schools on referendum night.\n\n\"I couldn't stand inside a polling place and hand out pizza if you voted for me,\" Peterson said.\n\nPeterson has proposed a bill that would change how districts go out to referendums.\n\nFirst, schools could only seek one referendum a year, at the same time as school board elections. That would save the state Department of Elections money and force districts to make one pitch for what they really need.\n\nThe fact that districts often come right back with referendum requests if a previous one fails upsets many opponents.\n\n\"If you say 'no' once, I mean 'no,\" Lulfs said. \"You don't have to keep shoving it down my throat.\"\n\nPeterson's bill would also have referendums conducted via mail. That would make more voters aware of the issues, she said, and prevent the inherent problems in having polling places that directly benefit from the results of a vote.\n\n\"We don't have to worry about all this going on at the schools,\" she said.\n\nWhile Peterson argues these changes would make the system fairer, she agrees with some school supporters who say broader change is a good idea.\n\n\"These districts can get in a really bad place, because this is money they really do need,\" she said. \"But you're asking people to vote for a tax on themselves. Something has to change.\"\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, (302) 324-2428, or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.

The district expects that, if voters approve, it will bring in over $16 million.\n\nThat money, school officials say, is sorely needed after the district slashed its budget by $9 million when the last referendum failed, said Brian Stephan, co-chair of the district's referendum steering committee.\n\n\"We're already running at bare-bones level,\" he said.\n\nChristina is hoping to replace some of the 78 teachers and 14 aides that were laid off in the budget cuts. Those layoffs led to larger class sizes, and the district is aiming to get back to its pre-2015 class sizes, said Wendy Lapham, spokeswoman for the district.\n\nIf voters reject the referendum for a third time, there's nothing left in the heftiest part of the budget to cut, Stephan said. The salaries and benefits of school workers take up 85 percent of revenues, and that section has already been shaved down. The district would have to cut after-school activities, after-school transportation and extracurricular activities, he said. The \"nuclear option\" would be closing down some school buildings.\n\nFollowing the defeat of the last referendum, Stephan said, the district took the temperature of voters to see what their hesitations were. In response, it lowered the proposed tax increase this time around, which it estimates to be about $192 per year for the average homeowner.\n\nChristina School District gears up for second tax vote\n\nIf it passes, Christina is planning to set aside $1 million to improve the general school environment – how exactly that will be done is still open for debate, and the district is having a public meeting on March 15 to discuss approaches. It will start at 7 p.m. at the Gauger-Cobbs Middle School on Gender Road in Ogletown.\n\nBrandywine hasn't pitched a referendum since 2012, and it is asking voters later this month to approve a 28-cent increase to school tax bills in order to finance the general operational needs of the district. Along with that, in a single vote, it is asking for voters to fund a capital project and a special project that would resurface several school athletic fields with synthetic turf.\n\nThe turf project would take three years to fund at 5 cents per $100 of assessed value, and the whole project, which would cover athletic fields at three schools, would cost about $5 million, said Superintendent Mark Holodick.\n\nThe capital project would cover work on three school buildings and the demolition of a school that has been empty since 2010. It would cost local property owners just over $19 million, but it wouldn't actually increase the taxes they've been paying because it would pick up where a large capital project, passed in 2005, left off. That was a $63 million project that renovated two schools, built three new ones, demolished one, relocated the district office and purchased a transportation facility, Holodick said.\n\nCape Henlopen is putting up a capital request to build two new elementary schools and renovate two old elementary schools, which is the last phase in a 20-year, long-term plan that the district committed itself to in 1999.\n\nIt asked for a 17-cent tax increase for the district's operating budget in 2014, said Superintendent Robert Fulton.\n\nCape Henlopen needs the new schools to accommodate growth, he said – it has gotten more than 1,000 new students since 2001.\n\nThe state is paying $72 million toward the project if local taxpayers will shoulder about $48.5 million.\n\nWith the growth that district has had, if it doesn't get new buildings, it would have to add modular classrooms, Fulton said.\n\nThat growth is \"a good problem to have,\" he said. \"We're just trying to plan ahead.\"\n\nContact Saranac Hale Spencer at (302) 324-2909, sspencer@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @SSpencerTNJ.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/delaware/2017/04/03/sussex-county-enjoys-referendum-success/98898488/", "title": "Sussex County enjoys referendum success", "text": "Gray Hughes\n\nrghughes@delmarvanow.com\n\nSince 2011, Sussex County has held nine referendum votes to increase taxes.\n\nOnly two have failed — the Indian River School District vote on Nov. 22, 2016, and one in the Seaford School District held Feb. 27, 2014.\n\nHowever, the tax increase that failed in the Indian River School District in 2016 passed 100 days later by a margin of 1,701. Even with the Nov. 22 measure's failure to pass, it failed by only 30 votes.\n\nThese votes generate a lot of interest, said Ken McDowell, the director for the Sussex County Department of Elections. Out of all the elections, he said, these tax increase votes require the most thought.\n\nThe referendums often have higher voter turnout than school board elections, he added.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"You see a far greater number of people come out for referendum because of the pocketbook issues,\" McDowell said. \"There is great interest in it.\"\n\nWhile Sussex County has the highest success in the state in passing referendums since 2011, school officials understand it's no simple task. They stress a few key components to the success of the recent votes — community support, effective outreach, transparency and already low tax rates.\n\nKent County, too, has had relative success passing referendums.\n\nSince 2011, Kent County has passed six out of the eight referendums related to county schools.\n\nHowever, the support districts receive in Sussex and Kent counties trends a little lower in New Castle County.\n\nBACKGROUND: Indian River referendum passes by almost 2,000 votes\n\nFor comparison, New Castle County has only passed 10 out of the 17 referendums held since 2011. Most recently, a referendum in the Colonial School District held on Feb. 28 that failed 2,961 to 2,067 on additional taxes that would have generated $10.9 million. A bond question to authorize the district to take out $4.7 million in bonds for school security upgrades that was voted on at the same time as the tax increase also failed by a count of 2,733 to 2,193.\n\nThat's roughly a 59 percent success rate, while Sussex and Kent voted to raise taxes more than 75 percent of the time.\n\nDistricts with lower taxes, such as Indian River, will only go to a referendum if they need to construct a building or raise money for the budget, said Brian Baull, mayor of Dagsboro and a member of the Indian River High School Band Boosters.\n\n\"The district doesn't come to the voters unless there is a serious need,\" he said.\n\nKeeping taxes low\n\nFor Alyssa Titus, public information officer for the Cape Henlopen School District, the difficulties the district faces while campaigning for tax increases are made easier by community support.\n\n\"I know other districts have a tough time, but we have so much support,\" she said.\n\nThe Cape Henlopen School District broke ground on a new H.O. Brittingham Elementary School on March 23, exactly one year to the day a tax increase to fund the school — along with several others — was passed.\n\nThe tax increase was passed by a count of 2,947 to 1,031.\n\nVoters in the Cape Henlopen School District approved the $130.18 million dollar tax increase — with those living in the district responsible for paying for $48.1 million of it — to help rebuild or renovate the district's four elementary schools as well as add a new Sussex Consortium.\n\nThis referendum raised property taxes by 33 cents per $100 of assessed property value.\n\nIn April of 2014, the Cape Henlopen School District passed another referendum to build a new elementary school in Lewes, which raised the property tax rate by 27 cents.\n\nThe tax increase in the Indian River School District approved on March 2 raised taxes by 49 cents per $100 of assessed value, with 33 cents going toward dealing with growth, 8 cents going toward student safety improvements and 8 cents going toward student services, such as textbooks, technology and student clubs and organizations.\n\nBACKGROUND: Indian River referendum fails in razor-close vote\n\nThe property tax rate in the Indian River School District has increased by 63.7 cents since 2011. Property tax rates increased by 60 cents in the Cape Henlopen School District during that same time period.\n\nDespite seeing a combined $1.237 worth of tax increases, the Cape Henlopen and Indian River school districts still have the two lowest tax rates in Sussex County, with Indian River being the lowest at $3.068 and Cape Henlopen the second lowest at $3.213.\n\nEven though Sussex County has had recent success in passing such tax increases, Indian River School District Superintendent Mark Steele said the measures, particularly tax increases for current expense funds, are not easy to pass.\n\n\"I think the tendency to pass a major capital referendum may be a little easier than passing a current expense, and I think the reason that is with a major capital, people in the community can see what their tax dollars are going toward,\" he said. \"They can see a new building or an addition, whereas when you have a current expense, it’s operations. So you don’t really see that money.\"\n\nThe approval of the tax increase in the Indian River School District came just weeks before Delaware Gov. John Carney announced there would be a $15 million cut to operation funds and a $22 million cut to the Education Sustainment Fund.\n\nUnder the proposed budget, Carney wants to empower schools to raise the match tax, the tax that funds things such as minor capital improvements, without going to referendum in order to cover reductions to the Sustainment Fund.\n\nHowever, school district officials have said they would be reluctant to use that option\n\nIt takes a community\n\nSteele and Titus both agreed it's community turnout that helps these tax increases pass.\n\nWhen Titus receives pushback from the community about the tax increases, she reminds people the funds raised go toward schools, and better schools raise property values.\n\n\"I think it’s cool that a lot of young families are moving and they care about our public education being great, and they understand what it takes for schools to be great, with new buildings and new teachers and new resources,\" she said. \"I definitely attribute to our community being very, very forward thinking understand in the changing needs of the district.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Tax vote bears fruit with Cape school groundbreaking\n\nSteele said reaching people helped in passing the March 2 tax increase.\n\nFacebook Live sessions in the days and weeks leading up to the vote, Steele said, helped him reach people.\n\nFor Steele, that made all the difference.\n\n\"I think in having a chance to talk to the superintendent from Colonial, I think one of the big things is you need to get to people,\" he said. \"And if you can’t get to people you’re in bad shape, because you will have the group who will not support it no matter how many times you go. So you have to make sure you go out to spread the message.\"\n\nTitus, too, said making administration highly visible during the days leading up to the votes makes a large difference.\n\nShe said on the days leading up to tax increase votes, Cape Henlopen Superintendent Robert Fulton and Cape Henlopen Director of Facilities Operations Brian Bassett are often in the community once a day spreading information about these votes.\n\n\"They are addressing concerns citizens may have, she said. \"That has been extremely helpful in moving a referendum forward.\"\n\nBaull, the Dagsboro mayor, said he feels it is important these tax increases are passed because they are not only important for the students themselves but for teachers, as well.\n\nBACKGROUND: Voters approve Cape schools referendum\n\nApproving the referendum to increase taxes helps to keep teachers in the district for years to come as well as ensure they are fairly compensated, he added.\n\n\"No one wants to hear that their taxes are going up,\" Baull said. \"But a referendum to benefit our students' future is a good thing.\"\n\nOverall, McDowell, the election organizer, gets very excited when he sees a large turnout for a vote, such as the one for the Indian River School District.\n\nFor that vote, 12,489 people voted — the most for any tax increase vote in the history of Sussex County, he said.\n\nMcDowell said these high turnouts are symbolic of democracy in action.\n\n\"Democracy is a great thing,\" McDowell said. \"There are countries in the world who would love to have a say in their government, schools and towns.\"\n\nrghughes@delmarvanow.com\n\nOn Twitter @hughesg19", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/delaware/2017/02/24/indian-river-second-referendum/97692658/", "title": "Contentious $7.2M IR schools vote nears", "text": "Gray Hughes\n\nrghughes@dmg.gannett.com\n\nMark Steele has been around the Indian River School District a long time.\n\nThe interim superintendent is a graduate of the district and has either taught or been an administrator in Indian River since 1981.\n\nDuring this time, there's never been a more important moment as when the district again tries to pass a $7.25 million expense referendum, he said.\n\nThat's kept Steele busy. The former assistant superintendent became interim superintendent when Susan Bunting was confirmed as education secretary in Delaware Jan. 24. Since then, he has heavily promoted the referendum, speaking with local groups, such as the Southern Sussex Rotary Cluband the Shore Democrats on why the referendum should pass. He even held a Facebook Live session all this month.\n\n\"By the time I get home from doing a faculty meeting, PTO meetings and referendum meetings, it's just a 12 to 13 hour day,\" he said. \"With that said, I usually get to bed pretty quick.\"\n\nBut he believes it's all been worth it to increase funding.\n\nIf the referendum passes, it would raise taxes by 49 cents per $100 of assessed property value, bringing the rate to $3.068 per $100, which would raise taxes by $95.41 for the average taxpayer in the district.\n\nThe hotly debated expense referendum is being held to deal with rising student populations throughout the district, which has grown by 22.4 percent over the past 10 years.

Several people concerned with the direction of the district's finances spoke out against the board, prompting a response from the district the following day.\n\n\"I am all about a better education for our children because I have one sitting in this audience,\" said Dana Lathbury, a parent who sends her child to John M.

But you want to throw it back on our taxpayers.\"\n\nHillary Mitchell also spoke out about the district's handling of Miller.\n\nShe was concerned the district continues to pay Miller's pension, something the district says it is obligated to do, while asking for money from the residents of the district.\n\n\"How can this board have the audacity to ask the citizens to vote for a referendum giving the district more money while allowing the former CFO to retire and receive a pension?\" she asked.\n\nMany are concerned charges have not been brought against Miller. However, the Indian River Board of Education members said they are unable to bring the charges themselves, and the charges must come from the Delaware Attorney General's office. In the letter the following day, the district also explained the differences between paid and unpaid leave, and that the board does not control pensions.\n\n\"By law, our former CFO was entitled to his full pension and benefits at the time of his retirement,\" the statement read. \"This was not a secretive process as has been alleged by some members of our community. To withhold benefits would have been a violation of the Delaware Code and exposed the district to possible legal repercussions.\"\n\nRobert Maloney voiced his concerns with the board at the Jan. 31 meeting.\n\n\"You are publicly elected officials misusing public funds,\" he said. \"You should resign.\"\n\nYet Steele remains steadfast as to why the referendum needs to pass.\n\nHe said a strong education system is key to having a strong community.\n\nREAD MORE: Indian River's 2nd referendum: Teachers' jobs at stake\n\n\"If you look at any strong community in the United States, you are going to see one thing: A strong community is always balanced by a strong education system. And if we struggle to get this through, it is going to be drastic to us what is going to happen in terms of cuts and the level of cuts,\" he said.\n\n\"That, in turn, will also reflect on the community, and if we are going to keep them both strong, we need to do everything possible to get this referendum passed.\"\n\nSupportive \"with concerns\"\n\nRaising taxes still has many concerned.\n\nArlett said he will support the referendum but has his eye on taxes and money coming into the district, especially from the state of Delaware and the federal government.\n\n\"This referendum, when it first came out, I was supportive, but with concerns,\" he said. \"And I'm no different today.\"\n\nHe is not of fan of raising taxes, and thinks elected officials on the school board need to be transparent and accountable to the people in the community to manage taxpayer dollars as well as educate children.\n\nHe added he is not a fan of giving more money just for the sake of giving more money.\n\n\"I'm not automatically a fan of raising taxes and giving more dollars,\" he said.\n\nBut, to benefit the students in the Indian River School District, Arlett supports it.\n\nRegardless of the March 2 outcome, more referendums may be in the future for district residents.\n\nBACKGROUND: Public reaction to the first Indian River referendum mixed\n\nIn addition to the current referendum, another referendum will needed in the near future that also addresses the population rise in Indian River schools.\n\nIn April 2016, the district's school board submitted a certificate of necessity to the state of Delaware, which would allow construction of a new elementary school on the Ingram Pond property in Millsboro and a new middle school on the Sussex Central High School campus, along with adding about 32 classrooms to the high school. This was in addition to other school expansion projects.\n\nSteele tried to alleviate concerns about a future referendum.\n\n\"The board is probably going to proceed with the Ennis school for the simple reason that it has no local funds attached to it,\" he said. \"It is purely state funding.\"\n\nRight now, he said, the current expense is at such a critical level, it would not make sense to be constructing the new buildings, which would require local dollars with the exception of the new Howard T. Ennis School.\n\nHe also added if the current expense referendum is not passed, there would be cuts to the budget that would make it impossible to staff any of the new schools.\n\nREAD MORE: Steele to take reins at IR if Bunting gets state post\n\nREAD MORE: Indian River referendum detailed at board meeting\n\nOther budget cuts\n\nDistrict-planned events have not been the only forum for referendum discussion.\n\nBusinesses, political groups and pro-referendum Facebook pages have been held and created in the previous months.\n\nAt an event at Bethany Beach Books to give teachers in both the Indian River and the Cape Henlopen school districts free books, the referendum was not far from people's minds.\n\nJohn Vogel, a fifth-grade teacher at Lord Baltimore Elementary School, said he would like to see the referendum pass to benefit the students.\n\n\"Without a doubt it's needed,\" he said. \"If you look at what teachers do, a lot of things we do for our own students and classes comes from our own pockets. I am stealing supplies from my home to use in my classroom.\"\n\nAndrew Carter, a parent of three students in the Indian River School District and a Selbyville resident, has volunteered as a parent ambassador to help pass the referendum.\n\nCarter created an \"IRSD Referendum Support Group\" on Facebook on Jan. 18. The group posts information about why it feels the referendum should pass. Nearly 2,000 have joined the group in a month.\n\nHe said there is a cloud hanging over the district: budget cuts.\n\n\"Not passing the referendum, along with the budget cuts, would be a double whammy,\" he said. \"That makes this referendum more critical to pass to support the growth.\"\n\nThe state of Delaware will be making cuts to all school districts to ensure the state budget is balanced, which Steele said could impact the Indian River School District anywhere between the minimum of $1.2 million (1.25 percent) and the maximum of $9.5 million (10 percent).\n\nAnd, if the referendum does not pass, 10 percent of jobs across the board would have to be cut, with teachers being the last cut that would have to be made, he said.\n\nSteele said because of this, voters have a big decision.\n\nVoting will take place from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. March 2. Those living in the district — renter or homeowner — who are 18 and older can cast their vote at East Millsboro Middle, Georgetown Elementary, Indian River High, Long Neck Elementary, Lord Baltimore Elementary or Selbyville Middle schools.\n\nRep. Ruth Briggs-King, R-37, hopes for a good turnout at the polls.\n\nFor a decision like this one, it is important people make their voices heard, the Sussex Central graduate said.\n\n\"It is their school district,\" she said.\n\nREAD MORE: Teachers staying in droves in coastal Delaware schools\n\nArlett said he has noticed residents within the Indian River School District have been more engaged during this referendum compared to the one held in November 2016.\n\nSteele agreed, and added he is confident.\n\nThe 13-hour days are paying off for him, he said.\n\nTalking with those in the district, he is able to tell them his vision of future growth, success and transparency.\n\nThe harm in not passing this referendum would affect students, Steele said. He tells voters they should leave emotions at home while voting.\n\n\"You have to weigh what the increase is and what the benefits are compared to the pitfalls of it not passing,\" he said.\n\nrghughes@dmg.gannett.com\n\nOn Twitter @hughesg19", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/02/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2021/08/20/delaware-school-board-meeting-masks-in-schools-mask-mandate-governor-john-carney-brandywine-red-clay/8181162002/", "title": "As school year nears, a small but vocal group of Delaware parents ...", "text": "Twenty-four hours after the Brandywine School District board meeting was postponed because a faction in the crowd refused to put on masks – required in school buildings when students are present – the Caesar Rodney School District meeting was in a recess.\n\nAbout a dozen district parents and their children had entered the auditorium before the 7 p.m. start without masks on and planned to use the public comment period to protest the governor's school mask mandate and implore their district to not comply.

It asks the state to require more models to be completed with forecasts into 2030 before accepting the developers' application.\n\nA checkered past\n\nPresented at a Nov. 30 meeting held by Lewes officials, the city-commissioned report comes after a number of years in which the developers and Sussex County officials fought about the use of more than 30 acres of undeveloped land.\n\nBack in 2008, the two developers approached the county with plans to create a 521,000-square-foot shopping center but withdrew the application after the county's Planning Commission voted unanimously to recommend denial.\n\nA downsized, 387,000-square-foot version was submitted but rejected by the Sussex County Council in January 2010. The developers sued the county, saying its reasoning was not supported by evidence and that Councilwoman Joan Deaver, D-Lewes, should've recused herself from the vote because of her alleged involvement with an opposition group.\n\nEventually, after the appeal was shifted to U.S. District Court, a stay was issued from Aug. 5, 2014, through May 25, 2015, and eventually extended to the end of the year, to allow the developer to submit a new rezoning application to the county.\n\nThe impact of traffic\n\nJack Lingo LLC has said the idea is to make the area more walkable, with ideas for a grocery store, pharmacy and dry cleaner as part of the overall plan.\n\nExpert: Mental health of man accused in PV murders diminishing\n\nBut the report claims that the developers are using outdated numbers to justify their layouts and planning. Environmental Resources Management said the 2006 study does not take into account the rising population of Cape Henlopen High School, also on King's Highway, as well as planned housing developments to be completed in upcoming years.\n\n\"The combined traffic from the Village Center and other surrounding developments are likely to cause the Savannah Road/Gills Neck Road/Front Street intersection to exceed capacity (to \"fail\" in transportation planning terms) more frequently throughout the year and throughout the day,\" the report reads.\n\n\"Such failures would be most common during weekday peak hours, and, given the current distribution of weekend daily traffic in Lewes, for extended portions of weekend days,\" it continues. \"Because the intersection is at the heart of the City's historic district, prolonged traffic congestion here could likely impact tourist and other commercial activity in the historic district.\"\n\nDeveloper's Response\n\nIn a statement on behalf of Jack Lingo LLC, spokesman Doug Motley claimed \"The draft ERM report contained several inaccuracies (for example — the actual number of units in several nearby subdivisions are lower than those published in the report).\"\n\nMotley also noted how the report did not include a full analysis of DelDOT's 2006 traffic impact study nor the study's \"review letter, and resulting letter agreement\" which outlined \"multimillion dollars of roadway improvements required as a result of their analysis.\"\n\nConcerning traffic on Route 9, Motley said the 2006 study, as well as the agreement for necessary improvements, provide the solutions to questions raised by Environmental Resources Management about the road's level of service. He pointed toward an agreement with DelDOT to improve the intersection of Gills Neck and Clay roads as an example of how the report did not understand the full picture.\n\n\"DelDOT's required improvements directly relate to what capacity is needed to what capacity is needed to provide acceptable levels of service,\" Motley said.\n\nCity officials still have concerns as to the impact the project could have to the city overall.\n\nLewes council's Vice President Fred Beaufait said that there are further concerns given the city's limited evacuation routes.\n\nBeaufait said there are \"only three ways into and out of Lewes,\" with flooding regularly happening on New Road, one of the three.\n\nWith Route 9 also acting as one of those three, the idea of having a major shopping center that would attract traffic could hinder residents' ability to leave the town quickly in the case of a flood or severe weather event.\n\n\"We are somewhat locked in in terms of being able to evacuate,\" Beaufait said. \"If we put this shopping center on King's Highway, now we've got one way in and out of Lewes.\"\n\n410-877-4221", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/12/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2014/05/24/concerns-raised-sussex-countys-true-colors/9555135/", "title": "Concerns raised about Sussex's true colors", "text": "James Fisher\n\nThe News Journal\n\nResident%3A %27It%27s just a horrible stigma for the county%27\n\nWilson and Phillips have defended their decision\n\nSussex County has high-tech companies and highly-ranked schools. It boasts vibrant tourism and agricultural sectors, with towns retirees flock to and chickens its farmers grow exported around the world. Its population is on the rise, and its county government hasn't raised property taxes in 25 years.\n\nBut those pleasantries were not on people's minds last week when they thought about Sussex County; instead, it was bigotry. The County Council found itself ensnared in controversy after two council members, Sam Wilson and Vance Phillips, gave offense to the NAACP, describing it in a May 13 meeting as an organization fixated on race and prone to discriminate against anyone who isn't black. They also withheld $100 apiece in discretionary grants to the group's local chapter.\n\nGiven the opportunity to explain his stance one week later at the next meeting, Wilson instead stirred up more controversy by noting that \"three homosexuals\" had stepped forward to defend the NAACP.\n\nNAACP members and others delivered forceful rebuttals at the next meeting, noting that the episode had put a magnifying glass on Sussex County's reputation as the most resistant part of the state to embrace social changes that swept America in the civil rights era and beyond.\n\n\"Sussex County has long been considered one of the most prejudiced counties in the state of Delaware,\" Jane Hovington, president of the Lower Sussex Branch NAACP, said sternly to the County Council. \"What has always been mere conjecture has been given credence by your recent statements.\"\n\nIn interviews and public comments, Wilson and Phillips have defended their decision to express unease about the NAACP and adamantly rebuffed accusations that doing so signaled they hold bigoted beliefs. Holding to a common pattern of modern racial dust-ups, they accused their accusers of being the ones not seeing past the color of their skin.\n\n\"To make judgments of people when you don't know them is evil, really. Worst thing you can do,\" Wilson said Tuesday. \"I'm sure not a racist, and my parents were not racists.\"\n\nBut Wilson, in the same talk to reporters Tuesday, promptly gave his opponents another opening to paint him as out of touch with the modern era.\n\nIn the same week that Pennsylvania, Oregon and Washington, D.C. opened doors to gay marriage, Wilson was noting disdainfully that \"three homosexuals\" came to the Sussex County Council meeting to show support for the NAACP, and explaining why it was he'd once told a Delaware gay marriage advocate, Lisa Goodman of Equality Delaware, she was bound for hell.\n\n\"I said if she didn't change her lifestyle, she's probably going to wind up there,\" Wilson said. \"That's very plain in Romans. I mean, I don't make the rules.\"\n\nIt is difficult to imagine an elected official in Kent or New Castle counties saying that without instigating a voters' revolt.\n\nBut Sussex – split between the rural, agricultural western side and its more liberal beach towns like Lewes, Rehoboth Beach and Dewey Beach along the coast – is a different story.\n\nThat such comments are electorally acceptable here bothers Delawareans who wish Sussex County – especially the conservatives and Republicans whose electoral grip is strongest west of U.S. 113 – would have decisively shed its song-of-the-South reputation by now.\n\n\"I don't think incidents like what happened two weeks ago help the image of Sussex County any,\" said Joe Conaway, a former county administrator. \"It plays into the view of – and I hate this word – progressives who think the people of Sussex just climbed out from under rocks. And that's not the case.\"\n\nOn Saturday the county government, responding to a request for comment on the two-week-long controversy, gave a statement from County Council President Michael Vincent that said \"the recent events surrounding the Sussex County Council are unfortunate.\"\n\n\"They have taken the focus off the many important functions of county government and the hard work of our dedicated staff, and they have caused strife in our community. This is not what our county stands for, nor will it be its legacy,\" Vincent said. \"Like any other organization that comes before Council seeking support, the Lower Sussex NAACP Youth Council should have received the highest levels of respect during the May 13 meeting.\"\n\nNeil Dickerson Sr., who moved to Millsboro several years ago from Maryland, said \"it really gives Sussex County a horrible, horrible name.\"\n\nDickerson said \"it's gone viral\" now.\n\n\"It's just a horrible stigma for the county,\" he said. \"You talk about a good old boy issue, there it is.\"\n\nBut others watched what happened and decided Wilson and Phillips had simply tweaked a too-little-questioned consensus on race.\n\n\"He's saying these people are concentrated on race instead of letting things go,\" Marion Barton, 79, said of Wilson. \"Years ago, people didn't even think about that [race]. Now anything that anybody says, people are afraid to say anything back against them. I think this guy needs some support.\"\n\nPart of a pattern\n\nThe \"good old boy\" stigma goes beyond race and includes a division between the haves and have nots.\n\nDickerson, who volunteers helping elderly residents, said the NAACP comments aren't the only problem. He said an older woman in Rehoboth replaced an old shed with a new one of the same size on the same footprint but it took her years to resolve it with the county.\n\nMeanwhile, he said, people with real estate connections breeze through the system.\n\n\"We need change,\" he said.\n\nThe county government has found itself fending off accusations of hard-heartedness toward the poor and minorities before.\n\nIn 2012, the county agreed to have its liability insurer pay $750,000 to a developer who'd tried to build low-income housing near Laurel, but was stymied by rulings of the Planning & Zoning Commission and the County Council.\n\nIn 2010, during a public hearing on the development, a county resident stood up to say when his mother \"found out all these people was gonna be back there, she was scared to death. ... I have nothing against these people. But I know how it's going to be. I better not catch them hunting on my land.\"\n\nThose comments, the U.S. Department of Justice later said, \"were impliedly derogatory and based on stereotypes of African-American and Hispanic residents,\" and the DOJ maintained the county government needed to have done more to make clear its denials of the developer's proposal weren't rooted in the same biases. As part of a settlement agreement with the Department of Justice to halt the fair-housing lawsuit, the county must submit its decisions on like-minded issues to federal authorities for final approval.\n\nThe County Council has also spent years litigating its members' ability to begin meetings with prayers while still staying within the bounds of the Constitution's establishment clause. Four county residents sued them over the constant invocation of The Lord's Prayer, and in 2012, a settlement agreement allowed the council to substitute a different prayer, the 23rd Psalm, while the plaintiffs agreed to drop their lawsuit.\n\nThe fight brought years of litigation and attention to the question of whether Sussex County Council respected the beliefs of non-Christians. Phillips and Wilson, in recent weeks, have called attention to a recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling that widened the scope of acceptable legislative prayer practices, saying the council should consider re-opening its Lord's Prayer litigation.\n\n\"It seems like we're the only body right now that's not permitted to do this. And it kind of irritates me a little bit,\" Wilson said on May 13. \"I think we'd be fine to go ahead and say The Lord's Prayer, or ask someone to go up and pray if they wanted to. I don't see any holdback.\"\n\nSince the 2012 settlement, the council members had not often heard a challenge to their prayer practice, but for the past two weeks an atheist from Seaford, Robert C. Harrison, has used public-comment periods at their meetings to protest their focus on prayer issues.\n\n\"Many Christians have exhibited prejudice against non-believers and discriminate against them socially,\" Harrison said. \"By holding Christian prayers here, you are helping them to identify those with differing beliefs. You are preventing some of those that fear identification from attending.\"\n\nOutside the council chambers, Wilson in particular has tangled repeatedly with gay rights advocates, bringing up his fervent belief that devout Christianity is incompatible with being gay. When the Cape Henlopen School District's school board deadlocked on a vote to add an elective class on Bible literacy, Wilson said to a talk-radio host that \"one of them is a lesbian,\" and \"they're not very strong on the Bible.\"\n\n\"Thank God for the western side of Sussex,\" he went on. \"We still believe in our Bible.\"\n\nFor some Republicans, including many outside of Sussex, the comments coming from council members this week about the NAACP and gay people brought feelings of chagrin and dismay.\n\n\"Any kind of divisive language that drives people away from the party is not helpful,\" said John Fluharty, executive director of the Delaware Republican Party. \"It's OK to have differences with folks, but we've got to build a coalition. This harsh language has just got to stop. ... I refuse to allow my party to be held hostage and bullied any longer by reactionary forces who try to hide their bigotry behind the mask of conservatism.\"\n\nFluharty said he's concerned employers considering whether to invest in Sussex County could take a dimmer view of the prospect because of the controversies.\n\n\"They've got business down there. They've got thriving tourism. At what point does this begin to impact all that?\" Fluharty said. \"At what point do potential employers look at the situation there and say, we don't want to relocate.\"\n\nVincent, in his statement Saturday, said he hoped potential residents and investors would \"view Sussex County from the broadest of perspectives. There is no doubt they will see a community that is inviting to anyone who wants to realize their part of the American dream.\"\n\nFormer Sussex resident Til Purnell, who now lives near Charlottesville, Virginia, said the latest controversy is really nothing new.\n\nPurnell recalled a different County Council years earlier where one of the members, the late William Stevenson, shut her down when she tried to speak at a meeting. Instead, the councilman suggested she should be at home canning.\n\nThat comment, too, brought a string of bad press.\n\n\"I think they were disrespectful to all women,\" she said.\n\nShe suspects council members still are because they are still part of that \"good old boy network.\"\n\n\"Poor old Joan Deaver. She puts up a gallant fight,\" Purnell said of the lone female on council.\n\nFor black citizens, it was even worse than for women, Purnell said.\n\nThey were essentially ignored ... \"treated like pet dogs. You don't harm them. You just put them out in the shed\" rather than pay attention to them, she said.\n\nRoom for all?\n\nIn Rehoboth Beach, where tourism is the economic driver, Carol Everhart, chief executive officer of the Rehoboth Beach-Dewey Beach Chamber of Commerce, said \"any negative statement or anything that's perceived as a negative statement tends to get a lot of attention.\"\n\nBut going into the busy Memorial Day holiday weekend, \"we are solidly booked,\" she said.\n\n\"Rehoboth is a biblical term and it means room for all,\" she said. \"That's the best kind of image you can have.\"\n\nAt the south end of the boardwalk Friday, dozens of gay visitors took in the sunshine on a picture perfect beach day.\n\nLouis Panos, of Baltimore, said he has always felt welcome in the city – perhaps more so than in Baltimore where people are often segregated into neighborhoods that are specifically black or gay.\n\n\"I feel extremely comfortable,\" he said.\n\nPanos said he's only driven through western Sussex County on his way to the beach, with his only stops used to get gas.\n\nMeanwhile, openly gay County Clerk of the Peace John Brady said he hopes he isn't remembered as the county's first openly gay elected official.\n\nInstead, he wants people to say: \"He did his job and he continues to do his job.\"\n\nBrady said he has known Sam Wilson for 12 years – back to the time when they were both Republican candidates. Brady has changed his party affiliation.\n\n\"Sam is a man of principle,\" Brady said. \"He's not a flip-flopper.\"\n\nBrady recalled sitting down at the Wilson family kitchen table with Sam, his wife and one of his sons – then a candidate for the Indian River School Board. Brady said he talked to them about how to get elected.\n\nIn fact, prior to his successful run for Sussex County Council in 2008, Wilson was a perennial Republican candidate.\n\n\"He and his wife are actually really nice folk,\" Brady said, adding that \"this county has a lot of colorful people.\"\n\nYet Brady acknowledges that not everyone in the county is inclusive.\n\nSometimes when people come into the Clerk of the Peace office, they say they'd prefer to have \"a Christian marry them,\" he said.\n\nBrady, who said he was raised Catholic, said he's interpreted that to mean: \"someone who's not gay.\"\n\nHis office has three people who perform marriage ceremonies so they are able to accommodate the request.\n\n\"I've gotten over that,\" he said.\n\nChanging county\n\nIf you wanted to identify the Sussex County Republican least like Sam Wilson, it might be Ernie Lopez.\n\nIn his first term as a state senator in the 6th District, representing Lewes, Milton and Rehoboth Beach, he beat a Democrat in a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans. He has cast votes in favor of repealing the death penalty and for limitations on firearms purchases, votes a good number of Sussex conservatives critiqued.\n\nHe did vote against legalizing gay marriage, surprising some who note he represents Rehoboth Beach, traditionally a popular place for gays and lesbians to vacation and own second homes. But as he campaigned in 2012, he opposed a state constitutional amendment that would have prevented the legislature from considering a gay marriage bill at all.\n\nIn an interview, Lopez quickly distanced himself from Wilson's and Phillips' NAACP words.\n\n\"I don't think the comments that were made were reflective of the majority of individuals in the county – Republicans, Democrats, anyone,\" he said. \"We all need to take a step back when we hear those comments.\"\n\nAt the same time, he said, he disputed the notion that Sussex is behind the times on racial issues.\n\n\"This county and this state have been so good to me and my family. I can say that as someone whose last name doesn't pop up in the phone book too often,\" Lopez said. \"As the first Hispanic in the Delaware State Senate coming from Sussex County, I know we've come a long way. But there's still a long way to go.\"\n\nTim Dukes, a Laurel pastor and first-term representative in the state legislature, represents Wilson-Phillips country, on the western side of Sussex. But Dukes said he couldn't get behind the two councilmen's position on the NAACP.\n\n\"It does nothing to promote what our county is about and what we stand for,\" Dukes said in an interview Friday. \"I hope that as a county we have matured enough, and we care enough about one another, that we look past race.\"\n\nRichard Smith, president of the Delaware NAACP, delivered some of the most fiery criticism of Wilson and Phillips last week.\n\n\"I'm trying to understand what came out of your mind to make you say the things you said,\" Smith said at Tuesday's council meeting. \"It's either racism or hate. Which is it?\"\n\nIn a radio interview on Delmarva Public Radio later in the week, Smith attributed the controversy the comments caused, in part, to the changing demographics of Sussex County, saying the county was increasingly led by its more urbanized, less rural eastern populace.\n\n\"What's happening is folks are coming in from D.C, Virginia, and they're coming from New York, and they're moving into Sussex County. So the county is changing,\" Smith said. \"And this little group of people who don't want the change is fighting everything. It's going to be a long fight.\"\n\nMany Sussex Countians, black and white, still have vivid memories of when their hometowns were rigidly segregated by race. J. Everett Moore Jr., an attorney who represents Sussex County's government and attends council meetings, published a book in 2012, \"Growin' up Country,\" that did not shy away from documenting segregation.\n\n\"When integration occurred, Georgetown was the last segregated high school because the blacks in Georgetown were allowed to continue their high school at Jason,\" an all-black high school, Moore wrote. \"Although blacks attended Georgetown High School when I was in high school, there were none in my grade until my senior year in 1968.\" He also recalled summer holidays at Trap Pond, in Laurel, when blacks and whites stayed on different shores of the pond.\n\nWhite people in Moore's world then, he wrote, perceived racial discord as a problem elsewhere, but not in Sussex.\n\n\"Everyone agreed that the 'colored' people around here were good people who didn't want to riot or create problems,\" he wrote of mainstream white sentiment in the mid-1960s. Moore credited a high school teacher of his, Bill Davis – a Nanticoke Indian – with opening his eyes to the damaging effects of segregation. \"Many of us were shocked by what he said,\" Moore wrote.\n\nMany blacks in Sussex County saw it differently from the start. Jea Street, a New Castle County Council member who went to Georgetown to admonish Wilson and Phillips, told them he remembered traveling through the county with his grandfather as a child.\n\n\"I have no memories of joy when he had to come over here, to go through this Circle, to transact his business because of the way he was treated,\" Street said. \"I've tried to forget that as a child we weren't allowed to go to Rehoboth Beach. We had to go to Lewes Beach. As much as I wanted to delude myself and think that things have changed, your statements make it crystal clear that nothing has.\"\n\nPhillips, in comments after the boisterous public comment period on Tuesday, said like Wilson, he believed he'd done the right thing in being skeptical of the NAACP chapter's worthiness for a county grant. He also acknowledged the episode had raised hackles.\n\n\"Maybe apologies, at some point, would be worthy all around,\" Phillips said. \"But in this heated environment, I don't think you're going to get it from anybody.\"\n\nConaway, the retired county administrator, said he didn't think this month's controversy would put a dent in the Sussex County way of life.\n\n\"I think everybody can grow from it,\" Conaway said. \"I haven't noticed the traffic heading south being any lighter. The attraction to come to Sussex is the natural resources God gave us.

The population has doubled since 1990, statistics show.\n\nSouthern Delaware is a vacation home mecca, with over one-third of the housing units here deemed vacant.\n\nBackground:Sussex traffic worsens with growth in housing, jobs, tourism\n\nThe housing market on the eastern side caters especially to retirees and second-home buyers, local realtors say. Bethany Beach realtor Leslie Kopp said in her market, inventory is half of what it was just two years ago.\n\nAt the Peninsula meeting earlier this year, to which Cole said he was late due to traffic, a man asked matter-of-factly, \"You guys approve development. Why don't you stop it?\"\n\nThe Peninsula was approved in November 2002 as a residential planned community for medium density housing, including condominiums. Cole was the sole \"Nay.\"\n\nWhen the council approved The Peninsula 16 years ago, the comprehensive plan had predicted the county would swell to 73,292 households by 2020: In 2016, there were already over 83,000.\n\nOver 40 percent of single-family homes here are less than 20 years old. Last year's fiscal year saw 2,269 new dwelling permits issued, and residential property sales topped 5,000 in 2017.\n\nLess than 20 percent of all land in Sussex County, including parcels listed under protected status, is developed. That leaves 256,000 acres of land that are either undeveloped or farmed.\n\nAs more people stay at the beach beyond summertime tourism, car-dependent sprawl fans out into areas lacking public transportation, shopping centers and roads that accommodate increased traffic.\n\nMany officials are calling for moderate infrastructure improvements, like putting in longer turning lanes, connecting commercial parking lots, adding additional lanes and widening shoulders — fixes that could have been made 10 or 20 years ago, Cole said.\n\n\"Those are the simple things we should be requiring,\" he added.\n\nBut a recent 3-2 vote against Overbrook Town Center, a sprawling shopping center that would have been built in a residential area between Milton and Lewes, shows the county council's near-even divide over rezoning, density and commercial and mixed-use development.\n\nIt's no surprise that a resort area on the Atlantic Ocean within a three-hour drive of Washington D.C., Baltimore and Philadelphia could attract such an influx. That geographic proximity is what makes Sussex County unique, and what makes more people come, year after year, temporarily and permanently.\n\nCole, who is considering stepping down this year as council member after 36 years, is focused on the folks who currently live here year-round, those most impacted by increased development and subsequent traffic.\n\n\"We’re at capacity,\" he said, \"and I just question, is it good to keep piling on?\"\n\nDensity and mixed use, debate\n\nJoe Conaway's single-family home on a spacious corner lot in Georgetown is the picture of low-density suburbia and the Sussex County status quo.\n\nBut it's not Conaway's ideal model for the future of Sussex County.\n\nHe describes himself as pro-growth, and as a land use consultant who has represented large communities like The Peninsula, he ought to be.\n\n\"Smart growth to me is density,\" the former county administrator said. Following the county's low-density scripture of two housing units per acre in agricultural-residential zones forces more development, than, say, allowing four units to the acre.\n\n\"In order to get to 400 units, I've got to do another 200 acres,\" Conaway said. \"So all I do is go down the street and keep building, until we're way out in the county where nobody wants (the houses) to be.\"\n\nSussex County councilman and U.S. Senate candidate Rob Arlett said he supports certain densities in specific locations, though not necessarily to the scale of Sea Colony, which was approved when the county allowed 36 units per acre.\n\nWhile Cole has argued higher density projects will contribute to more traffic, Arlett says the same about single-family homes.\n\n\"No matter what we do it’s not going to change people’s desire to come here,\" Arlett said, questioning what will happen if the county keeps saying yes to just two housing units per acre.\n\n\"It will be a continuation of what’s been happening, and that’s called sprawl,\" he said, adding that more farmland gets eliminated with current development standards and people are pushed onto the back roads. \"That exacerbates the issue.\"\n\nBut the issue isn't just density, Arlett said: It's increasing housing types like apartments and condominiums, and putting them near existing public transportation and infrastructure.\n\nCole said developers are primarily building single-family developments \"because that's what the market is,\" but Arlett wants to bring in affordable housing, which doesn't necessarily equate to detached homes on a half-acre lot, especially in eastern Sussex.\n\nThe Lewes City Council voted 4-1 on June 11 to approve a request to rezone a seven-acre lot to mixed residential.\n\nThe request was submitted by OA Vantage Point II, LLC and is comprised of Greg Stevens, Vantage Point and Ocean Atlantic President Preston Schell.\n\nThe parcel, located off Savannah Road, could contain 165 multi-family apartment units priced for working folks, as presented by Schell Brothers for a conceptual site plan.\n\nThe parcel, located off Savannah Road, could contain 165 multi-family apartment units suited for working folks, as presented by Schell Brothers for a conceptual site plan.\n\nCouncilperson Dennis Reardon said he thinks there is a need for workforce housing, especially for Beebe Hospital and Cape Henlopen High School employees.\n\n\"While there will be a traffic impact, I don’t think it will be that great,\" he said.\n\nAccording to councilperson Rob Morgan, those who spoke against the rezoning request were concerned with density and traffic, especially since it could generate more vehicle trips on Savannah Road.\n\nBut Reardon said the apartments would give people a place to live in Lewes and thus less time on the road.\n\nRelated:Live where you work, unless at the beach. Affordable housing slim at resorts\n\nMore people, even those who can't afford a $300,000 single-family home, can get their housing slice, according to Conaway. It will just take more density and mixed-use development, which may also help residents drive less miles to get to shopping, nightlife and other amenities that improve quality of life.\n\nDelaware Department of Transportation planning director Drew Boyce said the agency supports mixed-use development. Integrated residences and businesses are part of Sussex County's history, he added.\n\n\"When we first came here and started settling, everything was mixed together,\" Boyce said. \"The general store, housing and restaurants were all on the same block.\"\n\nThen the county created zoning districts, which Boyce said serves a purpose for separating incompatible industries like loud manufacturing businesses from neighborhoods.\n\n\"But what's wrong with having a school in a residential area, or a food service provider?\" he said. \"Those types of mixed use we encourage.\"\n\nTransportation, issues in the past\n\nTransportation and development are at an all-time high now, but the roadside affair has been ongoing for over 40 years now.\n\nConaway remembered fighting the “continuous battle” for better roads back in the 1970s during his time as county administrator.\n\nHe testified on the floor of the state senate and told legislators Sussex County needed relief from traffic congestion.\n\nAn upstate senator, whom Conaway declined to name, told him, \"Look, it's a 100-day season. Get used to it.\" Now, the summer season's congestion is spreading into the rest of the year as more people fall in love with Sussex County so much they decide to live there.\n\n\"The opportunity to correct some of the road problems is slowly diminishing,\" Conaway said\n\n\"You didn't notice there were a lot of cars? You didn't notice that we are a large tourist industry?\" Conaway asked, figuratively pointing at the newcomers who complain about traffic at county meetings.\n\nStory continues after graphic\n\nDelDOT doesn't have to build a bunch of new roads, Conaway said. Rather, it should better utilize existing ones by renumbering them and redirecting people to them.\n\nIn the 70s, during Conaway's time as county administrator, the state suggested building a new Route 26 south of Bethany Beach, one that would have involved seven major acquisitions.\n\n\"The people raised hell: 'We'll never need that kind of road. It'll never happen,'\" Conaway recalled. \"Well, it did.\"\n\nBoyce mirrored Conaway's observation, saying many proposals to expand major corridors like Route 26 and Route 9 were \"met with a lot of opposition,\" halting projects to improve major links to Sussex County's transportation system.\n\nMore:Five Points traffic nightmare: Officials search for a fix\n\nMore:Senior transportation expands in Sussex County\n\nPart of it may have been DelDOT's fault in how they communicated projects, but that's changing, according to Boyce.\n\n\"We're getting folks to see the future and where we're going, now that the future is in their front yard,\" he said. \"Folks are realizing you can't just do nothing. No is no longer an answer to the transportation issues.\"\n\nOverbrook and mixed use\n\nA young Joe Biden, who was just starting his career as a senator in 1973, came up to Joe Conaway after a town meeting, wanting to talk to him.\n\nThey went down to his office and Conaway asked, \"What's the problem?\"\n\n\"You've got to stop this development,\" Conaway remembers Biden saying. \"You've got to do something about all this traffic and growth.\"\n\n\"And I said to him, 'I'll do it. I'll get fired, and people are going to be mad,' \" he recalled. \" 'But you answer one question for me: Who's the last person on the beach? Give me their name. Who's the last person here?'\"\n\nForty-five years later, the last person is yet to be determined in Sussex County, and Conaway's land consultancy business is still representing incoming developments.\n\nOverbrook Town Center, a recently rejected project that Conaway provided his services to, in its most recent manifestation would have been a 312,000-square-foot shopping center in front of a residential development called Overbrook Acres with 135 homes on 66 acres.\n\nThe project, which would have been located on Cave Neck Road just off Route 1, met massive public opposition. Nearby residents voiced concerns about quality of life, the environment and of course, traffic.\n\nMore:Sussex officials say no to rezoning farmland on Del. 1 for Overbrook Town Center\n\nMore:Overbrook Town Center: What to know about the revote\n\nDespite the updated mixed-use proposal, the developers were rejected by a 3-2 vote.\n\n\"Overbrook was designed to bring regular shopping to Sussex County,\" Conaway said. \"The things you go to Salisbury and Dover to get, that's what would have been there.\"\n\nWhile the future of the parcel is yet to be determined, it may become what it was zoned for: residential housing, no more than two units to the acre.\n\n\"We can’t keep saying yes to single-family homes and keep saying no to commercial,\" Arlett said. \"You need commercial to support those (people) buying the homes.\"\n\nMillsboro example, looking to future\n\nNot everyone says no to growth.\n\nMillsboro grew in population by 12 percent from July 2016 to June 2017, according to the town's website. It issued the highest number of residential permits in the county between 2011 and 2016. And it prides itself in being a \"truly pro-business, pro-family town.\"\n\n\"If you're not growing, you're dying,\" town manager Sheldon Hudson said. \"We want to find a way for the town to embrace the positive aspects of development.\"\n\nDevelopments in Millsboro like Plantation Lakes carry a mix of housing options, from single-family homes to villas and townhomes, which arguably cost much less in Millsboro than they would near the beach.\n\nHudson is a proponent of \"work where you live,\" and calls place-making \"huge.\" He often uses the tagline, \"the convenience of a city but the charm of a small town,\" when describing Millsboro.\n\nMore:Millsboro says plan to draw business, residents is working\n\nMore:Millsboro hopes to build restaurant boom downtown\n\nRetirees and millennials have at least one thing in common: They want to do as much as they can in the place they live, Hudson said.\n\nAnd if Millsboro can attract enough of a mix of people, from millennials to retired folks, from hospitality workers to health care professionals, it could end up creating a mixed-use environment, where services are in close proximity to residences.\n\nBut it doesn't work if higher density development is not within walking or biking distance.\n\n\"(George) Cole is right in that if it's truly not dense and diverse enough to have commercial reasonably close to residential, then you just end up in a smaller space,\" Hudson said.\n\nPublic transportation works \"much better\" in higher density, urbanized areas like Wilmington, Boyce said. Having more regular riders means DelDOT can provide a more reliable bus service.\n\n\"Density in the middle of nowhere doesn’t help anybody,\" Boyce said, echoing Cole. \"But if we can cluster higher density developments in and around existing transit routes, that allows us to potentially increase the frequency of those transit routes and provide a better service.\"\n\nSussex County Council is in discussion for a potential pilot program that would be located in a geographic area not completely built out yet, Arlett said.\n\nIt could serve as Sussex County's mixed-use trailblazer.\n\nThe area would include \"all types of housing\" and commercial development near residences. Arlett calls the test an \"opportunity to plan for the future.\"\n\nFor now, as tourists squeeze their way into the resorts this summer, Cole is determined to accomplish one feat: Keep the traffic moving.\n\n\"We will be defeated if we get gridlock on a regular basis and it just comes to a halt,\" Cole said, adding that proposed solutions need to ensure the roadways don't become a parking lot.\n\n\"Nothing is worse than being stuck in gridlock. That kills me,\" Cole said. \"If I’m creeping along, I’ve got hope.\"\n\ntgoebel@delmarvanow.com\n\nTraffic by the numbers\n\nBetween 2001 and 2016\n\n•Route 16, a two-lane east-west highway, saw an 82 percent increase in traffic.

She had seconds to make a decision.\n\nThe jammer for Southern Delaware Roller Derby juked one way, then leaped over a blocker with acrobatic grace to avoid being stopped and scored five points for her team.\n\nThat kind of physical action and savvy skating was front and center at the Dover Skating Center when her team hosted River City Roller Derby from Richmond, Virginia.\n\nWith nonstop physical action and names like Betty ClockHer, Brute E. Licious, Hello Killy and Prim N Popher, Southern Delaware's version of roller derby is every bit as entertaining as the leagues made popular by TV in the 1980s and 90s.\n\nThere's one difference, though. The women who skate for Southern Delaware Roller Derby are the real deal.\n\nBack in its TV glory years, roller derby resembled and had a following much as professional wrestling does today.\n\nThe sport included staged action and storylines, and the most popular was called RollerGames, which featured a figure-8 shaped banked track, dancers and stunts like the sudden-death alligator pit (with real reptiles).\n\nOn Saturday against River City, it was just two teams battling it out for superiority.\n\nThere were player pileups, acrobatic skating and a lot of physical action from start to finish of the bout, which is two 30-minute periods. Included in the action were multiple 30-second penalties for illegal actions like blocks to the back, tripping or throwing elbows.\n\nWith exotic makeup, face paint, multicolored leggings and even spiked belts to accentuate the uniform, the \"RollerGirls\" pulled off the bad girl image perfectly.\n\nThat's the trademark of the team and roller derby matches in the Women's Flat Track Derby Association, said Andrea Davis, whose derby name is Double Treble because she's a choir teacher and singer by trade.\n\n\"It's fun, but physically grueling,\" said Davis, a veteran member of four years. She is taking time off from skating to have a child (called a nine-month injury in roller derby vernacular) in November. \"It's a full-contact, hard-hitting sport. It's not for the faint of heart.\"\n\nThe names given some of the moves can be just as entertaining as the game itself, such as booty block, the can opener, cannonballing, butt to the gut, hip whip, seal clubbing and the soul crush, to name a few.\n\nAnd should some of the moves and rough play result in injury, the referees are quick to stop the action. Emergency medical technicians are present at every game to check the downed player while the other participants take a knee.\n\nWhile the recent bout was non-sanctioned and was played to get the newest members of the combined Southern Delaware team experience, the action was rough and tumble.\n\nSODEL and Diamond State Roller Derby out of Christiana (founded in 2006) are the only sanctioned leagues from Delaware in the 417-league Women's Flat Track Derby Association worldwide organization.\n\nSince its inception in April 2011, the Dover team has grown to include 25 to 30 skaters who make up two home teams that essentially go by the same name. One is a sanctioned \"travel\" team consisting of the league's best players, while the other is made up of newer, less experienced skaters.\n\nThe sanctioned bouts count toward the team's ranking, and there is a four-bout minimum to maintain accreditation in the organization.\n\nPlayers on both teams have an opportunity to participate in home bouts, as well as travel to play other teams. SODEL has traveled to West Virginia and Connecticut and will skate in New York and Ohio later this year. The team's next bout is Aug. 11 against Charm Female Trouble out of the Baltimore/Washington area at the Dover Skating Center.\n\nBesides the skating members, the team has many league members who don't skate but do behind-the-scenes things. More than 15 sanctioned officials, many with names just as entertaining as the skaters, oversee the action.\n\nWhen she's on the track, Davis is no different than the others who let their alter-egos and competitive natures take over.\n\n\"Some of us grew up playing traditional competitive sports and were looking for that same type of rush,\" she said. \"We're not looking to kill each other out there, but everybody is here to play as hard as they can, for as long as they can.\"\n\nIf the jammers are fast and physical, the scores can be high. In the Saturday bout, Betty ClockHer (Jamie Doerfler), Brute E. Licious (Caitlyn Short) and Prim N Popher (Alicia Kendoeski) provided all the firepower the team needed for a 304-106 win.\n\nA PRIMER: The basics of roller derby scoring\n\nA growing family\n\nSODEL is a skater-run, skater-owned nonprofit organization. Davis said since its start, the following has grown and each bout is a production with an announcer, volunteers keeping score and selling merchandise and others selling raffle tickets for various charities.\n\nWhen the league started, the team skated out of the Milford Skating Center and had a pretty large following from Sussex County. That has grown since the team started skating out of Dover, she said.\n\n\"We are still drawing spectators from the southern part of the state,\" Davis said. \"In addition, our friends from Smyrna and Middletown and southern New Castle (County) are making the short trip.\"\n\nKasey Bennett, one of the regular skaters who sat out Saturday's bout to give the newer players a chance to gain more experience, said the roller derby scene is a subculture.\n\nShe said the reason the sport is growing is the \"wow factor.\"\n\n\"Getting them in the door the first time is the trick,\" said Bennett, a six-year veteran called Racey Anthony on the track. \"Once they are in, I have never heard anyone say anything other than that was more competitive, hard-hitting, exciting and athletic than I ever thought it was going to be. They are pleasantly shocked and come back.\"\n\nThat's the case for Brute E. Licious' grandmother Arlene Evans and her friend John Jeffries, who make it to every home bout. The fans are affectionately known as \"Bleacher Creatures.\"\n\n\"I couldn't believe how rough they get,\" Evans said. \"I was afraid of her (Brute E. Licious) getting hurt, but it's so exciting. I love it.\"\n\nReach Jerry Smith at jsmith17@delawareonline.com.

Kay Ivey on Friday signed employment protections for workers who claim a religious or health reason for not getting vaccinated against COVID-19. The Republican governor signed the legislation a day after it was approved by the Alabama Legislature as GOP-led states turn to lawsuits and legislation to fight federal vaccine requirements that they call an infringement on personal liberties. Ivey also signed into law a separate bill requiring parental consent for minors to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The new law says employers in Alabama can’t fire workers for being unvaccinated if the employee returns a new standardized state form to claim a religious or medical exemption. President Joe Biden in September announced contractors who do business with the federal government must have workforces vaccinated, with no option to test out. The Alabama law will also affect companies, such as medical providers, who wanted to independently place vaccination requirements on workers. The bill drew opposition from the Business Council of Alabama, which said it would put federal contractors in a no-win situation. Democrats said Republicans were putting both jobs and public health in jeopardy for the sake of scoring political points.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Department of the Interior said the first two federal land allotments to Alaska Native Vietnam War-era veterans have been finalized. Frank Nanooruk and Richard Boskoffsky received the first allotments under a 2019 law passed by Congress, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. The allotments are east of Goodnews Bay in southwest Alaska, agency spokesperson Richard Packer said by email Friday. The Interior Department said the allotments were finalized Thursday. Under the 1906 Alaska Native Allotment Act, Alaska Natives were allowed to apply for up to 160 acres of land. Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s office has said that the program’s restrictions kept many from applying until the 1960s. There was a push to urge Alaska Natives to apply for lands if they had not already done so before a 1971 law took effect. But that period overlapped with the Vietnam War. A 1998 federal law allowed veterans to apply for land, but the provisions were seen as restrictive. The 2019 law lifted use and occupancy requirements that were part of prior laws and made lands available until late 2025, the Bureau of Land Management has said. “We have a sacred obligation to America’s veterans,” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Education advocates did not collect enough valid signatures to give voters a chance to repeal a new state law exempting some business owners from a tax increase on the wealthy to boost school funding, a lawyer for Secretary of State Katie Hobbs said Friday. The measure is one of two tax-cut bills signed this year by Gov. Doug Ducey that school-funding advocates are trying to refer to the 2022 ballot. County election officials reviewing a sample of the 123,500 submitted signatures found too many were invalid. Petitioners needed 118,823 valid signatures. The failure to collect enough signatures is not likely to matter much, however, because the Arizona Supreme Court has signaled that the entire tax increase, approved by voters last year as Proposition 208, is likely to be struck down. In addition to the tax exemption for business owners, education groups want voters to have a say on a new flat income tax rate of 2.5%, which would cut taxes by about $2 billion a year, primarily benefiting the wealthy. They turned in significantly more signatures to refer that measure. Lawyers for the Free Enterprise Club, a conservative advocacy group, argued in court Friday that the constitution does not allow referrals for measures that provide for “support and maintenance” of state government and that tax cut bills fall into that category.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: A former state senator convicted in 2018 of corruption-related charges is pushing forward with a request for a new trial. Attorney Lee D. Short of North Little Rock filed notice Wednesday that his client, former Sen. Jon Woods, will take his request for a new trial to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Woods was sentenced to more than 18 years in prison on 15 counts of conspiracy, fraud and money laundering for a bribery scheme in which prosecutors said he and another Republican legislator were taking kickbacks from state grants meant to be directed to nonprofit groups. The scheme involved at least $20 million taken from taxpayers or the nonprofit. The request for a retrial comes after claims that the FBI coerced former state Sen. Jeremy Hutchinson into giving incriminating information about Woods that lead to his investigation and subsequent conviction. According to the Democrat-Gazette, the information Hutchinson gave the FBI should have been protected by attorney-client privilege. Four additional state legislators pleaded guilty or were convicted on corruption-related charges in the investigation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nDiamond Bar: Southern California air regulators on Friday approved new restrictions on area oil refineries and other factories that could remove tons of smog-forming pollutants from the air. The board of the South Coast Air Quality Management District adopted rule changes requiring emissions limits on oxides of nitrogen that will affect nine refineries and seven plants that produce asphalt, biofuel plants, hydrogen and sulfuric acid. Oxides of nitrogen, collectively known as NOx, form when fuel is burned at high temperatures. The gases can be produced by cars and industrial sources such as refineries and power plants. They are a key ingredient in producing ozone pollution. The new rules will reduce NOx emissions by about 8 tons per day over the next 14 years, with nearly half the reductions expected by 2023, and will go a long way to helping the region meet some federal air quality standards by 2031, the AQMD said. The rules apply to some 300 pieces of combustion equipment at the facilities, such as boilers and gas turbines. The rules, which will be implemented over a decade, provide two ways of meeting the new requirements and also ban refineries from purchasing credits to offset pollution they produce. The total cost of implementing the new rules is projected at about $2.3 billion, but the reduction in health costs from pollution is expected to be about $2.6 billion, according to a September AQMD study session.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Two hyenas at the Denver Zoo have tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the first confirmed cases among the animals worldwide, a national veterinary lab announced Friday. Samples from a variety of animals at the zoo, including the spotted hyenas, were tested after several lions at the facility became ill, according to the National Veterinary Services Laboratories. The hyena samples tested presumptive positive at a lab at Colorado State University, and the cases were confirmed by the national lab. In addition to the two hyenas, 11 lions and two tigers at the zoo tested positive for the virus. “Hyenas are famously tough, resilient animals that are known to be highly tolerant to anthrax, rabies and distemper. They are otherwise healthy and expected to make a full recovery,” the zoo said in a statement. Zoo officials said the hyenas – 22-year-old Ngozi and 23-year-old Kibo – are experiencing mild symptoms, including slight lethargy, some nasal discharge and an occasional cough. The other animals that tested positive in recent weeks either have fully recovered or are on the path to a full recovery. “We now know that many other species may be susceptible to COVID-19 based on multiple reports, and we continue to use the highest level of care and precaution when working with all of our 3,000 animals and 450 different species,” the statement said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Bomb threats forced the evacuation of several buildings at Yale University as well as nearby businesses for hours Friday, school and city officials said. A single caller to the New Haven police nonemergency line indicated there were bombs in eight buildings on campus about 2 p.m., police and school officials said. People in the buildings were initially told to go to the New Haven Green. Later, they were directed to certain indoor locations. Yale gave the all clear at about 7 p.m. and said the campus had resumed normal operations. Several city streets were blocked off as law enforcement officials with bomb-sniffing dogs prepared to search the buildings that were threatened. FBI and state police were helping Yale and New Haven authorities in the investigation and response. “We’re treating this as if it is a legitimate threat; however, at this time we are still working on who the caller was,” acting New Haven Police Chief Renee Dominguez said at a late afternoon news conference. Yale Police Chief Ronnell Higgins said the person who made the bomb threats did not give a reason.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The family-owned Delaware Park, home to the state’s biggest thoroughbred horse race each year, is being sold to a private equity firm and a gambling investor. The sale of Delaware Park, which has been operated by the Rickman family since the early 1980s and now includes a casino, should be completed by the end of the year, according to a news release Friday. The new owners will be Canadian-based Clairvest Group Inc. and Rubico Gaming LLC, a newly formed subsidiary run by investor Thomas Benninger. Delaware Park President Bill Fasy, who declined to comment Friday when asked about a sale price, said he wasn’t aware of any immediate operational changes to the Wilmington-based attraction, which hosts the Delaware Handicap each July. First developed by William du Pont Jr. in the 1930s, Delaware Park was known as the only major East Coast track, save for Aqueduct in New York, that raced in June. In 1983, longtime Maryland-based real estate developer William Rickman Sr. purchased the track, which had closed after financial troubles. He revived the business by offering smaller purses, which attracted cheaper horses. Competition improved in 1996 when legislation allowed slot machines at the track.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Howard University’s president addressed students Friday as campus protests entered a 24th day Friday, WUSA-TV reports. Dozens of students began occupying the Blackburn University Center and set up tents on the yard in October to bring attention to several issues, including a demand for better living conditions, as they claim some dormitory rooms have been found to have mold. They also want student representation to be restored on the university board of trustees. “We’re not just these radical Black students,” said Channing Hill, a junior at Howard. “We’re simply trying to garner the first-class living conditions that Georgetown students have.” The day’s protests coincided with President Wayne Frederick’s annual State of the University address. Frederick took questions from students and alumni in a virtual event and said he was “empathetic with the students who have concerns.” He said one student with mold in their room is one too many, and Howard needs to make sure its housing partners who are responsible for the upkeep and cleaning air ducts are doing it at a high level. But Frederick also said dorms are not any worse now than they have been in the past. “The physical infrastructure of our residence halls today is as good as it’s ever been,” he said.\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Reversing its previous position, the University of Florida said Friday that it will allow three professors to testify as experts in a lawsuit challenging a new state election law that critics say restricts voting rights. Last month, the university prohibited Dan Smith, Michael McDonald and Sharon Austin from testifying in the lawsuit brought by civic groups, saying that such testimony would put the school in conflict with the administration of Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, which pushed the election law. More than half of the university’s trustees are appointed by the governor. In a letter to the campus, university President Kent Fuchs said he is asking the office responsible for approving professors’ outside work to greenlight their request to serve as expert witnesses in the litigation. Fuchs said the outside work would have to be on the professors’ own time and not use university resources. Attorneys representing the professors said they were still planning to move forward with a lawsuit against the university. The school’s announcement came after the union for faculty members urged donors to withhold contributions and scholars and artists to turn down invitations to campus until university administrators affirmed the free speech rights of school employees.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Republicans on Friday advanced a plan projected to maintain a 33-23 GOP majority in the state Senate, setting it up for a possible vote this week in the full Senate. The proposal passed the Senate Reapportionment and Redistricting Committee on a 9-4 party-line vote over complaints that Republicans pushed too fast for a proposal released late Tuesday. “This process has gone too fast,” said Sen. Harold Jones II, D-Augusta. “We should really know what we’re talking about.” As senators voted, a House committee started considering new districts for the 180-member state House. The General Assembly must redraw electoral districts at least once every decade to equalize populations following the U.S. census. Georgia added more than a million people from 2010 to 2020, with urban districts generally growing and rural districts usually shrinking. This will be the first time in decades that Georgia lawmakers won’t be required to get federal approval of their maps after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a portion of the Voting Rights Act. Committee Chairman John Kennedy, R-Macon, noted that this year’s redistricting process had been compressed because of delays in releasing census results. But he said that if people wanted different alternatives considered, they should have gotten their senators to introduce them.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: An independent review of the state of astronomy and astrophysics in the U.S. has recommended federal funding of a giant telescope in the state. The Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey warned it could be “disastrous” for U.S. astronomy if the National Science Foundation does not invest in projects like the Thirty Meter Telescope, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. The survey recommends the U.S. government fund several large astronomy projects. “There’s a little bit of a feeling of astronomy going the way of physics,” said Doug Simons, director of the University of Hawaii’s Institute for Astronomy. He said the cancellation of a particle accelerator in Texas in 1993 resulted in the research moving to European facilities like the Large Hadron Collider. “I think if … the Europeans were the only international organization that had this kind of research capacity, that really signals something kind of alarming in the U.S., which has historically had a leadership role in contemporary astronomy.” But the report also highlights astronomy’s problems with Indigenous people. Some Native Hawaiians consider the proposed site for the giant telescope, on the Big Island’s Mauna Kea, to be sacred. “I wish they would have recognized that we have already spoken,” Native Hawaiian activist Kealoha Pisciotta said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and Jim Risch sent a letter to the White House last week requesting a meeting about Idaho’s federal district judge vacancy, saying it “cannot be filled” without a “mutual agreement” between them and the administration. But the “blue slip” procedure that the Republicans referenced – a system that gave home-state senators a veto over federal judicial nominees – was thrown out during the Trump administration, when federal judges were appointed over objections from Democratic senators. “The blue slip procedure regarding filling United States District Court vacancies is alive and well,” the two senators wrote in a Nov. 2 letter to Dana Remus, counsel to the president, the Idaho Press reports. Idaho’s top Democratic elected officials submitted an all-female list of four nominees to the White House in March, but there’s been no further word on the nomination since then. U.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill took senior status in August, making Idaho eligible for another federal judge. The Democratics nominated Idaho Falls attorney DeAnne Casperson, Boise attorney Keely Duke, Boise attorney Deborah Ferguson and former U.S. Attorney for Idaho Wendy Olson. Idaho is one of just three states with only two U.S. district judges and has not gotten an additional judgeship in 60 years, though caseloads have soared.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Chicago Public Schools officials have canceled all classes next Friday in a bid to boost COVID-19 vaccinations among younger students who are newly eligible for the shots. A letter from the district sent Thursday to parents and families said schools will be closed Nov. 12 for “Vaccination Awareness Day” after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved a COVID-19 vaccine for children 5 to 11 years old last week. District CEO Pedro Martinez said next Friday’s canceled classes will provide “an opportunity for parents and guardians to take their children 5 years of age and older to get vaccinated.” He said sporting events would not be canceled. Martinez and Chicago Public Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady have stressed their desire to see children vaccinated ahead of the holidays, when family gatherings have proven to spread the coronavirus at high rates. Jesse Sharkey, the Chicago Teachers Union president, said in a statement to union members that he welcomes the district’s acknowledgment of the importance for parents and families to get their children vaccinated. Free vaccines can be obtained at sites around the city. In addition, CPS has set up four clinics where students can get shots. Appointments can be made at cps.edu/vaccinations.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: With state tax collections surging, a top Republican legislator is looking at possible significant changes to the state sales tax and cutting property taxes for some businesses. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Tim Brown hasn’t offered details yet for what he could propose for the new legislative session starting in January, but such changes face concerns about the possibility of an economic slowdown and the impact on funding for local governments and school districts. Topics in Brown’s sights include expanding Indiana’s 7% sales tax that covers merchandise purchases ranging from clothing to cars so that it also is charged for spending on services, which potentially could be anything from haircuts to hospital stays. Brown said his aim would be to lower the sales tax rate if it were applied to a broader range of spending. Brown pointed to a trend of more spending on services, which federal reports show now make up nearly 70% of consumer spending. “Our sales tax base is changing a lot, so I am interested in looking at sales tax, and sales tax affects everybody,” Brown said. “It doesn’t matter how much money you make; you pay sales tax.”\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: Twenty years after a fire destroyed the dome of the University of Iowa’s Old Capitol, the UI now is preparing to redo “failing” gilding at an estimated cost of $200,000 to $500,000. The UI will pay OPN Architects $23,500 to study the “causes and extents of gilding failure on the Old Capitol dome and develop recommendations for repair and restoration,” according to a contract signed in September. The study may include drone photography, sampling of the gold leaf and consultation with the State Historic Preservation Office. Wendy Moorehead, UI assistant director of facilities management, said that “the campus is excited to celebrate the upcoming year representing the 175th anniversary of the UI, and the Old Capitol dome, at the heart of campus, will represent that important milestone.” Another major milestone was the Nov. 20, 2001, fire that destroyed the dome, damaged much of the historic building and kept the Old Capitol shuttered for five years. The Old Capitol Building, for which the cornerstone was laid July 4, 1840, was to be the hub of state government after Iowa City was chosen as the state capital in 1839. The Iowa Legislative Assembly met in the building for the first time in December 1842. The Legislature decided in 1857 to move the capital to Des Moines. Old Cap housed most of the UI classes after the university was founded in 1847. The building also served as the library, chapel, armory and office space for administrators.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly grew more forceful Friday in opposing President Joe Biden’s COVID-19 vaccine mandates, saying it’s “too late” in the pandemic to impose them after Kansas and other states tailored responses to their needs. Kelly’s latest statement came a day after she argued that federal mandates “tend not to work,” though they’ve boosted vaccination rates elsewhere. She faces a difficult race for reelection next year in her Republican-leaning state, and GOP officials have been attacking the Democratic president’s mandates for weeks and criticizing Kelly for not making any public comments until Thursday. “While I appreciate the intention to keep people safe, a goal I share, I don’t believe this directive is the correct, or the most effective, solution for Kansas,” Kelly said in her latest statement. Attorney General Derek Schmidt, a Republican who hopes to unseat Kelly next year, announced later Friday that Kansas is among seven states that filed a federal lawsuit with the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati against a Biden mandate that applies to companies with more than 100 workers. Schmidt already had brought Kansas into a federal lawsuit against a mandate applying to employees of federal government contractors.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Gov. Andy Beshear, a Bluegrass State bourbon industry leader and a Louisville-based spirits producer are applauding an agreement between the United States and the European Union to lift tariffs on bourbon and whiskey. The United States and European Union have been in a trade war since 2018, when the former imposed a 25% tariff, or tax on imports, on European steel and a 10% tariff on aluminum under then-President Donald Trump. The European Union retaliated with tariffs on American products, including a 25% on bourbon whiskey. That tariff on a major Kentucky product was set to double Dec. 1. But now, for bourbon producers, “it’s time to raise a glass,” Kentucky Distillers Association President Eric Gregory said. National security adviser Jake Sullivan, U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo announced an agreement Oct. 30 in which the United States will allow some quantity of European steel and aluminum to come to the country without tariffs, and, in turn, the European Union will drop its retaliatory tariffs. Gregory said that “these unfortunate tariffs have slashed exports of Kentucky bourbon by 50% to the EU and the United Kingdom, costing distillers, industry partners and farm families hundreds of millions of dollars.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nFranklin: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is holding a contest to name a recently improved pond in a national wildlife refuge. The agency has graded the parking lot and installed a floating dock and an information kiosk at the pond on Stephen R. Road in the Bayou Teche National Wildlife Refuge near Franklin. Now it’s asking people to visit the refuge and take a selfie or a photo of their family enjoying its trails as part of their entry. The photo, proposed name and a short explanation of the name can be submitted by email – bayouteche@fws.gov – or at facebook.com/SoutheastLouisiana. Specific personal names or vulgar, profane, racially insensitive or other derogatory names will not be accepted. The top five entries will be announced Dec. 2 on the refuge’s Facebook page, and the public will have a week to choose their favorite. The winning name will be announced live on Facebook at 10 a.m. Saturday, Dec. 11.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The state’s environmental commissioner said Friday that she’ll take the referendum vote into account when deciding whether to suspend a permit for a $1 billion electric transmission line in western Maine. Commissioner Melanie Loyzim will close comments at the end of a new public hearing Nov. 22 so she can expedite a decision. Loyzim’s letter to New England Clean Energy Connect points to an aggressive timetable after Maine residents voted Tuesday to halt the project. The law takes effect 30 days after election results are certified. The Natural Resources Council of Maine told the commissioner the permit should be revoked immediately to prevent further environmental damage during construction, which is continuing. It would be a “dereliction of duty” for regulators to allow “continued destruction” of woodlands while waiting for the law to go into effect, James Kilbreth, a lawyer for NRCM, wrote Thursday in a notice to environmental regulators. The 145-mile power transmission line would serve as a conduit for up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower. Most of it would be built along existing corridors, but a new 53-mile section is being cut through the woods to reach the Canadian border.\n\nMaryland\n\nElkton: The Christmas tree that will light up Rockefeller Center this holiday season is coming from Maryland for the first time in the nearly nine decades of the annual tradition. A 79-foot-tall Norway spruce will be cut down in Elkton next Thursday and arrive in New York City on Saturday, the center announced Thursday. Rockefeller Center’s website says the 85-year-old tree will be covered with about 5 miles of wire holding more than 50,000 multicolored lights and topped with a 900-pound star covered in 3 million Swarovski crystals. The lighting ceremony is scheduled for Dec. 1 and will be televised on NBC. After that, the tree will be lit daily from 6 a.m. to midnight. It will be lit for 24 hours on Christmas Day and from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. on New Year’s Eve.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Three residents of a tent encampment at the nexus of the city’s opioid and homelessness crises say in a lawsuit that Boston’s plan to move them from the area is unconstitutional because it doesn’t provide viable alternatives, officials said Friday. The lawsuit filed Thursday in Suffolk Superior Court by the American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts and the WilmerHale law firm was in response to the city’s decision last month to declare addiction and homelessness a public health emergency and clean up the area around Massachusetts Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard, known as Mass and Cass. The city pledged to find treatment or alternative housing for people displaced from tents in the area but has not properly done so, according to the ACLU. Although only three plaintiffs are mentioned, the suit applies to all residents of the area, according to the ACLU. “We can’t sweep or arrest our way out of the intersecting crises at Mass and Cass,” Carol Rose, the state ACLU’s executive director, said in a statement. “This plan is harmful and unconstitutional because it forces people to disperse with no safe place to sleep, while disconnecting them from the medical care they are able to receive at Mass and Cass.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday vetoed Republican-backed bills that would have created scholarship accounts for K-12 students to pay for educational expenses, including private school and tutoring, and given tax credits to people and corporations that donate to the program. The veto, which was expected, came the same week proponents of the legislation preemptively launched a ballot drive that would enable the GOP-led Legislature to enact identical citizen-initiated bills without her signature. The Democratic governor said the bills would cut state revenue by as much as $500 million in 2022 alone. “Simply put, our schools cannot provide the high-quality education our kids deserve if we turn private schools into tax shelters for the wealthy,” she wrote to lawmakers, adding that she has worked to reverse disinvestment in public education. School-choice proponents such as the Great Lakes Education Project criticized Whitmer, saying the funds would have helped more than 1 million kids who fell behind during the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the plan, students would have been eligible for scholarships if their family income was no more than double the cutoff to receive free or reduced-priced lunch – $98,050 for a family of four currently – or if they had a disability or were in foster care.\n\nMinnesota\n\nPine City: Gov. Tim Walz was among the thousands of hunters who took to the field Saturday for the state’s firearms deer hunting season opener. Walz hunted with Brady Crocker and Kevin Hinze on the Hinze family’s private property in Pine County. The family permanently protected the land by donating a conservation easement to the Minnesota Land Trust. Walz, Crocker and Hinze didn’t get a deer, but the opener was marked by beautiful, warmer-than-usual weather across most of Minnesota. Following the hunt, Walz visited a chronic wasting disease sampling site in Pine City, joined by Department of Natural Resources Commissioner Sarah Strommen and Agriculture Commissioner Thom Petersen. They highlighted the importance of sampling to detect the brain disease, which is always fatal in deer. During opening weekend, people hunting in CWD surveillance, control, or management zones must bring their harvested deer to sampling stations to be tested. Voluntary sampling is available after the opening weekend for deer harvested within a CWD zone. “I ask all Minnesota deer hunters to be aware of CWD regulations and use one of the state’s sampling sites if hunting in a mandatory or voluntary sampling area,” Walz said in a statement.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An environmental group is using fines from the 2010 BP oil spill to plan the state’s first oyster shell recycling program. “It’s very straightforward – take the actual oyster shell and reuse it to help restore the very resource it’s providing. But the devil is always in the details,” said Alex Littlejohn, state director for The Nature Conservancy. “We want to learn from the other successful programs like this in other states, work through the kinks and make this a viable program for Mississippi.” At least 14 other states have had programs that collect empty shells from restaurants, festivals and other venues and use them to build coastal reefs. A survey before the COVID-19 pandemic found such programs in all four other Gulf Coast states, nine on the East Coast, and California, said Tom Mohrman, The Nature Conservancy’s director of marine programs. The programs often cover specific areas, such as Galveston Bay or Mobile Bay, but Mississippi’s coastline is small enough that one program could cover it all, he said. Mississippi’s Gulf Coast generally has plenty of oyster larvae but needs more hard surfaces where they can attach themselves and grow into oysters, the organization said in a news release. Oyster reefs also create homes for other types of marine life, slow waves that erode coastlines, and purify water.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The U.S. Office of Special Counsel said in a letter to President Joe Biden and members of Congress that employees at a federal office complex in the city were exposed to “widespread, longstanding” contamination from asbestos, lead, mercury, arsenic and other toxic materials by the agency in charge of managing government workplaces. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports that the letter, issued Friday, also noted that children at an on-site day care facility were exposed. The letter said officials deliberately misled tenants about the health risks at the Goodfellow Federal Center in north St. Louis. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel handles investigations and prosecution aimed at protecting federal employees. The OSC said an investigation into whistleblower allegations “substantiated that officials had been aware of environmental contamination but failed to appropriately notify GSA employees or tenant agencies.” The investigation also concluded that officials made no effort to limit access to contaminated areas and failed to assess potential exposure risks in the site’s child care center. The GSA has said it is working to close the Goodfellow complex and expects to relocate most tenant agencies by the end of 2022.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Calls to the Missoula Mobile Support Team have significantly reduced the number of people who would otherwise be taken to jail or to an emergency room since the team’s inception late last year, according to a presentation the program’s organizers made to a City Council committee Wednesday. Data shows that calls to the team are also on the rise. “The number of calls increased over time and continue to increase,” Gretchen Neal, Missoula County’s mental health coordinator, told the Missoulian. The Mobile Support Team is funded by the county, the city and the state. Emergency medical technicians from the Missoula Fire Department and licensed behavioral health clinicians or clinicians in training work with case facilitators to staff the team. They are trained to provide consultation, screening and brief intervention to individuals in crisis stemming from behavioral health issues, which includes mental health issues or substance abuse issues. The goal is to provide them with the care they need while reducing the time that first responders spend addressing a situation in which behavioral health is the chief concern. Another goal is to reduce the number of arrests and emergency room visits, which reduces government-funded jail and hospital costs.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The city plans to join hundreds of others across the nation trying to come up with strategies to combat climate change. While the Nebraska Legislature has rejected calls for a statewide plan, Omaha will lead a metropolitan area climate action plan expected to be funded with a mix of public and private money, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Mayor Jean Stothert told the newspaper in an email that the time is right. “Omaha has been implementing sustainability measures for some time now without the need for a formal plan,” she wrote. “The current timeline gives us the opportunity to maximize the results of more coordination for climate-related practices.” Climate plans typically involve identifying where a community is most vulnerable to severe weather, its contribution to global warming, what needs to be done and measurable steps that can be taken. A consultant is expected to be chosen by mid-2022. It could take a year or longer for the consultant that’s chosen to develop the plan. Some wonder what took so long. The Kansas City metropolitan area, the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, and Lincoln are among nearby places that already have climate action plans. “Omaha and the surrounding area are late to the solutions game,” said David Corbin, chairman of the Missouri Valley Sierra Club’s energy committee.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: American Civil Liberties Union attorneys said if the state redraws its political maps without reallocating thousands of inmates to their pre-prison addresses, they will be in violation of a 2019 Nevada law. The threat of a lawsuit and the organization’s insistence that prison officials compile more addresses could complicate the redistricting process that lawmakers are expected to conduct this month. Though the U.S. census counts inmates at prisons where they’re serving sentences, Nevada is one of a growing number of states required to reallocate residents in prison to where they previously lived. Nevada lawmakers in 2019 passed legislation to ban so-called prison gerrymandering. It directs the Department of Corrections to “compile the last known residential address of each offender immediately before the offender was sentenced to imprisonment in a facility or institution of the Department” and subsequently “provide to the State Demographer all available information.” Last week, prison officials said they only had usable addresses for 6,275 people out of the 12,214 counted in the 2020 census, or about 51%. In a Friday letter sent to lawmakers and state officials, attorneys Holly Welborn and Chris Peterson allege the thousands of missing inmate addresses “place the Legislature at risk of violating Nevada’s Constitutional requirement to base reapportionment on accurate data.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: A 9-foot-tall video game joystick made of wood, rubber and steel has made it into the Guinness World Records 2022 as the largest. Dartmouth College professor Mary Flanagan created the giant controller – nearly 14 times the size of an original classic Atari controller – in 2006 to celebrate her childhood experience of “maniacally” playing Atari 2600 video games. She also wanted to see what it would be like when a single-player experience becomes collaborative: It takes at least two people to operate the joystick and push the button to play classic Atari games such as “Centipede” and “Breakout.” “To have this common pop culture artifact just erupt in the middle of a space and allow people to play something familiar, yet not familiar, was exciting,” said Flanagan, an artist who is chair of Dartmouth’s Film and Media Studies and the Sherman Fairchild Distinguished Professor in Digital Humanities. The joystick, which toured Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States, is now part of the permanent collection of ZKM Center for Art and Media in Karlsruhe, Germany.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A truck driver who ousted the powerful state Senate president in last week’s election previously posted online calling Islam “a false religion,” comparing vaccine mandates to the Holocaust and defending rioters at the U.S. Capitol. Republican Edward Durr apologized Friday after media outlets highlighted the posts. His victory over Steve Sweeney, widely regarded as the second most powerful Democrat in state government, in Tuesday’s election shocked the state’s political establishment. Durr spent a paltry sum on his campaign. On Thursday and Friday, media reports highlighted posts Durr had made on Twitter and Facebook, including some critical of immigrants, boasting of defying state COVID-19 mask mandates, and making misogynist attacks on Democratic elected officials like then-Vice President-elect Kamala Harris. Durr issued a statement Thursday night to radio station WHYY and Friday to the website New Jersey Globe apologizing for the posts. “I’m a passionate guy and I sometimes say things in the heat of the moment,” Durr said in identical comments to both outlets. “If I said things in the past that hurt anybody’s feelings, I sincerely apologize.” Twitter showed Friday that Durr’s account had been deactivated by the user.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State officials have been inundated with critical letters on proposed K-12 social studies standards over the inclusion of racial identity and social justice themes in a majority-Latino state where Indigenous tribes have persevered through war, famine, internment camps and boarding schools aimed at stamping out their cultures. If approved, the standards would require students starting in kindergarten to “identify some of their group identities” and “take group or individual action to help address local, regional, and/or global problems.” By high school, students would examine “factors which resulted in unequal power relations among identity groups.” Critics, including some Hispanics, say the standards promote victimhood, while supporters have praised the standards as “more just and anti-racist.” The proposed New Mexico standards represent a new frontier in the clash over “critical race theory” – an academic concept increasingly used by conservative activists as a catchall term for the study of systemic racism, historical oppression or progressive social activism. New Mexico is a patchwork of 23 federally recognized Native American nations, tribes and pueblos. Half of the state is Latino, and about 10% of students are Native American, with many tracing their heritage to pre-Columbian and 16th-century Spanish conquistadors.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The former head of the city’s police sergeants union has been punished with a loss of 70 vacation days, which amounts to almost $32,000 in pay, after being found guilty by his own police department of improperly disclosing information and using inappropriate language on social media, police said Friday. Ed Mullins of the New York Police Department had already filed retirement papers last month and retired as president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association in the wake of federal agents raiding the union’s office and his home. The retirement was effective as of Friday, but the NYPD said in an email that “the cases were moved forward expeditiously to ensure the appropriate penalty could be imposed in the event of findings of guilt.” Mullins was found guilty in disciplinary proceedings for improperly tweeting NYPD paperwork last year regarding the arrest of Mayor Bill de Blasio’s daughter during protests over the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. He denied violating guidelines. In a separate complaint from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, he was also found guilty after an administrative hearing for using inappropriate language in social media posts he made that referenced other New York City officials. Review board Chair Fred Davie said he was “disappointed” that Mullins was docked vacations days and not fired.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Barely 24 hours after their passage, the state’s newly drawn maps drew another legal complaint that will likely determine how much Republicans can expand their political clout over the coming decade in a state that is slowly becoming more blue. An organization formed by Marc Elias, a prominent Democratic lawyer, announced Friday that a group of voters who successfully challenged previous North Carolina maps will now make a similar appeal in state court contesting the latest congressional maps. They will argue that the boundaries approved by Republicans on Thursday were drawn for political gain in a way that violates several provisions of the North Carolina Constitution. The stakes are high, as Republicans currently hold an 8-5 edge over Democrats in the U.S. House and would likely expand their advantages substantially if the maps prevail. During a virtual event on Twitter, Elias, founder of Democracy Docket, called North Carolina’s maps “a grotesque partisan gerrymander” and “indefensible.” “The Republican Party has lost all shame,” Elias said. “I mean, in the 2010 (redistricting process and) after 2010, they were still pretending that they cared about democracy and about voting rights, and now they no longer pretend.” Last week, voters and advocacy groups sued in Wake County court to block the timetable for passing state legislative maps, accusing Republicans of breaking rules aimed at ensuring Black voters can elect their desired candidates.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: A proposal to use $150 million in federal stimulus money to build another pipeline to carry natural gas from the Bakken region to eastern North Dakota will be on the table as lawmakers convene at the Capitol. Lawmakers plan to divvy up $1 billion from the federal American Rescue Plan Act during the special session, which opens Monday, and the money that leaders hope to set aside for pipeline grants could make the prospect of such a project more attractive to developers. “There’s been a long-standing desire to see more North Dakota gas be used in the state,” North Dakota Pipeline Authority Director Justin Kringstad told the Bismarck Tribune. The Bakken region of western North Dakota produces substantial quantities of gas alongside oil, and some of it is wastefully burned off in flares at well sites rather than piped away for use as fuel due to a lack of infrastructure. Some eastern North Dakota communities have gas service because they happen to be near a limited number of pipelines that extend to that part of the state, but many do not. Much of the gas produced within North Dakota is transported to markets in other states. Cost appears to be the major barrier to building another pipeline. The economics tend to work out better to send gas down existing pipelines into other states, Kringstad said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The election board for the state’s most populous county is being put under administrative oversight by the secretary of state, after another problem with electronic poll books led to three improperly cast votes in last week’s election. Not all of Franklin County’s electronic poll books were properly updated on Election Day with data about who had already voted early or requested an absentee ballot, according to Secretary of State Frank LaRose’s office. His office has determined three voters were able to vote twice but said those votes didn’t affect the outcome of any election. One of those voters told the office they cast a ballot during early voting, then did so again on Election Day while accompanying their spouse to vote because a poll worker indicated the poll book didn’t reflect the earlier vote. The voter said they were worried their first ballot hadn’t been counted. The Franklin County Board of Elections had another problem last year with some of its electronic poll books not updating, and it didn’t fully follow a remediation plan to avoid the newest problem, LaRose’s office said. To make sure the board is effectively administering elections, it will now have to report weekly to the secretary of state, according to LaRose’s office.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group of about 20 local pastors and ministers gathered outside the state Capitol on Friday to pray for Gov. Kevin Stitt as he weighs the fate of high-profile death row inmate Julius Jones. The preachers said they hoped Stitt would lean heavily on his Christian roots and follow the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board’s recommendation that Jones be granted clemency. “Lord, we implore you to allow Gov. Stitt to be the hero of Julius’ story,” the Rev. Keith Jossell, Jones’ spiritual adviser, said in his prayer. The prayer gathering came only days before Jones’ execution date, set for Nov. 18. Jones was convicted in 2002 in the fatal shooting of Edmond insurance executive Paul Howell during a 1999 carjacking. Jones has maintained his innocence in the murder, claiming another individual shot and killed Howell and pinned the slaying on him. The Rev. Major Jemison, senior pastor of St. John Missionary Baptist Church, said the circumstances surrounding Jones’ conviction included Jones’ lack of adequate representation, lack of fairness and lack of equality. Jemison also voiced unease that there could be negative consequences should the governor go against the parole board’s recommendation. “We are also very concerned about the potential for civil unrest if the state proceeds with the execution of Mr. Jones while disregarding the avalanche of questions and ambiguity surrounding the circumstances of the case,” he said.\n\nOregon\n\nNewberg: The teachers union in the city has filed a lawsuit over a policy passed narrowly by its school board that limits what kinds of images or signs school employees can display on campus. The “Ensuring Safe Environments to Learn” policy bars school employees from displaying images “relating to a political, quasi-political, or controversial topic.” The lawsuit was filed Wednesday. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the Newberg policy has been a lightning rod for controversy, with the ACLU, Democrats in the Oregon Legislature and the State Board of Education all issuing statements against it. The policy, backed by a four-member majority of the Newberg school board, started out as a directive to remove signs and posters showing support for Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ pride. In its 18-page complaint, the Newberg Education Association argues the policy violates two amendments of the U.S. Constitution: the First Amendment protecting free speech and the 14th Amendment guaranteeing equal protection. The suit also argues the Newberg policy violates Article I, Section 20 of the Oregon Constitution, which protects “against vague laws that confer unbridled discretion, because such discretion creates the potential for unequal application of the law,” among other state constitutional provisions.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf said his mail-in ballot was dropped off by his wife before Tuesday’s election despite a state law requiring that voters deliver them in person. Wolf’s spokeswoman Beth Rementer called it an honest mistake. “I did vote; actually I voted by mail,” Wolf said Tuesday on KDKA radio. When an interviewer told him the ballot was due in the York County elections office by the end of Election Day, he said first lady Frances Wolf delivered it. “My wife actually dropped it off personally two weeks ago, so it’s there,” he said. The interview segment was highlighted Thursday in a tweet by state Rep. Seth Grove, R-York County, who has spent much of the past year working on an election code revamp. In June, Democrat Wolf vetoed an election reform bill Grove sponsored. “It’s law,” Grove said in a text exchange Thursday. “You can’t hand in more than 1 ballot.” He said Frances Wolf dropping off the governor’s mail-in ballot would have been legal had his bill been enacted. State law requires voters who do not mail their absentee or mail-in ballot to “deliver it in person to (their) county board of election,” although with preapproval others can do it under certain circumstances.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A World War I veteran is getting a new monument in the city after the original monument in his honor was vandalized. City Councilman David Salvatore said the new marker in honor of Pfc. Carlo Lafazia will be commissioned and dedicated next spring. “We’re going to relocate it to a new area that is going to allow for an education opportunity, first and foremost about the history of Private Lafazia and the contributions that he made, and secondly, some of the history around World War I and what that meant to the Eagle Park community and to Rhode Island as a whole,” Salvatore said. Lafazia, who served in the 16th Infantry Regiment, was killed in the Forest of Argonne in France in October 1918. The original monument was placed on Admiral Street in 2017. But earlier this year, it was knocked off its foundation. The vandal was never caught. The damaged monument stone is now stored at the Department of Public Works.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A strong storm off the Southeast’s Atlantic coast combined with periodic higher tides Sunday, causing coastal flooding that approached levels rarely seen outside of hurricanes along the South Carolina and Georgia coasts, officials said. Scientists have said data shows the unusually high tides and the flooding of roads that come with it are happening more frequently as sea levels rise with global warming. The Sunday high tide in Charleston Harbor reached 8.51 feet, the 10th-highest level in the century of recording at that site, the National Weather Service said. The high water closed dozens of roads in downtown and caused the city to cancel its Veterans Day parade scheduled for Saturday. Sunday’s high tides were the culmination of four days of rising ocean water pushed ashore by both winds from a strong autumn storm offshore and periodic King Tides when the moon’s location causes the water level to increase. Rising sea levels are leading to more frequent flooding, meteorologists said. Charleston Harbor has recorded 25 of the 39 tides of 8 feet or greater since 2015. The tide reached that level for major flooding three times already this month, meteorologists said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: A moose on the loose got onto the South Dakota State University football field in Brookings before leaving town. Campus police said the moose left campus about 3:30 p.m. Friday and was headed west. They said the bull moose appeared to be 1 to 2 years old. Emmett Keyser, the regional supervisor for the Game Fish and Parks office, told KELO-TV his agency helped the campus police and other law enforcement with herding the moose out of town. “We did try to move him north,” Keyser said. But, in apparent impersonation of a running back, “he ran back through our line and into the stadium,” Keyser said. The moose hung around campus for a time until officials were able to herd him west out of town. “The thing is, moose are so unpredictable,” Keyser said. “You don’t want anyone getting hurt or the animal getting hurt.” The sighting followed one a few days earlier of a moose walking down U.S. Highway 75 in Luverne, Minnesota, about 50 miles away. It wasn’t clear if it was the same moose. While moose are rare in the area, they do appear from time to time.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee on Friday again extended an executive order that allows parents to opt students out of school mask requirements that federal judges have blocked from applying in three counties. The Republican’s decision maintains the status quo on the opt-out order for two weeks while he considers whether to sign a broad coronavirus-related bill that would limit mask policies in schools even further. He first issued the mask opt-out order in mid-August and extended it in late September. Lee on Friday also extended the ongoing state of emergency over the COVID-19 pandemic until Nov. 19, while members of his administration “continue analyzing impacts of recent legislation & how it affects certain provisions,” he wrote on Twitter. During their recent three-day special session, Republican lawmakers passed a proposal that would in part largely prohibit government entities – including public schools – from implementing mask mandates. Those entities would only be allowed to require masks if they lived in a county with a rolling average 14-day COVID-19 infection rate of at least 1,000 per 100,000 resident while the state is under a state of emergency. There are no counties that currently meet that threshold. Even then, mask mandates would continue to be limited in use.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The weeklong, record-breaking February freeze this past winter led to crises of power, water, food, shelter, medical care, transportation and emergency response. A lengthy report published by the city Thursday identified a myriad of issues the community experienced that week and offered 132 recommendations about how to be better prepared for the next disaster. The freeze “was an overlapping emergency with overwhelming and cascading community impacts,” says the report, written by the city’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management departments with the help of Hagerty Consulting. The report reviewed the city’s entire response to the weather event and subsequent crises, identifying lapses in training and coordination, as well as supply-chain failures and neglected communities. “City and county leadership sought to move expeditiously to provide life-sustaining services,” the report says. “These included activation of shelter and warming centers, coordinating medical operations and distribution of drinking water. They faced significant obstacles in loss of infrastructure, staffing shortfalls, and availability of volunteers.” The coronavirus pandemic meant resources were already stretched thin, the report says. Some elected officials and volunteers set up services in response to shortfalls in departmental services.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State lawmakers are set to vote on a name change for southern Utah’s Dixie State University this week. A bill to rename it Utah Technical University will be considered in a special session in which lawmakers will also vote on redistricting, state Rep. Kelly Miles, R-South Ogden, told Fox13. It’s expected to get a hearing before the Education Interim Committee on Tuesday. The step comes after numerous public hearings, focus groups and a vote in favor of a name change from the Utah System of Higher Education. Supporters of changing “Dixie” have pointed to difficulties in recruiting and retaining students, who link the name to the South, the Civil War and the Confederacy. Past yearbooks show students in blackface, Confederate flags and the former mascot dubbed “The Rebel.” Opponents of the name change insist the name comes from Mormon pioneers who settled in the St. George area to grow cotton. They’ve begun launching campaigns to pressure lawmakers to resist a name change, accusing the state of giving in to “cancel culture.” The Washington County Commission recently passed a resolution supporting \\\\ the “Dixie” name. But Miles said that after an extensive input-gathering process, he expects the Legislature to support a name change. Gov. Spencer Cox would also be expected to sign it.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state is requiring unvaccinated employees to use personal sick time if they are exposed to someone with COVID-19 through their jobs and have to quarantine. State workers who exhaust all their sick time could be required to quarantine without being paid. Fully vaccinated employees forced to quarantine will be paid without needing to use sick time. “We want to do whatever we can to take advantage of safe, effective and free vaccines,” Jason Maulucci, a spokesperson for Republican Gov. Phil Scott, said Friday. “If there are people who choose not to, there are implications to making that decision.” Maulucci said it was unclear how many people have had to use sick leave or if anyone has already gone unpaid. Steve Howard, executive director of the Vermont State Employees Association, said there have been cases in which employees have had to use leave, but he didn’t have a specific number. He didn’t know if anyone had gone without pay. Howard said the union has filed a grievance, saying the new policy was implemented without working through the details with the union. The previous policy allowed state workers who had to quarantine to be paid while out of work.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A juvenile son of Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin tried twice to cast a ballot in Tuesday’s election, election officials said Friday. The 17-year-old presented an ID but was told he was ineligible to vote due to his age and turned away, according to a statement from Scott Konopasek, Fairfax County’s general registrar. The statement said the teen did not successfully vote, made no false statements, did not disrupt voting and appeared to have committed “no election offense.” The statement mentioned Youngkin’s son by name, saying the identification was based on contemporaneous notes by the chief election officer. The news was first reported by The Washington Post. The Associated Press is not naming the son because he is a juvenile. A spokesman for the Republican governor-elect, who campaigned heavily on election integrity, said the son misunderstood Virginia’s laws. State law allows any person who is 17 and will be 18 by Election Day to register in advance and vote in any intervening primary or special election. Jennifer Chanty, a precinct captain, told The Washington Post she encountered the son, who left after initially being told he was too young to vote. She said he returned a short time later, saying a friend who was also 17 had been allowed to cast a ballot. Youngkin, who has four children, made election integrity central to his campaign during the fight for the GOP nomination, and he refused for months to say whether President Joe Biden was legitimately elected.\n\nWashington\n\nTacoma: Three Black women who work for the Pierce County Sheriff’s Department have filed a lawsuit against the county alleging a long-standing pattern of discrimination, harassment and retaliation against minority employees. The News Tribune reports Lt. Charla James-Hutchison and Sgts. Dione Alexander and Sabrina Braswell-Bouyer are the highest-ranking African American women in the department’s 168-year history. Their attorneys filed the suit on their behalf last Monday, claiming that the women – who all work in Pierce County Jail – have suffered emotional distress, economic losses and damage to their reputations due to the decades of discrimination. No specific damages are specified in the lawsuit. James-Hutchison, Alexander and Braswell-Bouyer are among 12 Black women who work for the Sheriff’s Department, according to county statistics. There are 47 Black sworn employees in the department out of about 614. The women have been subjected to racial slurs, told they were only hired or promoted to “fill a quota,” called thugs because of their hairstyles, and subjected to colleagues’ comments about how the COVID-19 vaccines should be tested on Black people before white people, the suit says.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Grandparents who are the primary caregivers for their grandchildren ages 5 to 11 can receive a $150 school voucher if they are vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Jim Justice said Friday. The program is through the Healthy Grandfamilies vaccination incentive program. To receive a voucher, the family must be enrolled in West Virginia State University’s Healthy Grandfamilies program at healthygrandfamilies.com. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently recommended the vaccine for use by children ages 5 to 11. All vaccine-eligible members of the family must have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. The vouchers can be used for school supplies, the governor’s office said in a news release. About 19,000 West Virginia children live in households with a grandparent as primary caregiver, according to the Healthy Grandfamilies organization.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The University of Wisconsin-Madison has raised the Ho-Chunk Nation flag over its main administration building, marking the first time the university has flown another nation’s flag with the U.S. flag and the Wisconsin flag. Friday’s ceremony at Bascom Hall felt historic to senior Paige Skenandore, who grew up on a reservation in northern Wisconsin and is one of roughly 100 Native American students on campus. It also felt long overdue. “I think this is a great first step,” Skenandore told the Wisconsin State Journal. “It’s been a long time coming. It’s kind of shocking that it hasn’t happened before.” Ho-Chunk Nation Chief Clayton Winneshiek told attendees the flag-raising was “a start.” UW-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank said the flag-raising was more than a symbolic gesture but part of an ongoing commitment to educate and acknowledge the state’s tribes and their sovereignty. Almost 190 years ago, the U.S. government and Ho-Chunk Nation signed the Treaty of 1832, which forced the tribe to give up territory that includes the UW-Madison campus. “For many years, UW-Madison was not mindful of this history, and we paid little attention to our relationship with the descendants of those who were here long before us,” Blank told a crowd of at least a couple hundred. “But we are working to change that.”\n\nWyoming\n\nTorrington: An inmate who died Wednesday is the fourth death in as many weeks at the Wyoming Medium Correctional Institution. The Casper Star Tribune reports 66-year-old Frank Lee Apodaca died Wednesday at the Community Hospital in Torrington. The Wyoming Department of Corrections said it will conduct an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Apodaca was from Fort Collins, Colorado, and sentenced to nine to 12 years in prison in 2017, after being convicted of third-degree sexual assault and intrusion on a victim under age 16 in Laramie County.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2014/05/14/crossroads-high-school-report/9101897/", "title": "Crossroads: High School Report", "text": "Submitted\n\nBrandywine\n\nBrandywine\n\nThe Annual Spring Conference/Food Show for Delaware School Nutrition Association selected Angelica Dennis, Stephanie Hudson, Federico Narducci, Doug Till, Eric Quick, Gracie Hudson, Anna Sheeky, Stephanie Guzman, Alvie Hossain and Alyssa Street to showcase their mural Saturday at the Chase Center on the Riverfront.\n\nSeniors selected Gracie Hudson and Michael Gallo to speak at graduation.\n\nThe Brandywine Alumni Association is offering two $500 scholarships.

County sheriff’s spokesman Mike Swafford said his department made 43 DUI arrests in the first nine months of 2019. This year, the total is 66 through Sept. 30, an increase of almost 54%. Swafford told The Decatur Daily that sheriff’s officials believe the pandemic is a factor. “People are stressed more,” he said. “We’re seeing more cases of domestic violence, people arguing with their neighbors that we attribute to the stress of everyday living during this pandemic.” But there has also been an increase in patrols under Sheriff Ron Puckett. And, another likely factor, he said, is the closure of two bridges on a U.S. highway that created a 16-mile detour. Another state jurisdiction also is seeing an increase in DUI cases compared to other localities. Town Creek Police Chief Jerry Garrett believes the pandemic is behind the rise his department has seen in recent months. The police force had 19 DUI arrests from March 1, 2019, to Sept. 30, 2019, but the total jumped to 27 for the same period this year.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Personnel stationed at a military base in Alaska’s largest city were ordered to avoid bars and interior dining at restaurants amid rising coronavirus cases on and off the base.

Members of the 673rd Air Base Wing are not allowed to visit businesses that “primarily engage in preparing and serving alcoholic beverages for on-site consumption,” an Oct. 8 memo from base Commander Col. Kirsten Aguilar said. The order keeps active-duty airmen assigned to the 673rd Wing from visiting bars, breweries, pubs and nightclubs. The restrictions were enacted as a “precaution” because of increasing COVID-19 cases statewide, Media Operations Section Chief Erin Eaton said. “The decision was made based on data and inputs from the medical team through their contact tracing efforts, and through base leadership’s evaluation of risk,” Eaton said in an email. The regulation might be reviewed within 30 days. Aguilar said in a video posted on social media Friday that the base has moved into HPCON Charlie, a military health protection level requiring additional limitations on certain base services and potentially more telecommuting.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Citing an urgent situation, particularly for communities of color, the Tohono O’odham Nation said it will donate $2million to advance COVID-19 research in the state. Leaders of the Tohono O’odham Nation of southern Arizona were in Phoenix to make the announcement that they would be giving $1 million each to the University of Arizona and Arizona State University to advance ongoing COVID-19 research, including the development of rapid tests. The money comes from gaming revenue earned by the tribe’s four casinos. Part of the tribe’s gaming compact with the state requires the donation of 12% of revenue toward local community programs. The tribe operates Desert Diamond casinos near Tucson, Sahuarita, Why and in the West Valley near Glendale that reopened in June. Native American communities across the U.S. have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19. In Arizona, Native Americans make up just 5% of the state’s population, yet 11% of its known deaths, tribal chairman Ned Norris Jr. said. Norris announced the grants after a prayer led by Tohono O’odham legislative council chairman Timothy Joaquin at the UA College of Medicine - Phoenix on Monday afternoon.

Asa Hutchinson said he remained hopeful that cases would stay low through the week. “Let’s stay vigilant, and while cases usually go up in the next four days, let’s remember that it is up to each of us to do our part to help slow this virus and protect ourselves, our family, and our neighbors,” Hutchinson said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state won’t allow any distribution of coronavirus vaccines until it is reviewed by the state’s own panel of experts, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday. Vaccinations for the pandemic “will move at the speed of trust,” said Newsom, a Democrat, and the state wants its own independent review no matter who wins the presidential election next month. “Of course we won’t take anyone’s word for it,” Newsom said as he named 11 doctors and scientists to review any rollout of vaccines by the federal government or vaccine developers. The board members hail from top California universities and medical providers, along with state and local public health officials. The pledge raises the possibility that California residents might not receive a vaccine as distribution begins in other states, though the governor said widespread vaccinations are unrealistic until sometime next year. At most, 45 million doses will be available nationwide before the end of this year from the two most advanced vaccines, Newsom said. Each person must receive two doses, three weeks apart. If California were to receive 12% of the doses, commensurate with its percentage of the nation’s population, that would be 5.4 million doses, or enough to treat 2.7 million of the state’s nearly 40 million residents. Most would go to front-line medical workers and first responders, he said, then to the most vulnerable in the population.\n\nColorado\n\nLone Tree: With many U.S. stores closing during the coronavirus pandemic, especially inside malls, the owners of a chain of retail stores called COVID-19 Essential have seized on the empty space, as well as the world’s growing acceptance that wearing masks is a reality that may last well into 2021, if not longer. Masks have evolved from a utilitarian, anything-you-can-find-that-works product into another way to express one’s personality, political leanings or sports fandom. And the owners of COVID-19 Essentials are betting that Americans are willing to put their money where their mouth is. Prices range from $19.99 for a simple children’s mask to $130 for a top-of-the-line face covering, with an N95 filter and a battery-powered fan. Almost all shops and many pop-up kiosks in the Park Meadows mall now sell masks. But COVID-19 Essentials also carries other accessories for the pandemic, including hand sanitizer and other sanitation devices. The chain has locations in New York City, New Jersey, Philadelphia and Las Vegas, and is looking to open stores in California, where wildfires have only added to the demand for masks.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state is planning to revamp its benchmarks for when people entering the state from locations with large COVID-19 rates will need to quarantine. Currently, state residents and out-of-state travelers coming from states and territories with 10 cases per 100,000 population or 10% positivity rates must fill out a state travel form and isolate for 14 days. Under the new rule, people must take such steps if they come from locations with 10 cases per 100,000 and 5% positivity rates. “The other threshold was so broad that it was including about 85 percent of our states across the country. It was becoming unenforceable,” said Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont. As of Monday, Connecticut itself surpassed the threshold of 10 cases per 100,000 with 11.2 new cases per 100,000. The state’s seven-day rolling average for positive cases as of Monday was 1.7%. Lamont said the state will continue to issue fines for Connecticut residents and out-of-state residents who violate the quarantine and state notification rules. As of last week, the state has issued 45 fines, most to people from Connecticut. Lamont said his administration is still trying to determine how to handle workers who live in one state and work in another if Connecticut reaches the new benchmark.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A health care system said it is seeing “overwhelming demand” for flu shots this year amid the coronavirus pandemic. Beebe Healthcare, a not-for-profit system based in Lewes, has vaccinated more than 3,100 community members through 13 flu clinics, the Delaware State News reported Saturday. That’s about 75% of the total number of vaccinations Beebe recorded last year in more than 30 clinics. This year’s total from Beebe doesn’t include its team members. More than 2,200 were vaccinated in a 48-hour period in September, according to the newspaper. “We’ve seen an overwhelming demand for flu shots from the community this year, which is really encouraging considering how important being vaccinated is with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,” said Dr. Bill Chasanov, clinical transformation officer and infectious disease physician at Beebe Healthcare. Health officials and medical groups are urging people to get either the flu shot or nasal spray, so that doctors and hospitals don’t face the extra strain of having to treat influenza in the midst of the pandemic. Last year Delaware had more than 7,000 cases of the flu, with 400 individuals hospitalized and 11 deaths.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article incorrectly described the nature and location of Beebe Healthcare, which is seeing high demand for flu shots. It is a not-for-profit, independent health care system based in Lewes, Delaware.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Mayor Muriel Bowser said the city will launch a new COVID-19 exposure notifications app for residents to aid in contact tracing, WUSA-TV reported. The app, DC CAN, which became available Tuesday, was developed by Apple and Google and can be used by iPhone and Android users based on whether the smartphone user activates the specific region/state on their phone. D.C. Health Director Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt said if users opt in, their phones will send out “beacons” to other nearby phones using a randomly generated ID that changes every 10-20 minutes. According to Nesbitt, the exposure notification system once a day will download a list of keys belonging to people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and report their diagnosis through DC CAN. Users will then receive a notification informing them if they have come in contact with an individual diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee:Florida State University President John Thrasher and his wife, Jean, are free of COVID-19, the president posted on his Twitter account Monday afternoon. “I am happy to share that Jean and I were cleared Friday by the Florida DOH after testing positive for COVID-19 earlier this month, and we are resuming many of our regular activities,” Thrasher said. “We are feeling good and appreciate all the prayers and well wishes!” Jean Thrasher learned of her positive diagnosis on Oct. 5 after a recent stay in the hospital and a local rehabilitation facility for an unrelated condition. President Thrasher, who tested positive Oct. 6, has continued to conduct university business at home. On Monday, FSU reported 26 students tested positive last week, along with one employee, according to the university’s dashboard. In total, 2,031 people were tested at the Tucker Center last week, with a low positivity rate of 1.33%. At Florida A&M University, eight students reported testing positive for the coronavirus for the week ending Friday, according to its weekly dashboard. That is the highest student number since the week of September 25, when nine positive students tests were reported.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The number of COVID-19 cases is rising in Georgia, although infections in the state are not climbing as fast as those nationwide. Even with relatively few infections reported Monday, the state’s seven-day average is close to 1,300, more than 10% above the recent bottom on Oct. 8. The number of people hospitalized with confirmed cases of COVID-19 has also been rising for a week, crossing back above 1,300 on Monday. A ray of light for Georgia is that the positivity rate has stayed level over the last two weeks at just above 6%, even as the number of DNA-based tests rose modestly, on average. Georgia’s transmission rates still remain below those being seen nationwide, with the state ranking 35th per capita among states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico over the last two weeks, according to data collected by the the Associated Press.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: A state program providing rental assistance to tenants struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily stopped accepting applications. The Rent Relief and Housing Assistance Program called a halt to applications after reaching its processing capacity, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Sunday. The program launched in early September received more than 20,000 applications and overwhelmed Catholic Charities Hawaii and Aloha United Way, which are helping administer the program. The charities are working out how to manage the current backlog. “Right now we’re meeting with them daily to figure out how to work through it as quickly as possible,” said Kent Miyasaki, spokesman for the Hawaii Housing Finance and Development Corporation. The program was expected to disburse $100 million in federal coronavirus relief funding through monthly payments to the landlords of tenants struggling to pay rent. The program approved $5.8 million in payouts, although only $2.3 million has been distributed, Miyasaki said.\n\nIdaho\n\nIdaho: State officials approved a contract with Florida-based vendor ClassWallet to distribute $50 million in federal coronavirus emergency money to low-income families to help children learn during the coronavirus pandemic. The Idaho State Board of Education awarded the no-bid contract Monday that with various fees will cost the state about $2 million to administer. The program will provide up to $1,500 per child with a maximum of $3,500 per family and help about 30,000 children. The program starts Wednesday, and families can apply between then and Dec. 8. Applications will go out in waves based on need until the money runs out. The board unanimously signed off on the contract that’s part of the Strong Families, Strong Students initiative program put forward by Republican Gov. Brad Little. The money is intended to make it less likely for parents to leave the workforce or dip into household money while their children learn amid the challenges posed by the pandemic. The money will be distributed based on income and can be used to purchase educational materials, computers and other services. Many of Idaho’s 310,000 students in kindergarten through 12th grade are learning at home as school districts and families try to avoid spreading COVID-19.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: City officials warned Monday of “worrying trends” in increased COVID-19 cases, calling it a second wave that could trigger additional restrictions to curb the spread. Such restrictions have returned to other areas of the state. Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker, speaking Monday in Murphysboro, announced an end to indoor restaurant and bar service in parts of southern Illinois, along with limits on groups of more than 25 from congregating. In Chicago, there has been a more than 50% increase of positive cases in the past two weeks to more than 500 daily cases, according to the Chicago Department of Public Health. Commissioner Allison Arwady said it is the most cases since late May, which was the end of the pandemic’s first wave. There also has been a 25% increase in hospitalizations. There are spikes across all groups of Chicagoans and parts of the city. The increase coincides with an increase statewide. The Illinois Department of Public Health on Monday announced 3,113 new confirmed COVID-19 cases and 22 additional deaths.\n\nIndiana\n\nCovington:A county clerk in rural Indiana said she will not wear a mask while overseeing early voting despite the county’s surge of coronavirus cases and warnings from a state official. Fountain County Clerk Paula Copenhaver said she will “not be part of the government overreach” and contends social distancing and hand sanitizer are enough. Valerie Warycha, spokeswoman for the secretary of state, confirmed Friday that Connie Lawson contacted Copenhaver to ask her to wear a mask. Lawson also wrote in an email on Friday to clerks and election officials in all 92 Indiana counties that if poll workers refuse to wear masks or other protection, clerks should thank them for their service “and ask that they voluntarily resign.” Lawson did not mention any clerks or counties by name in her email, and she did not issue any mandates. State elected officials do not have the authority to do that, Warycha said. Lawson said the election is “the time to be careful, not cavalier,” and that clerks needed to put public health before personal preference, the Journal & Courier reported.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: State Auditor Rob Sand warned the governor’s decision to spend $21 million in federal pandemic relief funds on a new executive branch software system would not be allowed and should be abandoned. Sand said that using the federal money to pay for Workday, a cloud-based program for the executive branch’s human resources and finances, is an inappropriate use under the law. He said that if the money isn’t redeployed for a different purpose, Iowa taxpayers could be on the hook to repay the federal government $21 million later on. Sand, a Democrat, said his conclusion was shared by the Treasury Department’s Office of Inspector General, which is responsible for overseeing the appropriate use of federal funds. He noted that the administration of Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a five-year, $20 million software contract with Workday in 2019, long before the coronavirus pandemic started. In addition, the state anticipates spending about $28 million more on implementation costs. Earlier this year, Reynolds’ office decided to partly pay for the program with money from the $2. trillion coronavirus aid package approved in March by Congress, which has sent billions of dollars to Iowa. Reynolds’ office has sought to justify its decision to pay for Workday with the money by arguing that it would allow the state to “act quickly to assist essential government employees.” The program could help workers request COVID-19 hardship assistance and time off for family and medical leaves, for instance.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A coronavirus outbreak has killed 10 residents in a nursing home in a northwestern Kansas county that proportionally already had the nation’s largest increase in cases over two weeks. The health department in Norton County reported Monday night that all 62 residents and an unspecified number of employees at the Andbe Home in Norton had tested positive for the coronavirus. The agency also said one Andbe Home resident was hospitalized, and the remaining 51 were being treated at the home. “Steps are being taken to prevent any further outbreak, including quarantining residents in their rooms and not allowing outside visitors into the facility,” the county health department said in a statement Monday night. The outbreak at the nursing home came after the state Department of Health and Environment last week reported more than 100 cases at the state’s prison in Norton over the two weeks ending Wednesday.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The moratorium on disconnecting utilities for nonpayment is ending in Kentucky, but relief funds are being designated to help when residents are at risk of having services cut off during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Andy Beshear said. Beshear signed an executive order ending the statewide moratorium on Nov. 6, but his office said the order also designates $15 million in federal COVID-19 relief funds to help Kentuckians who face disconnections. The order also requires utilities to provide a payment plan over at least six months for residential customers.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette:Five members of a sorority at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette have tested positive for COVID-19, university officials said. Officials did not identity the sorority but stated the members followed protocols and self-reported their illnesses, UL Lafayette spokesman Eric Maron said in the release. They are now in isolation, he confirmed. An additional 16 sorority members were in close contact with the women who tested positive and are now in quarantine, Maron said. The university is conducting contact tracing to identify others who may have been in close proximity to the members. Student Health Services will notify anyone who is determined to have been in close contact with anyone who tests positive. Members of the sorority are being offered free, on-campus testing. Once the cases are confirmed through documentation, the cases will be added to the university’s public COVID-19 dashboard. Since March, 138 students and faculty have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the dashboard.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Restaurants and retailers will be allowed to continue operating outdoors through the holiday season in Maine’s largest city. The Portland City Council approved a plan Monday night that extends through Jan. 4 provisions letting businesses operate on private property, public sidewalks and in parking lanes. “Certainly most people in the city are more comfortable dining outdoors than they are indoors right now, so we’re hoping that will provide some flexibility and relief for businesses that are really struggling right now,” Councilor Justin Costa said. In the Old Port, Dana, Milk, Exchange and Wharf streets are closed. Under the plan, all of these roads will reopen to traffic and parking except Dana Street from Fore to Wharf streets and Wharf Street from Union to Dana streets. Businesses on Middle Street cxan continue to use the parking lane with some changes to help with winter operations. City Manager Jon Jennings said the plan accounts for safety and public health standards, along with expeditious removal of snow. Businesses will have to reapply for a permit to continue outdoor dining, but all fees have been waived.\n\nMaryland\n\nHurlock:The governors of Maryland and Delaware have announced new grant programs to help contracted chicken farmers offset losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Each state’s program will offer grants of $1,000 per house, up to $5,000 per farm, with $10 million in funds from the federal CARES, Act. The help is intended to boost family farmers who are contract growers for big companies, like Perdue or Tyson, the governors said in a news conference in Hurlock on Monday. Poultry is the region’s top agricultural commodity and is Delaware’s No. 1 industry. “This COVID-19 pandemic has caused and is continuing to cause great hardship for so many people, not just here in our state, but all across the country and all around the globe,” said Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan. “And our farmers certainly are no exception... It’s been a very difficult time for our ag community.” Farms that were forced to euthanize entire flocks – a production reduction measure done in response to processors having reduced capacity – will be eligible for an additional $1,500 per house. Applications are open for the programs, called the Maryland Farmer COVID-19 Relief Program and the Delaware Contract Poultry Grower Grant Assistance Program. The application deadline is Dec. 1.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A cluster of COVID-19 cases that affected nearly 60 staff and patients at Brigham and Women’s Hospital has been contained, hospital officials said. The cluster was identified Sept. 22 in two inpatient units, and 42 employees and 15 patients were potentially connected, the hospital said in a statement on its website. The hospital has not had any new potentially contagious cases on the units that were affected since Oct. 3. The possible factors that contributed to the cluster included a highly infectious source patient, several people with very high viral loads, inconsistencies in patient masking and the use of eye protection among providers, and a lack of physical distancing among staff while eating. The likely source patient was not admitted because of the coronavirus, but had symptoms of a respiratory infection and twice tested negative for COVID-19, Dr. Michael Klompas, hospital epidemiologist, told The Boston Globe. The patient infected a roommate who was then transferred to another unit, he said. In response to the cluster, the hospital instituted an aggressive testing protocol for staff and patients, tested the HVAC system and thoroughly cleaned the affected areas.\n\nMichigan\n\nOwosso: Misdemeanor charges are being dropped against a barber who defied Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and reopened his shop last spring during the coronavirus pandemic. The case against Karl Manke of Owosso fizzled after the Michigan Supreme Court on Oct. 2 said Whitmer used an unconstitutional law as the foundation for emergency orders to control the virus, attorney David Kallman said. Barbershops and salons were closed for months until June 15. But Manke, 77, reopened in early May, declaring that “government is not my mother.” He inspired people from all over Michigan to drive to his shop for a haircut. Manke cut hair on the grounds of the state Capitol during a protest in May. Kallman said the Shiawassee County prosecutor’s office is dropping the case. “It is definitely a weight off my shoulders,” Manke said. “I just want to earn a living, and I am not a health threat to anyone.” State regulators still are trying to revoke his barber license, Kallman said. A hearing is set for Nov. 19.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Monday’s lunchtime crowd at the White Horse restaurant and bar included Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan after she listened to the owner’s feedback on how the pandemic has affected her small business. Flanagan stopped in St. Cloud on a half-day trip to Central Minnesota as part of a statewide small business listening tour. Flanagan also stopped at Stoney Brook Farms in Foley earlier in the day. White Horse owner Jackie Lee told Flanagan and state Rep. Dan Wolgamott, D-St. Cloud, how much she appreciated financial help in the form of the Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan – especially with the potential for forgiveness. Flanagan said she continues to advocate for cities and counties to dole out Coronavirus Relief Fund money established by the federal CARES Act. The Minnesota Department of Revenue distributed more than $837.5 million to 85 counties and 1,521 cities and townships, which could be used to support, among other things, grants to businesses impacted by COVID-19. She said the state wants to make sure that money gets to where it needs to be. Cities have until Nov. 15 and counties to Dec. 1 to spend that funding. Unspent aid will then return to the state.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said he is imposing a mask mandate for public indoor spaces and other restrictions in nine counties to curb the spread of the coronavirus amid weeks of steadily rising case numbers. “Here in Mississippi, we have seen this before,” Reeves said, referencing a spike in cases the state saw in the summer. “We know what can happen if we allow this to get out of control, so want to be proactive to prevent that from happening.” Reeves said explicitly that he does not think what is happening in Mississippi qualifies as a spike. “We’ve seen a relatively slow, slight increase over the last six weeks, which has really been exacerbated over the last 10 or 11 days,” he said. In the past week, Mississippi had two days when the number of new cases reported in one day reached more than 1,000, something the Department of Health hadn’t reported since mid-August. The seven-day rolling average of daily new confirmed cases in Mississippi has risen from 518 per day on Oct. 4 to 725 cases on Sunday, according to Johns Hopkins data analyzed by the Associated Press.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Dr. Alex Garza of the St. Louis Metropolitan Pandemic Task Force is warning that hospital workers are “overworked and demoralized” after months of fighting the coronavirus, and the worst might yet to come. Garza said hospitalizations are getting higher and intensive care unit beds are filling up at a time when the flu season is about to create even more strain on the health care system. The St. Louis region is actually in better shape than the rest of the state, according to data released Tuesday on the state health department’s COVID-19 dashboard. Hospitalizations are at or near record levels in virtually every region except St. Louis, which was hit hardest in the spring. But, according to Garza, even St. Louis is seeing an uptick. In Springfield, CoxHealth constructed a temporary building on the parking lot of Cox Medical Center South to serve the expected overflow of COVID-19 and flu patients. The state dashboard showed that ICU capacity statewide was down to 29%, with 476 of Missouri’s 1,439 COVID-19 patients receiving intensive care. The data also shows that 788 ventilators are in use, a figure that includes non-COVID-19 patients.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Students at Montana State University have sued the university claiming it broke a contractual agreement when it canceled in-person classes because of the pandemic without offering to refund or reduce tuition and fees. Anthony Cordero, who was an undergraduate student in the spring semester, filed a class-action lawsuit in U.S. District Court in September on behalf of himself and other students who paid tuition for in-person classes that were forced online because of the pandemic, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reported. The lawsuit said Cordero paid about $6,500 for the spring semester and was not provided a prorated refund for his in-person classes that were discontinued and moved online, or the mandatory fees he paid after school facilities and events were canceled. The university said in early March that it would transition to fully online because of health concerns, and did not offer in-person classes again until Aug. 17. The lawsuit alleged that since the students did not choose to attend an online-only higher education institution, they were deprived of both the education and on-campus experiences they paid for when they chose the Bozeman-based university. Kalispell-based attorney Dale Cockrell, who is representing the university, said he was reviewing the lawsuit and expects to file a response toward the end of November. University spokesman Tracy Ellig said the university doesn’t comment on pending litigation.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state continues to report record numbers of people hospitalized with the coronavirus, and another inmate who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 has died. The state said the number of people hospitalized with the virus jumped to 380 on Monday and eclipsed the previous day’s record of 343. The new record is 64% higher than the spring peak of 232 set on May 27, according to the state’s online virus tracker. But Nebraska officials said 37% of the state’s 578 intensive care beds remain available, so it appears that hospitals have the capacity to handle the recent surge. Nebraska has the fifth-highest rate of new virus cases in the nation. The rate of new cases per 100,000 Nebraska residents over the past two weeks reached 547.25 on Monday, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. The state Corrections Department said an inmate in his 60s died Sunday – three weeks after testing positive for the coronavirus. He is the second inmate to die after being diagnosed with the virus, although officials said he had other health problems.\n\nNevada\n\nBoulder City: The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation reopened Hoover Dam to the public Tuesday, seven months after it closed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Federal officials said visitors will be able to access all open areas and visit the Mike O’Callaghan-Pat Tillman Memorial Bridge plaza and walkway. The visitor center will remain closed with no tours or exhibits available. Visitors to the dam at the Nevada-Arizona border are being asked to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines when it comes to preventing the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state attorney general’s office has fined a restaurant where at least 18 people have tested positive for COVID-19. Fat Katz Food and Drink restaurant has been fined $2,000 for violating emergency orders related to the coronavirus after it moved a karaoke event inside. The Hudson restaurant told authorities that it moved the event inside after receiving noise complaints and because of colder weather. In issuing the fine, the state in a letter to the restaurant said the decision to move the event inside after being told it wasn’t allowed indoors and allowing individuals to participate without bringing their own equipment not only violated the state’s emergency order but also was “reckless.” The cases linked to Fat Katz include a person who went to the restaurant while aware of their COVID-19 diagnosis when they were supposed to be in isolation, and a second person who went there when they were knowingly supposed to be in quarantine. No one responded to a request for comment at Fat Katz.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAtlantic City: Gov. Phil Murphy conditionally vetoed a bill that would have expanded charitable groups’ ability to sell raffle tickets online based around sporting events, determining that the measure was too close to internet gambling. Because the coronavirus pandemic has drastically reduced or even eliminated in-person attendance at large sporting events in the state, some legislators proposed expanding the law to let people buy tickets to such raffles over the internet, regardless of whether they were in a stadium or not. Although lauding the intent of the bill, Murphy sent it back to lawmakers with recommended changes, including allowing such an expansion only during times of a declared public health emergency, and requiring the same sort of geolocation technology that New Jersey’s casinos and racetracks use to ensure that a person making an online casino or sports wager is physically located within the state’s boundaries.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Netflix has halted production of its Western film “The Harder They Fall” after at least two people on the set tested positive for the coronavirus while working in New Mexico. The production did not identify the people infected with the virus, and declined to comment beyond confirming that production stopped as of Thursday. It is unclear when production is expected to resume. Productions usually wait two weeks with no positive tests before resuming. The New Mexico Rapid Response report listed the positive test at Santa Fe Studios, the Albuquerque Journal reported. The New Mexico Environment Department, which publishes a daily list of entities in the state reporting newly confirmed coronavirus tests, reported that Netflix confirmed at least five positive test results between Oct. 8 and Oct. 19, with at least two of those reports listed as “THTF,” an acronym for the film, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. The production has been required to adhere to state safety guidelines, including facial masks and social distancing. The cast and crew was also subjected to multiple tests a week.\n\nNew York\n\nRamapo:After repeated complaints by the state and county, the Town of Ramapo and Village of Spring Valley have committed personnel to the COVID-19 cluster enforcement task force that’s patrolling Rockland County’s red zone. “We just had online training, Ramapo Town Supervisor Michael Specht said. He said six full-time code enforcement and parking enforcement workers are now dedicated to the task force, including at least one person who is fluent in Yiddish. Another five part-time town workers will be made available this week, Specht said, if the state needs them. Amid growing clusters of COVID-19 cases, Gov. Andrew Cuomo launched enforcement zones, or red zones, with strict regulations – which closed schools and cut religious gatherings to just 10 people – designed to tamp down the spread of the virus. Downstate zones, including in Rockland County, mirror the footprint of large Orthodox and Hasidic Jewish communities. The 12.5-mile diameter zone in Rockland focuses on eastern Ramapo and portions of the Village of Spring Valley.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nGreenville: East Carolina University has announced temporary furloughs and pay cuts for its athletics staff because of budget deficits caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The salary reductions and furloughs for coaches and staff members at the university will start next month, Jon Gilbert, the university’s athletic director said in a statement Monday. They are based on salary, and will be effective through June 2021. The entire athletics staff was recently furloughed for five days to reduce the school’s deficit by $4.7 million, the statement said. The university estimated a $25 million budget shortfall this fall, The News & Observer reported.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nTown: Mayor Tim Mahoney said he would like to see a statewide mask mandate as the coronavirus spins out of control and in the meantime invoked emergency powers to require face coverings in most settings that don’t involve family members. Mahoney, who in addition to being Fargo’s mayor is also a general surgeon, has been largely supportive of Republican Gov. Doug Burgum’s approach to managing the pandemic. But he said up to one in four people being tested for the virus in his city in recent weeks has tested positive, and Mahoney said it “would be great” if Burgum issued an order for the entire state. Cass County, which includes Fargo, had more than 200 new cases Monday and has had nearly 8,000 since the pandemic began. It has been one of the hardest-hit spots in a state that has ranked worst in the nation for daily new cases per capita the past two weeks. North Dakota leads the nation in the number of new cases per capita in the last two weeks, a distinction it has held many times in the last couple of months, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The number of people hospitalized in the state because of the coronavirus hit a new high, the Ohio Department of Health reported. The agency said Monday that 1,154 people are hospitalized with COVID-19 related symptoms, with 158 on ventilators. That’s the highest hospitalization figure since July. Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Monday he was caught off-guard by the recent spike in cases and pleaded again for Ohioans to wear masks and keep themselves socially distanced. The Health Department reported 1,837 confirmed and probable cases on Monday, well above the 21-day case average of 1,515. The numbers reflect a recent and continuing spike in cases, including a record 2,178 cases reported on Oct. 15.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The president of the Oklahoma State Medical Association is renewing the group’s call for a statewide mask mandate as the number of people hospitalized because of the coronavirus has reached record levels. OSMA President George Monks said in a tweet Sunday that cities in Oklahoma that have adopted mask ordinances have seen lower rates of infection. “We need face mask mandates to protect more of our Oklahoma citizens,” Monks tweeted. The association has been calling for a statewide mask mandate since the summer, but Gov. Kevin Stitt has repeatedly said he has no plans to do so, citing concerns about how such a mandate would be enforced.\n\nOregon\n\nAlbany: At least 19 students in Greater Albany Public Schools attended a gathering without masks, spurring new COVID-19 cases and setting back progress made toward holding in-person classes, officials said. At least three positive cases have been traced to a large gathering in a local home with students from West Albany High School, South Albany High School and Lebanon High School, the Albany Democrat-Herald reported. “In addition to the large gathering, a number of the same individuals have been together since then,” Schools Superintendent Melissa Goff said. “So we have an additional six students who should be quarantining right now.” The families of the students have been contacted by local health authorities but according to Goff, some families might not be cooperating with efforts to trace the potential outbreak. Before the latest positive cases, the school district was holding limited in-person instruction for students who receive special services while monitoring the increasing case load around the county. A total of 142 students at 14 district sites were receiving in-person instruction. Those services have been paused and all teachers and staff who are able to work from home have been asked to do so by the district.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg:The state’s COVID-19 quarantine list for out-of-state travelers has grown a bit larger over the past few weeks. But Georgia and Louisiana were removed from the travel advisory, meaning travelers coming from there will no longer be subject to a 14-day self-quarantine upon arrival in Pennsylvania. Ten states – Alaska, Indiana, Kentucky, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming ––have been added to the quarantine list, pushing the total to 25 states. The recommendation for travelers coming into Pennsylvania marks a notable shift in which states are being flagged nationwide for the most alarming increases of coronavirus cases. The list of states is fluid though and will be updated regularly, according to the governor’s office. Essential workers – including truckers and others in transportation – are exempt.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A state facility that houses federal detainees has seen a recent surge in coronavirus cases, according to documents filed with a federal court. The Wyatt Detention Facility in Central Falls had 52 active cases among detainees, and eight among staff as of Monday, The Providence Journal reported. A spokesman said the facility anticipated additional cases and is prepared to respond appropriately. The center has had more than 150 cases total among detainees and staff.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSpartanburg:Blood supplies are getting dangerously low because there haven’t been any blood drives during the coronavirus pandemic. Schools, churches and businesses usually hold blood drives during the year, but many haven’t returned to a normal working schedule and most outside activities have been canceled. In addition, blood banks have seen some people who are concerned about donating blood because of fears of becoming infected with COVID-19. All of these issues have forced The Blood Connection in Spartanburg to supply hospitals with only enough blood for immediate needs. Allie Van Dyke, The Blood Connection media coordinator, said during the early months of the pandemic, blood donations declined and the trend has continued. September is usually a time when college campuses host blood drives but those also didn’t happen because of the pandemic. And in addition to the lack of donations, she said some area hospitals are beginning to perform some elective surgeries again and that has depleted the blood supply even more. Spartanburg Medical Center is among the hospitals that receive donations from The Blood Connection. Hospital officials understand how low the blood supply is and are calling on donors for help.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The state reported seven more deaths from COVID-19 on Tuesday, along with an increase in hospitalizations by 25 people. October has been the deadliest month of the pandemic in the state, with the Department of Health reporting 107 deaths. A total of 330 South Dakotans have died from COVID-19 over the course of the pandemic. Gov. Kristi Noem has said her focus is on hospitalizations, offering assurances that the state’s hospitals are still capable of caring for people with severe cases of the virus. But hospitalizations have reached a new high at 329 people. Health officials reported that about 40% of general-care hospital beds and 33% of Intensive Care Units are available, along with staff to operate them.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: First-time voters in Tennessee won’t have to appear in person to vote while a court appeal proceeds, as the Oct. 27 deadline to request an absentee ballot approaches. In a 3-0 decision, the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel on Monday declined the state’s request to reinstate the in-person requirement while the court mulls the case. The decision maintains a lower court’s order last month. The blocked law requires first-time voters to cast a ballot in person or show ID at the local election office before voting by mail, if they qualify. Instead, officials are requiring certain first-time voters to submit a copy of their ID during the absentee voting process. In Monday’s opinion, Judge Julia Smith Gibbons said “disrupting the new rules at this point poses significant risk of harm to the public interest in orderly elections.” Kristen Clarke, president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said the ruling, coupled with expanded eligibility, means “thousands of first-time voters should not be forced to risk their health in order to vote.”\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Schools in the state’s largest school district resumed in-person classes Monday for the first time since campuses doors were closed in March at the start of the coronavirus pandemic. About 80,000 of the school district’s 190,000 students were back on campuses, where they were required to wear masks and practice social distancing. Movement within campuses was also going to be limited during the school day and only essential visitors would be allowed inside, said Interim Superintendent Grenita Lathan. District officials have worked to put necessary safety protocols in place, purchased needed supplies, and relied on science and data to provide a safe environment and address any concerns teachers and others might have, Lathan said. The first six weeks of classes in the current school year for Houston school district students were held online. Those children who chose not to return to campuses on Monday will continue to attend classes virtually and will have a chance after every six-week grading period to change their minds.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:The southwest Utah health district reported 92 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Saturday, a record for a single day, as the St. George area has joined a statewide spike in numbers at the beginning of the fall season. Local health officials have reported 430 new cases over the past seven days, also a record for any seven-day period since the pandemic began. As recently as mid-September, the region was counting fewer than 200 cases per week. The southwest district, which includes Washington, Iron, Kane, Beaver and Garfield counties, has now counted 424 total hospitalizations and 45 new deaths. Washington County, home to the St. George area, has seen the majority of the numbers, with 4,034 total cases and 38 deaths as of Thursday. The jump comes just as hospitals across Utah are warning that they could run out of beds, with Gov. Gary Herbert having just declared the state’s rapidly rising case numbers an “unsustainable” trend.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The outbreak of people infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 traced to a Montpelier hockey rink has expanded to 30, the Vermont Health Department said Monday. The cases are linked to adult and youth hockey leagues and an adult broomball league at the Central Vermont Memorial Civic Center. The Health Department is planning a pop-up testing clinic Thursday at the Barre Auditorium. Testing is for people who are not showing any symptoms of COVID-19, but had direct links to the teams and their close contacts. The Central Vermont Medical Center will also be holding special testing clinics from 2 p.m. to 4 p.m. through Friday at its Acute Respiratory Clinic on the Barre-Montpelier Road.\n\nVirginia\n\nHopewell:A Hopewell City Public Schools employee has tested positive for COVID-19, the school division said Monday. The employee works in the division’s technology department. The individual works “across our schools” and was “on site” on Oct. 15. In a press release, the school division encouraged anyone who had contact with technology department staff between Oct. 12-15 to monitor their symptoms and reach out to a primary care provider if needed. Hopewell is one of two local school divisions, along with Petersburg, that has not opened schools to students for in-person learning, so it is unlikely a student was in contact with the individual. Hopewell is considered an area of “highest risk” for the spread of COVID-19 in schools, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Petersburg, Prince George and Dinwiddie counties are also considered “highest risk.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Republican state Rep. Tom Dent of Moses Lake is the second Washington lawmaker known to have tested positive for the coronavirus. The Yakima Herald-Republic reported Monday that Dent, who is up for reelection, talked about his diagnosis on NewsTalk-KIT Radio and said he has been recovering at home. “So far I think I’ve gone through every symptom anybody’s talked about,” he said. “And, you know, it’s crazy. It started out pretty benign in the beginning and then kind of started to go away and came back a little stronger. It’s played this game now, today will be day 15.” Lawmakers haven’t been at the Capitol since they adjourned in March. Any meetings have been held remotely, and it’s unknown what the 105-legislative session will look like when it convenes in January.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The federal government has authorized the West Virginia National Guard to increase the number of personnel on active status to support the response to the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Jim Justice said. There are 379 members of the state National Guard on active status. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will allow that to increase to 400. The federal government will reimburse the state for 75% of the related costs for these personnel, the governor’s office said. The National Guard’s state response has included producing and distributing personal protective equipment, performing virus tests, disinfecting vehicles and facilities, and virus prevention training for businesses, long-term care facilities, medical practices and residents, the statement said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Like Froedtert Hospital in Wauwatosa, Aurora St. Luke’s Medical Center on Milwaukee’s south side is investigating an outbreak of COVID-19 on an inpatient rehabilitation unit where patients go to recover from surgeries, strokes and other ailments. As of Monday, St. Luke’s was investigating at least 15 cases of COVID-19 among patients on the rehabilitation unit and tests were pending on staff members who were potentially affected. “We have taken the appropriate steps to isolate and care for these patients and have suspended new admissions to this unit at this time,” spokeswoman Cheri Mantz wrote in an email to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Mantz said the source of the outbreak had not been determined. St. Luke’s had not been routinely testing staff members for the virus or taking their temperatures before they showed up for work. Like Froedtert, they were relying on employees to self-report their temperatures and any symptoms via an app. It’s unknown the extent to which the hospital has been testing the patient population for the virus.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: In the first week of October, Wyoming was averaging about 105 newly confirmed cases a day, officials said. That average is now above 162 new daily cases, outpacing any previous time period since March. Wyoming also reached a record on Friday for new confirmed cases in a day with 248. The state’s largest hospital, Wyoming Medical Center, opened its COVID-19 surge unit for the first time and activated its Code Orange Incident Command, which establishes special protocols and appoints a team to evaluate daily concerns and communicate them with the rest of the staff. The facility also stopped accepting nonemergent patients transferred from outside Natrona County, hospital interim CEO J.J. Bleicher said. Those patients are now being transferred out of state. “We expect this to continue for several weeks, based on COVID projections in our community,” hospital spokesperson Kristy Bleizeffer said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/10/21"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/11/politics/covid-19-testing-joe-biden-administration/index.html", "title": "Biden vowed to fix testing. But he didn't plan for Omicron. | CNN ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nAs President Joe Biden was spending his holidays with family at the White House and in Delaware, he was frustrated to see images on television of Americans waiting in long lines for Covid-19 tests.\n\nNearly a year after he had taken office, the stubborn problem he had vowed to solve persisted, exposing a testing system that was failing once again to meet demand – and Biden’s own promises.\n\nAnger over testing shortages has been mounting across the country – including inside the White House – since early December, when the Omicron variant began spreading widely across the country and the demand for tests began far outstripping the supply in many areas. According to people involved in the conversations, Biden himself has privately told top staff members in strong terms that he regrets that he and his team did not anticipate the shortfalls earlier, something he’s also made clear in public.\n\nDespite those regrets, experts had been warning for months that testing capacity wasn’t where it should be as the holiday season approached, including during a virtual meeting with White House officials in October. Multiple experts argue that Biden and his team did not move quickly enough to address the coming shortfalls, and by then it was too late to dramatically increase supplies to levels that would have eased the current shortages.\n\n“Everybody saw it coming. We knew we needed more tests,” Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said on CNN last month. “I think the administration had dropped the ball on this.”\n\nWhile Biden entered office with a plan to expand testing – pouring in billions of dollars to boost manufacturing and ramp up testing in schools – his top priority was vaccines, which kept most people out of the hospital and even slashed the chances of getting infected with and spreading the virus.\n\nBut vaccine hesitancy remains stubbornly high, and a new, highly transmissible variant that sidesteps much of the vaccines’ protection against infection has spread across the country, driving case counts to their highest levels to date. By December, it was evident Biden was falling short of the promise he had made as a candidate that “anyone who wants a test should be able to get one, period.”\n\nThat has prompted a hurried effort inside the White House to stand up a new test distribution program that officials say will provide free at-home rapid tests to any American who orders them online. Federal testing sites have opened in cities across the country and a new requirement for health insurance companies to reimburse for the cost of tests takes effect this week.\n\nThe White House says a slew of investments it made in the fall – including through the Defense Production Act – and efforts to speed up the authorization of new rapid tests have helped to dramatically increase the number of at-home tests. The monthly supply of at-home tests has risen from 25 million to 28 million in August to 46 million in October to 300 million today. The White House projects that next month the monthly supply will hit 350 million to 400 million, according to a White House memo obtained by CNN. Still, many experts say that even those ramped-up numbers are not enough.\n\n“We’re not going to stop there. Those numbers will keep going up in the months ahead,” Dr. Tom Inglesby, the White House’s newly installed testing coordinator, said in an interview this week.\n\nAs the country shifts into a new phase of the pandemic focused less on eradicating Covid and more on learning to live with it, there is a renewed emphasis on the availability of testing to assure people they’re safe to travel and engage in other normal activities.\n\nIt’s a pivotal moment for the Biden White House. Aides to the President know he and his party will be judged by how well they navigate a return to “normal.” Pivoting quickly to improve testing supplies is a test of Biden’s ability to shift the country into a new stage of a virus he’s acknowledged is unlikely to completely disappear.\n\n“What we’ve been hampered by is thinking that the role of testing is sort of secondary and optional, where really the role of testing is foundational throughout the course of the pandemic and throughout the exit from the pandemic,” said Dr. Thomas Tsai, assistant professor of health policy at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “Because the testing is the information, is the early warning system, on whether cases are rising or decreasing. It’s the information that informs behavior.”\n\n“We’ve always been chasing our tails within testing strategy,” Tsai added. “It’s never sort of coincided where we’ve had the demand and supply of tests … before the waves peak, so we can actually alter the course of the pandemic. It’s always documented the course of pandemic, as opposed to altering the course.”\n\nAn October warning\n\nTwo months before Christmas, medical experts foresaw a frantic last-minute shopping surge, with millions of Americans flooding stores in search of at-home Covid testing kits to tell them their holiday gatherings were safe. A group of doctors shared that vision with the White House at a meeting on October 22, urging officials to expand the nation’s testing capacity in a hurry.\n\nThe participants say they got what they wanted: “Massive efforts” to expand production and distribution of tests, as one of those physicians described it to CNN.\n\nYet it turned out the warning and the effort came too late. By that point, the doctors’ vision of 732 million tests per month by March 2022 was simply impossible to pull off. Demand for the tests had tumbled so low during the summer that manufacturers had dramatically reduced production. And at that point, only a handful of at-home tests were available for purchase.\n\n“I think the bold initiative, had it come to fruition, would have been amazing,” said Dr. Michael Mina, a physician who was part of that October briefing with the Biden administration. “But it would have been very, very difficult in the last two months.”\n\nInglesby, who joined the White House this month as the Covid-19 Response Team testing coordinator, said the goals presented in the meeting were “ambitious” but impossible to reach in October because of the limited number of authorized over-the-counter tests.\n\n“We all wish it could have been sooner if it were feasible. Everyone would have liked it to be earlier,” he said in an interview this week.\n\nInglesby noted that the testing shortage is not unique to the US: “If you look at newspapers all over the world, every country is having challenges meeting demand.”\n\nAdministration officials have been working behind the scenes for weeks in a hurried effort to stand up the free test program, including working with test manufacturers to solicit proposals and with website programmers to develop the portal where Americans will be able to request the tests.\n\nContracts between private companies and the federal government to procure the 500 million tests began being awarded on Friday, and more information about the website is expected in the coming days. The White House said it expected the first free rapid tests to be delivered to the government “early next week.”\n\nWhite House officials insist the steps Biden took over the past months have made it possible to order the 500 million tests at all, including purchasing $3 billion in rapid tests during the late summer and early fall to bolster the market and spending another $1 billion to secure key supplies for test-makers using the Defense Production Act. They say those steps increased capacity when demand was low. But they have acknowledged it wasn’t enough to avert the Omicron-induced shortage.\n\n“We do not have the tests that we need to meet all the demand,” Inglesby said of the current state of play, echoing a blunt acknowledgment from the President.\n\n“Creating a system that can scale 50 to 60 times is challenging. We are working to meet that challenge, but it’s just really important to understand that this virus that we are working against now – this strain of virus – is moving and has accelerated in a way that was very different even from Delta and certainly from the world before Delta,” Inglesby said. “We have all the levers pulled.”\n\nToo late to help?\n\nTesting companies are poised to make the most of the moment. Manufacturers whose tests have been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration – including Abbott, ACON and iHealth – had been increasing their capacity already and there have been significant changes in capacity for the start of 2022.\n\n“It has taken a year and a half for the US to embrace the important role of rapid testing,” said a spokesperson for Abbott, who said the company was producing 70 million of its BinaxNOW products in January and prepared to “scale significantly further” in the coming months.\n\n“It is important for the US to maintain the testing manufacturing capacity and supply during periods of low demand so we can respond to future variants and surges. We’re on the right path now, but we can’t be complacent or think that testing won’t play a critical role in our ability to gather safely later on.”\n\nYet even if tests begin reaching Americans by the end of January, that would be more than a month after the latest wave began hitting communities and the testing shortfalls became apparent.\n\nSome in Congress have sharpened their criticism of the administration’s testing approach in recent weeks. In a letter last week addressed to US Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, two senior Republicans on key health committees demanded answers on the Biden administration’s “lack of strategy” for Covid-19 testing.\n\n“With over $82.6 billion specifically appropriated for testing, and flexibility within the Department to allocate additional funds from COVID-19 supplemental bills or annual appropriations if necessary, it is unclear to us why we are facing such dire circumstances now,” wrote Sens. Roy Blunt of Missouri and Richard Burr of North Carolina.\n\nOn Monday, a group of 50 lawmakers who included some high-profile Biden allies — such as Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, along with independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont – wrote a letter to the President urging “additional, immediate steps” to ramp up testing supply so that every American has access to one rapid test a week.\n\nOfficials say the scarcity of at-home tests this month was driven by a steep uptick in demand, particularly in major cities where cases began surging at the same moment Americans were entering the holiday stretch. Increased travel and family get-togethers prompted fresh interest in getting tested, which depleted stocks of at-home tests at drugstores and online.\n\nThe plan Biden announced in December to procure and distribute hundreds of millions of at-home rapid tests developed quickly over a stretch of days that month as reports emerged of empty shelves and sold-out notices, according to officials familiar with the matter.\n\nStill, when Biden made that announcement, several details of the plan remained unresolved. Administration officials were unable to provide any specific details about when the website to request the tests would launch or how quickly tests would be shipped, pointing only to a broad timeline of early January. They also did not detail a plan to get tests to those with limited internet access.\n\nA problem Biden promised to solve, but hasn’t\n\nA buildup of factors over the past two years led to a shortfall in testing that became apparent only as the Omicron variant began spreading across the country in the weeks after Thanksgiving, according to administration officials and others familiar with the matter.\n\nSince the beginning of the pandemic, testing has been an issue in the US pandemic response, many public health experts say.\n\nThe first tests developed in the United States by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in early 2020 were faulty, keeping many local officials in the dark about the sizes of their outbreaks. Correcting these tests took nearly a month, leaving the country in a blind spot about how to contain the growing pandemic. There also were questions over who should be tested – only those who had symptoms, or close contacts of people with confirmed infections as well.\n\nBiden entered office vowing to remedy the testing issues that had plagued the previous administration, and he signed an executive order on his first day in office meant to expand the availability of testing, including in schools and other “priority populations.”\n\nHe established a Pandemic Testing Board – a campaign promise modeled on President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s War Production Board – early in his term. And in February he announced a series of investments meant to increase testing capacity by scaling up the production of raw materials and establishing regional centers to distribute test kits and collect samples.\n\nBut Biden’s central focus in the early days of his term ultimately was on getting as many Americans vaccinated as possible, a campaign that diverted public attention from the testing initiative he’d entered office vowing to execute.\n\n“Right from the start, the CDC, for lack of a better word, screwed up testing. They got the testing kits wrong; they sent out the wrong kits. Then we finally built up an infrastructure, but it came simultaneously with the vaccine, and we thought the vaccine would solve the problem and we didn’t need to maintain that infrastructure,” said Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a physician at the University of Pennsylvania who served on Biden’s Covid advisory team during the transition.\n\nThe White House rejects the notion that it prioritized vaccination at the expense of testing.\n\n“That is not true at all,” Inglesby said. “It was never zero sum between the two.”\n\nStill, without adequate testing, public health officials and hospitals aren’t in the best position to anticipate how many cases may be coming their way or how much treatment may be needed.\n\nTesting is taking on an additional importance with the introduction of antivirals such as the recently authorized product from Pfizer, Paxlovid, which can reduce hospitalization by nearly 90% in high-risk adults. For that medication to work properly, the pills need to be taken within the first five days of symptoms occurring. The only way to know if those symptoms are caused by Covid is through testing.\n\n“If you don’t have a strategy around testing, you’re just kind of shooting in the dark and really addressing issues as they come up,” said Lori Freeman, chief executive officer of the National Association of County and City Health Officials. “And I think we might be feeling the consequences of that right now.”", "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Jeremy Diamond", "Kevin Liptak", "Jeremy Diamond"], "publish_date": "2022/01/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/05/hatch-chile-crisis-cream-puff-sweetener-ben-jerrys-spat-news-around-states/117869556/", "title": "Hatch chile crisis, cream puff sweetener: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: More than 500 hunters across the state have bought licenses to hunt feral pigs and coyotes at night, authorities said. It’s a new approach to try to control the destructive animals in Alabama, Al.com reports. State lawmakers passed a bill last year to allow the nighttime hunting. It’s aimed at targeting the wild pigs, which cause more than a billion dollars in damage annually, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Experts say that nighttime hunting could help control the population but that trapping and killing is the best way to do so. Feral pigs – also called feral hogs, swine and wild boars – roam Alabama and other Southern states, rooting up crops and pastures and stomping through forests, fences and gardens.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The U.S. Bureau of Land Management announced Tuesday that it is moving ahead with a new environmental review of oil and gas leasing in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge after the interior secretary said she found “multiple legal deficiencies” in a prior review that provided a basis for the first lease sale on the refuge’s coastal plain earlier this year. The federal land agency said there will be a public process to determine the scope of the review and identify major issues related to a leasing program. Information gathered during that process will influence development of the review, according to an agency notice. President Joe Biden, in a January executive order, called on the interior secretary to temporarily halt activities related to the leasing program, review the program and, “as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, conduct a new, comprehensive analysis of the potential environmental impacts of the oil and gas program.” Interior Secretary Deb Haaland in June said her review identified deficiencies in the record underpinning the leases, including an environmental review that failed to “adequately analyze a reasonable range of alternatives.” She announced plans at that time for the new review and halted activities related to the leasing program while the analysis was pending.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Phoenix Zoo is asking the public to help name one of its black-footed ferret litters. The zoo is caring for 27 black-footed ferret kits, and officials say it’s the most successful breeding season in 20 years. The first litter was born in May and the last in June. The Phoenix Zoo is one of six facilities worldwide breeding black-footed ferrets for release to the wild. The species is considered one of North America’s most endangered. Once thought to be extinct in the wild, the black-footed ferret has returned to its native habitat through reintroduction efforts facilitated by state, federal, tribal and nongovernmental wildlife conservation partners. The zoo has produced over 500 black-footed ferrets in 30 years of involvement with the breeding program, with many released into the wild in prairie grasslands in Arizona and other parts of their native range.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson pressed forward Tuesday with efforts to allow schools to mandate face masks as the state’s coronavirus cases continued to spiral, but he faced heavy opposition from fellow Republicans over the move. Hutchinson called the majority-GOP Legislature back into session to take up the change to a state law he signed in April prohibiting mask mandates by schools and other governmental bodies. The agenda for session started Wednesday also includes a proposal to prevent the state from having to resume making supplemental unemployment benefits to thousands of residents. Hutchinson has faced growing calls to revisit the ban as the state’s cases and hospitalizations surge. Arkansas on Monday reported its biggest one-day jump in hospitalizations since the pandemic began. “Local school districts should make the call, and they should have more options to make sure that their school is a safe environment during a very challenging time for education,” Hutchinson said. The governor is focusing on schools with students under the age of 12, since they’re not currently eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations. Arkansas has one of the lowest inoculation rates in the country, with only about 36% of the state’s population fully vaccinated against the disease.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: Some farmers in one of the country’s most important agricultural regions will have to stop taking water out of major rivers and streams because of a severe drought threatening the drinking water supply for 25 million people, state regulators said Tuesday. The Water Resources Control Board approved an emergency resolution empowering regulators to halt diversions from the state’s two largest river systems. The order could apply to roughly 86% of landowners who have legal rights to divert water from the San Joaquin and Sacramento river watersheds. The remaining 14% could be affected if things get worse. The rule won’t take effect for another two weeks and includes exceptions for some uses, such as water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, sanitation and generating electricity. Without the order, officials warned much of the state’s drinking water supply would be at risk if the drought continues into next year. “This decision is not about prioritizing one group over the other but about preserving the watershed for all,” said E. Joaquin Esquivel, chair of the Water Resources Control Board. The vote came one day after regulators halted water diversions from another Northern California river system, the Upper Russian River, warning Lake Mendocino would be empty by the end of the year, “putting both people and wildlife in harm’s way.”\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A Christian baker found to have violated the state’s anti-discrimination law by refusing to make a birthday cake for a transgender woman has appealed the ruling to the state appeals court. In a notice filed Monday, lawyers for Jack Phillips asked the appeals court to review the June ruling by a Denver judge by looking at both procedural issues and whether the ruling violated Phillips’ constitutional rights to freedom of speech and religion. Judge A. Bruce Jones ruled that attorney Autumn Scardina was denied a cake that was blue on the outside and pink on the inside to celebrate her gender transition on her birthday because of her transgender status in violation of the law. While Phillips said he could not make the cake because of its message, Jones said the case was about a refusal to sell a product, not compelled speech. Phillips won a partial victory at the U.S. Supreme Court in 2018 for refusing to make a wedding cake for a same-sex couple when the court found the state civil rights commission showed anti-religious bias when it sanctioned Phillips.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: A bronze sculpture depicting Italian immigrants is the top choice of a city panel to replace a statue of Christopher Columbus that was removed from a city park last year amid protests. The design by Branford sculptor Marc-Anthony Massaro has been chosen by the Wooster Square Monument Committee to replace the Columbus statue that had stood for 128 years in Wooster Square, the New Haven Register reports. The choice is being submitted to the Board of Alders and three other city agencies for final approval. Massaro’s work is titled “Indicando la via al futuro,” Italian for “pointing the way to the future.” It shows a boy, his older sister and their parents, newly arrived in America from Italy with suitcases. The father is holding the boy, who is pointing to something in the distance. Massero made a one-sixth-scale model of the image. “I think the committee felt that his proposal exemplified the story that we are telling – that is, the story of Italian immigration,” said William Iovanne, co-chairman of the Monument Committee. “His sculpture is incredible.” Columbus statues across the country have been removed amid widespread racial injustice protests. The city Parks Commission had voted to take down the statue amid demands by many residents, including Italian Americans.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: With the delta variant of the coronavirus spreading, state health officials recommended Tuesday that unvaccinated people get tested weekly and announced more ways to access testing, including take-home kits offered at libraries. In a statement, Gov. John Carney, the Division of Public Health, and the Delaware Emergency Management Agency urged everyone 12 and older to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and encouraged anyone who is unvaccinated to get weekly virus testing to prevent additional infections. Unvaccinated people also should undergo testing five to seven days after exposure to someone confirmed to have the coronavirus and should quarantine at home under such circumstances, especially if they develop symptoms. Cases climbed steadily in Delaware during the month of July, and more than 100 new cases have been reported every day for the past five days, officials said. Officials stress that the vaccine is effective against severe disease and death from the variants that are circulating in the United States. Only a small proportion of fully vaccinated people get infected, and those infections tend to be mild, officials said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The National Museum of Women in the Arts is planning its first major renovation in more than 30 years, but visitors can check it out for free this week before work closes the building down for two years, WUSA-TV reports. Officials said ahead of the long-term closure for changes and upgrades beginning Monday, the museum is offering free entry and extended hours. The two-year project will be the museum’s first major renovation since its doors opened in 1987. “We need an updated building to complement the groundbreaking work we do to champion women artists,” the museum said on its website. The museum is hoping to raise $66 million through a donation campaign to fund the renovations. Key improvements include enlarged gallery space, a new destination for researchers and education programs, enhanced amenities and accessibility for visitors, and infrastructure and storage upgrades to improve the long-term conservation and security of the museum’s collection of more than 5,500 works. NMWA purchased a landmark 78,810-square-foot former Masonic temple in 1983. “Updates to the building will refresh our space and heighten our impact as the only major museum in the world dedicated to women in the arts,” said Susan Fisher Sterling, the museum’s director.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: Florida won’t put any state money into the parent company of Ben & Jerry’s unless it reverses a decision to stop selling ice cream in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and contested east Jerusalem, Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday. The Republican governor said the State Board of Administration added London-based Unilever to its list of “scrutinized companies” that boycott Israel. This means if Ben & Jerry’s position on Israel is not reversed in 90 days, Florida will not invest in or contract with Unilever or its subsidiaries. “As a matter of law and principle, the state of Florida will not tolerate discrimination against the state of Israel or the Israeli people,” DeSantis said in a news release. “I will not stand idly by as woke corporate ideologues seek to boycott and divest from our ally, Israel.” The company’s founders, Bennett Cohen and Jerry Greenfield, said in a recent New York Times opinion piece that they no longer control the company but approve of the action in Israel as reflecting their progressive values. “We are also proud Jews,” the founders said. “But it’s possible to support Israel and oppose some of its policies, just as we’ve opposed policies of the U.S. government.” Unilever’s 400 brands also include Dove personal care products, Lipton tea and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations continue to rise rapidly, with some hospitals voicing concern as they fill with patients infected with the coronavirus. The state Department of Public Health on Tuesday reported 9,100 new positive tests but said that number included new reports dating back until Friday that hadn’t been included because of data transfer problems with electronic reporting. With the data dump, the state’s seven-day average rose above 4,000 cases, almost 11 times higher than when cases bottomed out in late June. The current seven-day average is the highest since Feb. 10 and higher than Georgia’s peak in July 2020. The state’s rolling average peaked above 9,500 in mid-January. Hospitalizations also continued their rapid increase, climbing above 2,600 statewide Tuesday. Statewide, 26 hospitals reported to the Georgia Coordinating Center that they were turning away all patients or new intensive care patients, including seven of 11 hospitals in the Piedmont system and half of the 10 hospitals in the Wellstar system. Dr. Alan Brown, chief medical officer of the Brunswick-based Southeast Georgia Health System, told The Brunswick News that the contagious delta variant and low vaccination rates have led to the system’s hospitals having 10 to 20 times as many patients as they had in early July.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Officials wrongly arrested a homeless man for a crime committed by someone else, locked him up in a state hospital for more than two years, forced him to take psychiatric drugs, and then tried to cover up the mistake by quietly setting him free with just 50 cents to his name, the Hawaii Innocence Project said in a court document asking a judge to set the record straight. A petition filed in court Monday night asks a judge to vacate the arrest and correct Joshua Spriestersbach’s records. The filing lays out his bizarre plight that started with him falling asleep on a sidewalk. He was houseless and hungry while waiting in a long line for food outside a Honolulu shelter on a hot day in 2017. When a police officer roused him awake, he thought he was being arrested for the city’s ban on sitting or laying down on public sidewalks. But what he didn’t realize was that the officer mistook him for a man named Thomas Castleberry, who had a warrant out for his arrest for violating probation in a 2006 drug case. It’s unclear how this happened, as Spriestersbach and Castleberry had never met. Spriestersbach somehow ended up with Castleberry as his alias, according to the Hawaii Innocence Project. Spriestersbach’s attorneys argue it all could have been cleared up if police simply compared the two men’s photographs and fingerprints.\n\nIdaho\n\nPocatello: Police in eastern Idaho are warning residents that counterfeit pain pills laced with a dangerous synthetic opioid have been found in the region. The Pocatello Police Department said a bag of about 3,000 pills that contained fentanyl – but that were disguised to look like less-potent oxycodone – were found at a local trailhead last month. Investigators fear the pills could cause lethal overdoses. “These pills are extremely dangerous and essentially impossible to discern as being fake or legitimate by appearance alone,” said Pocatello Police Capt. Bill Collins. “We have seen lots of overdoses in our area because of fentanyl, which we have found laced with methamphetamine, heroin and other pills. We don’t want anyone touching them, and we certainly don’t want anyone to ingest them.” Collins said the Pacific Northwest region has been “inundated” with similar pills in recent months, “but we haven’t seen them left out in the open in this quantity before.” The 3,000 or so pills – with a street value Collins said is somewhere around $60,000 – are colored and marked to resemble Oxycodone 30mg, a commonly prescribed medication for chronic or severe pain. Fentanyl is a controlled substance about 100 times more potent than morphine that is usually used to treat patients with chronic or severe pain after a surgery.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state will effectively end immigrant detention and further restrict local law enforcement’s ability to cooperate with federal immigration authorities under a plan Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed into law Monday. The new law targets local government agreements with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement allowing jails to house immigrant detainees awaiting court hearings. Current contracts must end by January 2022, and new agreements are prohibited. Currently, three Illinois counties – Kankakee, Pulaski and McHenry – have such agreements at local jails and house roughly 260 immigrant detainees overall, according to ICE. “Every family, every child, every human being deserves to feel safe and secure in the place that they call home,” Pritzker said at an event in Aurora where he signed several other immigration-related measures. The measure likely ends the federal agency’s power to detain immigrants in Illinois. Most detainees in ICE custody nationwide are held in privately run facilities. The agency owns and operates only a handful of its own detention centers, and none exist in Illinois. The state barred private detention in 2019 following several failed attempts to build a new facility near Chicago.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The Indiana Supreme Court on Tuesday denied an emergency request by state Attorney General Todd Rokita to stall Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb’s lawsuit challenging the increased power state legislators gave themselves to intervene during public health emergencies following conservative objections to his COVID-19 actions. Rokita petitioned the Indiana Supreme Court last month after a Marion County judge ruled against arguments from his office that he alone has the legal authority to represent the state in court and can decide whether the new law is allowed under the state constitution. The Republican attorney general asked the Indiana Supreme Court to order the trial court hearing the case to “cease all proceedings” in the lawsuit, arguing that Holcomb’s lawsuit does not meet the narrow standard for cases filed with the high court. The court turned down the emergency request 5-0 without comment. A request for a permanent writ is still pending, with briefs due Friday. The next hearing in Marion Superior Court is scheduled for Sept. 10. Holcomb’s lawsuit argues that the law passed this year over his veto by the Republican-dominated Legislature is unconstitutional because it gives lawmakers a new power to call themselves into a special legislative “emergency session” during governor-declared statewide emergencies.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A teenager who was critically injured in an amusement ride accident that killed his younger brother last month was released from the hospital Tuesday. David Jaramillo, 16, went home from Blank Children’s Hospital after having been placed on life support following the July 3 accident on the Raging River raft ride at Adventureland Park in Altoona. David initially was placed in a medically induced coma, and when he first regained consciousness, he could neither see nor speak. As of Friday he has regained his vision, speech, and ability to walk and eat solid food. “They say I’m mostly fine,” David said. “I just have to go to a few more speech therapy sessions and make sure my brain is OK.” That his recovery has been so quick and medical treatment so successful is nothing short of God’s work, said his father, also named David. The Jaramillo family, of Marion, Iowa, went to Adventureland to celebrate David’s birthday. Their boat on the ride, which has been a staple of the park since 1983 and uses a conveyor belt to push circular rafts through rapids, flipped upside down within seconds, causing all six to hit their heads on the surface below and trapping them in their seatbelts underneath the water. At least one other family who rode on one of the boats within minutes of the Jaramillo family reported problems with their raft. Amber Estrada, 31, said last month that the boat carrying her family at times struck and dragged along the bottom of the human-made river and that her family felt unsafe.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State Attorney General Derek Schmidt said he will prosecute any violations of election laws in Douglas County upon which the district attorney refuses to act. Douglas County District Attorney Suzanne Valdez, a Democrat, said last week that her office will not prosecute violations of new voting laws that took effect July 1. She said they are too vague and too broad and threaten “to create felons out of dedicated defenders of democracy.” Among the provisions is one that makes it illegal to “give the appearance of being an election official.” State-level voter engagement groups contend that could criminalize their work if Kansans mistake volunteers for election officials. Schmidt, a Republican seeking his party’s nomination for governor, urged law enforcement agencies in the county to refer election law cases to him, the Wichita Eagle reports. “Thousands of Kansans will go to the polls tomorrow in the municipal primary elections,” Schmidt said Monday. “Citizens throughout our state deserve assurance that state election-integrity laws will be enforced and election crimes, like all other crimes, will be prosecuted when warranted by the evidence.”\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Fatal drug overdoses – an ongoing scourge that has ravaged communities in the state – surged nearly 50% last year, and isolation caused by the COVID-19 pandemic was a “major contributing factor,” a state report concludes. More than 1,964 Kentuckians died from drug overdoses in 2020, according to the report from the Kentucky Justice and Public Safety Cabinet and the Office of Drug Control Policy. The official count easily eclipsed the state’s prior record level of fatal drug overdoses and mirrored a national increase in overdose deaths, the report said. Kentucky’s rising death toll was driven by opioid abuse. A key factor was the prevalence of fentanyl – involved in about 71% of the state’s overdose deaths for the year, according to the report, issued Tuesday. Fentanyl is a powerful synthetic opioid increasingly added to other illicit drugs to boost potency. Kentucky has long been plagued by high rates of addiction to opioid painkillers. But the Office of Drug Control Policy pointed to the COVID-19 pandemic as a “major contributing factor” in the surge in deaths. “The interruption of routine for those in recovery, the sense of isolation, economic concerns and anxiety all contributed to the dramatic increase recorded,” the report said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Education leaders said Tuesday that state standardized test results show public school students who attended in-person classes during the coronavirus pandemic outperformed those who relied on distance learning. The Advocate reports the disparities surfaced on LEAP 2025, standardized tests that measure what students in grades 3-12 know about math, English, science and social studies. Students took the tests in April and May. Louisiana’s goal is for students to achieve mastery or better – the fourth-highest of five achievement levels. The education department said in grades three through eight, the rate of students who scored mastery or higher on the English and math portions of the test was 15% higher for students who spent the 2020-21 school year in the classroom compared to those who relied on online instruction. Students who used distance learning had an 11% greater rate of scoring unsatisfactory on the exams – the lowest achievement level. State Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley said in a statement the test results show it’s “absolutely critical that we keep our students in the classroom for this upcoming year while mitigating the spread of COVID-19.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Maine Public Utilities Commission has opened an investigation into a lack of phone numbers available in the 207 area code, the only code used in the state. The investigation centers on the number-forecasting practices of the provider Verizon, the Portland Press Herald reports. Last year, an assessment found that Maine no longer had access to most of the 8 million phone numbers in the area code. Because of expected demand, Maine’s area code could run out of usable numbers by late 2024, according to the newspaper. Carriers said that Maine should join the 25 states in the country that have added multiple area codes. Maine Public Utilities Commission said it questions how Verizon distributes numbers to people. “Verizon may be using unrealistic forecasting goals, unnecessarily tying up available phone numbers,” PUC Chairman Philip Bartlett said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Baltimore Symphony Orchestra has fired its principal flutist, months after distancing itself from her controversial social media posts. The orchestra didn’t offer a specific reasons for its decision to dismiss Emily Skala on Tuesday, but it comes six months after the orchestra publicly rebuked her for social media posts that questioned the safety of COVID-19 vaccines as well as the efficacy of face masks. She also questioned the authenticity of the presidential election results. BSO President and CEO Peter Kjome said in a statement that Skala was fired under the progressive discipline policy agreed to with the Musicians’ Association of Metropolitan Baltimore. “Ms. Skala has had discipline imposed upon her over these past few months for violating several policies; unfortunately, she has repeated the conduct for which she had been previously disciplined, and dismissal was the necessary and appropriate reaction to this behavior,” the statement said. Skala had been suspended from work duties and told The Baltimore Sun she was notified by phone Tuesday that she had lost her job of 33 years. “I’ve only ever wanted to state my truth,” Skala said. “I’m not going to sit passively by.” It wasn’t clear whether “repeated conduct” in the statement refers to new social media posts.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The famous islands of Martha’s Vineyard and Nantucket are facing serious impacts from rising sea levels and more powerful coastal storms driven by climate change, a new environmental report released Wednesday warns. The “State of the Coast” report by the Trustees, a prominent Massachusetts conservation group, says the popular tourist destinations off Cape Cod risk losing hundreds of acres of marshlands to flooding and billions of dollars in coastal homes, buildings and infrastructure to erosion. What’s more, roughly 900 structures on the two islands may experience daily tidal flooding by 2050 as sea levels are predicted to rise more than 2.5 feet, the organization said. “The impacts of flooding and erosion on these beloved islands will affect thousands who live and work there and the thousands more who visit each summer,” said Tom O’Shea, a managing director at the Trustees. The island communities, which also include the small and sparsely populated Elizabeth Islands, also known as Gosnold, are taking climate change seriously, the organization said in its report. Island communities have hired staff focused on climate change and begun resiliency work – redesigning harbors, replenishing sandy beaches, raising roads and creating living shorelines to protect against coastal erosion.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: While COVID-19 upended and ended the lives of thousands of Michiganders, taking a profound emotional toll, the challenges of 2020 did not seem to bring about a rise in suicides, which early data indicates dropped last year after rising significantly over the previous decade. According to provisional data from the state health department, Michigan recorded 1,284 deaths by suicide in 2020, down nearly 200 from the 1,471 recorded in 2019 and more than 250 from the 1,547 deaths in 2018. Nationally, suicides dropped from 47,511 in 2019 to 44,834 in 2020, a decline of 5.6%, preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows. In Michigan, suicides have been on the rise for years, increasing annually with few exceptions over the past decade. The decline indicated by preliminary data comes despite Michiganders and Americans reporting they felt more anxious and depressed – and GOP state lawmakers promising pandemic regulations would lead to skyrocketing suicide rates. The data came as a surprise to the state’s suicide prevention coordinator. “I think everybody’s assumption … was that there would be a dramatic increase,” said Patricia Smith, who leads the state health department’s prevention efforts.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The Minnesota Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that a state law requiring individuals to have a permit to carry a handgun in public is constitutional and does not violate the Second Amendment. The ruling comes in the case of a man who was charged with carrying a pistol without a permit. Nathan Hatch was arrested in 2018 after Metropolitan Airport Commission police stopped to help him after his truck broke down. He told officers he had a gun in the back seat and did not have a permit, and officers found a loaded pistol. Hatch was convicted of a gross misdemeanor. On appeal, he tried to strike down the state’s permit-to-carry statute, arguing it violated his right to bear arms and failed to survive strict scrutiny because it was not narrowly tailored to advance the state’s interests. The Supreme Court disagreed. “Considering the undisputed compelling governmental interest in ensuring public safety and the narrowly tailored provisions of the statute to achieve that interest, we conclude that the permit-to-carry statute withstands strict scrutiny,” the justices ruled. “We therefore hold that the permit-to-carry statute does not violate the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution.”\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The sheriff of the state’s largest county has died, almost two weeks after he tested positive for the coronavirus amid an outbreak of the illness at a jail he oversaw, despite being vaccinated. The Hinds County Sheriff’s Department said an ambulance was sent to the home of Sheriff Lee Vance on Wednesday morning. “Sheriff Vance was non-responsive when medical personnel arrived and pronounced deceased,” the department posted on Twitter. The sheriff’s office announced July 23 that Vance had tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 and was in isolation at home. It was not immediately known whether that illness caused his death. Vance was elected sheriff in 2019. He had served more than 30 years with the Jackson Police Department and was chief from 2014 to 2017. Vance had been vaccinated against COVID-19, and he tested positive as cases of the virus were spreading rapidly at the Hinds County jail.\n\nMissouri\n\nO’Fallon: Gov. Mike Parson announced Tuesday that he made good on his promise to pardon a couple who gained notoriety for pointing guns at social justice demonstrators as they marched past the couple’s home in a luxury St. Louis enclave last year. Parson, a Republican, on Friday pardoned Mark McCloskey, who pleaded guilty in June to misdemeanor fourth-degree assault and was fined $750, and Patricia McCloskey, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor harassment and was fined $2,000. “Mark McCloskey has publicly stated that if he were involved in the same situation, he would have the exact same conduct,” the McCloskeys’ lawyer Joel Schwartz said Tuesday. “He believes that the pardon vindicates that conduct.” The McCloskeys, both lawyers in their 60s, said they felt threatened by the protesters, who were passing their home in June 2020 on their way to demonstrate in front of the mayor’s house nearby in one of hundreds of similar demonstrations around the country after George Floyd’s death. The couple also said the group was trespassing on a private street. Mark McCloskey emerged from his home with an AR-15-style rifle, and Patricia McCloskey waved a semiautomatic pistol, according to the indictment. Special prosecutor Richard Callahan said his investigation determined the protesters were peaceful.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Gov. Greg Gianforte announced the allocation of over $35 million in coronavirus relief dollars Wednesday. More than $32 million will go toward COVID-19 screening and testing in schools. Over $1.6 million will go toward an employment and training program that assists people supported by the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program gain skills and workforce experience. Gianforte said the funds will help SNAP recipients become self-sufficient. Currently, the program is only available in three Montana counties: Yellowstone, Missoula, and Lewis and Clark. Gianforte also approved $1.2 million for a program that provides early intervention services for infants with significant developmental delays or disabilities. The Montana public health department reported that enrollment in the program dropped by 48% during the coronavirus pandemic. About 1,540 infants were served by the program in the 2020 fiscal year. Over $300,000 will go to Montana’s Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act grant to provide training and technical support to teams responding to child abuse in the state.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: An 8-foot bulge near the north end of Offutt Air Force Base’s single runway will disappear during a $198 million reconstruction project that is the most extensive in its history. For the past five months, construction equipment has been swarming over Offutt’s 2-mile runway, chewing it to bits and depositing it into giant piles of rubble, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Much of that concrete will eventually be recycled, mixed with other fill, and compacted to form a base for the new runway. The hump was one of the airfield’s quirks. It and the 8-foot valley toward the south end were gentle enough that they never posed a threat to pilots, said Lt. Col. Derrick Michaud, director of the 55th Wing Runway Project Management Office. The paved runway still in use was put down in 1941 to accommodate the Glenn L. Martin Bomber Plant, which produced more than 2,000 military aircraft during World War II. The runway was extended to its current length in the mid-1950s. Over the years, the original concrete was patched and repaired but never completely replaced. The runway had deteriorated so badly by 2015 that it was ranked as the worst of any at the 17 bases operated by the Air Force’s Air Combat Command.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: An uptick in coronavirus cases driven by the highly contagious delta variant and Nevada’s flagging rate of vaccinations has pushed hospitalization rates in the state past levels seen in a surge last summer, well before vaccines were available. Nevada reported Tuesday that 1,148 people were hospitalized with COVID-19, and 67 others were suspected to have the illness. Those are levels last seen in late January but below the peak seen since the pandemic began. That came in December, when hospitals were pushed to near capacity, with few people having access to vaccines and many gathering over the holidays. On Dec. 15, Nevada reported 1,857 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Now, hospitals have more COVID-19 patients than during a previous surge last summer, when 972 were hospitalized and 174 were suspected of having the virus. As of last week, the Nevada Hospital Association said seven hospitals were reporting a surge in cases above licensed bed counts, and five had staffing shortages. There were 231 COVID-19 patients in intensive care last week – about half the peak of 460 seen Dec. 22. There were 142 people on ventilators, less than half the level seen at the peak the same December day.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nJaffrey: A theater that offered entertainment from 1922 to 1976 before it closed is reopening. A ribbon-cutting is scheduled for Thursday at the Park Theatre in Jaffrey. The theater has been rebuilt to feature two auditoriums seating 450. They will feature movies, live theater – including children’s productions – concerts, lectures and community gatherings. Construction began in 2019. “This project is the culmination of the efforts of more than 1,000 people. We are so proud to present the new theatre to our town, the region, and New England,” Nancy Belletete, theater board president, said in a statement. On Thursday, two classic films will be presented as part of a “Quarter Day” in the auditoriums: “Field of Dreams” and “Cinderella.” The ticket price will be 25 cents for either film, with popcorn costing 10 cents.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJackson: Six Flags Great Adventure will host three daylong COVID-19 vaccination clinics this month. All guests who receive a shot on site will also get a free ticket to the park’s Wild Safari Drive-Thru Adventure for the 2021 season. Vaccinations will be available 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Thursday, with additional clinics Wednesday, Aug. 11, and Tuesday, Aug. 17. The park has partnered with the Ocean County Health Department for the free vaccination clinics, which will take place in the Membership Building in the park’s outer mall. Participants will have their choice of the two-shot Pfizer or Moderna vaccine or single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine. Reservations are not required, and parking fees may apply. “We’re honored to partner with the Ocean County Health Department to encourage New Jersey residents and our out-of-state guests to get vaccinated,” Six Flags park president John Winkler said in a statement. “The vaccination helps us protect ourselves and those we love.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: The state prides itself on having the best chiles in the world, but a shortage of farmhands could leave a big portion of this year’s bumper crop rotting on the vine. “We have one of the best chile crops the state has ever seen because the weather just set up perfectly in most areas,” Joram Robbs, executive director of the New Mexico Chile Association, told the Santa Fe New Mexican on Tuesday. “There are some farmers that got hit by monsoons in a negative way, but there’s tons of chile on these plants, so we’re going to see a huge loss if we don’t get it picked.” Some GOP lawmakers and farmers in the Hatch Valley are blaming the labor shortage on the extra unemployment insurance benefit payments they believe are keeping workers at home instead of in the field, and they’re urging Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to “immediately” cut them off. In a letter to the governor, Sen. Crystal Diamond of Elephant Butte and Reps. Rebecca Dow of Truth or Consequences and Luis Terrazas of Silver City contend the supplemental unemployment benefits are responsible for a lack of workers “in virtually every area of our state’s economy.” Joe Paul Lack, who grows chile in addition to onions and pecans, said he’ll probably only be able to harvest half of the 80 acres of onions he grew this year because he doesn’t have enough workers.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The New York International Auto Show has become a casualty of the coronavirus’ fast-spreading delta variant. Show organizers said Wednesday that they’ve decided to cancel it this year, a little over two weeks before the scheduled start. The reasons are the growing spread of the variant and recent restrictions announced by state and local officials to fight it. “Over the past few weeks, especially within the past few days, circumstances have changed, making it more difficult to create an event at the high standard that we and our clients expect,” Mark Schienberg, the show’s president, said in a statement. The show was scheduled to begin with a press day Aug. 19. The next show will come in April 2022, spokesman Chris Sams said. The event was scrubbed before automakers’ trucks left warehouses to start moving into the Jacob Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, Sams said. He said current government precautions wouldn’t have stopped this year’s show, but organizers feared the situation could worsen between now and the start. Once the trucks depart, costs to automakers grow, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Young people would need parental permission now before receiving the COVID-19 vaccine in legislation approved unanimously Tuesday by the state Senate. The bill, which now must return to the House for consideration, contains a parent or guardian requirement for vaccines approved by federal regulators for emergency use, such as the Pfizer COVID-19 shot. It’s currently the only COVID-19 vaccine available to children as young as 12. North Carolina law currently allows those under 18 to make the vaccine decision on their own “if they show the decisional capacity to do so,” according to the state Department of Health Human Services. DHHS said it’s expected most teens would receive parental consent anyway. But legislators wanted more assurances that parents will have the say over whether their child gets an immunization still authorized for emergency use. The consent provision is contained within a bill that also would expand the types of medications immunizing pharmacists can administer. The state health director would issue standing orders for immunizing pharmacists to administer more medications without a doctor’s prescription. Those would include certain nicotine smoking cessation programs, some oral contraceptives or those delivered via a skin patch, and prenatal vitamins.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: An attorney for a man accused in the gruesome killings of four people at a property management firm said Wednesday that the case amounts to a rush to judgment based on bad information that led to the wrong conclusion. A prosecutor, though, said every piece of the puzzle leads to the defendant. Chad Isaak, 47, of Washburn, is on trial for the April 1, 2019, deaths of RJR Maintenance & Management co-owner Robert Fakler, 52, and co-workers Adam Fuehrer, 42, and spouses Bill and Lois Cobb, 50 and 45. He pleaded not guilty to four counts of murder and three other counts. It was one of the most heinous crimes in North Dakota history, defense attorney Bruce Quick acknowledged in his opening statement. Three of the victims were shot and stabbed. Combined, the four of them were stabbed about 100 times. Prosecutor Karlei Neufeld began the trial being livestreamed from Mandan by describing the horrific crime scene and said evidence would include photos, surveillance video, lab reports, bullet fragments, and a knife and other things found during searches of the suspect’s home and vehicle. Quick spent a good chunk of his opening statement pointing out what evidence was overlooked or not investigated, saying law enforcement was under a “tremendous amount pressure to solve this case.”\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Mike Carey, a coal lobbyist backed by former President Donald Trump, beat a bevy of Republicans in central Ohio, while Cuyahoga County Council member Shontel Brown pulled out a victory for the Democratic establishment in Cleveland, in a pair of primary elections for open House seats Tuesday. The special elections were both viewed as a measure of voters’ influences, though low turnout and huge candidate fields complicated interpreting the results too broadly. In both races, party leaders showed they still held sway. Carey’s race reinforced Trump’s status as GOP kingmaker, particularly after the former president’s preferred candidate lost a special election in Texas last week. Brown’s primary win over progressive Nina Turner handed another blow to a liberal wing that has been challenging the Democratic old guard with a more confrontational style. Turner, a leading national voice for Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaigns, was for many months the best known and most visible among 13 Democrats running in the fiercely fought primary and the choice of Sanders, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others. But Brown – a centrist backed by Hillary Clinton, influential House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn, the Congressional Black Caucus, leading unions and many local leaders – prevailed after a surge in national attention.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: More than 150,000 Oklahomans have qualified for Medicaid under an expansion of the program approved by voters, and state health officials say they suspect many more residents are eligible but haven’t yet applied. The Oklahoma Health Care Authority reported Monday that 154,316 people have qualified for the additional health benefits. Of those, nearly 91,000 live in urban areas and about 63,000 in rural Oklahoma. About half are between 19 and 34 years old. “We are currently working with our community partners to reach those hard-to-find eligible adults,” said OHCA CEO Kevin Corbett. “We encourage Oklahomans to spread the word to their family and friends in hopes of providing health care coverage to those who need it.” After a decade of Republican resistance, Oklahoma voters narrowly approved a constitutional amendment last year to expand eligibility for benefits. Now, an individual who earns up to $17,796 annually or $36,588 for a family of four qualifies for Medicaid health care coverage. The Health Care Authority has projected that about 215,000 residents would qualify for expanded Medicaid for a total annual cost of about $1.3 billion. The estimated state share would be about $164 million.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: As COVID-19 cases continue to climb, some counties – most where less than half of the area’s adult population is vaccinated – are experiencing their highest hospitalization numbers of the pandemic. Statewide coronavirus-related hospitalizations increased to 379 patients Tuesday, 39 more than the previous day. Some hospital officials, including those at Oregon Health & Science University, said they are postponing some surgeries that are not urgent, KOIN-TV reports. In addition, Oregon health officials reported 1,575 newly confirmed and presumptive COVID-19 cases Tuesday, the most since early January. “The vaccines that we currently have available to us in Oregon, and across the United States, are highly effective at preventing hospitalizations and death from COVID-19,” Dr. Dean Sidelinger, the state epidemiologist, said Friday. “But that depends on people being vaccinated.” About 29% of adults in Oregon are unvaccinated, and more than 102,000 vaccine doses have been thrown away due to non-use. The impacts of the virus on unvaccinated people are apparent when looking at high infection rates in counties with low vaccination rates, such as those in eastern Oregon, including Baker, Malheur, Morrow, Umatilla, Union and Wallowa counties.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A Republican state senator who wants to have the committee he leads force three counties to turn over election machines, ballots and related material said Tuesday that he thinks subpoenas will be issued in the next two weeks. Sen. Doug Mastriano of Franklin County told the conservative-friendly outlet Newsmax that he’s working on a broad subpoena to York, Tioga and Philadelphia counties. “Obviously I can’t operate on my own, so I have a committee, so the committee will have a vote, hopefully in the next week or two, that will authorize the committee, and me as their chair, to send the subpoenas to three counties,” he said. The deadline for voluntary compliance that Mastriano gave the counties expired in recent days – officials in Tioga and Philadelphia have said no, and York has raised concerns but has not directly turned him down. Mastriano has been a leading proponent in Pennsylvania of former President Donald Trump’s attempt to reverse his election loss. Mastriano was outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, when Trump encouraged a mob that subsequently forced their way past police into the seat of federal legislative power. He said Tuesday that the subpoenas would help the committee look into the November election as well as the May 2021 primary in Pennsylvania.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Fifteen more nonprofits have each been awarded $10,000 as a part of the state’s vaccine incentive program, which releases the awards as more residents get inoculated, Gov. Daniel McKee announced Tuesday. The RI Gives Vax Challenge launched last month awards grants to nonprofits that have been on the front lines of the pandemic response for every 5,000 people in the state who get a first dose of a vaccine. 15,000 first doses have been administered since the program was announced, the state Department of Health said. “It takes a team to get the job done, and Rhode Island is lucky to have so many nonprofits stepping up to keep us safe, support vaccination efforts and help those in need,” the Democratic governor said in a statement. Nearly 660,000 people have been fully vaccinated in the state, and almost 80% of adult Rhode Islanders are now at least partially vaccinated, according to state health officials. “It is inspiring to see Rhode Islanders stepping up to help organizations that are delivering food, housing and health care to those most affected by the pandemic,” said Neil Steinberg, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation, which is partially funding the $750,000 initiative. “But make no mistake, more resources will be necessary.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The mayor is considering issuing a school mask mandate, a move he says would protect vaccine-ineligible children amid the coronavirus’ resurgence. The effort would put Columbia Mayor Steve Benjamin, a Democrat, at odds with Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, as well as the GOP-controlled Legislature, which recently barred such policies for all public schools. Benjamin, who has previously declared a state of emergency during the pandemic, said during a City Council meeting Tuesday that he was considering issuing a new one, which he said would allow him to impose mask requirements in schools within the city’s limits. Because adults, as well as children age 12 and older, are eligible to get vaccinated against COVID-19, Benjamin said he was not considering a universal mask mandate – only one intended to protect age-ineligible kids. “The challenge is that our babies are unvaccinated,” said Benjamin, currently in his third and final term as Columbia mayor and among South Carolina’s most notable Democrats. “If we as a community are not willing to do what is necessary to keep them safe and keep them alive, then that is indeed a statement on who we are as a people.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Education leaders say that as the new school year approaches, the state doesn’t have enough teachers and support staff, a situation they attribute to the coronavirus pandemic. State Education Secretary Tiffany Sanderson said every school district in South Dakota is dealing with staffing shortages for the upcoming year. “The open positions right now, going into the school year three weeks away, we still have almost 120 unfilled positions for classroom teachers,” she said. Sanderson said some teachers decided to retire earlier than planned because of COVID-19. She said schools are also looking for additional staff to help students who need tutoring or special assistance to make up for lost learning during the pandemic. Sioux Falls Superintendent Jane Stavem said her district is having trouble finding enough bus drivers and other support staff. Stavem said she is concerned the pandemic will make college students rethink pursuing a teaching career, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. “The complexities that our staff dealt with in just the dailiness of teaching were immense, and it was very exhausting,” she said. Stavem said one way to recruit more teachers is to raise their salaries. The Sioux Falls school board voted in May to raise the base pay for new teachers from $37,000 to $41,000.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state has sent nearly half a million dollars to farmers who have vaccinated their cattle against respiratory diseases and other maladies over the past two years. But Republican Gov. Bill Lee, who grew up on his family’s ranch and refers to himself as a cattle farmer in his Twitter profile, has been far less enthusiastic about incentivizing herd immunity among humans. Even though Tennessee has among the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the country, Lee has refused to follow the lead of other states that have offered enticements for people to get the potentially life-saving shots. Lee hasn’t always been against incentivizing vaccinations. Tennessee’s Herd Health program began in 2019 under Lee, whose family business, Triple L Ranch, breeds Polled Hereford cattle. The state currently reimburses participating farmers up to $1,500 for vaccinating their herds, handing out $492,561 over the past two fiscal years, according to documents from the Tennessee Agriculture Department. Lee, who so far has avoided drawing a serious Republican primary challenge in his 2022 reelection bid, has been accused of complacency in the face of the deadly pandemic. Tennessee’s vaccination rates for COVID-19 hover around 39% of its total population, versus more than 49% nationally for the fully inoculated.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A federal judge on Tuesday blocked Texas from allowing state troopers to stop vehicles carrying migrants on the grounds that they may spread COVID-19 as worries and new cases are rising along the U.S.-Mexico border. The temporary order by U.S. District Judge Kathleen Cardone of El Paso is at least a short-term victory for the Biden administration, which had warned that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott’s plan would create more problems amid high levels of summer border crossings in Texas – particularly in the Rio Grande Valley, which one U.S. official called the “epicenter of the current surge.” In a sign of the growing strain, local officials there who have rebuffed Abbott’s hard-line immigration actions to jail border-crossers and build new barriers declared a local state of disaster this week as coronavirus cases climb and as capacity at migrant shelters is stretched. Cardone said Abbott’s directive would have the effect of “exacerbating the spread of COVID-19.” She scheduled another hearing for next week. Abbott spokesman Renae Eze said that the decision was “based on limited evidence” and that the governor’s office looked forward to providing evidence to the court.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The state’s hospitals are feeling the strain as coronavirus cases increase, the vast majority among unvaccinated people, officials said Tuesday. Republican Gov. Spencer Cox called the latest wave a “pandemic of the unvaccinated” yet maintained the state wouldn’t be following New York in requiring people to show they got their shots. Still, if private companies require some sort of proof, the state would support them, he said. “The delta variant is highly contagious, and it’s spreading rapidly. Our hospital ICUs are filling up, and our health care workers are feeling the strain,” he said. Hospitals have a shortage of qualified health care workers more than a year into the punishing pandemic. Intensive care units around the state have exceeded 100% capacity multiple times over the past several days, according to officials with Intermountain Healthcare. The state had more than 6,000 new cases over the past week, and about 90% of those were among unvaccinated people, hospital system officials said. There’s also a national shortage of a medication shown to be effective in treating COVID-19 called Tocilizumab, doctors said. Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson, who said she still suffers the effects of her own battle with COVID-19, was blunt: “Everybody who is unvaccinated is part of the problem,” she said.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Performance venues across the state that were closed by the COVID-19 pandemic will get up to $18.7 million in federal funding to help them survive, according to Vermont’s congressional delegation. The money for the 59 locations comes from the Small Business Administration Shuttered Venue Operators Grants, which are available to live music venues, movie theaters and performing arts organizations affected by the pandemic. The three members of Vermont’s congressional delegation said what began as the “Save Our Stages” movement over a year ago has now materialized into meaningful relief for the affected venues. “Our independent live music and entertainment venues not only bring joy and energy to our downtowns and communities, they are economic engines that help make Vermont such a special place to live and visit,” said the statement by Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter Welch, Democratic U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy and independent U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders. The program provides support to businesses in the music and entertainment sector that were forced to shut their doors due to coronavirus restrictions. The grants have served as a lifeline for the venues, the statement said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state House gave initial approval Wednesday to a spending plan for billions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief money, a day after the Democratic majority flatly rejected a Republican-proposed alternative. The chamber ultimately advanced the legislation on a bipartisan vote of 71-25. The budget proposal crafted by Gov. Ralph Northam and fellow Democratic leaders calls for spending most of Virginia’s $4.3 billion share of the American Rescue Plan funding on initiatives aimed at helping small businesses, improving air quality in public schools, bolstering mental health and substance abuse treatment, increasing broadband access, and replenishing the state’s depleted unemployment trust fund. Republicans, in the minority in both chambers, have complained that they were kept out of the budget-writing process and were stifled by Democrats in the House who allowed no amendments to be offered in committee and squashed a GOP counterproposal offered on the floor Tuesday by House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert. Gilbert was given two minutes to discuss his proposed alternative. Democrats said their budget would help struggling families and businesses.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Amid a tough summer for agriculture across the state, with crops like berries struggling under record heat and drought, some farmers now worry about how smoke in August could stunt the growth of some crops should the haze intensify and linger, KOMO-TV reports. Jennifer Schuh has worked with her father Steve Schuh for decades in the Skagit Valley, growing everything from corn to berries, squash, cucumbers and pumpkins. She said a long stretch of thick smoke could hurt their crops. Steve Schuh isn’t letting the potential of damaging smoke worry him, but he acknowledged ash can block a plant’s access to light and food. “They don’t function right if they’re all covered in smoke,” said Steve Schuh. While smoke has stayed in the upper levels of the atmosphere in Western Washington this week, communities in Central and Eastern Washington have battled wildfires and bad air quality for weeks. Some winemakers say smoke has not affected their wine grapes so far, but it could get bad in August. “They can get something called ‘smoke taint,’ ” said Nick Bond, the Washington state climatologist. “That is especially a problem right before they’re harvested.” Bond said wildfires could intensify in the next few weeks, posing a threat to agriculture around the region.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: People who inject drugs in Kanawha County should have expanded access to sterile syringes, testing and treatment in response to one of the nation’s highest spikes of HIV cases, according to federal and state recommendations released Tuesday. The report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the state’s Department of Health and Human Resources, and the health department in its largest county comes amid a new West Virginia law that tightens requirements for needle exchange programs. Other guidance resulting from the CDC investigation includes getting the community involved in addressing the HIV outbreak and doing more analysis of public health data to understand the extent of injection drug use in Kanawha County. The agency also recommends expanding and improving so-called harm reduction programs that connect people with substance abuse treatment, recovery support and other health services. And it outlines actions that should be taken by agencies such as health departments, social services, clinical and correctional settings, and public safety. The report found there were 63 new intravenous drug-related HIV cases in the county from January 2019 through May 13 of this year. Before 2019, the average number of such cases in the county was below five per year.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Anyone who gets vaccinated against COVID-19 at a clinic at the Wisconsin State Fair will get a free cream puff, Gov. Tony Evers said Wednesday. AMI Expeditionary Healthcare will run the free clinic at the fair in West Allis, the governor said. The clinic will offer Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. Anyone who gets a shot there will receive a voucher for a free cream puff redeemable at the Cream Puff Pavilion. The incentive comes as COVID-19 cases are surging across the state, driven largely by the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus that causes the disease. The fair begins Thursday and is scheduled to run through Aug. 15.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Vaccinated and unvaccinated people alike should resume wearing masks indoors in most of the state amid a rise in infections of the highly contagious delta variant of the coronavirus, the state health officer said Wednesday. Fifteen of Wyoming’s 23 counties – including Laramie, Campbell, Sweetwater, Albany and Fremont – had moderate to high virus transmission, according to a health department dashboard. People should wear masks indoors in those and 10 other counties, said Dr. Alexia Harrist, the state health officer. “We are deeply concerned. The delta variant has really changed the COVID fight we have on our hands. Unfortunately, Wyoming’s low vaccination rate makes our state more vulnerable to this highly contagious variant,” Harrist said. A recent survey of more than 5,000 people with lab-confirmed or probable COVID-19 cases in Wyoming showed that 95% were not fully vaccinated against the disease, the health department said. About one-third of residents are fully inoculated, according to the department. That’s one of the lowest COVID-19 vaccination rates in the U.S.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/28/hiv-sos-miss-mississippi-ice-cream-festival-news-around-states/117249770/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa:Officials in west Alabama’s largest city said they expect to spend $1.5 million to $4 million repairing damage to water and sewer pipes damaged by Tropical Storm Claudette. The storm dumped between 4 and 8 inches of rain on Jan. 19, causing widespread flash flooding. City officials told The Tuscaloosa News that they’re still repairing water and sewer pipes near the Black Warrior River. A leak there had caused Mayor Walt Maddox to issue a water conservation order for users south of the river, including more than 100,000 residents, the University of Alabama and the Mercedes-Benz assembly plant. Maddox allowed the order to expire Wednesday, saying the line had been patched up and the water supply had stabilized. A contractor is rebuilding a slope that collapsed, damaging raw water intake lines that feed a treatment plant. The most expensive problem might be the failure of a water main and a sewer main near Nucor Corp.’s steel plant, which could cost $1 million. Jarrod Milligan, acting executive director for Tuscaloosa’s Infrastructure and Public Services department, said a private dam appears to have failed, washing out the line. Tuscaloosa officials said they hope to seek federal disaster aid to pay for repairs. Typically, damage would have to rise above a certain threshold before President Joe Biden’s administration would declare a disaster and free up aid from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The Sealaska Heritage Institute has released the first children’s book in the Haida language Xaad Kíl through its Baby Raven Reads program. “Nang Jáadaa Sgáana ’Láanaa aa Isdáayaan,” or “The Woman Carried Away by Killer Whales,” is a story carried down through generations orally and published through the work of team of artists and linguists. “It’s the first book I ever illustrated, and now it’s the first children’s book in the Haida language,” said Haida illustrator Janine Gibbons in a phone interview. “I had to stretch my mind. How am I going to represent this? And how am I going to represent this accurately?” The book’s art, painted by Gibbons, was originally created for the Tlingit version of the story. With interest in a Haida translation of the traditional story, Skíl Jáadei Linda Schrack and Ilskyalas Delores Churchill worked together to translate it to Xaad Kíl. Schrack also narrated a spoken version of the story for SHI’s Youtube to accompany readers, so they may hear the language spoken, said Xaad Kíl and Sm’alagyax language coordinator Susie Edwardson in a phone interview. The book is available now for purchase on the SHI website.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson:Police made an arrest in connection with the vandalism of a Tucson synagogue. Authorities said 30-year-old Nathan Beaver was booked into Pima County Jail on one charge of aggravated criminal damage. Beaver is accused of spraying anti-Semitic graffiti on the Chabad on River Synagogue on June 7. The graffiti included a swastika and a slur. Police said a unit that handles possible hate crimes made “exhaustive efforts” and determined there was enough evidence to arrest Beaver. It was not immediately known if Beaver had an attorney or if he was still being held. Mayor Regina Romero and Police Chief Chris Magnus said the incident had especially troubled the community. Rabbi Yehuda Ceitlin of Chabad Tucson said the vandalism was discovered by a congregant coming to the synagogue for prayer and a Torah class. Gov. Doug Ducey condemned the “terrible” vandalism on social media. “Anti-Semitism has NO place in Arizona and this behavior cannot be tolerated,” Ducey wrote in a tweet. “Arizona stands with those of the Jewish faith.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Amid increases in new COVID-19 cases in Arkansas, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said the overwhelming majority of those hospitalized with the virus have not been vaccinated. “These vaccines are effective, but we need more Arkansans to get the shot,” Hutchinson said on Twitter. Over the previous two weeks, the rolling average number of daily new cases in Arkansas has increased by 97.1, an increase of about 51%, according to researchers from Johns Hopkins University. They said the state ranks fifth in the country for new cases per capita. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said about 42% of Arkansans have received their first dose of the vaccine, and about 34% of the population has completed their vaccination. Th state health department said Friday on Twitter that it will no longer publish COVID-19 data on weekends. The department said those numbers would now be available on Mondays. Arkansas in late March opened its vaccinations to everyone at least 16 years old and lifted its statewide mask mandate, but the state has had one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPacifica: A great white shark bit a man in the leg as he swam off a northern California beach on Saturday morning, authorities said. The 35-year-old man’s injury was not life-threatening and he was able to swim to shore at Grey Whale Cove State Beach, about 18 miles south of San Francisco, where he received medical aid, San Mateo County Sheriff’s Lt. Eamonn Allen said. The man said he believed he was bitten by a 6- to 8-foot-long great white shark, Allen said. State park officials prohibited water activities off the beach, as well as off nearby Montara State Beach, for 48 hours and will post signs to advise beachgoers of the closure, said California State Parks spokesman Gabe McKenna.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A summer snowstorm hampered the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb, one of the oldest auto races in the United States which was run Sunday night. Participants in the second-oldest auto race in the U.S. drive a course covering more than 12 miles with 156 turns up to the 14,115-foot summit. But it was shortened by 3 miles because of poor weather and road conditions.. Robin Shute of the United Kingdom won the race for the second time, finishing in 5 minutes, 55.246 seconds, slightly more than 36 seconds ahead of runner-up and four-time champion Romain Dumas of France. The storm in Colorado was in sharp contrast to a dangerous heat wave that was gripping much of the Pacific Northwest, with cities such as Seattle and Portland, Oregon, expected to break records for high temperatures throughout the weekend.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont on Friday unveiled a new promotion – a concert ticket giveaway – to encourage residents, especially younger adults, to get a COVID-19 vaccination throughout the summer and fall. The “Rock the Shot” campaign will offer people two ways to win tickets to see popular pop, country and hip-hop artists in person, including Luke Bryan, Lil Baby and the Jonas Brothers, when they come to perform in Connecticut. First, anyone 18 and older who has received at least one vaccine shot can enter an online drawing for two premium seats to one of several concerts. Weekly drawings throughout July will begin July 8. Winners will be contacted once their vaccination status is verified. Second, the first 24 people to get vaccinated at select clinics will receive two tickets. “Getting vaccinated is incredibly important to protecting your families, friends, neighbors, and communities as a whole, and we are launching this Rock the Shot campaign to stress – especially to the youngest adults in our state – just how important and safe getting vaccinated is,” Lamont, a Democrat, said in a statement. Last week, state officials reported more than 2 million residents in Connecticut have been fully vaccinated. Lamont said he wants to “keep the momentum going.”\n\nDelaware\n\nRockwood Park:After being postponed in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Rockwood Park Ice Cream festival returned Saturday with entertainment, activities for families and tastings. Activities were scaled down from the usual activities. There also were opportunities available for festival-goers to get vaccinated. New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer said the event was nearly canceled once again. “We’re only here because so many Delawareans raised their hands to get vaccinated,” he said. “We know it’s not that way everywhere in our country and everywhere in our world, but without that, we were, as I said, ready to cancel this.” This year’s modified version featured live music, vendors from First State Flea and various ice cream and food trucks – including fan favorites such as the University of Delaware’s UDairy Creamery and Hockessin-area’s Woodside Creamery.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:There’s still no word from D.C.’s Department of Transportation on when a pedestrian bridge that collapsed Wednesday will be reconstructed and if they will offer transportation help to neighbors left without easy access to the other side of Ward 7, WUSA-TV reported. The bridge near the corner of Lane Place NE and Kenilworth Ave NE collapsed after a truck rammed into it. Advisory Neighborhood Commissioner 7B06 Kelvin Brown said the bridge collapse is like a clamped artery for some neighbors. “This pedestrian bridge is the lifeblood through which they travel to doctor’s appointments, travel to get groceries at the only grocery store in the area – Safeway,” he said. As an immediate solution, a DDOT spokesperson suggested using one of the other pedestrian bridges along the avenue to get across I-295, such as the one at Douglas Street NE. Brown said there are not enough sidewalks to make that a safe alternative – especially for elderly neighbors. “I’m literally about to jump out my chair and probably out the window,” he said. “Making sure our neighbors have access to safe, efficient transportation is just a nonstarter.”\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The first cruise ship to leave a U.S. port since the coronavirus pandemic brought the industry to a 15-month standstill sailed away Saturday with nearly all passengers on board vaccinated. The Celebrity Edge departed Fort Lauderdale at 6 p.m. with the number of passengers limited to about 40% capacity, and with nearly all 1,100 passengers vaccinated against COVID-19. Celebrity Cruises, one of Royal Caribbean Cruise’s brands, said 99% of the passengers are vaccinated, well above the 95% requirement imposed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A giant greeting was projected on a wall of one of the port buildings: “Someday is here. Welcome back.” Passengers arrived with matching T-shirts that read phrases such as “straight outta vaccination” and “vaccinated and ready to cruise.” To comply with the CDC’s requirement and a new Florida law banning businesses from requiring customers to show proof of vaccination, Celebrity Cruises asked guests if they would like to share their vaccination status. Those who did not show or say they are vaccinated face additional restrictions. Saturday’s sailing kicks off the cruise lines’ return to business with Carnival vessels already scheduled to depart from other ports next month.\n\nGeorgia\n\nColumbus: Fort Benning’s commanding general is urging more people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, saying it’s crucial to protecting the soldiers on the sprawling army post. The Ledger-Enquirer reported that Maj. Gen. Patrick Donahoe told the Greater Columbus Chamber of Commerce on Friday that vaccine numbers could determine how much freedom soldiers have to visit businesses off the base. “We encourage everyone who is going to interact with a soldier to be vaccinated,” Donahoe said, adding that trainees living in large open barracks are in a “hot house for any kind of contagious disease.” Donahoe took command at Benning a year ago. He tightened restrictions for soldiers and civilian workers. Earlier this month, he loosened rules in whch fully vaccinated people can go maskless with the exception of medical facilities and certain gyms. Graduation ceremonies are open, but visitors must show proof they’re fully vaccinated or have tested negative for the coronavirus in the last 72 hours. Donahoe said Columbus’ vaccination rates are too low. Only 29% of the city-county’s residents are fully vaccinated, and that number is 33% statewide. Chattahoochee County, where most Fort Benning residents and trainees live, continues to report more cases than Columbus because of testing of newly arrived soldiers. Donahoe said 2% to 4% of newly arrived soldiers continue to test positive for the virus, down from close to 20% during the worst days of the pandemic.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Health officials said the more transmissible and potentially more harmful delta variant of COVID-19 has been detected in all four of the state’s major counties. The state Department of Health has found 13 cases of the delta variant, including seven or eight that related to people who have traveled from out of state. There is also evidence of community spread of the variant. The cases were from specimens collected between May 31 and June 10. Preliminary research showed the delta variant results in a higher rate of severe illness than other strains of the disease, the department said. Available vaccines against COVID-19 have been shown to be effective at helping prevent people from spreading the variant and getting severely ill as a result of it. Kauai District Health Officer Dr. Janet Berreman urged people to get vaccinated. “It’s really important not only that people who haven’t been vaccinated be vaccinated, but that they don’t delay being vaccinated because every additional week is a chance for this virus to take hold even more strongly in our community and spread even more quickly,” Berreman said during a news conference. “So time is really of the essence.”\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Authorities have started releasing cold water from a northern Idaho dam to keep Snake River water temperatures cool to help migrating salmon and steelhead. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers started increasing releases of the 43-degree Fahrenheit water at Dworshak Dam on Tuesday ahead of an expected heat wave with temperatures expected to reach 100 degrees. The agency typically waits until the July Fourth holiday to start the releases. The Lewiston Tribune reported the agency will up the flows to 12,400 cubic feet per second. The water travels down the Clearwater River and joins the Snake River at Lewiston. The goal is to keep the temperature of the Snake River from exceeding 68 degrees at Lower Granite Dam, the uppermost of four dams on the lower Snake River. Temperatures above 70 degrees can be harmful to salmon. In 2015, about 90% of the 510,000 sockeye salmon that entered the Columbia River died when an unusual combination of low water and an extended heat wave pushed water temperatures past 70 degrees. Those conditions had not occurred in the basin since at least the 1950s and are lethal for cold-water sockeye. That same year an estimated 4,000 Snake River sockeye entered the Columbia River in what managers expected would be one of the best returns to high-mountain lakes in central Idaho. But only about 1 percent survived the 900-mile (1,450-kilometer) journey to Idaho. Snake River sockeye are listed as endangered.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Although most of Chicago’s cultural institutions have reopened their doors, the Adler Planetarium won’t do so fully until next year. The planetarium along Lake Michigan closed in March 2020 amid the coronavirus pandemic. Planetarium officials said in a letter posted on the website earlier this month that they will start offering some events in July including weekend screenings of sky shows, but because of financial difficulties, the full reopening will be in March 2022. For instance, employees let go earlier in the pandemic have not been rehired. “Opening the museum at full capacity now would further strain our limited resources and reduced staff,” the letter read. “We have developed a timeline that will allow us to fully reopen from a position of strength.” Upgrades and renovations at the planetarium include a new telescope installed a month before the closure that has not officially opened to the public.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis:A Marion County judge ordered that Indiana must continue the federal government’s unemployment benefits, putting a temporary stop to Gov. Eric Holcomb’s move to drop the state from the program. Marion Superior Court Judge John Hanley granted the preliminary injunction in a lawsuit filed June 14 by two legal organizations, which argued that Indiana law requires the state to procure federal insurance benefits to residents. The lawsuit emphasized that the Republican governor’s actions to withdraw Indiana from the expanded unemployment benefits before the Sept. 6 expiration of those benefits will hurt thousands. Indiana’s decision to leave the federal program early violates state law, Hanley wrote in his court order, adding that the unemployment benefits are “instrumental in allowing Hoosiers to regain financial stability at an individual level while the state continues to face challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic during its return to normalcy.” The decision requires the state to continue the extra $300 weekly payments to unemployed workers and remain in other programs that expanded unemployment benefits during the COVID-19 pandemic. Holcomb said jobs are available across the state and pointed to Indiana’s 3.9% unemployment rate for April, which was down from the pandemic peak of 16.9% a year earlier. Ending the benefits early will also help Indiana businesses find and hire qualified employees for thousands of open positions, he said.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: The Iowa Supreme Court has ruled that employers cannot subject all warehouse employees to random drug testing by designating them as having “safety sensitive” jobs. In a 4-3 decision, the court ruled that companies must consider the specific duties of each worker when designing safety-based drug testing programs and not just where they work. The majority rejected an argument from the state’s largest business association that courts should not second-guess determinations made by employers on which jobs are more dangerous than others. The decision interpreted a 1998 state law that regulates how employers can conduct unannounced testing for drugs and alcohol in workplaces. One option under the law that is popular with employers is to test only those workers who are in “safety sensitive” jobs in which an accident could cause death, serious injury or damage. The case before the court involved a determination by the gas station chain Casey’s General Stores that all workers at its Ankeny distribution warehouse were “safety sensitive” employees. The company implemented random drug testing for them in 2016, citing concerns about widespread drug use. Three employees who tested positive for either marijuana or amphetamines were fired, and a fourth who failed to provide an adequate urine sample was let go. All four sued the company, raising a variety of concerns about how the drug testing program was conducted.\n\nKansas\n\nEdgerton: Residents living on the outskirts of a sprawling industrial park southwest of Kansas City want to create their own town to protect their rural lifestyle from encroaching development. Opposition to the massive Logistics Park Kansas City intermodal facility has been brewing for months, but it boiled over after the Edgerton City Council earlier this year agreed to rezone 700 rural acres to make way for more industrial properties south of Interstate 35, the Kansas City Star reported. That’s bringing development closer to the rural homes residents said they bought to be surrounded by fields and pastures – not warehouses and semitrailers. They said they hope that incorporating their own town of will give them more say over their fates. Jennifer Williams filed the petition on behalf of roughly 300 Miami County residents to create the new city of Golden. If approved, Golden would sit just south of the Johnson County border with more than 770 residents. Incorporation of the new city requires a unanimous vote of the Miami County Board of Commissioners. About 200 people gathered Wednesday for a four-hour hearing. Miami County Commissioner Rob Roberts could not offer a definitive timeline for further public discussions or a decision.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Almost all coronavirus cases reported in Kentucky during the past four weeks have been in unvaccinated residents, the state’s public health commissioner, Dr. Steven Stack, said. Roughly 99% of those hospitalized were also unvaccinated. “The bottom line is, these vaccines work, they work against every known variant of concern and interest out there right now,” he said. “If you get vaccinated, you’ve essentially got a 90%-plus reduction in your risk for death and serious disease and going into the hospital.” Stack pointed toward Kentucky’s low test positivity rate of 1.85% as a sign that vaccinations continue to ward off an uptick in new infections. And though Kentucky has reported a seven-week decline of cases, he added, unvaccinated residents are vulnerable to the fast-spreading delta variant. The delta variant now accounts for more than 20% of new coronavirus infections in the U.S., doubling in just two weeks, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana’s health insurer for state workers, teachers and retirees will soon cover weight loss surgery for people who are obese, under a bill signed into law by Gov. John Bel Edwards. State Sen. Regina Barrow, D-Baton Rouge, had previously tried to get the Office of Group Benefits to cover gastric bypass surgery and other types of weight loss surgeries, to lessen the health conditions associated with obesity. But lawmakers had raised concern about the costs. Barrow made some adjustments to the legislation and won unanimous support from the House and Senate in the recently ended legislative session. The governor agreed to the idea and signed the bill, which will take effect Aug. 1. To be eligible for the health procedure, members of the Office of Group Benefits insurance system must have a body mass index of at least 40 – or 35 or more if they have two qualifying health conditions. They will have to pay 20% of the costs for preoperative services and a $2,500 co-pay and other charges for the surgery. Although thousands of workers or retirees are expected to be eligible, the law caps the number of weight loss surgeries to no more than 300 a year. The health insurer won’t cover skin removal surgery associated with the medical procedure.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Maine Bicentennial Commission wants to hear from residents about what should go in the state’s official Bicentennial Time Capsule. The commission wants to preserve items from the era for future Mainers to rediscover upon the state’s 300th anniversary, a hundred years from now, in 2120. The deadline is Aug. 13. “We look forward to receiving creative and thoughtful suggestions for the ‘People’s Choice’ time capsule items,” said state Sen. Bill Diamond, chairman of the Maine Bicentennial Commission. The commission will review the submissions and present suggestions for a vote in the fall. The Bicentennial Time Capsule will be dedicated and sealed in a December ceremony in Augusta.\n\nMaryland\n\nWoodlawn: A small earthquake shook the Baltimore area on Friday afternoon, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 2.6, happened about 3:40 p.m., according to Paul Caruso, a geophysicist at the USGS National Earthquake Information Center. It was centered in Woodlawn, just west of Baltimore, and was about 1.5 miles deep. Fire department officials in the city of Baltimore and Baltimore County said they had no reports of injuries or damage from the quake more than an hour after it struck.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The first of five drawings for the Massachusetts coronavirus vaccine lottery is scheduled for July 26, state officials said. Additional drawings for either a $1 million prize or a $300,000 college scholarship will be held on the four Mondays following that date through the end of August, according to a statement from the office of Gov. Charlie Baker. The winners will be announced three days after each drawing. Registration for the Massachusetts VaxMillions Giveaway will begin Thursday. Residents must be fully vaccinated before registering, but if they are not vaccinated by the registration date for a certain drawing, they can still complete vaccination and register for subsequent drawings. Residents will only have to enter once to qualify for all drawings after their registration date. Residents age 18 and older are eligible for the $1 million prizes, and residents ages 12 to 17 are eligible for the scholarships, which are in the form of grants via a 529 College Savings Plan managed by the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority. The state is using federal coronavirus relief funds to pay the winners.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing:Gov. Gretchen Whitmer vetoed two bills that would let businesses seek refunds for taxes paid on personal protective equipment, disinfectants and plexiglass barriers during the coronavirus pandemic. Whitmer said she instead favors creating a direct grant program with federal money. She said tax credits would be ineligible for reimbursement from Washington, a blow to the state budget. The bills passed the Legislature with support from both parties. “I know we all share a commitment to sound fiscal management, embodied in a good faith agreement to run any legislation with a fiscal impact through the budget process,” Whitmer, a Democrat, said in a letter to lawmakers. The Detroit Regional Chamber, an influential business group, expressed disappointment. The bills “responded to the needs of businesses that were doing everything that Gov. Whitmer asked of them to keep employees and patrons safe,” said Brad Williams, the group’s lobbyist. “In a political era when there is very little cooperation across party lines, there was overwhelming bipartisan support for this legislation. … Such bipartisanship deserves to be celebrated rather than vetoed.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz said he will relinquish the special powers that he has used to manage the COVID-19 pandemic by Aug. 1, ending a peacetime state of emergency that has been in effect since March 2020. “That’s when the toolbox will close, everything will be done, it’ll be done in an orderly fashion,” Walz said. “At this point in time, it’s turning off the lights and sweeping the floor.” About three dozen states still have a state of emergency, Walz said, calling his plan “the responsible way to close this up.” But that wasn’t assurance enough for Republicans who control the state Senate and complain that the Democratic governor has repeatedly cut them out of major pandemic decisions. They approved a budget bill Friday that would end the state of emergency on July 1. The Democratic majority in the House has repeatedly blocked such moves. “He’s proposing Aug. 1, we’re saying, look, 15 states have already done it, we don’t need to wait any longer. This is time to close the chapter and move toward the future,” Republican Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka of East Gull Lake said. Walz has already allowed many of his most contentious pandemic executive orders to expire, such as the mask mandate and restrictions on businesses. But Minnesota’s director of Homeland Security and Emergency Management, Joe Kelly, said the governor needs to hold on to his remaining emergency powers through next month.\n\nMississippi\n\nVicksburg: Miss Golden Triangle Holly Brand was crowned Miss Mississippi during the final stage of the competition Saturday night. Brand, a native of Meridian, will compete in the Miss America Pageant in December at the Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut. The televised competition concluded at the Vicksburg Convention Center after three nights of preliminary competitions including talent, evening wear and social impact interview categories. Brand studied communication at the University of Alabama. She was named Miss Mississippi’s Outstanding Teen in 2017. Her social impact initiative is promoting volunteerism in the state. “Mississippi, my state and my home, ranks 50th in the nation for volunteerism,” Brand said during an onstage interview with the top five finalists. “Only 23% of Mississippians volunteer annually, but I know we can do better.” Brand said she would work to increase the volunteer percentage by at least 5% and implement a statewide day of service. She encouraged her fellow Mississippians to make a difference by “seeing a need and taking the lead.” First runner-up was Miss University of Southern Mississippi Vivian O’Neal; second runner-up was Miss Jones County Caidyn Crowder; third runner-up was Miss Pine Belt Macy Mitchell; and fourth runner-up was Miss Pearl of the South Rachel Shumaker.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The spike in COVID-19 cases is leading to a surge of critical illnesses in southwestern Missouri. The Springfield-Greene County Health Department on Friday reported the largest number of critical care and intensive care unit patients since the pandemic began, KYKY-TV reported. Health officials in Missouri’s third-largest city said 44% of the 167 COVID-19 patients there are considered critical care or are being treated in the ICU. The delta variant of the virus is believed responsible for much of the spread in Missouri, especially in the southwestern and northern parts of the state. Officials also cited low vaccination rates, especially in rural areas. Data from the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services shows that 313 of the 833 people hospitalized statewide with COVID-19 are in southwestern Missouri.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: More than $30 million of federal funding could be directed toward expanding child care capacity in Montana under recommendations approved by a state health advisory commission. The commission approved up to $31 million for the state health department to administer grants to expand child care in the state, the Montana State News Bureau reported Thursday. The grants will be used to increase worker pay and benefits and help with the cost of rent for facilities, among other uses. The commission also approved $6.8 million in administrative spending to help people apply for grants and learn how to better run their businesses.The recommendations next go to Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte for final approval. A lack of access to child care in Montana was hurting parents in the workforce before the pandemic, according to a 2019 report by the Montana Department of Labor & Industry. The report found licensed child care providers in the state met less than half the estimated demand. The health department estimated that 171 child care programs closed in Montana at the height of the pandemic. In a survey conducted by the department, about 42% of parents said they could not afford child care services. Child care providers attributed demand challenges to high staff turnover because of low compensation.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The University of Nebraska-Lincoln will offer prizes to students, faculty and staff who voluntarily sign on to a registry to show they have been vaccinated against COVID-19. The university said in a letter to students and staff on Wednesday that students who upload vaccination information to registry could receive five prizes worth one year of undergraduate tuition and fees, worth $9,872. Staff and faculty could be awarded a trip for two to Ireland to watch the Huskers play football in August 2022. The information must be registered by Aug. 15, The Omaha World-Herald reported. The university also said it will again require students, faculty and staff to undergo weekly saliva-based testing for the coronavirus. The registry and required testing is designed to help the university “understand the breadth of vaccination rates in our community and more accurately prepare for fall,” the university said. People who upload a record of their COVID vaccination will be exempt from mandatory COVID testing.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: More than 3.5 million passengers came through McCarran International Airport in May, an indication that Las Vegas is inching toward a post-pandemic comeback. Airport officials on Friday released data from last month showing a significant bounce in foot traffic at Las Vegas’ main airport. The total number of travelers was 600,000 more than in April, according to the Clark County Department of Aviation. The 3.5 million travelers in May, however, is a roughly 23% decrease from the more than 4.5 million seen in May 2019. For the year-to-date, McCarran has received more than 12 million passengers. That is a 41% drop from 2019, which saw 20.7 million.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A mosquito batch in Bow has tested positive for the Jamestown Canyon virus, the first time it has been detected in mosquitoes in the state, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services said. Humans have been previously diagnosed with the virus, which is transmitted by the bite of an infected mosquito. Testing mosquitoes has not been part of the routine surveillance, but the state started a pilot project this summer to estimate its prevalence in disease-carrying species in central New Hampshire. The department hasn’t identified the disease in a human this year. Since the first report of the disease in New Hampshire in 2013, the state has identified 14 human cases of JCV. Nationally, there are about 15 human cases of the virus diagnosed each year. Early symptoms of a mosquito-borne disease can include flu-like illness, such as fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue. Some people might progress to more serious central nervous system diseases, including meningitis or encephalitis\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBerkeley Township: As New Jersey residents prepare to head outdoors for the Fourth of July, the state’s parks are seeing a sharp rise in popularity, with more than 100,000 people signing up for annual park passes as part of New Jersey’s COVID-19 vaccine incentive. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy announced in May that any state resident who has at least one shot by July 4 can get a free state parks pass, which would cost $50 for residents this year. The 100,000 sign-ups is up from nearly 50,000 earlier this month, weeks after the program was announced, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees New Jersey’s parks. It dwarfs the roughly 5,000 annual passes typically purchased in a year. Although it’s not known how many people were motivated to become vaccinated by the free parks pass, the state eclipsed its goal of 4.7 million vaccinations last week amid the allurement. On a recent weekday, a parking lot at Island Beach State Park, a 10-mile stretch of mostly undeveloped shoreline and one of the state’s most popular beaches, was packed but not filled to capacity. The Department of Environmental Protection urged park-goers to arrive early to be sure of a spot in parks such as Island Beach that frequently reach capacity – as passes don’t guarantee entry.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Authorities at Petroglyph National Monument said visitors committed extensive vandalism by collecting rocks and stacking them in the form of cairns, sometimes used as a hiking trail marker. The federally protected park was created to preserve rock designs scratched by Ingenious people starting at least 700 years ago, and Spanish settlers as far back as 400 years ago. Venturing off trails and rearranging rocks in modern times is a violation of federal regulations. “Moving, stacking, or making shapes out of rocks is a form of vandalism and will impact every visitor who comes after,” said Park Superintendent Nancy Hendricks, asking visitors to “respect these sacred landscapes.” National Park Service workers are dismantling the stacks of rocks, but can’t be sure they will return the rocks where they came from along the largely preserved desert landscape. The agency is asking the public to share information about the person or persons who may have moved the rocks. The vandalism was first reported to the agency on June 17, according to a statement. Last year, a visitor was shocked with a Taser by a park ranger after he left a trail at the park, which lies northwest of Albuquerque. In March, the National Parks Service said it concluded the officer’s actions were appropriate. The male visitor was cited by the agency for being in a closed area off the trail, providing false information and failing to comply with a lawful order. A female visitor who was with him was cited for providing false information and being in a closed area off the trail.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York City: In-person visits at city jails are resuming after being suspended at the start of the coronavirus crisis. The first visitors were expected last Friday at Rikers Island and other city lockups. Last year, the jails became hot spots for the spread of the virus. That prompted efforts to decrease an inmate population numbering in the thousands and suspend the in-person visits. Mayor Bill de Blasio said at the time that the city would try to compensate by making more phones and stamps available for inmates to stay in touch with their families during the pause. The city also launched a “televisit initiative” for people in jail to video conference with people on the outside. During the initial phase of the return to in-person visits, family members will be allowed to see inmates on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. Visitors will have to practice social distancing, wear masks, undergo temperature checks and complete a self-screen for COVID-19.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Less than half of North Carolinians eligible for a COVID-19 shot are fully vaccinated, even though there are more than 2.1 million doses waiting on shelves for residents to take. In the two weeks since the state announced four $1 million prizes would be given out to vaccinated adults, less than 118,000 residents, about 1% of the state population, came in for a first dose. North Carolina ranks 12th-worst in the nation in vaccines administered per capita, and second-worst among states with a Democratic governor, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Those lagging numbers were the context under which President Joe Biden visited Raleigh on Thursday to urge North Carolinians to come in for a COVID-19 vaccine. “Please, please get vaccinated,” he said, noting he was “preaching to the choir” at the Green Road Community Center. “Folks, there is no reason to leave yourself vulnerable to the deadly virus for one single day more.” Gov. Roy Cooper and Dr. Mandy Cohen, the state’s top public health official, are sounding the alarm that a more dangerous delta variant is spreading and communities with high unvaccinated populations are most vulnerable, even as cases, hospitalizations and deaths continue to drop statewide.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: North Dakota health officials continue to document few new cases of COVID-19, but the state’s vaccination rate remains low as a new coronavirus variant that’s gaining a foothold across the country emerges in the state. Only 14 new virus cases were confirmed Saturday and just over 100 have been confirmed all week. As a comparison, the North Dakota Department of Health reported 2,278 newly confirmed cases on Nov. 14 alone – the high point for the state. At that time, daily tests routinely totaled more than 10,000. Weekday testing has rarely surpassed 3,000 in recent weeks, the Bismarck Tribune reported. North Dakota has a daily test positivity rate of 1.89% and a 14-day rolling average of 1.57%. Since the onset of the pandemic in North Dakota in March 2020, there have been 110,657 confirmed virus cases, with 108,962 recoveries and 1,528 deaths. One new death was confirmed Saturday.\n\nOhio\n\nOxford: A 52-year-old professor at Miami University died after he fell off the peak of a mountain in a national park. David Shrider fell 150 feet on Friday down the slope of Donoho Peak in Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve near Kennecott, Alaska, the Wrangell-St. Elias National Park & Preserve said in a news release Saturday. Just before the fall, a family member in the hiking group reported that he asked for help and then rolled approximately 150 feet down a slope. When a member of the group found him, he was dead. His son, who was a member of the party, called 911,” the park said. Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve Search and Rescue team members and an Alaska State Trooper used a helicopter to get the hiker’s body Saturday afternoon, the park said. Shrider was the director of global business programs at Miami University, according to a Facebook post about his death from the university’s Farmer School of Business. He graduated from Miami University in 1992 and became a professor there in 2004, the school said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A bullet has been found in a set of human remains that were exhumed during a search for victims of the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, a search team member said. Nine sets of remains have been examined and the bullet was found in the shoulder of a man, forensic anthropologist Phoebe Stubblefield said. Other parts of the man’s remains showed similar signs of trauma, including to the head. “He has multiple projectile wounds,” she said, referring to gunshot wounds. Stubblefield said she could not identify the type of bullet, which is the only one found thus far among examined remains. Of the nine sets, four are the remains of adults and five are those of juveniles. The remains have not been confirmed as belonging to victims of the massacre and forensic lab work by Stubblefield is expected to take three to four weeks. Searchers have found 35 coffins containing remains in Tulsa’s Oaklawn Cemetery and have sent 20 of the coffins for forensic examination, according to state archaeologist Kary Stackelbeck. One exhumed coffin, believed to be for an infant, contained no identifiable human remains, according to Stubblefield.\n\nOregon\n\nLincoln City:The coastal region might seem like heaven with temperatures 30 degrees cooler than in the boiling Willamette Valley, but that just meant overwhelming crowds and gridlocked roads at recreation sites anywhere near the beach. “Anytime it’s over 100 degrees in the valley, we see big crowds coming over to the Coast,” said Oregon Parks and Recreation Department spokesman Chris Havel. “But with this level of historic heat on a weekend, we expect the coast to be completely nuts.” The temperature in Salem was projected to hit 108 on Sunday – or possibly even higher. Meanwhile, just an hour’s drive west, Lincoln City’s high temperature was expected to reach 78 on Sunday – with Newport even cooler at 71. The power of the Pacific Ocean’s marine layer rarely allows temperatures over 90 degrees in coastal towns, said National Weather Service meteorologist Chris Burling. In fact, since records started being kept in 1890, Astoria has only recorded 10 days in June – and 55 days total – where the temperature reached 90 degrees or higher.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state budget that puts billions in federal coronavirus money into savings, boosts spending on education and provides aid to nursing homes easily passed the Legislature on Friday. Gov. Tom Wolf’s office said he plans to sign it this week. Supporters described it as a sensible approach that targets spending increases while setting aside a large contingency reserve for when federal stimulus ends in the coming years, but Democratic opponents decried what they saw as a missed opportunity to make significant economic and educational progress. “It is not the kind of practice we should do, to keep squirrelling away money while we go begging to get things done,” said Rep. Mike Sturla, D-Lancaster, who nonetheless supported the $39.8 billion general fund budget plan. The House vote was 140-61, with a handful of the chamber’s most conservative Republicans joining dozens of the more liberal Democrats in voting against it. The Senate vote was 43-7. It puts into savings about $5 billion in federal coronavirus relief money and boosts K-12 education state support by $300 million. It pumps $279 million into transportation infrastructure and directs $280 million to nursing homes and similar facilities, both drawing from the federal pandemic money.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Lawmakers have passed legislation that requires all public schools to provide feminine hygiene products at no cost to students. The legislation said that starting in the 2022-2023 academic year, schools teaching grades 5 through 12 shall make feminine hygiene products available in all gender-neutral and female bathrooms. “We all know how necessary feminine hygiene products are, but what many people do not realize, and I see this as a long-time educator, is that a lack of access to these products can cause students to miss crucial school days,” bill sponsor Sen. Valarie Lawson, a Democrat from East Providence, said in a statement. “These products are a daily necessity to so many students and just as schools provide toilet paper for the bathrooms, these products should also be readily accessible for our students in need.” State Rep. Carol Hagan McEntee, a Democrat from South Kingstown, was the House sponsor of the bill. “If soap and paper towels are available in bathrooms, so should feminine hygiene products, it’s as simple as that,” she said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A significant reduction in the number of southern flounder has led lawmakers to reduce the number of the fish that can be caught per day. The new rules go into effect Thursday and limit one person to five flounder per day or a boat to 10 per day, according to the state Department of Natural Resources. The previous limits were twice as many flounder. The new rules also increase the minimum size to keep a flounder to 16 inches, up an inch from the previous rule. The new limits were needed after studies showed the number of southern flounder in the ocean off the southeast coast were at historically low levels and the size of the average fish also declined, wildlife officials said. The same law that changes flounder regulations is also increasing saltwater fishing license fees for the first time in two decades. South Carolina residents will pay $15 a year, up from $10, and some of the extra money will go to a new flounder stocking program, the DNR said in a statement.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nFlandreau:The state’s first medical marijuana dispensary is set to open in Flandreau. The Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe said it will open its first retail location and begin selling cannabis Thursday, the day medical marijuana becomes legal in South Dakota. The tribe said it’s already accepting applications for medical marijuana ID cards, the Sioux Falls Argus Leader reported. The tribe’s program is independent of South Dakota’s new law and the system that the South Dakota Department of Health has until October to launch. The state is also awaiting a Supreme Court decision on whether recreational marijuana will become legal under a constitutional amendment approved by voters in November. The Native Nations Cannabis Dispensary is about 45 miles north of Sioux Falls. To qualify through the tribe, an applicant must first be certified by a medical professional to have “a chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition.” Patients who might benefit from cannabis – such as those with AIDS, anorexia, arthritis, cancer, migraines and glaucoma – are eligible with a recommendation from anyone licensed to prescribe drugs. Applications are on the tribe’s website. The fee is $50.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The University of Tennessee system’s board has voted in favor of buying Martin Methodist College to set up a fifth campus, naming it UT Southern. According to a university news release, the vote at a meeting in Memphis means UT Southern in Pulaski will be the first new University of Tennessee campus in more than a half-century. The campus is about 75 miles southwest of Nashville, closer to the Alabama border. The board also voted to make Martin Methodist President Mark La Branche the first chancellor of the new campus. The changeover is effective July 1. The state budget that kicks in July 1 includes $6.1 million for the acquisition, which has been in the works for months. The university system will now have campuses in Knoxville, Chattanooga, Martin, Memphis and Pulaski.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: State Democratic lawmakers who blocked one of America’s most restrictive voting measures with a dramatic walkout sued Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday after he vetoed funds that cover thousands of Capitol paychecks that he said shouldn’t be given “to those who quit their job early.” The lawsuit reflects the tensions that remain in Texas more than a month after Democrats’ last-ditch revolt over the Memorial Day weekend, and more fights are ahead. Abbott has ordered lawmakers back on the job for a special session starting July 8, when Republicans are expected to embark on a second try at passing new voting laws. Going straight to the Texas Supreme Court, Democrats called the veto an unconstitutional power grab. Abbott has indicated he will give lawmakers the chance to reinstate the money once they return for the special session. The veto of more than $400 million in funds didn’t just punish Democrats: paychecks for the offices of Republican legislators are also impacted, as well as nonpartisan support staff across the Capitol. Democratic state Rep. Chris Turner put the number of affected jobs in the legislative branch at more than 2,000. Abbott spokeswoman Renae Eze responded to the lawsuit with a statement defending the governor’s veto power and called Democrats’ claims misleading. “This is not the first time, and undoubtedly will not be the last time, that a governor vetoes funding for government positions and salaries,” she said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City:The National Park Conservation Association, a nonprofit advocacy group based in Salt Lake City, released a data analysis Thursday showing there are more than 160 abandoned oil wells near Utah national parks. The NPCA, in conjunction with nonprofit FracTracker Alliance, compiled a dataset of untraceable abandoned wells that require rehabilitation or clean-up and found there were 163 sites within 30 miles of Utah national parks. By their definition, orphaned wells are \"disused and abandoned facilities where the original owner is insolvent or there is no owner of record,\" according to an NPCA release. These abandoned wells, if not properly taken care of, can leak methane into the air and groundwater and cause dangerous health risks, the release said. Of the wells, 142 are near the Navajo Nation in southeast Utah, the data showed. Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, containing Lake Powell, has 13 wells.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife’s annual turkey brood survey is expanding this year. In years past, the survey took place in August. Starting Thursday, people who see a flock of turkeys in Vermont are asked to go to the turkey brood survey on the department website and report where and when the turkeys were seen, along with the number of adult and young turkeys, or poults. The survey will run through the end of August. “Information gathered from this survey helps us monitor long-term trends in the productivity of Vermont’s wild turkey population,” said Vermont wild turkey biologist Chris Bernier. “It also helps us assess the impacts of spring weather on the survival of poults and adult turkeys which is an important consideration in the management of turkeys.” Vermont is changing from an August-only survey to a July and August survey to bring the survey into compliance with the way they are done regionally. “One of the biggest benefits of this survey is being able to compare productivity trends across turkey range and the only way we can do this effectively is if all the Northeast states collect these data in the same way,” Bernier said.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: The Air Force is permanently moving its its F-22 fighter jet training operation from Florida to Virginia, officials said. The F-22 training squadron will be based at Joint Base Langley-Eustis in Hampton. The squadron originally was located at Tyndall Air Force Base near Panama City, Florida, before Hurricane Michael heavily damaged the base in October 2018. It has been temporarily located at Eglin Air Force Base in Okaloosa County, Florida. The Daily Press reported that the unit has 31 F-22 fighters and 16 T-38 training aircraft. Bruce Sturk, Hampton’s director of federal facilities support, estimated the squadron’s move will bring a total of 2,100 to 2,200 people to the region. The Air Force has said the arrival of the training unit would more than double the annual number of F-22 flights from Langley’s airfield, from more than 22,000 to nearly 50,000.\n\nWashington\n\nLongview: After a major electrical failure at the Longview Westlake Chemical company plant earlier this month caused chlorine shortages across the West Coast, a local business stepped in to help replace the part and get the plant back online. NORPAC gave the plant a spare transformer and production restarted last Wednesday, The Daily News reported. Earlier this month, a piece of equipment experienced a failure with an electrical transformer and had to be sent off-site to be repaired. Plant officials originally estimated the plant would be offline until the end of June at a minimum. “Westlake Chemical’s Longview, Washington, plant successfully installed a replacement electrical transformer and completed its testing earlier this week, which permitted the restart of the facility,” a statement from Westlake said. The plant manufactures chlorine and caustic soda. The Longview facility was purchased by Westlake Chemical in 2016 with its acquisition of Axiall Corp. Chlorination is crucial in the water treatment process that disinfects and kills bacteria, viruses and other microbes, and multiple cities asked residents last week to conserve water until the shortage was resolved. Westlake said in a statement it will be letting customers know when they will get chlorine deliveries.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Dozens of volunteers formed the letters “HIV SOS” at a health event Saturday as activists seek a public health emergency declaration in a city with one of the nation’s highest spikes of such cases. Kanawha County, which includes Charleston and has 178,000 residents, had two intravenous drug-related HIV cases in 2018. The number grew to 15 in 2019 and 39 last year, according to state data. There have been 14 such cases so far in 2021. After volunteers wearing red T-shirts formed the plea for help along the Kanawha River near downtown Charleston, Joe Solomon, co-founder of the nonprofit group Solutions Oriented Addiction Response, called on the City Council and Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin to act on the HIV crisis and overdoses from prescription pain pills. “In Charleston and Kanawha County, there’s a family butchered by the overdose crisis every other day,” Solomon said. “All we’re asking is for (them) to take one day to declare a public health emergency. We need to treat this like the emergency that it is.” Earlier this year, Dr. Demetre Daskalakis, the chief of HIV prevention at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called Kanawha County’s outbreak “the most concerning in the United States.” He warned it could take years to address the surge and that the case count possibly “represents the tip of the iceberg.” Earlier this week the CDC presented preliminary findings of an investigation that showed emergency departments and inpatient medical personnel in Kanawha County rarely conducted HIV testing on intravenous drug users.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWeyauwega: The Weyauwega Star Dairy unofficially broke the record it held for the world’s longest piece of string cheese at 3,832 feet, WLUK-TV reported. Gerard Knaus’ 85-year-old father, Jim, set the record in 1995. The Knauses beat their 1995 record in 2006 with a piece about 2,000 feet long. “We’re just adding onto his record,” Gerard Knaus told the station. “That’s all we’re doing.” To do that, the cheesemakers needed a good slice of Weyauwega’s more than 1,700 residents. Standing 7 feet apart, on a shutdown Main Street, residents of the northeastern Wisconsin town grabbed a piece of the potential record as it was uncoiled from a trailer pulled by a tractor Thursday. “I’ve never seen this before and I want my piece of string cheese,” said Allen Robbert, who lives about 10 miles away. The cheese was strung from person-to-person for about three blocks and then doubled back the way it came. After about 90 minutes, the record was broken with a nearly three-quarter-mile-long piece of string cheese. The dairy said the record probably equaled about 30,000 individual sticks. Participants got to keep the long pieces. Gerard Knaus said Guinness World Records recognized the 2006 record and he hopes it will this time, too.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A utility proposes to build six wind farms that could supply enough electricity for more than 1 million homes by 2024. Portland, Oregon-based PacifiCorp, whose subsidiary Rocky Mountain Power serves Wyoming, Utah and Idaho, announced the plan. The wind farms would add more than 1,600 megawatts of power capacity in Wyoming. Combined with PacifiCorp’s plans for solar, battery power and transmission proposals, the utility would add 3,200 megawatts of capacity in four states. PacifiCorp hasn’t announced where specifically the projects would be built. The proposals would concentrate wind development in Wyoming and Idaho, and solar development, including battery storage, in Utah and Oregon, the Casper Star-Tribune reported. It would be the utility’s first large-scale battery installation. PacifiCorp’s latest round of renewable development began in 2019, when the company’s biannual economic analysis identified renewables as a highly cost-effective electricity source.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/12/23/million-dome-home-owl-surprise-christmas-guest-cold-sea-turtles-red-snapper-news-around-states/40876827/", "title": "50 States roundup", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nCullman: Money raised by an 11-year-old girl to help a north Alabama animal shelter is being used to fund animal adoptions as an early Christmas treat. The Cullman Times reported that sixth-grader Denna Chivers has been helping the Cullman County Animal Shelter for three years by holding yard sales and giving the proceeds to the operation. The girl’s mother, BethAnn, said she raised $400 one year and $1,400 the next. She raised $3,000 this year, which was used to purchase some equipment. The shelter decided to use the remainder of the money to offer free adoptions to people looking for a pet. A shelter worker said the offer started Thursday. Denna said she loves all animals, but dogs and cats are her favorite.\n\nAlaska\n\nSitka: The Sitka Planning Commission got its first look Wednesday at how city code could be amended to make room for tiny houses, specifically those on chassis allowing the structures to be moved. At Wednesday’s meeting, the commission voted 3-2 to direct special projects manager Scott Brylinsky to continue developing proposals on changing parts of the general code to define tiny houses and tiny houses on chassis. The idea is to allow them in mobile home parks and manufactured home parks. Brylinksy was hired to work on an action plan for tiny homes, among other projects. The informal action plan was proposed by the Sitka Assembly last year. The plan directed the Planning Commission review zoning codes to see which ones could be changed to enable tiny homes as a potential affordable housing option. Acting Chairman Darrell Windsor said he would like the full commission present before making recommendations for changes related to tiny homes.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Democratic U.S. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona has introduced a bill that would ban new mining claims around the Grand Canyon. The Obama administration put about 1,562 square miles outside the boundaries of Grand Canyon National Park off-limits to new hard rock mining claims until 2032. The bill would make that permanent. Environmentalists and Native American tribes applauded Sinema’s introduction of the bill Thursday. They say mining in the Grand Canyon region, particularly for uranium, could contaminate a water source that serves millions of people. The bill isn’t expected to have an easy ride in the Senate, which is controlled by Republicans who have opposed the effort. The House passed a similar bill introduced by Arizona Democratic Rep. Raul Grijalva earlier this year. Meanwhile, the mining industry has been pushing President Donald Trump to boost demand for domestic supplies of uranium, tax breaks and other financial incentives.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The Republican president pro tem of Arkansas’ Senate said Friday he won’t seek another term leading that chamber next year. Sen. Jim Hendren said he won’t run for another two-year term as the chamber’s president when senators meet at the end of next year’s fiscal session to select a new leader. Hendren’s term as Senate president runs through the end of 2020. Hendren said he’s still seeking re-election to the Senate next year. Hendren said he plans to decide after next year’s session whether to seek the Republican nomination for governor in 2022. Hendren said he didn’t want to serve as the chamber’s leader and run a statewide campaign if he does jump in the governor’s race. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is Hendren’s uncle, is barred by term limits from seeking re-election in 2022. Lt. Gov. Tim Griffin has said he’s seeking the GOP nomination. Other potential GOP candidates for governor include former White House press secretary Sarah Sanders and Attorney General Leslie Rutledge.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: At least three unoccupied passenger buses caught fire Saturday night at Los Angeles International Airport, the Los Angeles Fire Department said. Shortly after 9 p.m., LAX Airport said on its Twitter account that “there is a significant fire emergency at the LAX-it lot. Emergency responders are on scene. More to come. No immediate reports of injuries.” KTLA and the CBS station in Los Angeles tweeted photos of the fire spewing smoke. At about 10 p.m., the airport said that the fire had been put out, and there were no injuries. The lot reopened, and ride-share services resumed.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:Michelle Lindsay, a Zumba instructor and registered dental hygienist from Fort Collins, became the country’s first avalanche death of the season on Dec. 8. On her first run down the South Diamond Peak face, Lindsay was engulfed by an avalanche in a narrow gully. Despite efforts to save the 29-year-old, she died from asphyxiation after being buried. The Colorado Avalanche Information Center released its full report on the avalanche Thursday, which included details from interviews with Lindsay’s companion, a male who was not named in the report. According to the report, Lindsay was 150 feet below her companion, about 11,200 feet in elevation, when she triggered an avalanche midslope. Her partner watched the avalanche unfold around her but noted that it did not look very deep, maybe only up to the top of her boots. He continued to see Lindsay in the avalanche, but the visibility was poor and she disappeared into the white cloud.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Department of Consumer Protection reminded residents that package stores must be closed on Christmas Day and on New Years Day, under state law. Connecticut law also requires bars to be closed by 3 a.m. on the morning of New Years Day. Consumer Protection Commissioner Michelle Seagull said her office encourages those who choose to drink alcohol “to make responsible decisions.” She reminded the public they must be over age 21 to make alcohol purchases. Connecticut lawmakers this year passed legislation updating the state’s liquor laws, in hopes of helping the state’s growing craft brewery industry. One change, which has taken effect, allows breweries to sell more beer to customers for consumption off-premises. The prior law limited craft breweries to selling only up to nine liters to a single individual within one day.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state has confirmed that 26 school-aged children have been infected through a salmonella outbreak that is potentially linked to recalled fruit. The state’s health department said in a statement Friday that evidence indicated that the fruit potentially came from a company in New Jersey. The firm had recently recalled some fruit mix, as well as cut honeydew, cut cantaloupe and cut pineapple. The fruit was distributed in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and Delaware. It was sold for use in institutional food service establishments such as schools. The children who were infected with the bacteria in Delaware were in New Castle County. Officials said there is no ongoing risk to any students. The children affected are between the ages of 4 and 17. Salmonella are a group of bacteria that can cause gastrointestinal illness and fever. Most people develop diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. But some people might need to be hospitalized.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:The Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture has extended its hours from 10 a.m. to 7:30 p.m. starting Dec. 26, and patrons won't need a pass to enter, WUSA-TV reported. The no-pass entry will go through Dec. 30. After those dates, the museum will resume back to its regular schedule. Groups of 10 or more are still required to get passes to enter the museum. Since opening three years ago, more than 6 million people have visited the museum, the largest cultural destination showcasing the African American story and its impact on American and world history.\n\nFlorida\n\nYeehaw Junction: A semi-truck plowed into a historic inn south of Orlando early Sunday, causing major damage but no apparent injuries. The truck ran through the wall of the Desert Inn and a portion of the building collapsed around it. Lisa Mason, who ran the inn before it closed last year, confirmed the crash but said she didn’t know any details. She said she doesn’t believe anyone was injured. The Florida Highway Patrol did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment. The inn is the centerpiece of Yeehaw Junction, a tiny respite off Florida’s Turnpike between South Florida and Orlando. According to a 2013 article in the Orlando Sentinel, the Desert Inn dates to 1889 when it was a barroom and brothel for cowboys and lumberjacks, and the look of the place hadn’t evolved much since. Through the years, the Desert Inn has been a trading post, gas station and dance hall. Until its closure, it served as a motel, restaurant and convenience store. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A family got a real hoot from its Christmas tree: More than a week after they bought it, they discovered an owl nestled among its branches. Katie McBride Newman said Friday that she and her daughter spotted the bird on Dec. 12. They had bought the 10-foot-tall tree from a Home Depot, brought it back to their Atlanta-area home and decorated it with lights and, coincidentally, owl ornaments. “It was surreal, but we weren’t really freaked out about it,” McBride Newman said. “We’re really outdoorsy people. We love the wilderness.” The family opened windows and doors near the tree hoping the owl would fly away, but it didn’t. So the family called a nonprofit nature center for help. The Chattahoochee Nature Center caught the bird and helped the family release it. McBride Newman said she believed the bird had been in the tree since they bought it but was hidden.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An illegal fishing net discovered in Oahu’s Kaneohe Bay was so large that a forklift was needed to move it, state officials said. The state Department of Land and Natural Resources said the net was found by two boaters last week, Hawaii Public Radio reported Thursday. The boaters discovered the net after their craft became entangled. They said that after they pulled the net out of the bay, the apparent owners chased them to retrieve the equipment. The boaters returned to the harbor and their pursuers fled, they said. State officials were not able to immediately measure the net, but the boaters said their measurement found 500 yards of netting. Rules adopted in 2007 to govern the use of gill nets left floating on top of the water to trap fish can be no longer than 125 feet. Lay nets are banned within 3 miles of the Oahu shoreline and in specific areas of the island including Kaneohe Bay, where the net was found, officials said. Maui has banned lay nets, which a land and natural resources department official said is the most regulated form of gill net fishing. A $5,000 fine can be levied for a first offense of catching threatened or endangered wildlife in the nets, with additional fines for each threatened or endangered wildlife taken, harmed or killed. A first-offense fine for illegal lay net fishing can cost up to $1,000.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Idaho Public Utilities Commission has rejected a proposal that would have slashed the incentive for the power generated from solar panels. The proposal to change net metering would have changed how much Idaho Power customers with solar panels can be reimbursed for the energy they harness that goes back into the power grid. The proposed settlement between Idaho Power, the Sierra Club, the city of Boise, Idaho Clean Energy Association, Idaho Irrigation Pumpers Association and others would have cut the rate from almost 10 cents per kilowatt produced to somewhere around 4.4 cents per kilowatt hour over the course of about 10 years. The PUC on Friday rejected that settlement, saying the public wasn’t adequately notified about the significant changes. The commission instead directed Idaho Power to conduct a cost-benefit analysis on the solar panel program while also voting to permanently grandfather in the 4,000 existing Idaho Power customers so that their rates will not change.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Metra is buying hundreds of new rail cars and wants passengers to weigh in on what amenities they would like to see in them, from cup holders to power outlets, tray tables or wifi. The suburban Chicago commuter rail agency expects to spend almost $1.2billion over the next five years to buy and rehabilitate rail cars and locomotives. The funding comes from a capital bill Illinois lawmakers approved this year. Metra issued a request for proposals earlier this year for at least 200 new rail cars, with options for up to 300 more. Manufacturers were encouraged to submit proposals that increase capacity and optimize amenities. Now the agency is asking commuters to complete a survey about which amenities are most important to them. Options include tray tables and power, as well as head rests, interior and exterior information signs or lights that can be dimmed. Metra said it can’t guarantee everything commuters want will be incorporated into the new cars but said it will try to get the most amenities possible. The survey is available at metrarail.com through mid-January.\n\nIndiana\n\nTerre Haute: Unusually large flocks of seagulls have descended on a western Indiana city, bringing the sounds of the beach to a local reservoir where the birds began gathering in late November. Residents near Hulman Lake on Terre Haute’s east side have seen hundreds of ring-billed seagulls in the skies over the reservoir since the birds began flocking around Thanksgiving. Peter Scott, a retired Indiana State University ecology professor who directs an annual Christmas Bird Count around Terre Haute, estimated that between 400 and 1,000 of the birds have congregated at the lake.He said ring-billed gulls aren’t uncommon in Indiana, but they prefer to winter around larger bodies of water like southern Indiana’s Lake Monroe. Scott said their appearance in large numbers at Hulman Lake is rare. Scott said the birds are most likely feeding on small fish in the lake. The Cornell University Lab of Ornithology described ring-billed seagulls as sociable creatures that feed together at coastal beaches but often head inland during winter to forage at golf courses, farm fields and garbage dumps.\n\nIowa\n\nDuncombe: After more than a century, a barn near this northern Iowa community is getting a new home and a new look. Matt and Libby Mitchell acquired the barn built in 1915 and watched nervously Thursday as it was moved about a mile over fields to a new location. Matt Mitchell prepared a path over fields by driving a blade over the land, smoothing out ruts. He now plans to restore the barn. Mitchell has restored two other barns and knows he’s in for a long process. Still, he said the structure is worth the restoration work. The Iowa Barn Foundation covered about half the moving expenses. The job was handled by Vote House Moving of Bradgate, in Humboldt County. Once the barn is restored to its original appearance, Libby Mitchell said she has plans for it. “We’ll put some cows and pigs in it,” she said.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The Lawrence library is joining a growing number of libraries that are dropping fines for overdue books. The library’s board voted unanimously Tuesday to make the change, The Lawrence Journal-World reported. Library patrons still will be charged for lost or damaged items. Patrons also would be blocked from checking out additional books and materials once an item became two weeks overdue, but the return of the overdue item would immediately restore access. Among those expressing concerns was Michael Austin, who said the change could result in people keeping books for long periods of time, ultimately reducing access to those materials for everyone else. But Brad Allen, the library’s executive director, said eliminating overdue fines is in line with the stance of the American Library Association that library policies should not disadvantage low-income people. The ALA officially came out against charging fines earlier this year, citing concerns that fines create barriers to library materials and services.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Deeply affected by a Courier Journal series in August on child abuse and neglect, members of Christ Church United Methodist are collecting and displaying prayers on behalf of abused children in Kentucky, which has the highest rate of child maltreatment in the nation. Church member Bill Cooper, a retired lawyer who is active in social justice work at Christ Church, is working with others at the church, including Shelah Woodruff, director of outreach, and the Rev. Leanne Hadley, the children’s and youth minister. They came up with an idea: collect 1,000 prayers during the four-week Advent season before Christmas and display them. Christ Church also created a display that is open to the public with information about child abuse, how to report it, Kentucky’s sobering statistics and suggestions on how people can volunteer or get involved in efforts to fight the problem. People who view the display are invited to fill out a prayer card.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Louisiana’s recreational red snapper season likely will continue through 11:59 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. Surveys indicate that 98% of the state’s quota had been caught as of Dec. 8, with about 16,100 pounds remaining, according to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries. If that’s all that is caught before Dec. 31, the season will end earlier. Louisiana’s recreational season opened May 24 and was weekends-only for most of the year. But in early November, Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Jack Montoucet expanded it to all week, starting on Thanksgiving. At the time, 27,582 pounds were left in the quota. The popular sport and table fish is still recovering from nearly disastrous overfishing. Red snapper has been a hot issue in the Gulf of Mexico, with seasons getting shorter and shorter as fish got larger and more numerous. In 2017, the Trump administration extended a three-day season to 42 days, even though regulators said the extension could add up to six years to the time required for red snapper stocks to recover. Regulators agreed in 2018 on a two-year pilot program under which each state sets dates for and keeps tabs on the recreational red snapper catch in federal waters off its coast. If approved by the U.S. commerce secretary, this would become official policy. In April, the group that manages Gulf of Mexico fishing in federal waters said states can continue managing anglers’ catch of red snapper after this year.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: A mapping and engineering company is donating about a million aerial images of New England to a University of Maine library. The university said Raymond H. Fogler Library has received 3,000 rolls of film from the James W. Sewall Co. of Old Town. The collection is made up of original aerial photography of Maine and other New England states, and it spans more than six decades. The archive of images will allow researchers and members of the public access to “a vast collection that details changes to Maine’s landscape over the past century,” the university said in a statement. The collection will be especially useful for forestry research, said Daniel Hayes, assistant professor in the university’s School of Forestry Resources.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Salvation Army leaders said a donor recently dropped thousands of dollars worth of jewelry in a red kettle. Capt. Ryan Vincent is commander of the Salvation Army in Annapolis. He told the Capital Gazette that everyone was shocked to find out the ring and two bracelets were real. One of the bracelets, a yellow-gold piece by Tiffany & Co., has been sold for $1,500. A gemologist will soon examine the ring and second bracelet that features diamonds and rubies to determine their value. Pearl Eldridge is the ringer who collected the donation. She called the donor a “quiet spirit,” and said the woman told her the pieces were sentimental but had been laying around. Other unusual donations have been reported in Salvation Army kettles across the country, including a gold bar in Kentucky and a more than century-old gold coin in North Carolina. Vincent said the Salvation Army has a policy for dealing with jewelry donations. Pieces found in a kettle are kept for 30 days, but if someone acknowledges leaving a piece with the bell ringer, it’s immediately considered donated. If big donations are found to be stolen, the charitable organization arranges them to be returned.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is using money it received from a nationwide settlement with Volkswagen to help electrify the state’s transportation sector and reduce air pollution. The state has designated a total of $7.5million toward 98 projects, including the purchase of electric cars, diesel-hybrid electric waste collection trucks, liquid-propane-gas school buses, cleaner-diesel trucks and ferry engines, and a marine shore-power installation. The money for the grant program comes from a settlement with Volkswagen over the company’s illegal tampering of vehicle emission control equipment. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said the money will be used on projects to put 32 heavy-duty vehicles, eight medium-duty vehicles, 17 buses, two marine engines, 35 pieces of airport ground-support equipment and three pieces of cargo-handling equipment into operation and install one new marine shore-power site. The new equipment will replace pre-2010 diesel counterparts. Baker said three-quarters of the funding will go towards areas where there are high populations of minority, low-income, or low English proficiency residents\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing:A nonprofit distributed nearly 50 bicycles to children after a dozen volunteers spent several weeks cleaning and repairing them. The Lansing Bike Co-op staged the giveaway last weekend, offering the 49 used bikes to anyone on a first-come, first-served basis, the Lansing State Journal reported. There were no rules or requirements, but the co-op teaches cyclists, many financially struggling, how to keep their rides in good working order. Every bike came with a red, green or blue helmet. Among those claiming bikes was Ciera Bonilla, who secured two for her daughter, 6, and son, 3. She said her son has autism and she hopes his first two-wheeler will help him gain independence and physical skills. Co-op President Aaron Fields said he believes a bike is “an essential part of childhood.” The organization launched in 2015 and is raising money to pay the mortgage for the east-side property it bought in July.\n\nMinnesota\n\nProsper: Authorities said four people were injured, including one critically, in separate vehicle crashes involving horses on the same southeastern Minnesota highway. The crashes happened within an hour of each other Friday night on state highway 44, the Star Tribune reported. The State Patrol said a 12-year-old boy was critically injured when a car struck a horse and buggy carrying the boy and five others. It happened about 7 p.m. just outside Prosper, on the Iowa border. The boy was airlifted to a hospital in La Crosse, Wisconsin. Two others on the buggy suffered nonlife-threatening injuries. The driver of the car and his passenger were not injured. About 45 minutes later, a pickup truck hit a horse that was loose on the highway about 13 miles east of the first crash. The driver was taken to a hospital with noncritical injuries.\n\nMississippi\n\nColumbus: Teachers and staff at two northern Mississippi schools are receiving more than $370,000 in bonuses because their schools have improved under a state grading system. Columbus Municipal School District trustees voted in 2018 to adopt a Teacher Incentive Pay Plan to provide bonuses for faculty and staff members of improving and high-performing schools. The plan also includes bonus incentives for math and science teachers. The first checks arrived this month, and the Commercial Dispatch reported that a celebration was held Tuesday at an elementary school. Superintendent Cherie Labat credited the trustees for showing employees how much their achievements are valued. Stokes-Beard Elementary School and Columbus High School improved this year in accountability ratings from the state Department of Education. Faculty and staff members at the schools received a combined $181,354. The district’s 54 math and science teachers, 15 of whom are new hires, received $189,000 total. The Columbus district has maintained a D overall rating for the last two years. However, during the 2018-19 school year, Columbus High improved from a C to a B, and Stokes-Beard jumped from an F to a B.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Mayor Lyda Krewson is pulling the plug on an airport privatization effort because of a lack of support. Krewson said Friday she’s determined that there is “very little support for moving forward with a private operator” for St. Louis Lambert International Airport after listening to members of the public, business leaders and other political leaders. She said she is sending a letter to members of the Airport Advisory Working Group, asking that her representative, Linda Martinez, not support or vote to move forward with issuing a request for proposals, St. Louis Public Radio reported. Krewson has been in favor of exploring the process to see if it could result in a good deal for the city – canceling nearly $600million in airport debt and bringing in up to $2billion in net proceeds.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A natural gas leak caused an explosion at an apartment complex that sent two people to the hospital with severe burns, officials said Saturday. Billings Deputy Fire Marshal Jeff McCullough said the explosion at about 9:45p.m. Friday caused an estimated $250,000 in damages. The Battleship Apartments building was cleared of residents, and an adult male and adult female were taken to a hospital. Residents of the building told The Billings Gazette that the blast sent glass from a door shooting into the road and that it sounded like a tree hitting the roof. Montana-Dakota Utilities was called to turn off gas to the building.\n\nNebraska\n\nColumbus: Consumers who get electricity from the Loup Public Power District in eastern Nebraska won’t see an increase in their electricity rates this year. The Columbus-based power district said the rates will hold steady for the third year in a row because of the district’s financial performance this year and its budget and expenses, according to the Columbus Telegram. District CEO Neal Suess said the company’s internal costs generally determine whether customer rates get raised. Jim Donoghue, chairman of Loup’s Rates Committee, said in a statement that company representatives have been working to make sure that customer’s rates do not increase next year.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Washoe County Roads has begun posting a snowplow monitoring system featuring an interactive map showing where trucks are operating in Incline Village and Crystal Bay in nearly real-time. County Community Services Operations chief Eric Crump said one of the most frequent questions officials get from the public is, “Where are the plows?” He said that by equipping trucks with automated vehicle locator technology, people can see for themselves which areas have recently been plowed. Officials said they hope they will be able to expand the “Where’s My Plow?” interactive map to other snowy high-elevation areas near Reno.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPlaistow: Firefighters said they got to work when a woman arrived in the lobby and announced she was having a baby. Firefighters told WMUR-TV that the woman was put on a stretcher, and the fire station training room became a delivery room Friday night. Seven minutes later, a baby boy was born. Firefighter and EMT Derek Travers said the episode was his first “field birth” in 23 years. “It meant a lot to me to see the beginning of life, not the end of life that we see a lot of times,” he said. Firefighters said they’re happy everything went smoothly. An ambulance transported mother and baby to a hospital.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Two Florida companies failed to comply with subpoenas to turn over records to New Jersey regarding the sale of outlawed large-capacity gun magazines, Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said Friday in a suit against the firms. Elite Aluminum, of Holly Hill, Florida, and 22Mods4All, of Longwood, Florida, refused to turn over documents showing information about large-capacity magazine sales into the state, Grewal said in a statement. Messages seeking comment have been left with both companies. New Jersey sent both firms cease-and-desist letters earlier this year after they sold the outlawed magazines to an undercover state investigator, said Grewal, a Democrat. The firms complied, but then failed to hand over more information about earlier sales despite subpoenas. New Jersey law caps magazines at 10 rounds, down from 15 before 2018, when Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed legislation limiting magazine size. The suits were filed in state Superior Court in Essex County.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico said people shouldn’t expect any major administrative changes with White Sands National Monument becoming the state’s first national park since 1930. But he cited a study that said the park could see an increase of 100,000 visitors annually with the change in status. Heinrich told the Albuquerque Journal that such an increase would be a boom for the local economies with an additional $7.5million in tourist spending in the area a year. He said national park status will open White Sands to more exposure from national travel and outdoors publications. Heinrich has also introduced legislation that would designate Bandelier National Monument in northern New Mexico a national park.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday he will push legislation banning gender-based price disparities for similar goods and services. Cuomo, a Democrat, cited research that indicated women often end up with a larger bill for items like toys, clothing and personal care products. The proposal, rolled out as part of Cuomo’s State of the State agenda, would require certain service providers to post price lists for standard services. Businesses that don’t comply could be hit with civil penalties. A 2015 study by the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs found that 42% of the products targeted at women were more expensive than those marketed to men. Products aimed at women cost an average of 7% more than similar items for men and personal care products for women were priced 13% higher than men’s products, according to the study. In 2016, New York banned taxes on menstrual products and last year enacted laws mandating equal pay and barring companies from asking about salary history.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nManteo: Cold weather is causing a problem for some sea turtles off the North Carolina coast, and an aquarium has taken in dozens of them for treatment. WVEC-TV reported that 96 turtles were taken to the North Carolina Aquarium on Roanoke Island after a drop in temperatures on Thursday and Friday. More are expected to be treated there in the coming days. Dropping water temperatures can cause cold-stunning, a condition similar to hypothermia that makes turtles unable to swim properly. The recovery process involves gradually warming the turtles up over a few days. According to the TV station, the center will be closed to the public beginning Sunday to accommodate all the turtles.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Bismarck Park Board has voted to create a formal process for renaming city parks after some residents pushed to have a park stripped of its name because of the “historical trauma” they said is associated with its namesake, Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer. Rather than immediately change the name of Custer Park, the board voted Thursday to develop guidelines for renaming parks. A draft of those guidelines will be considered by the board in February. A member of the Three Affiliated Tribes, M. Angel Moniz, told the board that to some, Custer is a reminder of violence and genocide, according to the Bismarck Tribune. Custer served during the Civil War and fought against Native Americans on the Great Plains in the 1860s and 1870s. In 1868, he launched an attack on Chief Black Kettle’s Southern Cheyenne Village near present-day Cheyenne, Oklahoma, in which Native American women were raped and killed in an assault known as the Washita Massacre. Custer spent several years stationed at Fort Abraham Lincoln in Mandan before his death.\n\nOhio\n\nAthens: The Ohio school district where Heisman Trophy winner Joe Burrow played football has named its high school stadium in his honor. The Athens City School District Board of Education in southeast Ohio posted a proclamation about the naming this week on Facebook. The proclamation details Burrow’s accomplishments as quarterback for Athens High School, where he was named Ohio Mr. Football in 2014, and at Louisiana State University, where he’s the quarterback for the undefeated Tigers. LSU faces the University of Oklahoma on Dec. 28 in the semifinals of the College Football Playoff. Burrow endeared himself to many by discussing the poverty endemic to the Appalachian region where he grew up in his Heisman acceptance speech. His comments prompted a campaign that has raised more than $400,000 for the Athens County Food Bank, the Athens High School Boosters, the county’s Children’s Services agency and other nonprofits. The proclamation directs Athens school district officials to plan a ceremony in Burrow’s honor.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: Officials said a privately owned cemetery is blocking efforts to find the remains of black Tulsa residents killed nearly 100 years ago in a race riot. But an attorney for the cemetery said his client submitted a proposal in November that would allow the city to search under certain conditions. Mayor G.T. Bynum has insisted that the city would do everything it could to find possible mass graves with victims of one of the worst race-related massacres in U.S. history. The 1921 violence left as many as 300 dead on Tulsa’s Black Wall Street. Bynum said the city has been unable to investigate whether Rolling Oaks Cemetery in south Tulsa contains unmarked graves, the Tulsa World reported. However, Timothy Studebaker, a Tulsa attorney representing Rolling Oaks, said the cemetery is not opposed to scanning its grounds. Bynum said the city will look at possible legal action if an agreement can’t be reached.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Oregon is renowned for its craft beer and increasingly for its high-grade marijuana, but the state is keeping the two apart – for now. In a new ruling, the Oregon Liquor Control Commission, which regulates alcoholic products and recreational marijuana, said beer and other alcoholic drinks as of Jan. 1 cannot contain either THC, the psychoactive component of cannabis, or CBD, the nonpsychoactive part that is said to relieve stress and pain. Mark Pettinger, a spokesman for the agency, cited concerns raised by the U.S. Food and Drug of potential liver damage from CBD, also known as cannabidiol. One prominent CBD-infused beer, Two Flowers IPA, was popular in The EastBurn, a Portland pub, according to Michael Fritz, one of the owners. The website of the brewery that made the beer, Coalition Brewing of Portland, said the CBD’s “bitter grassiness augments the hop bitterness, while the citrusy terpenes in the CBD mirror the aromatics and hop flavors.” Coalition Brewing recently went out of business. Pettinger said he didn’t know of any other Oregon brewery that makes CBD-infused beer.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Businesses that manufacture frames that can be built into working firearms sued Pennsylvania’s attorney general on Friday, five days after he issued a legal opinion classifying the products as guns under state law. The Commonwealth Court lawsuit asks a state judge to stop the state police from implementing any new policy, including background checks, based on a legal opinion the agency received Monday from Democratic Attorney General Josh Shapiro. Shapiro told state police to treat unassembled “ghost guns,” gun frames also referred to as 80% receivers, as firearms. The plaintiffs said the opinion does not give fair notice to people regarding what is legal and what is not, said Joshua Prince, who filed the petition.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State lawmakers are unveiling bills they plan to pursue in the new legislative session that begins Jan. 7. Democratic Reps. June Speakman of Warren and Terri Cortvriend of Portsmouth said they will introduce legislation establishing a state-level process to set maximum contaminate levels for toxins, including a family of industrial chemicals turning up in public water supplies across the country. Democratic Sen. Leonidas Raptakis of Coventry said he will reintroduce legislation that stalled in past years to establish an inspector general’s office to identify fraud and waste in public spending. Raptakis will also again propose allowing voters to vote on a constitutional amendment to give the governor the power to veto parts of the state budget. Most states allow governors to strike individual budget items without having to veto an entire appropriations bill. Democratic Rep. Joseph Solomon of Warwick said Thursday he has prefiled legislation to cap the amount health insurance providers can charge for insulin co-pays. Solomon said he’s concerned about rising costs.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A unique, dome-shaped house on the South Carolina coast dubbed “Eye of the Storm,” has recently been sold for $4million. The Post and Courier reported that according to Charleston County land records, a firm called ITAC 433 LLC that lists a Chapel Hill address, bought the 3,384-square-foot house in early October. The distinctive house features a white shell that resembles a Storm Trooper helmet from the movie “Star Wars.” It was built in the early 1990s by Huiet and Helen Paul after their beachfront home was destroyed in 1989 by Hurricane Hugo. The house is made of concrete and steel and weighs 1.3million pounds. It includes an elevator, wet bar, skylight, an 889-square-foot deck and a bank vault room. The seller was a trust associated with the late couple. The property was marketed as hurricane-resistant because its design doesn’t have seams for strong winds to hook onto, the newspaper reported. The design is also intended to allow storm surge to pass through several openings on the lower level. The house’s unique architecture in comparison to the more antebellum homes often seen on the island attracts curious onlookers. But even at a $4million price tag, the dome house isn’t the most expensive to be sold on the island. Last summer a 5,000-square-foot, three-story house fetched $7.35million.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Tribes in South Dakota are trying again to gain state legislative support to repeal an archaic law that bans them from Minnesota. The State-Tribal Relations Committee voted this week to introduce a resolution during the 2020 legislative session requesting that Congress repeal the 1863 Dakota Removal Act. The law forced Native Americans onto South Dakota reservations following an 1862 conflict that included the mass hanging of 38 Dakota men. Minnesota passed a resolution supporting its repeal in 2009. The South Dakota Senate State Affairs Committee, without any discussion, failed to pass the same resolution during the 2019 session. Republican Rep. Tamara St. John, a historian for the Sisseton-Wahpeton Sioux Tribe, said she’s concerned that repealing it could impact legal precedents based on the act, specifically a lawsuit involving Mdewakanton Sioux members in Minnesota that has not been resolved.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee has landed a $5.3million federal grant that aims to address opioid misuse among expectant mothers and improve care for their affected children, the Division of TennCare announced Thursday. TennCare plans to partner with Vanderbilt University Medical Center to focus on the issue in 26 rural and urban counties. Tennessee is one of 10 states to receive the Maternal Opioid Misuse Model grant from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Tennessee’s initiative will focus on expectant mothers and their children beginning in pregnancy and extending to one year postpartum. The money covers a five-year performance period beginning in January. The program aims to get the women engaged in treatment before and after pregnancy, use therapies to maximize the time they aren’t using illicit substances, reduce infant hospital stays to keep them with their biological mothers as much as possible and connect to early intervention services for the children.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: Police said one woman was killed and another was injured after they were attacked by three pit bulls. Authorities said a man called 911 just before 6 a.m. Saturday to report that his wife had been attacked by dogs in a north Houston neighborhood. At the scene, police found the woman had been bitten multiple times. She was taken to a hospital and was expected to survive her injuries. Soon after arriving at the scene, police received another call, this one from the dogs’ owner. The owner reported his dogs had attacked a woman and her body was in a ditch in front of his home. The three dogs were taken away by authorities. Police said the case will be referred to the Harris County District Attorney’s Office to determine if any charges could be filed against the dogs’ owner.\n\nUtah\n\nHyrum: A northern Utah bank is dismantling and rebuilding a historic small-town grain elevator for its new “Scandinavian-modern” building in Hyrum. The tall wood structure, now weathered with age, was first built in 1918 by the Holley-Globe and Milling Company, the Herald Journal reported. It has been a fixture in the small town for a century, but soon it will get a new life: front and center into Cache Valley Bank’s new location. Workers began lifting sections of the structure with a crane this week. The bank wanted a building that was creative and embodied the town. Board member Peter Daines said his grandfather, a high school shop teacher and Hyrum native, informed their decision to incorporate the rustic appeal of the historic wood on the agricultural storage structure. Bank CEO George Daines remembered seeing the big tower when while visiting his grandparents as a child, though it wasn’t in operation even then. Visitors to the new bank building, though, will be able to reach the top through a spiral staircase. It will also have a new all-glass observation deck.\n\nVermont\n\nMonkton: A general in Monkton is going to close its doors by the end of the month. The Alderman family, which has managed the store for more than 12 years, said the costs of operating the business are “just too much,” MyNBC5 reported. The closing comes less than a year after the Aldermans announced they were struggling to pay back approximately $20,000 in delinquent state taxes. An online fundraising campaign brought in nearly $9,000 over the course of eight months. In a social media post, the Aldermans said they appreciated the community’s support and expressed their sadness in having to close.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State health officials are mounting an effort to identify people who might have recently been exposed to a person with measles. The Virginia Department of Health said in a news release Saturday that the person visited Richmond International Airport on Tuesday night and a doctor’s office in suburban Richmond on Thursday afternoon. The department posted detailed instructions online about what to do if you were at either of the locations during certain time frames. The directions depend on whether you have been vaccinated against measles. Based on the date of exposure, the health department said people infected could develop symptoms as late as Jan. 11. Measles is a highly contagious illness spread through coughing, sneezing and contact with droplets from the nose, mouth or throat of an infected person. Symptoms include a fever, runny nose, watery red eyes and a cough, followed by a rash that begins on the face and spreads all over the body.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Officials are warning about the Asian giant hornet, a new invasive species found in the state that can pack a powerful sting and be a threat to honeybees. The Washington State Department of Agriculture said the bug was found in early December in Blaine, near the Canadian border. The state’s agriculture and health officials are now warning people in the area to be on the lookout and avoid the hornets, which are typically 1.5 inches long with large yellow heads. The species is not usually interested in humans or animals but might sting if they or their ground nests are disturbed or threatened. The health department said humans should take preventative measures by covering food and garbage and also avoid swatting at the hornets. Winter is the dormant season for the bugs, which are more often seen from July through October.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nElkins: The U.S. Forest Service has halted a logging project in Monongahela National Forest to protect an endangered fish. The Center for Biological Diversity and Friends of Blackwater submitted objections in July to the project to protect the endangered candy darter. The Center for Biological Diversity said in a news release the project would likely have caused significant erosion and sent sediment into rivers and streams, threatening the rare fish. The candy darter was listed as endangered in November 2018.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:A judge has reinstated a felony count against a Milwaukee man who was living in an underground bunker that contained a stash of weapons, generator and various power tools. Geoffrey Graff, 41, was originally charged with two felonies after police discovered the bunker while investigating a report that he fired a shot into the nearby Milwaukee River. A court commissioner earlier this month dismissed one of the charges, for recklessly endangering safety. Milwaukee Circuit Judge David Borowski reinstated the charge on Thursday, the Journal Sentinel reported. Graff is facing a separate felony charge of possessing a short-barreled shotgun. Graff told authorities he had been using the bunker for at least seven years.\n\nWyoming\n\nSaratoga: The U.S. Forest Service has bought the last piece of private land within a wilderness area in central Wyoming. The 80-acre purchase in Carbon County will allow members of the public to roam the Huston Park Wilderness without the worry of crossing into private land, Forest Service officials said Friday. The land is located just north of Colorado-Wyoming state line and is part of the Medicine Bow National Forest in the Sierra Madre mountain range. Congress designated the 31,000-acre Huston Park Wilderness in 1984 and officials have since been seeking to buy up private lands inside its boundaries. The purchase price for the 80-acre parcel was not released. Officials said they worked with the Daley family and the Daley Basin Land Company to complete the deal.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/12/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/01/mister-rogers-civics-education-fishy-promotion-news-around-states/49308903/", "title": "Mister Rogers, civics education: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Republican-led committees in the Legislature advanced new congressional, legislative and school board districts Friday as lawmakers try to get new maps in place in time for the 2022 election. The House State Government Committee voted along party lines to approve new lines for the state’s seven congressional districts and 105 districts in the Alabama House of Representatives. Democrats, who voted against the plans, raised concerns that the proposed lines don’t reflect a state that has grown more diverse and would pack their supporters into a single congressional district. And while the plan passed with GOP support, several Republicans expressed concern that their legislative districts had been sacrificed for other party priorities. The maps, along with Alabama Senate and Board of Education districts, are in line for votes Monday by the full Alabama House of Representatives and Alabama Senate. Democrats have argued that Alabama, whose population is about 26% Black, should have a second congressional district with a significant African American or minority population. The seven-member delegation has for decades included a single African American, elected from the only district with a majority-Black population. The district is now represented by Rep. Terri Sewell, who’s also the only Democrat in Alabama’s congressional delegation.\n\nAlaska\n\nSoldotna: The city wants to create a new “main street” running parallel to the Kenai River. City officials on Thursday applied for a $360,000 federal grant that they hope would fund planning for the project that is also expected to boost capital investment in the area, the Peninsula Clarion reports. The planning project is estimated to take about 18 months and would help with efforts to design a new “main street” adjacent to the river. It would address about 85 acres of land running along the Kenai River, from Soldotna Creek Park to the Sterling Highway bridge. Many of the riverfront properties are privately owned, and development would require private and public partnerships. Currently, there is no road or trail that offers developed public access or views of the Kenai River between the highway bridge and state-owned land. Three dead-end roads stop short of the river. “Based on the number of no trespassing signs in many places the river today is more of an attractive nuisance than an asset,” city documents say. City officials informed City Council members that previous discussions with landowners indicated their support for collecting more information to determine the project’s feasibility. If approved, funding for the grant would come from the American Rescue Plan. Soldotna has already spent $90,000 of its own funds on the project.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Nearly five years after Joe Arpaio was voted out as sheriff of Maricopa County, taxpayers are covering one of the last major bills from the thousands of lawsuits the lawman’s headline-grabbing tactics inspired – and the overall legal tab has hit $100 million. County officials agreed last month to pay $3.1 million to cover the county’s portion of a settlement with a restaurant owner who alleged Arpaio defamed him and violated his rights when raiding his businesses. The payout boosted the cost stemming from Arpaio’s six terms to $100 million for attorney fees, settlements and other costs the county has paid from lawsuits over things such as jail deaths, failed investigations of the sheriff’s political enemies and immigration raids of businesses. That doesn’t include the separate $178 million and counting taxpayers have shelled out in a 2007 racial profiling case stemming from Arpaio’s signature traffic patrols targeting immigrants, though about 75% of that spending has occurred during his successor’s watch as he works to comply with court-ordered overhauls of the sheriff’s office. Advocates for immigrants have long warned Arpaio should be viewed as a cautionary tale for the long-term financial obligations communities take on when they let local police officers handle immigration enforcement.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: A special election will be called to fill the term of Republican state Sen. Lance Eads, who resigned from his position Thursday to take a job in the private sector. Eads, who won reelection last year to a four-year term, represented a district in northwest Arkansas that includes Springdale and parts of eastern Washington County. He said he was resigning to take a consultant job with the Little Rock-based lobbying firm Capitol Consulting Firm. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports Eads will remain a resident of northwest Arkansas. Eads served two years in the House of Representatives before first winning election to the Senate in 2016. Gov. Asa Hutchinson must call a special election to fill the vacancy in the Senate. “Sen. Lance Eads has served his community well,” Hutchinson said Thursday. “He has been a good partner in the successes we have achieved in Arkansas from economic development to lowering taxes.”\n\nCalifornia\n\nNewport Beach: Four weeks after an oil spill washed blobs of crude onto Southern California’s coast, surfers have returned to the waves, and people play in the surf. But fishermen still can’t drop lines in the same waters. California has prohibited fishing in an area that ranges about 6 to 12 miles off the shores of Orange County since an undersea pipeline leaked at least about 25,000 gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean. State environmental health experts are conducting studies to determine whether shellfish and fish are safe for human consumption – a process expected to take weeks or longer. Scott Breneman, owner of West Caught Fish, said he still fishes for tuna and black cod well beyond the prohibited area. He said he’s been able to keep selling his catch to restaurants, but customers aren’t buying like they usually do at a popular Newport Beach fish market because of concerns about the state fishing ban. “People assume that local fish is contaminated, and we’re fishing like 90 miles off the beach here, a long ways away,” Breneman said, adding that he’s heading out fishing about half as much as usual. “I don’t want to take the resource when I can’t sell it.” Commercial fishermen and charter operators have been hit especially hard. Some have joined lawsuits against pipeline owner Amplify Energy of Houston and worry about lingering effects on tourism.\n\nColorado\n\nGreeley: A former long-shot Idaho gubernatorial candidate on trial in the 1984 killing of a 12-year-old Colorado girl has testified that he did not know the girl or her family before she vanished and denied being involved in her disappearance. At the time, Steve Pankey was a neighbor of Jonelle Matthew and her family in Greeley, about 50 miles north of Denver. The girl’s remains were found by oil and gas workers in 2019. She had been fatally shot. Pankey was charged with Jonelle’s murder last year after showing extreme interest in the case for many years and allegedly sharing details with investigators that had not been made public. Pankey said in court that he pretended to know information about the case out of bitterness for police and for his former church and former employer, both of which he wanted investigated, KCNC-TV reports. Most of his testimony Thursday to questions by his lawyer was rambling and included comments about his hatred of racist police officers. District Attorney Michael J. Rourke pressed him about his views about police, which Pankey said came from seeing officers humiliate and hurt Hispanic people while he was working for an ambulance service in California. Pankey said he refused to put a splint on a sheriff’s deputy who broke his leg, letting the deputy ride to the hospital in pain. He said the deputy screamed for eight or 12 minutes. “I sat there and watched,” Pankey said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHamden: The state’s attorney general is investigating the closure of Quinnipiac University’s Great Irish Hunger Museum, which shut its doors permanently in August after nine years dedicated to study of what’s commonly known as the Irish potato famine. Attorney General William Tong’s spokesperson Elizabeth Benton confirmed the probe to the New Haven Register on Thursday, saying in a statement that “we have an open and ongoing inquiry into this matter.” Tong took up the investigation after a lawyer representing an organization dedicated to saving the Hamden museum sent a letter to his office, raising concerns about the prospect of museum artifacts being sold off. The group, the Committee to Save the Great Irish Hunger Museum, was planning a “salute to the museum” Saturday with Irish dancing, food and treats. A Quinnipiac spokesperson told the Register that the university is “not selling any” items and that it’s committed to finding a way to ensure the collection “remains publicly accessible, advances the museum’s original mission, and preserves the story of the Great Hunger.” Morgan said the university is cooperating with the attorney general’s inquiry. Morgan said Quinnipiac decided to close the museum because of funding shortfalls and a lack of interest from visitors.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Lawmakers in the state House don’t have enough votes to petition the governor to remove indicted Auditor Kathy McGuiness, who refuses to step down or take a leave of absence while she faces an indictment for alleged abuse of office. Instead, they appear to prefer a proposal from the Senate to ask the courts for advice on how to execute the constitutional law that sanctions the removal process, which has not been touched in living memory. Meanwhile, a judge ruled Thursday that McGuiness must be provided a public defender or pay for her own private attorney to fight criminal corruption charges. The ruling settles a conflict between McGuiness and Delaware prosecutors, who argued that McGuiness, by virtue of her public office, was entitled to a public defender, not her choice of a more expensive, private attorney to be funded by the public. McGuiness faces two felony charges and multiple public corruption misdemeanors, all of which carry the potential of more than 10 years in prison. Specifically, she is accused of giving her daughter a do-little job in the auditor’s office, rigging state contracts to avoid regulatory scrutiny and intimidating those who questioned her behavior, according to an indictment filed against her last month.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Ahead of the holiday season, the National Park Service planted a new National Christmas Tree on the Ellipse in President’s Park on Saturday, WUSA-TV reports. The new tree is a 27-foot white fir from Middleburg, Pennsylvania, the park service said in a release. Donated by Hill View Christmas Tree Farm, it will be the first white fir to serve as the National Christmas Tree. Since 1973, the National Christmas Tree has been a living tree that people can view year-round at President’s Park. The National Park Service said a white fir was selected because it is more resilient to needle cast disease, a fungal issue that affects spruce trees and causes their needles to fall off. The previous tree, a Colorado blue spruce planted in October 2019, succumbed to needle cast disease, according to the National Park Service. NPS officials say transporting and taking care of such a large tree can be challenging and requires careful planning and mild weather conditions. Late October is an ideal time for planting, but there is still a chance for transplant shock, experts say. NPS horticulturists will keep an eye on the tree’s health and ensure its transition is as easy as possible. The tree will be lit up during the National Christmas Tree Lighting Ceremony, details of which have not been announced yet.\n\nFlorida\n\nWinter Park: A little rain didn’t stop it from being a beautiful day at Rollins College as school officials unveiled a sculpture honoring alumnus and beloved children’s TV host Mister Rogers. Rollins President Grant Cornwell and others held umbrellas during Thursday’s private ceremony as they pulled back a drape on the bronze rendering of Rogers in his iconic sweater and tennis shoes, a work entitled “A Beautiful Day for a Neighbor.” “This inspirational sculpture will be a permanent reminder of the ideals and values modeled by Mister Rogers as he set out to make the world a better place,” Cornwell said during the ceremony at the private liberal arts college in Winter Park, just northeast of Orlando. Years before the world came to know him as Mister Rogers, Fred McFeely Rogers transferred to Rollins College in 1948 and graduated in 1951, according to the school. He majored in music composition and served as president of his fraternity and chairman of the Inter-Faith and Race Relations Committee. He also met his future wife at the school. He received an honorary degree from the school in 1974. The 360-degree sculpture designed by Paul Day, a British artist known for his public monuments, depicts Rogers surrounded by children, hand puppets from his show, lyrics from the theme song for “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” and the show’s Neighborhood Trolley. The sculpture will be part of the school’s Mister Rogers Walking Tour.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAthens: Former residents of a Black neighborhood that was destroyed more than 50 years ago and replaced with university dorms and parking lots are demanding the university recognize their loss. The city used eminent domain to force Black families out of the Linnentown neighborhood in the 1960s as part of an urban renewal plan. It sold the land to the state Board of Regents, and dorms and parking lots for the University of Georgia went up after the homes were razed. Now, a group of former residents and descendants wants the university to apologize for the land seizure and create a memorial to Linnentown, which was home to dozens of Black families, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reports. One member of the Linnentown Project group, Bobby Crook, told the newspaper the university needs to pay compensation, though he acknowledged that may not happen. The average condemnation award for homes in the neighborhood was $5,750, according to a resolution approved by Athens-Clarke County commissioners in February. The land – roughly 20 acres – and the improvements on it are worth tens of millions of dollars today. The county resolution did not mince words, accusing the city and the University System of Georgia of “an act of institutionalized white racism and terrorism resulting in intergenerational Black poverty, dissolution of family units, and trauma through the forcible removal and displacement of Black families, and the accumulation of the majority of their wealth and political power within the University System of Georgia and the City of Athens.”\n\nHawaii\n\nKihei: A new high school on Maui won’t be welcoming students as planned next fall because the state Department of Education didn’t build a pedestrian bridge to the campus. The state Land Use Commission on Thursday voted unanimously to stick to its earlier decision to require the state to build the bridge over Piilani Highway to Kihei High School, Hawaii News Now reports. That means the school won’t be able to open for the fall 2022 semester. The busy highway separates the school from neighborhoods where many students live. Currently, public school students in Kihei are enrolled at Maui High School, which is overcrowded. There are some charter school options in the area. The commission in 2013 said either a pedestrian overpass or an underpass would be required for safety. “It’s a shame that this high school, which is almost built, will not be open on time,” said Dan Giovanni, the commission’s vice chairperson. “To me, the fault for that is the DOE.” A department spokesperson said the department is assessing its next steps. Department officials said the state Department of Transportation advised them that a pedestrian bridge was not yet necessary because only a few students were scheduled to start school in August 2022.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lawmakers will gather this month to consider legislation banning COVID-19 vaccine mandates by the federal government and private employers, according to top lawmakers in the House and Senate. Republican House Speaker Scott Bedke and Republican Senate President Pro Tem Chuck Winder said the chambers will likely return for several days Nov. 15. The House never officially adjourned, and it can reconvene if called by Bedke. Winder said he would recommend senators return as well. Bedke said he expects about a dozen pieces of legislation to be introduced, including some to prevent employers from requiring workers get vaccinated. He said lawmakers getting between the employee-employer relationship wasn’t his preference, but some lawmakers supported the idea. “The objective is to get all of the various ideas out into the public domain so that everyone can take a look at them, to start the process,” Bedke said. “I don’t know how many of them, if any of them, will get critical legislative mass, in our bicameral system, but we’ll see.” Both said lawmakers will look at legislation that would allow the state to initiate legal action over federal vaccine mandates on private employers. The legislation would include $2 million for a potential legal battle.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: A conservation group has reached an agreement with a northern Illinois airport that temporarily halts work on a project that would destroy an 8,000-year-old tract of remnant prairie. The Bell Bowl Prairie, located on the Rockford Airport’s property, is targeted for demolition as part of a $50 million expansion of the airfield’s cargo operations. The prairie’s longtime stewards, the Natural Land Institute, sued the Greater Rockford Airport Authority last week, seeking injunctive relief to temporarily halt bulldozers from destroying the 25-acre prairie. The nonprofit conservation group announced Thursday that a deal putting that work on hold through March 1, 2022, had been reached through U.S. District Court with the Greater Rockford Airport Authority, its board of commissioners and executive director, WTTW-TV reports. Construction of an access road that would cut through the prairie’s highest-quality habitat had been slated to resume Monday. The temporary hold buys more time for the Natural Land Institute to convince the Airport Authority to explore alternative design concepts that protect the prairie and the endangered rusty patched bumblebee, the institute said in a statement.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A federal appeals court has cleared the way for state officials to start enforcing a law requiring reports from doctors if they treat women for complications arising from abortions, even though the court said the law could be struck down in the future. Action by the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals last week followed a 2-1 ruling by a court panel in August upholding the law, which had been blocked by a judge shortly after it was approved by the Republican-dominated Legislature in 2018. The law lists 25 physical or psychological conditions – including unsuccessful abortions, infections, uterine perforations, depression and deaths – that could trigger the reporting requirement for doctors or clinics. It makes failure to do so a misdemeanor punishable by up to 180 days in jail and a $1,000 fine. Planned Parenthood challenged the law in federal court, arguing that it was vague and would leave medical professionals uncertain in determining whether they needed to report conditions such as a patient’s anxiety or minor bleeding regardless of whether they believed it stemmed from the abortion. The Chicago-based appeals court last week turned down Planned Parenthood’s request for the full court to reconsider the case, and it issued an order Thursday allowing the law to go into effect.\n\nIowa\n\nAnkeny: A school board candidate changed his name following conviction on a threat of terrorism charge last year after he said he would shoot up a high school and sexually assault students. Christian Mathew Holtz, 20, of Ankeny, is one of seven candidates running in Tuesday’s election for school board in the Ankeny Community School District. His campaign has focused on addressing bullying, protecting marginalized groups and being a younger voice for students on the board, among other issues. Holtz has been running his campaign and participating in candidate forums as he remains on probation for the threat of terrorism charge, a felony, according to court records. In March 2020, Holtz – then known as Isaac Quinton Holtz – was charged in Dallas County District Court after police accused him of sending an email to more than 750 Waukee High School students and staff saying he planned to come to the school with a gun, shoot all the students, and go into the locker room to sexually assault and murder girls. According to a criminal complaint, police said he admitted to sending the email. Holtz entered an Alford plea, a type of guilty plea in which the defendant asserts innocence but acknowledges that the evidence would probably persuade a judge or jury otherwise. He was sentenced to three years of probation. Reached by phone Friday, Holtz would not directly confirm or deny he is the same person involved in that case. “It’s not me because I’m not Issac anymore,” Holtz said. “I’m Christian.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Hundreds of people opposed to COVID-19 vaccine mandates rallied Saturday at the Statehouse and pushed state lawmakers to quickly counter them, while an international labor union disavowed a local leader’s comparison of the mandates to the Holocaust that killed millions of Jews. The rally kicked off ahead of a rare weekend legislative committee hearing on mandates from President Joe Biden that affect as many as 100 million Americans. The hearing gave dozens of mandate opponents a chance to vent their frustration and anger with the White House and with Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s handling of the pandemic. Several critics of the mandates suggested Saturday that they violate international human rights standards enacted in the wake of atrocities during World War II. Bryan Luedeke, a Wichita-area aircraft worker, called them “reminiscent of Nazi Germany.” His comments followed Friday’s comparison of the mandates to the Holocaust by Cornell Beard, president of the Wichita district of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. A committee member, Rep. Brenda Landwehr, R-Wichita, appeared to agree with the analogy.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state Supreme Court has unanimously ruled that jails cannot force inmates to pay for their confinement if their criminal charges are dropped or if they are found not guilty. Ruling for a Winchester man who was billed more than $4,000 for his incarceration, even though a felony charge against him was dismissed, the court said inmates can only be charged if the payment is ordered by their sentencing judge. And because people who are acquitted or have charges dropped are never sentenced, they can’t be required to pay, the court said in a 12-page opinion Thursday. Greg Belzley, the attorney for David Allen Jones, said the ruling is a “huge” victory for the presumption of innocence. Belzley said he will ask that the ruling be applied to all inmates who are exonerated or have charges dropped, which could have serious financial implications for the commonwealth’s jails. “Jails are crumbling, but the way that gets addressed is through taxes, not by going after our poorest citizens,” he said. “We are delighted with the ruling.” The attorney for the Clark County Detention Center, Jeff Mando, had argued in a brief that the presumption of innocence does not apply to jail fees because they are not “punitive.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state Senate has created a special committee to dig into complaints about the use of excessive force by the State Police, after troopers were documented in a series of beatings of Black men that have drawn attention from federal investigators. Senate President Page Cortez said he set up the seven-member advisory panel in response to requests from senators concerned about troopers’ behavior. He sent a letter Thursday officially naming lawmakers to the committee. Two senators from Baton Rouge will lead the work: Republican Sen. Franklin Foil will be chairman, and Democratic Sen. Cleo Fields will work as vice chairman. Foil intends to hold the panel’s first meeting in December, he said, and expects the committee to hear from the State Police and the public with an eye toward developing recommendations for tightened laws regarding use of force that legislators can consider. The review will focus more on overall policies, rather than specific allegations of improper force, he said. The Senate Select Committee on State Police Oversight will “go over what kind of oversight the State Police has when there are reports of excessive force that may have been used inappropriately and what mechanisms they have as far as safeguards,” said Foil, a lawyer and Navy officer who has worked as a military judge.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Health care centers are facing a staffing crunch, but COVID-19 vaccination mandates are not the cause, according to the chief of the largest health network in the state. MaineHealth CEO Andrew Mueller said the organization has a staff vacancy rate of about 10% and described that level of staffing loss as “really, really difficult” for the organization, especially at a time when hospitals are full. However, he said, the shortage can be attributed to an aging workforce and workers leaving the industry because of the stress of working during the pandemic. The deadline to begin enforcing the vaccine requirement for health care workers across the state arrived Friday. Mueller had said that he expected to lose 1.5% to 2% of staff systemwide but that those losses would be offset by fewer COVID-19-related absences. “We actually think we’re going to have more capability and less shortages in a real way by ensuring our workforce is vaccinated,” he said last week. Meanwhile, Northern Light Health announced that unvaccinated workers would no longer be working at its 10 hospitals as of Saturday. In Lewiston, Central Maine Medical Center was already in compliance, with unvaccinated staff members not allowed to work.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A state lawmaker who is a plastic surgeon has been fined $15,000 and reprimanded for twice participating in legislative meetings via videoconference from an operating room during surgery. Del. Terri Hill signed a consent order last month agreeing to the disciplinary actions from the Maryland Board of Physicians, which found the Democratic lawmaker guilty of “unprofessional conduct in the practice of medicine.” The board noted that Hill participated in one voting session of a House committee while appearing in a video feed wearing “a surgical gown, facemask, and surgical cap.” In Maryland’s legislative session this year, legislative committee meetings were held by videoconference due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The public was able to livestream the meetings and hearings. “She was positioned under the surgical lights, focused downward, and would occasionally shift, reach for surgical instruments, or adjust the lights,” the board’s report said, noting the surgeon and other operating room staff “occasionally moved surgical equipment and blood-stained towels so that they were briefly visible on the video feed.” In a statement Friday night, Hill said she has worked hard to fulfill her professional obligations to both her patients and her constituents during the pandemic – a balance that has been challenging at times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Students will have greater access to school meals under a bill signed into law by Gov. Charlie Baker last week. The new law requires schools or districts to implement universal free breakfast and lunch for all students if a majority of students in the school meet low-income criteria. The law also bars school employees or volunteers from publicly identifying a student when payment for a meal hasn’t been received. Denying a student a meal as a form of punishment for bad behavior or disposing of an already served meal because of a student’s unresolved meal debt is also banned. Schools will also be prevented from denying a student or their sibling the chance to participate in non-fee-based extracurricular activities because of meal debt; prohibiting a student from receiving grades, transcripts, report cards or graduating as a result of meal debt; or requiring a parent or guardian to pay additional fees or interest costs above the amount owed for meals. “This legislation is another way we can ensure all children in the commonwealth have access to healthy meals when they are in school,” Baker said after signing the bill last Monday.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: As promised, Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday vetoed Republican-sponsored legislation that would toughen in-person voter identification rules and require people to include additional information such as their driver’s license number on absentee ballot applications. The governor said the bills would disproportionately hurt minority voters who are more likely not to have a photo ID on Election Day than white voters. They also would prohibit the secretary of state and clerks from mailing absentee ballot applications unless voters request them and ban private donations to help administer elections. “Voting restrictions that produce such a racially disparate impact must never become law in this state,” Whitmer wrote to lawmakers. A GOP-affiliated ballot committee, Secure MI Vote, is circulating petitions that would enable the Republican-controlled Legislature to enact a similar initiative next year regardless of Whitmer’s opposition. In Michigan, voters who go to a polling place without a photo ID can cast a regular ballot if they sign an affidavit. More than 11,400 did so in the 2020 presidential election. Under the legislation, they would get a provisional ballot and have to verify their identity with the local clerk within six days of an election for their vote to count. The governor said the change would disenfranchise voters, and there is no evidence that affidavit ballots are related to voter fraud.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Sales at municipal liquor stores in the state soared in 2020 for a record-breaking year. Sales at Minnesota’s 213 “munis” jumped 10% during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a report released last week by State Auditor Julie Blaha. In recent years, a typical sales increase has been in the range of 1% to 3%. With many bars and restaurants either closed or operating at reduced capacity during parts of the year, people did more of their drinking at home, according to liquor store managers and employees. And the lifestyle shifts prompted by the pandemic played a major role. The Star Tribune reports the bars and liquor stores transferred more than $21 million back to their local governments in 2020, helping supplement traditional tax revenue. According to the International Wines and Spirits Record, Americans consumed 2% more alcohol last year than in 2019. It was the biggest year-over-year increase since 2002.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Retired NFL player Brett Favre and Mississippi Auditor Shad White feuded Friday over the auditor saying Favre failed to make speeches after being paid by welfare money. The Twitter spat happened days after Favre repaid $600,000 to the state – the last portion of the $1.1 million that the auditor said Favre received from a nonprofit organization that used money intended to help needy people in one of the poorest states in the U.S. The auditor said Wednesday that Favre still owes $228,000 in interest, and the state attorney general could sue if that is not paid by mid-November. “Of course the money was returned because I would never knowingly take funds meant to help our neighbors in need, but for Shad White to continue to push out this lie that the money was for no-show events is something I cannot stay silent about,” Favre wrote Friday. The former Green Bay Packers quarterback, who lives in Mississippi, wrote that he made commercials for which he was paid by a nonprofit group. White tweeted that Favre’s contract required speeches and a radio ad. “The CPA for Favre Enterprises confirmed this was your contract,” White replied to Favre. “You did not give the speeches. You have acknowledged this in statements to my agents.”\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Professional sports teams are trying to put a proposal to legalize sports betting in the state on the ballot, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. A Jefferson City lawyer filed nine ballot proposals on the issue last week on behalf of the St. Louis Cardinals, St. Louis Blues, St. Louis City soccer club and Kansas City Royals. Money from taxing sports betting would be split between schools and roads under the proposals. Efforts to pass a law allowing sports betting have failed for years in Missouri’s GOP-led Legislature, so the teams are hoping to take the issue directly before voters. Republican Sen. Denny Hoskins has proposed several bills to legalize sports betting. But he warned that legalizing sports betting through the Missouri Constitution will mean lawmakers can’t easily address any potential issues with the program once it’s enacted. In Missouri, proposals need a certain number of voter signatures to be put on the ballot. Backers haven’t started collecting signatures yet.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: State environmental regulators ignored the law when they permitted an expansion of a massive strip mine that is the sole source of coal for a large power plant despite concerns about water pollution, a judge ruled. State District Judge Katherine Bidegaray ordered the Montana Department of Environmental Quality to revisit its 2015 permit to expand the 25,752-acre Rosebud Mine, owned by Colorado-based Westmoreland mining. The judge’s Thursday order came after environmental groups sued over damage to a nearby creek from wastewater that flows out of the mine. Rosebud, in the Powder River Basin along the Montana-Wyoming border, fuels the Colstrip Power Plant that burns about 8 million tons of coal annually. For years, nearby East Fork Armells Creek has received salty water from the mine and contaminants from coal ash ponds at the power plant, The Billings Gazette reports. The Montana Strip and Underground Mine Reclamation Act forbids the state from issuing mine permits unless it can be proven there won’t be damage to the balance of water outside the permit area. But Bidegaray said the state was doing the opposite – allowing harmful salt levels in Armells to increase. It’s unclear what the ruling means for mining operations, a Department of Environmental Quality spokesperson said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: A Christian student group has sued the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, alleging that the school discriminated against the group’s views when it denied a funding request to bring a Christian philosopher to campus as a guest speaker. The federal lawsuit by the group Ratio Christi alleges that the university failed to distribute money to student groups in a fair, viewpoint-neutral manner, according to the Omaha World-Herald. The lawsuit says Ratio Christi requested $1,500 in January from the university’s Fund Allocation Committee, which it was entitled to do as a recognized student organization. The group wanted to bring in philosopher and former university professor Robert Audi, who is currently a philosophy professor at the University of Notre Dame. The students were represented by Alliance Defending Freedom, a nonprofit legal organization that supports conservative Christian causes. The lawsuit alleges that the university’s program council told Ratio Christi it would need to invite another person from a different ideological perspective to the same event to receive funding. The school allegedly said it could not promote speakers of an ideological nature with its student organization funding, according to the lawsuit. In a statement Friday, Republican Gov. Pete Ricketts called on university Chancellor Ronnie Green to intervene and define policies that encourage all viewpoints.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Hundreds of hotel, casino and restaurant workers in matching red shirts rallied Thursday on the Las Vegas Strip as the Culinary Union made a second monthly call to return people to jobs idled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Culinary Union said more than one-third of its 60,000 members haven’t been rehired, despite a recovery by casinos and hotels from closures imposed in March 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. “If companies are going to charge you the full rate, you want to make sure you get full service,” union President Ted Pappageorge said, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. The message echoed calls made Sept. 24, when the Culinary Union organized a march of thousands of members on the Strip. Casinos statewide have ridden a tourism surge to set monthly winnings records, room rates have rebounded, and tourism officials report the number of visitors is approaching pre-pandemic levels. Nevada’s unemployment rate in September was 7.5%, down slightly from 7.7% in August. That’s more than twice the record low of 3.6% in February 2020 but far below the record peak of more than 30% set in April 2020 – a month after businesses and casinos were shuttered. The union says many idled employees have exhausted public unemployment benefits.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state has resumed its Homebound Vaccination program for COVID-19 shots. Appointments are being scheduled to provide first, second and booster doses of the vaccines to people who are unable to leave their homes, have difficulty doing so, or have been advised by a medical provider that their health could worsen by leaving their home. The state Department of Health and Human Services has contracted with On-Site Medical Services in Newport to conduct the program. Appointments can be made by calling (603) 338-9292 from Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., filling out a form at www.onsitenh.com/vaccine, or emailing vaccinations@on-sitemedservices.com.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEnglewood: An eatery offered Bergen County voters what some considered a great catch for participating in the democratic process, but others say something’s fishy with the promotion. If customers showed that they cast their ballot Friday or Saturday – presumably by displaying an “I voted” sticker – they were eligible for a free fried fish sandwich at TJ’s Southern Gourmet. A state statute on bribery says offering or receiving “money or other valuable consideration” to induce someone to vote or not vote “shall be guilty of a crime of the third degree.” The fried whiting sandwiches being offered by TJ’s – and the giveaway’s promotion by Teaneck school board member Victoria Fisher, who is up for reelection – is cause for concern for some people. Teaneck Councilman Keith Kaplan said Friday that he sent information about the fried fish sandwiches to Bergen County Superintendent of Elections Debra Francica and that he would send it to the state attorney general if needed. The attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the offer for free whiting, which typically sells for $8 and is described by reviewers as “fried to perfection.” Francica, however, said she had “checked with the AG’s office, and that’s legal.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Researchers say they have more evidence that Chaco Canyon was more than just an ancient gathering spot for Indigenous ceremonies and rituals. The researchers from the University of Cincinnati analyzed pollen content and the chemical composition of soils to help document environmental impacts of the early residents who called the area home. Their findings, published last week in the journal PLOS ONE, focus on changes resulting from tree harvesting that sustained daily life at Chaco. The researchers reported a gradual degradation of the surrounding woodlands beginning around 600 B.C., much earlier than previously thought. While some of the mysteries surrounding Chaco, now a national park and UNESCO World Heritage site, are still debated in academic circles, there’s agreement that the massive stone buildings, ceremonial structures called kivas and other features that dot the landscape offered a religious or ritualistic experience for the ancestors of today’s Native American pueblos. Many of Chaco’s structures are aligned with celestial events, such as the summer solstice. David Lentz, a biology professor and lead author of the study, said many researchers have the idea that Chaco was too arid to sustain day-to-day living and that the infrastructure built over many centuries at Chaco was used only as a periodic ceremonial center and storage facility. Lentz said that explanation is too simplistic, and his team turned up evidence to support human management of the area’s environment to support daily life.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Nine in 10 municipal workers received COVID-19 vaccinations as a Monday deadline loomed under a city mandate, according to Mayor Bill de Blasio. City officials have been making contingency plans to deal with an expected staffing shortfall Monday. De Blasio tweeted Saturday night that 91% of city workers had received the vaccine, which represented a jump from about 83% as of Friday night. Under a city mandate, those who haven’t received at least one dose of a vaccine against the disease will be put on unpaid leave starting Monday, raising the possibility of shortages of police, fire and EMS workers. New York has more than 300,000 employees. The police department, which employs about 36,000 officers and 19,000 civilian employees, reported an 84% vaccination rate as of Sunday morning, while roughly 2 in 10 of the fire department’s roughly 17,000 employees remained unvaccinated as of Friday night. Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro denied reports that some firehouses had been closed due to shortages. “Irresponsible bogus sick leave by some of our members is creating a danger for New Yorkers and their fellow firefighters,” he said in a statement Sunday. And six Brooklyn-based firefighters angry with the mandate were pulled from duty and suspended after driving a fire truck to a state senator’s office and threatening his staff over the requirement, with which the lawmaker wasn’t involved.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Bus drivers for the state’s largest school system called in sick Friday to protest working conditions, prompting administrators to urge parents to arrange their own transportation and warn of similar problems this week. Officials with the Wake County Public School System said 400 of the 600 buses operated by the system were running, news outlets report. Bus drivers have said concerns about being overworked and underpaid haven’t been addressed. Many parents said their children walked to school, or they were driven to school when their buses didn’t show up. The Wake County system has 160,000 students, and up to half of them ride the bus in a normal year. Wake County Superintendent Cathy Moore and school board chairman Keith Sutton wrote in a message to staff members: “The pay and salary structure for the work we do is not adequate. Our bus drivers shone a harsh light on this reality.” Moore and Sutton also said many drivers have to run as many as six routes a day without receiving extra compensation. They said most school staffers are in the same situation. The system also told parents that bus service for Monday is uncertain and asked families to plan for that possibility.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Republican Gov. Doug Burgum on Friday called a fall special session to deal with a limited agenda that includes legislative redistricting and the approval of a spending plan for federal coronavirus relief aid. The Nov. 8 special session approved by the governor through an executive order has no time restriction and may last indefinitely, though legislative leaders said they hoped it would only last five days. Republican Senate Majority Leader Rich Wardner and GOP House Majority Leader Chet Pollert have been meeting with Burgum in recent weeks to discuss the possibility of a special session. They joined the governor at the Capitol in announcing the special session Friday. The North Dakota Constitution limits the Legislature to 80 days of meetings every two years, and last spring’s regular session used 76 days. That means if the GOP-led Legislature had called itself back into session, lawmakers would have had to shoehorn the redistricting job, pandemic spending and other proposed legislation into just four days. Each of those subjects would take a minimum of three legislative days to be approved by both chambers of the Legislature. The GOP leaders said all of the Legislature’s pending business could have been accomplished during a reconvened session, though they preferred the special session.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Two Republican appointees to the Ohio State Board of Education resigned Friday, about two weeks after they opposed its decision to rescind an anti-racism resolution passed last summer. Board President Laura Kohler, of New Albany, told reporters that GOP Gov. Mike DeWine requested her resignation and that Republicans in the state Senate who didn’t like the resolution would’ve had enough votes to remove her if she didn’t step down. The resolution, passed by the board last summer after George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police, condemned racism and included an acknowledgment that “the path to equity begins with a deep understanding of the history of inequalities and inhumanity.” It talked about training board members and Department of Education employees to identify their own biases and recommended that districts reexamine areas such as curriculum and discipline strategies. In their resignation letters to DeWine, Kohler and board member Eric Poklar, of Worthington, didn’t specifically mention the anti-racism resolution or related controversy. Kohler told the governor she felt resigning was how she could “best support you and your work at this time.” Poklar wrote that his “time on the board has ended” and that he was ready to pass responsibilities to the next person.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: While medical experts say it’s unclear why a condemned inmate began convulsing and vomiting after the first of three drugs used to execute him was administered Thursday, all agree the dosage was massive compared with what’s standard in surgeries, with one doctor calling it “insane.” The state’s prisons agency is now likely to face new litigation, which may focus on the state’s description of the execution of John Marion Grant for the 1998 slaying of a prison cafeteria worker as “in accordance with” protocols. Grant, 60, convulsed and vomited after the sedative midazolam was administered. That drug was followed by two more: vecuronium bromide, a paralytic, and potassium chloride, which stops the heart. Thursday’s lethal injection ended a six-year moratorium on executions in Oklahoma that was brought on by concerns over its execution methods, including prior use of midazolam. Oklahoma’s protocols call for administering 500 milligrams of the sedative. Arkansas and Ohio are among other states that use that dose of midazolam in executions. “It’s just an insane dose, and there’s probably no data on what that could cause,” said Jonathan Groner, an Ohio State University medical school surgery professor and lethal injection expert. He added that sedation does not increase as the dosage goes up. “There’s a reason these drugs are given by anesthesiologists and not prison guards,” he said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The city’s “badly damaged” reputation – marked by months of destructive protests, a homelessness crisis and record year of homicides – is hurting its standing, according to its main tourism promoter. Travel Portland, the tourism promotion group partly funded by taxes, presented data to the City Council and mayor last week showing the city has declined to its “lowest level” of being a likely destination for delegates to attend conferences. Just 64% of surveyed tourists said they would visit Portland again. “There’s an old old saying, ‘It takes a lifetime to build a reputation, and you can ruin it in an instant.’ That’s true of cities, as it is people,” Mayor Ted Wheeler said in response to the Travel Portland data. “And we’re just going to have to commit to that long-term process of improving the safety and the livability and the economic prosperity of the city.” The liberal city had long been known nationally for its ambrosial food scene, craft breweries and nature-loving hipsters. But last year, it became the epicenter of racial justice protests following the murder of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis. For months, a small downtown area was consumed by protests that often turned violent, with clashes between demonstrators and federal agents, plumes of tear gas, fireworks exploding in the streets and rubber bullets flying through the air. While Portland’s violent protests have largely eased, there are still outbreaks.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Members of the city’s largest transit workers union reached a tentative contract agreement early Friday, averting a possible strike that threatened to bring elevated trains, buses and trolleys to a halt and leave thousands of children and educators without a way to get to school this week. The existing contract between the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority and the 5,000-member Transport Workers Union Local 234 was set to expire at 12:01 a.m. Monday. The tentative agreement announced by the union includes a two-year contract with a pay increase, a pandemic payment and parental leave for workers. “Our members are essential workers who move Philadelphia and who have risked their lives putting their own families at risk during this pandemic,” Willie Brown, Local 234 president, said in a statement praising Friday’s agreement. Members are scheduled to vote to ratify the contract next Friday. The union had voted Oct. 24 to authorize a worker walkout if an agreement couldn’t be reached. The union represents bus, trolley and elevated train operators, as well as mechanics and other staff. Union leadership had asked for a four-year contract with annual wage increases and a pandemic payment to compensate SEPTA workers who had served on the front lines of the pandemic, keeping public transportation moving for other essential workers. Nearly 800 members contracted COVID-19, and 11 TWU members died from COVID-19 or related complications, union leaders said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Students from the state are asking a federal appeals court to affirm that all public school students have a constitutional right to a civics education, saying that they aren’t taught how to meaningfully participate in a democratic and civil society and that the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol was a symptom of such ignorance. Students nationwide need to know how to participate in the political process, effectively exercise their constitutional rights, and learn skills like media literacy to distinguish accurate from false information, their lawyers argue. The plaintiffs have asked the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Boston, to reverse a lower court’s dismissal of the case, declare there’s a constitutional right to an adequate civics education, and send the case back to district court. Such a judicial declaration is urgently needed, their brief to the court argues, in light of the events of Jan. 6 that were carried out by “a mob motivated by a fundamental misunderstanding of the congressional role in counting electoral votes.” Oral arguments will be heard Monday. The defendants include Rhode Island’s governor, education commissioner, and other education authorities.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nJenkinsville: An area near the town has been hit with multiple minor earthquakes over the past week, including the latest one Sunday. The U.S. Geological Survey initially registered the early Sunday morning earthquake in Fairfield County at 2.2 magnitude but later edged up the intensity to 2.3, multiple news outlets report. It’s the sixth small earthquake in the area over a week, with three quakes recorded Thursday alone. The State newspaper reports the South Carolina Emergency Management Division is studying the seismic activity. Earthquakes that register less than 2.5 usually are too small to be felt.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Workers at a pork processing plant that was overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic say the company is no longer working in good faith. A spokesman for the United Food and Commercial Workers local union said the workers are “fed up” with injustices at their facilities after being on the front lines of the pandemic at the Smithfield plant for nearly two years. Local union president B.J. Motley said in a Friday release that the company is speeding up lines of production, verbally abusing employees, and neglecting social distancing and sanitary measures. “In consequence, we are seeing a record number of quits, injuries, grievances and overall unhappiness,” Motley said. “Our workers are tired, and their families are being affected by the heartlessness of the situation.” Jim Monroe, vice president of corporate affair for Smithfield, said in a statement that it’s the first time they have heard those concerns and that they disagree with the “portrayal of conditions” at the facility. The complaints come four months after the union agreed to a contract with Smithfield, which increased base pay, provided a bonus, and offered options of one to three weeks of leaves of absence and 15-minute breaks for employees working eight-hour shifts.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The GOP-controlled General Assembly has signed off on a number of measures undercutting COVID-19 protections, while also begrudgingly backing off on threats to revoke businesses’ ability to enforce mask mandates. Lawmakers approved the slate of bills early Saturday while most Tennesseans were asleep, marking the second time the Legislature has recently advanced significant legislation in the middle of the night. Democratic lawmakers quickly criticized that their Republican lawmakers were willing to concede to concerns raised by influential businesses lobbyists but not those pointed out by school and health officials alarmed at other measures that advanced during the three-day special legislative session. On Friday, Gov. Bill Lee’s office confirmed Ford Motor Co. and other manufacturers had expressed concerns with several of the proposals being discussed during the special session. Lee had declined lawmakers’ requests to call a special session to address the coronavirus, forcing them to collect enough signatures to call the session without the governor. By Saturday, Lee thanked Republicans for taking up certain issues but held off from promising he would sign all of the bills into law.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Marcos: Local police officials refused to provide an escort for a Joe Biden campaign bus when it was surrounded by supporters of then-President Donald Trump on an interstate, an amended lawsuit filed over the 2020 encounter alleges. The updated lawsuit, filed Friday, included transcribed 911 audio recordings, The Texas Tribune reports. The suit alleges that law enforcement officers in San Marcos “privately laughed” and “joked about the victims and their distress” in the audio recordings. The city of San Marcos didn’t return a request for comment from the newspaper. A spokesperson previously said the city and the San Marcos Police Department would not comment because of the pending litigation. Videos shared on social media from Oct. 30, 2020, show a group of cars and pickup trucks – many adorned with large Trump flags – riding alongside the campaign bus as it traveled from San Antonio to Austin. The “Trump Train” at times boxed in the bus. At one point, one of the pickups collided with an SUV behind the bus. According to the transcriptions, a 911 dispatcher told one bus passenger to call back if the caller felt threatened. “Are you kidding me, ma’am?” the caller replied. “They’ve cut in on me multiple times. They’ve threatened my life on multiple occasions with vehicular collision.”\n\nUtah\n\nKanab: Zion National Park officials and national conservation leaders met at the Utah Outdoor Recreation Summit on Thursday to hold the first public engagement meeting for a new recreation management plan. The five-person panel discussed the East Zion Initiative, a multimillion-dollar project to develop the east side of the park in order to disperse visitors and protect the “last unprotected gateway to a national park in the continental United States.” “The regional recreational management planning process is not just a thing: It is a spirit, it is a community effort, and it needs to remain such if it’s to be successful,” said Kevin McLaws, the owner of Zion Mountain Ranch and of the land granted for the East Zion Initiative. During the summit, titled “Crafting a Community-Led Vision for Regional Recreation Management in Greater Zion,” leaders and attendees discussed “solutions to trip planning, visitor experience, dispersal, mobility, and economic opportunity” that the region faces, the summit’s website said. As Zion is the third-most-visited national park in the county, seeing over 4 million visitors per year, the park and nearby gateway communities have seen record-high visitation since last fall, putting strain on amenities, the environment, businesses, park staff and locals and causing crowding.\n\nVermont\n\nFairfax: Some school districts are using electric school buses this fall as part of a pilot project to test their effectiveness. Gov. Phil Scott and education leaders celebrated the introduction of four electric buses in Fairfax on Thursday, with more expected to arrive this month. The buses also being used by the Champlain Valley School District and the Barre Unified Union District will start using them this month. “We are beyond excited to add electric buses to our fleet,” said Justin Brown, middle school principal at Bellows Free Academy in Fairfax. “We all hope this paves the way for more ‘green’ transportation in our – and our kids’ – future.” The goal is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and ultimately save school districts money, officials said. An emissions settlement with Volkswagen is funding most of the project. The school districts each get two buses. Bus driver Patsy Parker said the electric buses are quieter than diesel models, which she believes makes her young passengers quieter, too. The buses’ battery range has forced schools to reconsider some routes, particularly during cold weather, school officials said. “Where we would normally be able to go 120 miles a day, we’re limiting more to 60 or 70 miles a day because of the cold weather. But that’s what this pilot program is about,” Parker said.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The anti-Donald Trump group The Lincoln Project took credit Friday for five people appearing with tiki torches at a campaign stop by the GOP candidate for governor – a stunt recalling white supremacists who descended on the city amid violence in 2017. Charlottesville TV station WVIR reports candidate Glenn Youngkin was inside a restaurant when the group dressed in matching hats, khakis and white button-down shirts appeared beside his campaign bus. The former private equity executive and political newcomer is in a close race against former Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe as Tuesday’s Election Day nears. Photos showed the group holding large tiki torches. Their appearance recalled two days of chaos in 2017, when white supremacists gathered for a “Unite the Right” rally ostensibly to protest the planned removal of a Confederate monument. The night before the planned rally, a group carrying tiki torches marched across the University of Virginia campus, clashing with a small group of anti-racist protesters. The next day, a car driven by a self-avowed white supremacist plowed into a crowd of peaceful counterprotesters, killing one and injuring dozens. McAuliffe staffers promoted a reporter’s tweet about the group’s appearance, using it to attack Youngkin and suggesting that those holding the torches were his supporters. Youngkin staffers then accused the McAuliffe campaign or Virginia Democrats of being involved, drawing disavowals from McAuliffe’s campaign.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: After more than 18 months of pandemic-driven eviction limits, Gov. Jay Inslee said he would allow the latest version of the state’s eviction moratorium to expire Sunday. The move opens the door for an influx of new eviction cases and tests key tenant protections for the first time since the pandemic upended the legal process last year. “We have to have some end to the moratorium. You can’t have an economy ultimately where just nobody pays rent,” Inslee said at a press conference last week, the Seattle Times reports. Soon after the coronavirus hit, Inslee used his emergency powers to halt most evictions. This fall, Inslee loosened the rules. He replaced the moratorium with a “bridge” proclamation that still stopped some evictions for nonpayment of rent in certain parts of the state but allowed evictions for other reasons. The expiration of that policy Sunday means landlords can seek more evictions of tenants who fell behind on rent during the pandemic, provided owners go through newly required steps such as offering the tenant a payment plan. Most evictions will still be halted in Seattle, Burien and Kenmore, where local lawmakers have passed their own eviction moratoriums to last through early 2022.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nKenova: When COVID-19 vaccines first became available, Ric Griffith’s family-owned drugstore was among 250 mom-and-pop pharmacies that helped the state get off to the nation’s fastest start in vaccinating its residents. Republican Gov. Jim Justice went on national news shows to declare West Virginia – a place that regularly ranks near the bottom in many health indicators – “the diamond in the rough.” Nine months later, those days are a distant memory. Demand for the vaccine has almost dried up, the question of whether to get a shot has become a political hot button, and West Virginia’s vaccination rate has plummeted to the lowest among the states. The governor, who spent months preaching the virtues of the vaccine to reluctant West Virginians, is still doing that but also promoting a new law that would allow some exemptions to employer-imposed vaccination requirements. And shots are mostly sitting on shelves. “I’m afraid that while taking a victory lap, we discovered that there were more laps to go in the race,” Griffith, who is also a Democratic member of the state House of Delegates, said Monday of West Virginia’s descent from first to worst. Griffith said he was proud of Justice’s nonstop effort to push vaccines “and the obvious love he has for the people of West Virginia.” But Justice also ended a statewide indoor mask mandate in June and has opposed vaccination and mask requirements since.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A federal judge has declined to issue a ruling on a preliminary injunction requested by Ojibwe tribes to stop the state’s 2021 wolf hunt. But Chief U.S. District Judge James D. Peterson said Friday that he had “deep misgivings” about state rules that proved inadequate in February to keep the wolf kill to the intended target. The case is part of a lawsuit filed Sept. 21 by six Wisconsin Ojibwe tribes against the Department of Natural Resources and Natural Resources Board. The tribes argue that the hunt violates their treaty rights and endangers an animal they consider sacred. The Wisconsin wolf hunting and trapping season in February resulted in a kill of 218 wolves, 99 wolves above the state-licensed quota. The shares had been split 119 for the state and 81 for the tribes. The take by state-licensed hunters and trappers effectively consumed the tribes’ quota. The tribes are represented by the California-based environmental group Earthjustice. The case took an unusual turn due to a preliminary injunction on the wolf season handed out Oct. 22 in a similar case by a Dane County judge. With the season already effectively blocked, Peterson said he wasn’t able to issue relief. But he heard arguments and testimony over seven hours Friday.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: State senators on Friday voted down the last special legislative session bill they had written to counter President Joe Biden’s plans to require COVID-19 vaccinations – one that would have prohibited discrimination against business customers and others based on their vaccination status. The special session that began Tuesday in response to the federal plans will continue Monday, however, when senators plan to take up a House bill to bar employers from considering vaccination status in hiring decisions. The measure cleared the House 38-20 on Friday. The Senate will also consider a bill that would give Gov. Mark Gordon’s office $1 million to fight the Biden administration vaccine requirements for certain federal, health care and other private-sector employees and to prohibit enforcement of the requirements in Wyoming. That bill passed the House 41-14 on Friday. With no more legislation related to COVID-19 immediately left to consider, the House adjourned until Wednesday. Lawmakers worried that prohibiting discrimination based on a person’s vaccination status would have unforeseen and unintended consequences for businesses. The bill would open the way for “still more ways to sue” businesses, said Sen. Dave Kinskey, R-Sheridan, calling it “a lawyer’s field day.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/09/20/fire-advances-general-sherman-flags-mark-virus-deaths-news-around-states/118840688/", "title": "Fire advances on General Sherman, 660K flags mark virus deaths ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state could see its shipments of monoclonal antibodies reduced as federal officials take over distribution to equitably dispense the limited life-saving resource amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the state health officer said. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the change was needed after just seven states – Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas – accounted for 70% of monoclonal antibody orders in the country. “Given this reality, we must work to ensure our supply of these life-saving therapies remains available for all states and territories, not just some,” the department said in a statement. The seven states are also among those that have the lowest vaccination rates in the nation. State Health Officer Scott Harris said Friday that federal officials told states providers would no longer be able to order the drugs directly but would have to place those orders through state health departments. “We are really sorry to say there are probably going to be some patients who aren’t able to access that drug who thought they were going to have that available to them,” Harris said. Doctors continue to emphasize that vaccination, rather than a secondary treatment after the fact, is the best way to prevent severe COVID-19 disease.\n\nAlaska\n\nJoint Base Elmendorf-Richardson: Military leaders on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson have declared a public health emergency and encouraged all personnel to avoid places that do not require masks or social distancing in response to increasing COVID-19 cases across the state, officials said. “We’ve all seen COVID-19 cases continue to spread rapidly across our nation, the state of Alaska and in our local community,” U.S. Air Force Col. Kirsten Aguilar, 673rd Air Base Wing and JBER commander, said in a statement Friday. “After close consultation with JBER mission commanders, I have decided to declare a Public Health Emergency.” Aguilar said the declaration will remain in effect for 30 days but could be shortened or extended based on cases and community transmission of COVID-19. The base has also transitioned to Health Protection Condition Bravo, which means Aguilar will be able to implement additional measures to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, “including restricting access to off-base establishments,” the statement said. Hospitalizations and COVID-19 cases throughout the state have increased as a result of the highly contagious delta variant. Alaska on Friday reported more than 1,200 newly confirmed cases per 100,000 people over the past two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins University researchers.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Board members overseeing Arizona’s most populous county reached an agreement Friday evening with the Republican-controlled state Senate that will end a standoff over a Senate demand that they hand over computer routers for use in an unprecedented partisan election review. The Maricopa County Board of Supervisors announced that a special master will take questions from the Senate’s election review contractors and provide them with information contained on the routers that they say they need to finish the election review. Supervisor Bill Gates said the deal will protect sensitive information contained on the routers while avoiding a massive penalty the county faced if they had not complied. Gates called the deal “a win for transparency, and it’s also a win for protecting sensitive data in Maricopa County.” Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich said in a decision last month that the county must comply with the subpoena issued by Republican Senate President Karen Fann or lose about $700 million in yearly state funding. The county agreed to drop a $2.8 million claim it filed with the Senate after election equipment it handed over to the auditor was decertified and needed to be replaced.\n\nArkansas\n\nRussellville: A former sheriff’s deputy was charged Friday with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of a white teenager whose death has drawn the attention of national civil rights activists. A special prosecutor announced the felony charge against Michael Davis, a former sergeant with the Lonoke County Sheriff’s Office, in the fatal shooting of 17-year-old Hunter Brittain. Davis faces between three and 10 years in prison if convicted. Davis shot Brittain during a June 23 traffic stop outside an auto repair shop along Arkansas Highway 89 south of Cabot, a city of about 26,000 people roughly 30 miles northeast of Little Rock. Davis told investigators he shot Brittain once in the neck after the teen reached into the back of his truck and did not comply with his commands to show his hands, according to the arrest affidavit. Brittain was holding a container – which his family members have said held antifreeze – and no evidence of firearms was found in or near the truck, the affidavit said. A passenger with Brittain said he and the teen had been working on the transmission for Brittain’s truck. The passenger told investigators he never heard Davis tell the teen to show his hands. Davis, who is white, was fired by Lonoke County Sheriff John Staley in July for not turning on his body camera until after the shooting occurred.\n\nCalifornia\n\nThree Rivers: Hot, dry weather Sunday added to the challenges facing firefighters battling to keep flames from driving farther into a grove of ancient sequoias, where the base of General Sherman, the world’s largest tree, has been wrapped in protective foil. Fire officials warned that stronger winds were also contributing to “critical fire conditions” in the area of the KNP Complex, two lightning-sparked blazes that merged on the western side of Sequoia National Park in the Sierra Nevada. The National Weather Service issued a red flag warning through Sunday, saying gusts and lower humidity could create conditions for rapid wildfire spread. The fires forced the evacuation of the park last week, along with parts of Three Rivers, a foothill community of about 2,500 people. Crews have been bulldozing a line between the fire and the community. More than 34 square miles of forest land have been blackened. The National Park Service said Friday that flames had reached the westernmost tip of the Giant Forest, where it scorched a grouping of sequoias known as the “Four Guardsmen” that mark the entrance to the grove of 2,000 sequoias. Giant sequoias are adapted to fire, which can help them thrive by releasing seeds from their cones and creating clearings that allow young sequoias to grow. But the extraordinary intensity of fires – fueled by climate change – can overwhelm the trees.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A civil rights investigation that was launched amid outrage over the death of Elijah McClain – a Black man put into a chokehold during an encounter with suburban Denver police two years ago – found a deeply ingrained culture of racially biased policing within the department, according to Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser. He said Wednesday that the investigation found the Aurora Police Department has long had a culture in which officers treat people of color, especially Black people, differently from white people. He said the agency also has a pattern of using unlawful excessive force, frequently escalates encounters with civilians, and fails to properly document police interactions with residents. It’s the latest mark against the Aurora department since Weiser’s office indicted three officers and two paramedics on manslaughter and other charges this month in connection with McClain’s death. “These actions are unacceptable. They hurt the people that law enforcement is entrusted” to serve, Weiser said. Police stopped McClain, a 23-year-old massage therapist, as he walked home from a store Aug. 24, 2019, after a 911 caller reported a man wearing a ski mask and waving his hands who seemed “sketchy.”\n\nConnecticut\n\nStonington: The town’s police force is warning residents to stay away from aggressive minks. In a recorded message sent to residents, Capt. Todd Olson of the Stonington Police Department urged people to stay away from a mink if they see one, The Day of New London reports. Olson said that even though they resemble a pet ferret, minks are territorial and are not friendly. One of them chased a person Wednesday, he said. Olson said the department’s animal control officer notified the state Department of Energy and Environmental Protection about the minks, and the agency is looking into the situation. A mink farm once operated in the town.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: African folk music played through the Herman M. Holloway Sr. Park as the community gathered Saturday to participate in the 25th African American Family Festival. The festival, designed to celebrate “everything African,” also serves as an opportunity to raise awareness about social issues – including COVID-19. “We want to do good things for the people in our community so they don’t feel like all good things happen in majority-white neighborhoods,” said Harmon Carey, the event organizer. “A lot of African American festivals have moved away from the community, near white communities, or they have completely stopped doing events.” The aroma of African cuisines filled the park as children playfully jumped in a bounce house, and adults gathered around jewelry and clothing stalls, adorned with traditional African stones and colorful fabrics. A Mobile Health Unit set up by the Life Health Center conducted coronavirus tests and encouraged people to get vaccinated. “It is kind of a hit and miss, but every time I come out, I cross my fingers and hope that we get a good response,” said Kyme McCleary, a nurse at the mobile unit. The unit focused on vaccinating children ages 12 and up during the first half of the event, followed by adults for the later part of the day.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: More than 660,000 white flags are waving in the air on the National Mall, each honoring one American life that has ended due to COVID-19. The installation, called “In America: Remember,” covers more than 22 acres in 143 sections near the Washington Monument and the National Museum of African American History and Culture, WUSA-TV reports. Volunteers from Ruppert Landscape installed the flags over the course of three days, completed Friday. The installation will be up for a total of three weeks, lasting until Oct. 3. Visitors are invited to get involved in the memorialization, come to the mall and personalize a flag for someone they have lost. Those who can’t make it in person can dedicate a flag virtually on the installation’s website. Artist Suzanne Brennan Firstenberg conceived the idea, beginning last fall with 267,080 flags placed outside RFK Stadium in Northeast D.C. Firstenberg – described as a “social action artist” based in the D.C. area, according to the installation’s website – has also spent 25 years participating in hospice volunteering.\n\nFlorida\n\nTampa: The mayor says officials will revamp a program that allowed police officers to notify landlords when their tenants had been arrested, even in cases in which charges were later dropped. The decision to reform Tampa’s Crime-Free Multi-Housing Program was announced by Mayor Jane Castor on Saturday following an investigation by the Tampa Bay Times that showed police officers were reporting tenants after arrests for misdemeanor crimes and the arrests of juveniles, and about 90% of the 1,100 people flagged by the program were Black tenants. Under the announced changes, the city will inform landlords only about “certain serious drug and violent felonies.” A police captain must sign off on notices sent, and landlords will be notified only about arrests that happen on their properties. The program was created in 2013 with the goal of stamping out drug and gang crime in apartment complexes. At its peak, about 100 apartment complexes were enrolled. While Castor touted the program as having “improved the safety and quality of life for tens of thousands of people,” Yvette Lewis, president of the Hillsborough County NAACP, said it could still violate a renter’s civil rights by resulting in an eviction based solely on an arrest. “This program needs to be stopped,” she said. “You’re treating housing as though it’s a privilege.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A disaster relief organization founded by actor Sean Penn is boosting the state’s drive to inoculate people against COVID-19, though some of its pop-up vaccine clinics have struggled to attract people. CORE has offered COVID-19 shots at hundreds of sites in big and small communities around the state, including schools, farmers markets and meat plants. But it has had few takers at some locations – a likely reflection, at least in part, of skepticism about vaccines in Georgia. The percentage of people who are fully vaccinated in the state is well below the national average, and that’s a big factor in Georgia’s nearly three-month surge in COVID-19 infections and hospitalizations. On a recent weekday, one person came in to get inoculated over six hours at an Atlanta church where CORE was offering the Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer vaccines. State health officials say regardless of how many people show up at each site, the group has been a key partner in their mobile vaccination efforts. “We feel like every opportunity is not wasted if we can get a shot in an arm,” said Chris Rustin, a senior adviser to the commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: At least seven people were injured Saturday in the collapse of a large tree branch in Waikiki, Hawaii News Now reports. A large branch of a banyan tree came crashing down about 12:15 p.m. at the Hilton Hawaiian Village in the heart of the popular tourist district, Honolulu Emergency Medical Services told Hawaii News Now. The seven people who suffered multiple injuries included some with serious head injuries and multiple cuts. Four of the seven were treated and transported to a nearby hospital, Honolulu EMS said. Among those seriously injured were a 50-year-old man, a 22-year-old woman, a 28-year-old woman and another woman whose age was not disclosed, according to Hawaii News Now. Three others evaluated at the scene refused to be transported. The banyan reaches a height up to 100 feet and spreads laterally indefinitely, with its branches dropping new roots to the ground, creating a structure that can appear to be composed of many separate trees. Hilton Hawaiian Village said in a statement after the incident: “Our thoughts are with those who have been affected and their families. Our hotel team along with several guests responded immediately and the proper authorities were contacted. The wellbeing, safety and security of our guests and team members are of paramount importance.”\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Republican state officials are warning President Joe Biden of legal action if his proposed COVID-19 vaccine requirement for about 100 million Americans goes into effect. Gov. Brad Little, Attorney General Lawrence Wasden, House Speaker Scott Bedke and Senate Pro Tempore Chuck Winder said in a letter Friday that there appears to be no legal basis for the requirement. “If you choose to continue to move forward in this direction, the State of Idaho will have no choice but to take the necessary legal actions to uphold its sovereignty, check the overreach of power by federal bureaucracy, and uphold the system of checks and balances our Constitution guarantees,” they wrote in the letter to Biden. Many Idaho Republican lawmakers are angry with the vaccine mandate that requires employers with more than 100 workers to require the workers either to be vaccinated or to be tested for the coronavirus weekly. The officials’ letter comes a day after the entire state entered crisis standards of care because of mostly unvaccinated COVID-19 patients filling hospitals. The standards allow health care providers to give scarce resources, such as ventilators, to the patients most likely to survive. The letter also comes as Republicans jockey for position ahead of the GOP primary early next year.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A kind of bird that not that long ago was so rare in Illinois that people traveled hours just to catch a glimpse of one has lately been winging its way through the Chicago area. Snow-white 30-pound birds called the American white pelican are on their semiannual migration through Illinois right now. The trip means hundreds of them stop to rest near the Four Rivers Environmental Education Center in Channahon, 50 miles southwest of Chicago. Thousands more stop for a bit about 150 miles beyond Channahon at the Emiquon National Wildlife Refuge in Lewistown. Among reasons this might be happening is that decades of wetland restoration across the country have helped increase the number of birds from about 40,000 in the 1960s to 180,000 today. As to why Illinois has seen so many more, American Birding Association webmaster Greg Neise told the Chicago Tribune that perhaps the birds that traditionally breed in Canada and the Great Plains and migrate to the Gulf Coast every winter started breeding in northern Wisconsin. He said another possibility might be that Asian carp that have invaded Illinois waterways in recent years are, as the pelicans have discovered, good eating.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state’s largest hospital system says more than 100 workers are no longer employed with the health network after they did not comply with its mandate for all employees to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Indiana University Health said Thursday that 125 employees had departed from the hospital system after a two-week unpaid suspension period that ended Sept. 14. Officials did not say whether those workers quit or were fired, saying in a statement that they “chose not to receive the COVID-19 vaccine and have left the organization.” IU Health did not provide details on what kinds of positions were affected or whether any of the employees worked in bedside care. The 125 former employees were a small percentage of IU Health’s work force of about 36,000. IU Health announced in June that it would require all its doctors, nurses and other employees to be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Sept. 1. The health system operates 15 hospitals and dozens of outpatient clinics around the state. Two weeks ago, IU Health said suspended employees would be allowed to return to work if they attested to partial or full vaccination. At the time, it said that fewer than 300 workers had been suspended, according to the Indianapolis Business Journal.\n\nIowa\n\nBurlington: Paint-A-Thon participants are hoping the goodwill it brings to the community each year will spread much like the virus that resulted in the cancellation of last year’s event. Each year, hundreds of Burlington and West Burlington residents work with their neighbors, co-workers and friends to paint houses for those most in need. “It’s like a good virus,” said Mark Rosenburg, team leader for Bethany Lutheran Church, who was painting a house on Elm Court. “It goes to the community and spreads.” The Burlington/West Burlington Paint-A-Thon is hosted each year by Two Rivers Bank and Trust in collaboration with Diamond Vogel Paint and Community Action of Southeast Iowa. One of the program’s goals is to beautify the homes of those who cannot afford a fresh coat of paint. This year’s event marks the 28th annual Paint-A-Thon. Last year’s was canceled because of COVID-19. When Paint-A-Thon first started in Burlington, an organizer reached out to all the churches in the city asking for help. Since then, it has become an annual tradition for many houses of worship. Individuals can apply to have their home painted or can be nominated by someone else. Community Action goes through a selection process in which members seek out the neediest homeowners to receive assistance.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: Sit-ins and marches have followed alleged sexual assault on two major university campuses in the state. Dozens of University of Kansas students staged a sit-in in front of the chancellor’s office Friday in an ongoing protest of the handling of allegations that a fraternity member sexually assaulted another student. A spokesman for Phi Kappa Psi has said the organization has been made aware of the allegations involving one of its new undergraduate members, and the university was immediately notified. Protesters are demanding that university officials take action against the fraternity as well as the alleged perpetrator, The Kansas City Star reports. They changed a placard at the entrance of the office of the chancellor, renaming it “Office of the Complicit,” and taped other signs with messages to the glass windows at Chancellor Doug Girod’s office. Meanwhile, more than 200 people marched to the Wichita State University police station to protest the handling of a reported rape in a dormitory. The Wichita Eagle reports students gathered Friday at Shocker Hall, where the sexual assault is alleged to have occurred Sept. 12. They then marched to the campus police station. Some carried signs reading: “We deserve a rape-free campus,” and “WSU, do better.”\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A $21 million project at the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport will install geothermal wells to heat and cool the facility. Crews will drill 648 vertical geothermal wells that go 500 feet deep on the east side of the airfield. Geothermal wells use the earth’s natural temperature to heat and cool. The new system will cut carbon emissions by 80% and use 40% less energy than traditional systems, the airport said. “Not only will this innovative technology make systemwide improvements and increase efficiencies, but we are also setting an example in the industry to reduce carbon emissions and energy use,” said Dan Mann, executive director of the Louisville Regional Airport Authority. Airport officials held a formal groundbreaking Thursday for the project, which is part of a larger set of improvements to the airfield and terminal.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Garbage and debris are piling up along many streets almost three weeks after Hurricane Ida pounded southeast Louisiana as residents react with increasing anger and, in some cases, dark humor. Several residents told a City Council committee Friday that they haven’t had their garbage collected since days before the storm hit Aug. 29. “I was at the point of naming every maggot in my garbage, and I was going to put them on my income tax as dependents,” a woman told council members at City Hall. “This is not good government. This is just incompetence.” Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s administration has said much of the problem arises from labor shortages that have plagued the city for months, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and, then, the storm. The city sought bids from companies wanting to supplement its two main waste contractors, officials said Thursday. A Sept. 8 deadline was extended to Sept. 13 due to a lack of response. After the later deadline, one contractor was hired to aid trash collection efforts Thursday in part of the city. Another contractor who bid on another area had 20 trucks available – but no labor. On Thursday, Cantrell’s office announced a plan to use workers and equipment from various city agencies to supplement trash pickup.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The public gets an opportunity Monday to weigh in on Democratic and Republican proposals for reshaping the border of Maine’s 1st and 2nd Congressional Districts. Both proposals released Thursday focus on Kennebec County, and both parties agree on moving Augusta, the capital city, to the state’s northern district. There’s disagreement, however, on reshuffling a dozen other towns. Democrats want to move both August and Waterville, along with several other Democratic-leaning towns. Republicans targeted a different grouping of towns. Based on the 2020 election, the Republican proposal would have meant nearly 900 additional votes for President Joe Biden and the Democratic proposal would mean about 6,200 extra votes for Biden in the district, according to an analysis by the Bangor Daily News. Former President Donald Trump won the vote in the 2nd Congressional District, picking up one of Maine’s four electoral votes. Sen. Rick Bennett, R-Oxford, who is serving on the commission for Senate Republicans, said he’s optimistic the differences can be ironed out. “I think we are pretty close, at least on the congressional side,” he told the Portland Press Herald. The state’s bipartisan redistricting commission is racing to meet a Sept. 27 deadline.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Legislative auditors found that glitches in the cashless tolling infrastructure at the state’s bridges, tunnels and express lanes overbilled motorists thousands of dollars. The Baltimore Sun reports the Office of Legislative Audit’s report on the Maryland Transportation Authority comes about a year after the state announced it permanently ceased cash toll collections – put on hold during the coronavirus pandemic – and moved to fully electronic tolling systems. “We received allegations on our fraud, waste, and abuse hotline alleging that MDTA was not taking sufficient action to detect and address the overbilling of customers for electronic tolling due to issues with its new toll equipment,” Legislative Auditor Gregory Hook wrote in a letter to the legislature’s Joint Audit and Evaluation Committee. “Our audit disclosed that MDTA was inconsistent in its actions related to the impact of issues with its electronic toll collection system on its customers and potential customer overbillings.” The report identified tolling issues at the Fort McHenry Tunnel in Baltimore, the Francis Scott Key Bridge, the Intercounty Connector in Montgomery County and the Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge in Cecil County.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nSalem: The city known for its witch trials more than three centuries ago will require a negative coronavirus test for people to attend some large Halloween events, officials said as they brace for the typical influx of visitors in the weeks ahead of the holiday. The Salem Board of Health voted Friday to require people to have a negative test taken within 72 hours to attend indoor events with more than 100 people at a public space. The requirement goes into effect Oct. 1 and lasts through Nov. 1. Masks are required inside all public businesses through mid-November. “The delta variant is so transmissible. We are seeing an increase in COVID case counts in Salem,” Mayor Kim Driscoll said. “Thankfully, more people are vaccinated, so we’re not seeing the crush of hospitalizations. But those numbers are up, too.” Details about rapid testing in the area will be announced soon. Vaccine mandates are in place for some events like the Horror Fest, which includes 50 indoor movies throughout October. “We’ll do whatever it takes to keep our audience safe,” said Kay Lynch, of Horror Fest. “We’ve capped our audience. We’ve required vaccination. Masks are required indoors.”\n\nMichigan\n\nJackson: After hearing from critics, including the homeless, city officials have rejected an ordinance that would have cracked down on panhandling. The measure would have stopped people in Jackson from asking for money by speech or sign near banks, building entrances or outdoor dining or on public transportation. A violation would have carried a $100 fine. Kevin Hardman, who said he’s homeless, told the Jackson City Council that finding solutions to poverty would be a better step. “To penalize me or anyone because I’m poor, I don’t dress nice – if you see somebody in that condition, why won’t you help them?” Hardman said. A first reading of the ordinance was defeated 5-2 on Tuesday, MLive.com reports. Council member Karen Bunnell, who voted for the ordinance, said panhandling is a serious issue downtown. “Those are not just my constituents. Those are also my business owners,” she said. Mayor Derek Dobies, who opposed the ordinance, said it violated free speech. “The city can’t say it’s OK for the Salvation Army or firefighters to collect donations in some of these places but not allow poor people to ask for spare change,” he said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Regulators have ordered Enbridge to pay more than $3 million for allegedly violating state environmental law by piercing a groundwater aquifer during construction of the Line 3 oil pipeline replacement. The state Department of Natural Resources said Enbridge, while working near Clearbrook in January, dug too deeply into the ground and pierced an artesian aquifer, which resulted in a 24 million-gallon groundwater leak. “Enbridge’s actions are a clear violation of state law, and also of the public trust,” said Barb Naramore, DNR deputy commissioner. “That is why we are using all of the tools in our authority to address the situation.” Enbridge said in a statement that it was reviewing the DNR’s order and would work with the agency on a resolution. It wasn’t until mid-June that the DNR discovered something was wrong after speaking to independent construction monitors who had observed water pooling in the pipeline trench near Clearbrook. The DNR has ordered Enbridge to put $2.7 million into escrow for restoration and damage to nearby wetlands. Enbridge is also required to pay $300,000 to mitigate the lost groundwater and $250,000 for long-term monitoring of the wetlands. Enbridge’s 340-mile Line 3 replacement pipeline, opposed by environmental groups and some Ojibwe tribes, is nearly complete.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: An interactive exhibit prompts visitors to speak aloud the names of people who were killed in acts of racist violence in the United States during the civil rights era – incantations in a darkened room to honor some 150 men, women and children whose lives were cut short. The names appear on lighted glass panels, backed by images of trees. Next to each name is a code that visitors can scan with their cellphones. “Say his name to begin his story,” or “Say her name to begin her story,” says the recorded narrator, journalist Charlayne Hunter-Gault, who made history in 1961 as one of the first Black students to enroll in the University of Georgia. The traveling exhibit, “Un(re)solved,” was created by PBS Frontline with artist, filmmaker and technologist Tamara Shogaolu. It is on display until Oct. 24 at the Two Mississippi Museums, which houses the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum and Museum of Mississippi History under one roof. The exhibit opened in downtown Jackson on Aug. 28 – 66 years to the day after Emmett Till, a Black teenager from Chicago, was abducted, tortured and killed in the Mississippi Delta after witnesses said he whistled at a white woman. “Un(re)solved” focuses on the federal investigation of more than 150 cold cases under a law enacted in 2008, the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. Mississippi has 56 names in the exhibit – more than any other state.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A crowd gathered Saturday to celebrate the state’s bicentennial, with a World War II nurse leading the parade. KTVO reports Edith Harrington waved to the crowd from a military jeep, followed by about 100 entries that highlighted the history of the Show-Me State. The 98-year-old Harrington joined the United States Cadet Nurse Corps in 1943. The festivities also marked the election of state officeholders in 2020 whose traditional inauguration events were delayed because of the coronavirus. Missouri turned 200 years old last month. Territorial residents first sought statehood in 1818, but the request became bogged down in Congress by a dispute over whether slavery should be allowed. In March 1820, President James Monroe signed legislation known as the Missouri Compromise. Maine was allowed into the union as a free state and was allowed to draft a constitution as a slave state, so long as no other new slave states formed north of Missouri’s southern border. Missourians thought they had become a state, but the parties were premature. Missouri’s first constitution, which sought to exclude free “Negros or mulattoes” from the state, prompted further opposition in Congress. After a second compromise, Monroe signed legislation finally making Missouri the 24th state on Aug. 10, 1821.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Interior Secretary Deb Haaland signed the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes water rights compact Friday, settling a decades­long battle over thousands of individual water rights in Montana and on the Flathead Indian Reservation. The deal also created a $1.9 billion trust to settle claims and refurbish the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project. The tribes have claims to more than 10,000 water rights beyond their reservation land. The compact offered a deal in which the tribes relinquished their claims to most of the water outside of the reservation. In exchange, the tribes will receive 211 water rights on their reservation, 10 water rights outside the reservation and co-ownership of 58 other water rights, along with the funding. “Our elders continually remind us to protect our water, and this day marks the beginning of the water compact implementation that will protect the water for all generations to come,” Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes Chairwoman Shelly Fyant said in a statement. Montana lawmakers passed legislation approving the compact in 2015. Under the compact, the federal government will initially provide the tribes with $90 million over a 10-year period to rebuild the Flathead Indian Irrigation Project, which was built in the 1900s.\n\nNebraska\n\nAlvo: A massive, flammable mountain of scrap tires that had grown to more than twice the size allowed under state environmental rules in a small eastern Nebraska town now appears to be in compliance. The Nebraska Department of Environment and Energy said a report that B-Rose Tire Recycling of Alvo had made significant progress in coming into compliance with a Sept. 1 deadline to bring its inventory below 160,000 passenger tire equivalents, according to the Omaha World-Herald. In April, the business signed a consent agreement with state regulators to drastically reduce its pile of shredded tires or face fines or other sanctions. By the middle of last year, the business’ pile of tires in the town halfway between Lincoln and Omaha had grown to as much as 323,228 passenger tire equivalents. B-Rose fell short of benchmarks in the agreement for July and August, but after a warning letter from the state agency Aug. 9, B-Rose reported hauling out 123,176 passenger tire equivalents to the landfill during August, exceeding the number of tires hauled out in the months of May, June and July combined. Officials at the State Fire Marshal’s office said Wednesday that they hadn’t yet conducted an inspection to determine if the business had created fire lanes for emergency vehicles between the tire piles.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A fire burned the main building of the Mount Charleston Lodge in a forest area that is a popular retreat from summer heat for Las Vegas residents. A fire official and a representative of the company that owns the business said the building that houses the lodge’s restaurant was a total loss, but cabins used for lodging weren’t damaged. No injuries were reported, officials said. The fire was reported about 4:45 a.m. Friday. Its cause wasn’t immediately known. Photos posted online showed flames flaring from the building, and Clark County Assistant Fire Chief Thomas Touchstone said the lodge’s dining area was fully engulfed when the first units arrived about 5 a.m. The lodge was built in the 1960s after a previous lodge on the site that had been operating since at least 1948 was destroyed by a fire in December 1961, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Since 2018, the property has been operated by Ellis Island Hotel & Casino. “The Lodge was a beloved landmark, and we plan on rebuilding and recreating the atmosphere and charm that so many were able to enjoy throughout the years,” Christina Ellis, the company’s marketing director, said in a statement. Touchstone said it appeared the fire started inside the building when no employees were there, and it was too dangerous for firefighters to enter the building to battle the blaze.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The head of the state’s health department on Friday accused a Republican lawmaker of spreading misinformation about COVID-19 vaccines. Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Lori Shibinette was telling the Legislature’s fiscal committee that 90% of those hospitalized in New Hampshire due to the coronavirus are unvaccinated when she was interrupted by Rep. Ken Weyler of Kingston. “That is in doubt,” he said, adding that he has heard from emergency room workers who say 90% of those admitted have been vaccinated. “That is incorrect, and that is misinformation,” Shibinette told him, according to video of the exchange shared by WMUR-TV. “I have no idea why someone would say that, but that is incorrect, and that is the problem that we are having in increasing our vaccination rate: spreading misinformation about the COVID vaccine.” Republican members of the committee voted to table $27 million in federal virus relief funds that would have gone to the state’s immunization program.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A judge who suggested to a domestic violence suspect that men are “in control” has been suspended without pay two years after he made the comments. The state Supreme Court announced Friday that it adopted the recommendation of a panel on judicial conduct to suspend Municipal Court Judge Steven Brister for one month, beginning Wednesday. The panel wrote in 2019 that Brister, who has served in both East Orange and Newark, told the man that men “can’t punch; you can’t hit. At best, you treat as if you’re holding a feather, just to let them know you’re the man, and you’re in control.” The panel wrote that the comments violated conduct rules, were disparaging to women and could create the perception of bias. It also wrote that Brister allowed his personal religious beliefs to influence his judicial role because he referred to women as being created “with the curve of the rib of Adam.” In a subsequent response to the panel’s report, Brister didn’t deny the remarks and called them “well-meaning but undeniably misguided” and said he had completed several ethics courses. An email message seeking comment was left Friday with an attorney who represented Brister.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s film industry has come roaring back to life this year and so far managed to avoid significant COVID-19 outbreaks. Many credit the stringent protocols put in place by the industry, the Albuquerque Journal reports. Film and TV productions in New Mexico got the green light to resume in September 2020. According to the New Mexico Film Office, from Sept. 1, 2020, through Sept. 1, 2021, there have been 176,598 coronavirus tests administered throughout the various productions. Of those, 183 were positive. “This is a testament to the film industry, as they want to mitigate and remain safe,” said Amber Dodson, director of the New Mexico Film Office. “There have been less than eight productions that have paused for their own safety during the last year.” As of Aug. 31, there were 18 film and 24 TV productions in various phases currently in the state. When the film industry paused in March 2020, leaders spent months developing protocols that would be put in place when it resumed. In June 2020, a white paper was created by a task force of the Industry-Wide Labor-Management Safety Committee describing health and safety guidelines to resume film and TV production.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Most nonviolent parole violations will not result in jail time under a new law signed Friday by Gov. Kathy Hochul. The “Less is More” law largely eliminates New York’s practice of incarcerating people for technical parole violations, including being late to an appointment with a parole officer, missing curfew, or failing to pay fees or to inform a parole officer of a change in employment. Starting in March, people on parole will land back behind bars only for drug or alcohol use if they were convicted of driving under the influence of those substances. Supporters of the law say that New York has one of the the nation’s highest rates of incarcerating people for technical parole violations and that the practice is costly and fuels the cycle of people landing behind bars again after serving their time. Criminal justice advocates applauded the law but urged Hochul and lawmakers to make it effective immediately. The move means an estimated 5,000 people who are behind bars for technical parole violations could eventually be eligible for release. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city will be releasing “hundreds and hundreds of people the right way.” The governor also said she would sign off on the release of 191 eligible inmates from the city’s notorious Rikers Island jail complex, troubled by years of neglect.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Judges struck down the state’s latest voter photo identification law Friday, agreeing with minority voters that Republicans rammed through rules tainted by racial bias as a way to remain in power. Two of the three trial judges declared the December 2018 law is unconstitutional, even though it was designed to implement a photo voter ID mandate added to the North Carolina Constitution in a referendum just weeks earlier. They said the law was rushed and intentionally discriminates against Black voters, violating their equal protections. The law “was motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters,” Superior Court Judges Michael O’Foghludha and Vince Rozier wrote in their 102-page order. “Other, less restrictive voter ID laws would have sufficed to achieve the legitimate nonracial purposes of implementing the constitutional amendment requiring voter ID, deterring fraud, or enhancing voter confidence.” The majority decision, which followed a three-week trial in April, will be appealed, Republicans at the Legislature said. A state appeals court had previously blocked the law’s enforcement last year. The law remains unenforceable with this ruling.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: The Grand Forks Air Force Base has been selected for a military satellite mission, the state’s U.S. senators announced Friday. Republican Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer said the base will be home to a Space Networking Center, which is part of the Pentagon’s Space Development Agency’s new low-Earth orbit mission. NASA defines low-Earth orbit as having an altitude of 1,200 miles or less. Hoeven said the mission serves as the backbone for all U.S. military communications. “Grand Forks is the ideal location to house this new Space Networking Center,” Hoeven said in a statement. The mission “provides essential support for our national security and will help our nation stay ahead of our adversaries in developing critical new technologies,” he said. Hoeven’s office said a military installation in Alabama also was selected as a center for the mission.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: As Republican lawmakers try to limit drop boxes and early voting, a new report shows rural Ohio voters want more flexibility in how they can cast their ballots. A poll commissioned by the nonpartisan election group Secure Democracy found that roughly three-quarters of rural voters support allowing counties to provide multiple early voting and ballot drop-off locations, as well as expanding the types of acceptable voter identification. They also back 24-hour drop box access and the use of a secure website to request an absentee ballot. The poll comes as legislators push separate bills that would alter the state’s rules for conducting elections. Supporters say the changes are necessary to prevent fraud, but opponents contend they would sow confusion and suppress votes. One proposal would eliminate in-person voting on the Monday before Election Day, limit drop boxes to 10 days before Election Day and require Ohioans to request mail-in ballots no later than 10 days before an election. A stricter measure would ban drop boxes entirely and significantly reduce the number of days for early voting, among other provisions. Officials with Secure Democracy say the bills could hurt voters in 17 rural counties who relied on voting flexibility even before the pandemic drove people toward absentee and early voting.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Supreme Court will expedite an appeal of an injunction limiting a ban on mask mandates in public schools. The court, in an order dated Wednesday, placed the appeal on its fast-track docket, giving Attorney General John O’Connor 20 days to file briefs in the case and opponents 20 days to respond. The appeal argued the law passed earlier this year by the Legislature is constitutional. “The Legislature may reasonably exercise its … power over public schools without regulating private schools,” the filing said. The appeal also said the state is immune from the lawsuit filed by the Oklahoma State Medical Association and four parents. District Judge Natalie Mai cited the fact the law did not apply to private schools in approving the temporary injunction. Mai’s ruling allows for exemptions to mask requirements for medical or personal reasons, which Oklahoma State Medical Association President Dr. Mary Clarke said some schools have adopted. “It’s disappointing to see the Attorney General appeal a decision that even Gov. Stitt supported,” Clarke said in a statement. “We’ve seen several schools implement masking programs with opt-out clauses.”\n\nOregon\n\nBend: About two dozen people have contacted the state’s poison center after self-medicating against COVID-19 with a drug used to treat parasites, with five becoming hospitalized and two winding up in intensive care units, authorities said Friday. The drug they used was ivermectin, which has no proven use against the coronavirus and is instead approved to treat some parasites in people and some animals. “COVID-19 is a devastating disease and can be very frightening, but the public does not need to use – nor should it use – unproven and potentially dangerous drugs to fight it,” said Robert Hendrickson, medical director of the Oregon Poison Center at Oregon Health & Science University. Between Aug. 1 and Sept. 14, the Oregon Poison Center at OHSU managed a total of 25 cases. Five of those cases involved hospitalization, and two people were so severely ill that they had to be admitted to an intensive care unit. Studies suggest that achieving the plasma concentrations necessary for antiviral efficacy would require administration of doses of the drug up to 100-fold higher than those approved for use in humans, the National Institutes of Health said. The Oregon Poison Center said its recent cases involved people experiencing mental confusion, balance issues, low blood pressure and seizures.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Democrats in the state Senate sued Friday evening in a state court to block a Republican-approved subpoena seeking voter information and to put a stop to what Republicans call a “forensic investigation” of last year’s presidential election. Democrats had said they would sue within days after the GOP-controlled Senate Intergovernmental Operations Committee voted Wednesday to issue a subpoena that seeks detailed state election records, including communication with counties and the names of who voted in last year’s presidential election, their birth dates, addresses, driver’s license numbers and the last four digits of their Social Security numbers. The subpoena is an outgrowth of former President Donald Trump’s baseless claims that he was cheated out of victory last November and ongoing pressure by Trump and his allies for battleground states where he lost to investigate the election. “The latest ploy by the Senate Republicans is unprecedented and completely unwarranted,” Democrats said in a statement. “All aspects of the certified 2020 election have been thoroughly reviewed and adjudicated in the courts with no findings of irregularities or fraud. The timeframe to contest the 2020 certified election results is long overdue.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A group of parents and grandparents has filed a legal challenge to Gov. Daniel McKee’s statewide school mask mandate. The lawsuit filed in Providence Superior Court on Thursday alleges the Democratic governor violated state law and the state constitution in both signing the K-12 mask mandate and declaring a new state of emergency due to the delta variant of the coronavirus, WPRI-TV reports. The 16 parents and grandparents from Glocester, Smithfield, North Smithfield and Warwick argue there is a double standard because the state no longer requires masks in restaurants, retail shops and other indoor spaces. They also question the science of mask-wearing, which state and national experts have said helps slow the spread of the virus. “Often, it appears that those at highest risk for the effects of COVID-19, the elderly, the obese, and those with multiple comorbidities, are willing to force the young and healthy, who are little affected by COVID-19, to suffer these irreparable harms on unproven science,” the complaint says. McKee spokesperson Alana O’Hare, citing the pending litigation, declined to comment. In the suit, the plaintiffs also say masks make it difficult for their children to breathe, hear and communicate, hampering the learning process.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The capital city will not allow people to carry guns in the open during protests, festivals or other events that need a city permit. The resolution passed unanimously earlier this month by the Columbia City Council also bans the open carrying of guns in city-owned buildings without written permission from the city manager, The State newspaper reports. The South Carolina General Assembly passed a law this year allowing people with a concealed weapons permit to carry those guns openly. But the law allowed local governments to ban open carry for specific events for a limited period of time. Columbia’s resolution will keep people safer, Mayor Steve Benjamin said. Concealed weapons permit holders “are incredibly responsible with the use of firearms, and I’m thankful for that,” Benjamin said. “But the ability for a good, hard-working police officer to be able to ascertain who’s who when someone has a sidearm on fully exposed is very difficult.”\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Legislative leaders on Friday distributed a petition to lawmakers asking them to support a special session to consider impeaching Attorney General Jason Ravnsborg for a car crash last year that killed a pedestrian. House Speaker Spencer Gosch released the text of the petition. Two-thirds of both the Republican-controlled House and Senate must sign on to convene the special session. Lawmakers would meet in November, the day after they are scheduled to hold another special session to consider new legislative districts. The petition says the special session would be called for “investigating and evaluating whether the conduct of Jason Ravnsborg … surrounding the death of Joe Boever, involved impeachable offenses.” Gosch has said that if the special session is approved, he will appoint a committee to investigate the conduct of the attorney general, a Republican whose term runs through 2022. The South Dakota Legislature has never tried to impeach an official as powerful as an attorney general. It would require a simple majority of the House to approve articles of impeachment, while two-thirds of senators must vote to convict and remove him from office. The attorney general pleaded no contest to a pair of misdemeanors last month, and prosecutors dropped a third misdemeanor.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A federal judge has indefinitely blocked Gov. Bill Lee from allowing parents to opt out of school mask requirements in Shelby County, saying Friday that evidence shows Lee’s order prevents children with health problems from safely going to school during the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Sheryl Lipman issued the preliminary injunction after parents of students with health conditions argued that the Republican governor’s executive order endangered their children and hurt their ability to attend in-person classes by allowing others to opt out of a mask mandate. “It is that unmasked presence that creates the danger to these Plaintiffs,” the judge wrote Friday. Meanwhile, two families in Williamson County, just south of Nashville, sued in federal court Friday, also challenging Lee’s order. In Shelby County, Lipman had already issued a temporary restraining order on Sept. 3 stopping schools from allowing parents to opt out. It was set to expire Friday. The preliminary injunction continues blocking Lee’s order as the federal lawsuit proceeds. The injunction applies to all seven public school districts in Shelby County, which began classes Aug. 9 under a universal mask requirement issued by the Shelby County Health Department. Shelby County Schools is Tennessee’s largest, with 100,000 students.\n\nTexas\n\nNew Boston: A man linked to the “boogaloo” movement who livestreamed threats to kill police was sentenced Friday to 50 years in prison after being convicted of attempted murder of a peace officer. On Thursday, a jury in Bowie County found 38-year-old Aaron Caleb Swenson guilty of attempted capital murder of a peace officer and found he’d violated the Texas Hate Crimes Act, the Texarkana Gazette reports. On Wednesday, before testimony began before the judge, Swenson had pleaded guilty to terroristic threatening and evading arrest. The newspaper reports that on Friday, the jury sentenced him to 50 years in prison for attempted murder, 20 years for terroristic threatening with a hate crime enhancement and 10 years for evading arrest. Prosecutor Kelly Crisp said the terms will run concurrently. The jury also assessed maximum fines on each of the three charges for a total of $30,000. Swenson testified he was trying to be killed by police in April 2020 when he made the threats and never intended to hurt anyone when he streamed on Facebook Live while driving in Texarkana, Texas, that he was searching for a police officer to kill. Texarkana crime scene analyst Spencer Price testified about the two pistols, 12-gauge shotgun, handmade sword and 156 rounds of ammunition found in Swenson’s truck.\n\nUtah\n\nSouth Salt Lake: The Wasatch Youth Center is no more. Demolition crews began work last week tearing down the former long-term, secure lockup for child offenders. A backhoe knocked down brick walls and tore off the roof of a gymnasium. A stray office chair was picked up with some debris and thrown into the back of a dump truck. The juvenile detention facility is no longer necessary. “Because of some of the shifts in reforms in Utah in juvenile justice, this is a space where we don’t need this capacity anymore,” said Brett Peterson, the executive director of Utah’s Division of Juvenile Justice Services, told Fox13. “We’re able to reinvest our dollars in serving youth in their home, schools and communities.” It’s a result of a series of laws the Legislature passed beginning in 2017 dubbed “juvenile justice reform.” Instead of incarceration, the state has placed more of an emphasis on rehabilitation and community oversight for youth offenders. Funding has been shifted to ensure there are proper services to keep children facing what are termed “low risk” offenses out of detention facilities. The Utah Division of Juvenile Justice Services had actually planned to expand Wasatch Youth Center prior to the reform legislation. Instead, the land will be given back to the state for other needs.\n\nVermont\n\nSpringfield: The state plans to spend $25 million of its own funds to help redevelop old industrial sites. Historically, the costs of cleaning up former industrial sites that may be contaminated from previous industrial or commercial activities, known as “brownfields,” have been funded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Vermont officials traveled Thursday to Springfield, where they highlighted that some of the state funds will be used to help redevelop the 270,000-square-foot former Jones & Lamson Machine Co. building that once employed 1,500 factory workers. Other sites that will be redeveloped with some of the money are in St. Albans and Burlington. “It’s an understatement to say this is just another brownfield site,” said Bob Flint, the executive director of the Springfield Regional Development Corp., which owns the 14-acre property. “This beats them all.” The projects were announced by Gov. Phil Scott. “This presents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to address longtime challenges and finally make good on the promise to increase economic equity from region to region and bring growth to all areas of the state, not just Chittenden County,” Scott said.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Residents have a new digital option for proving they’ve been vaccinated against COVID-19. The Virginia Department of Health has added QR codes, barcodes that can be scanned with smartphones, to state COVID-19 vaccination records, officials announced Thursday. People will be able to prove they’ve been inoculated by showing a digital or printed QR code instead of a paper card, and they won’t need a special app. As more employers and businesses require employees and customers to be vaccinated, officials said this will boost the consistency and security of vaccination information while protecting individual privacy. Anyone vaccinated in Virginia can visit the department’s Vaccinate Virginia website to obtain their free vaccination record with QR code, which can then be saved to a phone gallery or printed out. The codes contain the same information as paper records, but the format offers more security, and the information is only available if a person chooses to share it, officials said. Because the digital records are digitally signed by the Department of Health, officials said they can’t be altered or forged. Businesses and employers can use a free app to scan the codes.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The Sauk-Suiattle Indian Tribe has filed a class-action lawsuit against the city on behalf of its members and the public, saying the electric utility’s green power claims are misleading and hurting the tribe. The lawsuit filed in King County Superior Court on Friday seeks to stop Seattle City Light from claiming that it’s a fish-friendly, green and environmentally responsible utility until Seattle provides fish passage at its three Skagit River dams. “Until that happens, they are not as green as they say they are,” said Nino Maltos, chairman of the tribe. More than 80% of City Light’s energy comes from hydropower, which doesn’t directly emit climate-warming carbon dioxide. The city of Seattle is in the midst of a relicensing process for the dams. The tribe insists the utility can’t claim its dams are green while they block salmon passage on the region’s premier salmon river. Julie Moore, spokeswoman for Seattle City Light, said the utility won’t comment on litigation. But she said the relicensing process “gives us the opportunity to update the research and determine what additional measures may be necessary to protect fish moving forward. This includes looking at fish passage.” Native wild Chinook salmon, steelhead and resident bull trout within the Skagit River drainage all are threatened with extinction.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s death toll from the coronavirus pandemic this month has already doubled the total from August. There have been 286 reported deaths from COVID-19 in September and at least 3,370 since the start of the pandemic, according to state health data. The September total includes at least 32 virus-related deaths added to the count after being reconciled with official death certificates. Deaths during the pandemic peaked in January, when there were 654 reported from Jan. 4 to Jan. 31. They slowed to 49 total deaths in July but picked up again in August with 148. “We’re going to have a bunch more die. That’s all there is to it,” Gov. Jim Justice said at a news conference Friday. “And the only way we can stop it from being a bunch more and then a whole lot more on top of that, in my opinion, is one thing, and that’s to get vaccinated. I’m going to continue to plead with you to do that because I don’t know anything else we can do.” Justice lifted a statewide indoor mask requirement in June as the number of cases dropped, and he’s balked at issuing a mandate vaccination or new mask requirements. He has said mandating masks is “penalizing” some people, but he’s not convinced it’s going to significantly help as the pandemic goes unchecked.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: The return of a popular annual music festival wasn’t what some vendors expected. After the event was canceled last year due to the coronavirus, Summerfest 2021 ended with mixed reports. Sellers who set up shop for the first time generally marked it a success, while longtime vendors saw it as a “total bust.” Vendors said during Saturday’s final day of the two-week concert that the crowds had picked up a bit more from the start but remained low compared to previous years. Surging cases of the delta variant of the virus and new pandemic protocols were cited as possible factors. “This was not what I expected,” said Kagan Tate, owner of Butterfly Connection. “A total bust.” Tania Espinoza Bonilla, owner of T for Textile, was selling for the first time at a large festival. Although she didn’t see the crowds she had hoped for, she said she was thankful for the exposure and connections she made for her business. “I’m sure the vaccine rule made a lot of people angry, but I supported it,” she said. Even before the pandemic, Summerfest had already experienced reduced attendance and in 2019 saw the lowest participation since 1986 with just more than 718,000 festivalgoers. Officials have not provided daily attendance numbers and would not comment on the numbers while the event was running.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Human remains found in a reservoir on the Wyoming-Idaho state line have been identified as a kayaker who drowned in 1995, investigators said. Kyle Martin, 24, was kayaking on the Hoback River when a companion lost his paddle. Martin went ahead but was never seen alive again. Relatives of Martin and sheriff’s officials briefly saw Martin’s body after a helicopter dislodged his kayak from a snag in the river a couple of days later, Teton County sheriff’s deputy Dave Hodges told the Jackson Hole News & Guide. “He separates, and he’s on the surface, but I didn’t expect him to then submerge almost as quickly as he emerged,” Hodges recalled. Last winter, Hodges saw an entry in Forensics Magazine about human remains found in Palisades Reservoir, downstream from the Hoback River. A DNA sample from Martin’s mother confirmed they were her son’s remains. Hodges called Martin’s brother with the news Sept. 10. “It was an incredible moment to call family after 26 years and say that your son and your brother is finally coming home,” Hodges said. “We both had a moment of tears. It was a sense of closure for a family that’s been waiting so long to have their son and their brother home.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/09/20"}]}

The reason behind the theft of the Cybertruck is unknown, but the futuristic vehicle fascinates many.\n\nDespite questions about the Cybertruck's quality — beginning with a botched demonstration aiming to highlight the truck's design which went awry when a metal ball thrown at the vehicle shattered a window on stage — the vehicle has managed to become one of the best-selling electric trucks this year.\n\nFor those unfamiliar with the Tesla Cybertruck, here are some key points to quickly get you up to speed.\n\nWhat is a Tesla Cybertruck?\n\nFirst unveiled in November 2019, the Tesla Cybertruck marks the company's entrance into the truck market. With an upper body with a distinctive triangular shape, it's an electric vehicle that looks like something inspired by Roblox. It features a \"bullet tough\" stainless-steel frame and armored glass described by Elon Musk as \"rock-proof.\" Industry analysts swiftly determined that the Cybertruck's appeal is more of a niche market model rather than a mass-market vehicle.\n\nAccording to Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ executive director of insights, who was quoted in a USA Today article, the initial buyers of the Cybertruck will probably be early adopters “who care more about being first to flash the shiny-new, angular toy than the price.”\n\nOther features that set the Cybertruck apart from anything else on the market, include:\n\nUp to 11,000 pounds in towing capacity.\n\nUp to 2,500 pounds payload capacity.\n\nA 6-foot-by-4-foot bed.\n\n0 to 60 miles per hour in 2.6 seconds.\n\nHow much does a Cybertruck cost?\n\nUpdated pricing posted online shows that Tesla's new model will start at $49,890.\n\nThe rear-wheel drive Cybertruck starts at $57,390 and will be available in 2025. The vehicle will have an estimated 250-mile range and can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 6.5 seconds, according to Tesla.\n\nThe all-wheel drive model starts at $76,390 with deliveries in 2025. This model has an estimated 340-mile range and can go from 0 to 60 in 4.1 seconds with a top speed of 112 miles per hour.\n\nThe \"Cyberbeast\" version starts at $96,390 with deliveries starting next year. The model has an estimated 320-mile range and can go from 0 to 60 in 2.6 seconds, according to Tesla, with top speeds of 130 miles per hour.\n\nTesla's website says these prices assume the buyer will receive federal tax credits and $3,600 of gas savings over three years.\n\nInsideve.com reported that the cheapest MSRP in the full-size truck segment is $49,590 for a Ford F-150 Lightning Pro with Standard Range (SR) battery. One of the most expensive is GMC's Hummer EV Pickup $126,935 which still comes in lower than Tesla's Cyberbeast's MSRP of $138,235.\n\nAs of July 2023, the website's unofficial reservation tracker indicated that around 1.9 million reservations for the Cybertruck had been made. Refundable reservations initially cost $100 then in December, the company upped the deposit to $1,000 for a reservation to order the truck. It has now been reduced to $250. The deposit is refundable if the customer changes their mind.\n\nTesla does not provide a breakdown of vehicle sales by model in its quarterly reports. Due to a recent recall, it is now known that nearly 4,000 Cybertrucks have been sold.\n\nRecall of all Cybertrucks issued in April\n\nIn April, the company recalled 3,878 Cybertrucks following a warning issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration regarding a potential issue with the accelerator pedal getting stuck when pressed.\n\nWhile Tesla can usually address issues through over-the-air updates, this particular problem, requires owners to bring their vehicles in for a physical repair.\n\nAccording to the agency, the accelerator pedal could get stuck when pressed, leading to unintended acceleration and a higher risk of accidents. The accelerator pedal pad may \"dislodge and cause the pedal to become trapped by the interior trim,\" the NHTSA said.\n\n\"An unapproved change introduced lubricant (soap) to aid in the component assembly of the pad onto the accelerator pedal,\" the NHTSA wrote in a recall document. \"Residual lubricant reduced the retention of the pad to the pedal.\"\n\nIn the recall notice, Tesla stated that it was not aware of any collisions, injuries or deaths relating to this issue. The recall applies to every 2024 Cybertruck produced between November 13, 2023 and April 4, 2024.\n\nTesla service will replace or repair the accelerator pedal assembly free of charge, according to the NHTSA. Owner notification letters are scheduled to be sent out in June 2024. For assistance, owners can reach Tesla customer service at 1-877-798-3751.

The vehicle looks like something straight from a post-apocalyptic movie, with what Musk described as a \"bullet tough\" stainless-steel frame and \"basically rock-proof\" armored glass.\n\n\"The apocalypse could come along at any moment, and here at Tesla we have the finest in Apocalypse technology,\" CEO Musk joked on stage at the event held in Austin, Texas.\n\nWhat time is the Cybertruck delivery event?\n\nA live broadcast of the delivery event was streamed on Musk's social media platform X, formerly Twitter, at 3 p.m. Eastern on Thursday. The event started about 25 minutes into the live stream and wrapped up less than half an hour later.\n\nAbout a dozen trucks were handed off to their owners during the live-streamed broadcast. One went to Reddit co-founder and tennis player Serena Williams' husband Alexis Ohanian.\n\nWhat's unique about the Cybertruck?\n\nMusk shared a few features about the vehicle Thursday, including:\n\nUp to 11,000 pounds in towing capacity.\n\nUp to 2,500 pounds payload capacity.\n\nA 6-foot-by-4-foot bed.\n\n0 to 60 miles per hour in as little as 2.6 seconds.\n\nMusk also made sure to highlight the truck's durability during the event. When the Cybertruck was first announced in 2019, a failed demo meant to show off the truck's exterior went wrong when a metal ball thrown at the vehicle shattered a window on stage.\n\nThis time, when what appeared to be a baseball was tossed at the car, the window held firm.\n\n\"You don't have to worry about, like, rocks hitting the glass and cracking the glass,\" Musk said.\n\nHow much will the Cybertruck cost?\n\nUpdated pricing posted online shows that Tesla's new model will start at $49,890.\n\nThe rear-wheel drive Cybertruck starts at $49,890 and will be available in 2025. The vehicle will have an estimated 250-mile range and can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 6.5 seconds, according to Tesla.\n\nThe all-wheel drive model starts at $68,890 with deliveries in 2024. This model has an estimated 340-mile range and can go from 0 to 60 in 4.1 seconds with a top speed of 112 miles per hour.\n\nThe \"Cyberbeast\" version starts at $96,390 with deliveries starting next year. The model has an estimated 320 mile range and can go from 0 to 60 in 2.6 seconds, according to Tesla, with top speeds of 130 miles per hour.\n\nTesla's website says these prices assume that the buyer will receive IRA Federal Tax Credits up to $7,500 for Rear-Wheel Drive and All-Wheel Drive and $3,600 of gas savings over three years.\n\nWhile Tesla originally said the Cybertruck's starting price point would come in below $40,000, its price hike was anticipated by experts.\n\n“($400,000) is not a realistic price point in 2023,” said Jessica Caldwell, Edmunds’ head of insights, in a Wednesday statement. “The reality is that no full-size truck, electric or gas, transacts anywhere near the $40K mark on average.”\n\nData from Edmunds shows that the average MSRP for the full-size truck segment is $65,158 and $76,281 for heavy-duty trucks.\n\nDealBook Summit:Elon Musk sends vulgar message to advertisers leaving X after antisemitic post\n\nWho is buying the Cybertruck?\n\nMusk in October said over 1 million people have reserved the Cybertruck so far. (While reservations had cost $100, Tesla upped the price to $250 on Thursday.)\n\nCaldwell said the Cybertruck’s first customers will likely be early adopters “who care more about being first to flash the shiny-new, angular toy than the price.”\n\n“The Cybertruck should perform well in sales early on as a niche vehicle with an instant, overwhelming response, though Elon has already hinted at production challenges that might make demand a moot point,” Caldwell said in the statement.\n\nDuring Tesla’s October earnings call, Musk said he expects \"enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck.” The vehicle is not expected to be cash-flow positive for another 12 to 18 months, and Musk said Tesla won't be able to ramp up to producing 250,000 Cybertrucks annually until 2025.\n\n“Long term, this feels like a true test for Tesla since it represents the brand’s first entry that feels legitimately risky from a product perspective and has the added challenge of an established competitor set,” Caldwell said. She added that while full-size trucks traditionally have high margins, the Cybertruck's design and production challenges \"leave Tesla unlikely to reap those rewards the way legacy automakers have.”\n\nTesla stock price\n\nTesla's stock price dipped 1.8% Thursday, closing at $239.79 on the Nasdaq.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/technology/2023/11/30/elon-musk-tesla-cybertruck-delivery-event-specs-interior-cost-price-austin-giga-texas/71718179007/", "title": "Elon Musk, Tesla launch Cybertruck delivery event in Austin", "text": "I’m Kara Carlson, a technology reporter for Statesman.

But follow along with us here for thoughts and analysis as the event progresses.\n\nWatch live:Tesla Cybertruck unveiling event in Austin\n\nHow big is the Cybertruck and what other features does it have?\n\nTesla included details on specs, dimensions and warranty for two of its Cybertruck models online following the event. The Cyberbeast and All-Wheel Drive models include seating for five adults, 120.9 cubic feet of cargo space, vehicle warranty for up to 4 years or 50,000 miles, as well as battery and drive unit warranty of 8 years or 150,000 miles.\n\nThe vehicle models both have the same dimensions, with a length of 223.7 inches, width of 95 inches and height of 70.5 inches. The vehicles also have 20-inch wheels. Comparatively, a 2024 Ford F150 Lightning is 232 inches long, 80 inches wide and 77 inches tall.\n\nThe Cyberbeast model weighs in at 6,845 lbs, while the All-Wheel drive model weighs in at 6,603 lbs. The models also vary slightly on charging speed, with the Cyberbeast able to charge up to 128 miles in 15 minutes, and the All-Wheel drive model able to charge up to 136 miles in 15 minutes.\n\nPowershare abilities\n\nTesla also showed on the website that the vehicles include the ability to be used to share power with other devices, such as charging other electric vehicles, devices or power tools.\n\nThe vehicles include four 120-volt outlets, two in the cabin and two in the cargo bed. The bed also includes a 240-volt outlet.\n\nThe vehicle is able to plug into a Tesla Powerwall, or a regular house with equipment that is sold separately. Tesla claims the vehicle could help power a home for about three days.\n\n-Kara Carlson 3:35p.m.\n\nHow much will Cybertrucks cost?\n\nFollowing the event, Tesla has dropped pricing and other information for three Cybertruck models, with prices ranging between $60,000 and nearly $100,000. They will start deliveries in 2024 and 2025.\n\nRear-wheel drive\n\nPrice: $60,990\n\nAvailable in 2025\n\n250 mile range\n\nAble to go 0-60 mph in 6.5 seconds\n\nAll wheel drive\n\nPrice: $79,990\n\nAvailable in 2024\n\n340 mile range\n\nTop speed: 112 mph\n\n600 horsepower\n\n7,436 lb-ft torque\n\n11,000 lb towing capacity.\n\nCyberbeast\n\nPrice: $99,990\n\nAvailable in 2024\n\n320 mile range\n\n0 to 60 mph in 2.6 seconds\n\nTop speed: 130 mph\n\n845 horsepower\n\n10,296 lb-ft torque\n\n11,000 lb towing capacity\n\nDeposits are being taken to get on a list for order.

Each owner got in their truck, and could be briefly seen riding off with a driver.\n\nAlexis Ohanion, a co-founder of Reddit and perhaps more famously known as the husband of Serena Williams, was one of the new owners to receive his truck.\n\n-David Dishman, 2:58 p.m.\n\nDeliveries of the Cybertruck begin\n\nDeliveries are now beginning at the event.\n\n“We are handing over production cybertrucks to their actual owners,” Musk said.\n\n“It’s going to be amazing to see all these cars driving around,” Musk said. “This is really going to change the look of the roads.”\n\n-Kara Carlson, 2:50 p.m.\n\nIs the Cybertruck faster than a Porsche?\n\nA video shown at the event indicated the Cybertruck could tow a Porsche at a race track faster than the Porsche could drive itself.\n\nMusk claimed the truck could go from 0-60 mph in 2.6 seconds\n\nHow accurate the video is, remains unclear. There was no live demonstration of the truck's speed.\n\n-David Dishman, 2:45 p.m.\n\nMusk boasts about performance capacity\n\n2,500-pound pay load\n\nCan tow 11,000 lbs\n\n6' long, 4' wide bed\n\n-Kara Carlson, 2:38 p.m.\n\nDurability of the Cybertruck first thing to be highlighted\n\nMusk starts off talking about the truck’s material. He said the steel is made to have no corrosion, didn’t need paint, but could still be made at volume.\n\nMusk said the shape is because you can’t stamp the body panels. The exoskeleton has more torrosional stiffness than a Mclaren.\n\nIn callback to the original launch in 2019, designer Franz Von Holzhausen throws a steel ball at the Cybertruck window, this time not shattering it.\n\n-Kara Carlson 2:36 p.m.\n\nElon Musk arrives on stage in a Cybertruck\n\nJust before 2:30, Elon Musk arrived on stage in a Tesla Cybertruck. He quickly began to hype the truck, emerging from the vehicle to a round of applause.\n\nIts \"more utility than a truck\" while also being \"faster than a sports car,\" according to Musk's presentation.\n\n-David Dishman, 2:30 p.m.\n\nFuturistic video leads off the Cybertruck event\n\nNo, your live stream is not broken.\n\nMore than 20 minutes after the posted start time, the live broadcast continued to be a futuristic-looking, stylized video of what appears to be parts of the Cybertruck in space. No one has been on to discuss the truck at this point.\n\n-David Dishman, 2:20 p.m.\n\nWhat Cybertruck could mean for Austin\n\nThe event is kicking off now.\n\nAhead of the event, I talked to Dan Ives, an industry analyst with Wedbush Securities, who said the event is like “the Super Bowl” for Tesla’s Austin facility.\n\nIt's about cutting the ribbon and the unveiling of a process that's been four years in the making,” Ives said. “It puts a major spotlight on Austin because the success of Cybertruck rests on the Austin Gigafactory.”\n\nIves also warned production remains the “biggest hurdle” that other automakers are going to be watching closely.\n\n- Kara Carlson, 2 p.m.\n\nTesla to launch long awaited Cybertruck\n\nToday Austin-based Tesla is expected to kick off an event to launch the long-awaited Cybertruck around 2 p.m. CT. The company is expected to unveil the latest version of the Cybertruck and deliver the first batch of vehicles — hopefully this time without shattering any windows in the process.\n\nThis follows years of delays following Tesla’s unveiling of the original Cybertruck prototype in 2019. The vehicle’s futuristic and militaristic design has gained mixed opinions from the start.\n\nHow to watch\n\nTesla held a drawing to select what shareholders were invited to attend the event in person at the company’s massive Austin-area facility Giga Texas. For the rest of us, Tesla will be streaming the event live on the company’s website.\n\n-Kara Carlson\n\nMusk's mixed signals ahead of the event\n\nMusk has said he expects the truck to be Tesla’s “best product ever.” But the CEO has also repeatedly downplayed expectations and said Tesla expects “enormous challenges” related to scaling up Cybertruck production.”\n\n“We dug our own grave,” Musk said on an investor call earlier this month.\n\nMusk hasn’t said many specific details about what production issues Tesla has been facing. I’m hoping to hear more about what this scale up could look like today, and what that could mean for the Austin facility.\n\n-Kara Carlson\n\nCybertruck fast facts before its launch day event\n\nThe Cybertruck is being produced in Tesla’s Austin-area facility\n\nThe Cybertruck was first announced in 2019\n\nDelays in production pushed back the expected launch date numerous times in recent years\n\nAt the time it was announced, no other electric trucks were on the market, but Ford, Rivian, and GMC have all released models since then\n\nMusk says the company will be able to produce 250,000 Cybertrucks in Austin in 2025\n\nMusk has warned a ramp up to full production could have challenges\n\nKey information such as updated pricing and specs have yet to be released\n\n-Kara Carlson", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/business/2023/12/01/price-speed-and-other-cybertruck-features-revealed-by-tesla-elon-musk/71759124007/", "title": "Price, speed, and other Cybertruck features revealed by Tesla, Elon ...", "text": "After years of delays, Tesla's Cybertruck made its official debut Thursday.\n\nThe event, which was held in Austin, where the trucks are made, follows years of delays since Tesla’s unveiling of the original Cybertruck prototype in 2019.\n\nThe pickup marks the first truck for Tesla, which moved its headquarters to its Austin facility in 2021.

This was all by design − a carefully managed pop-up retail event where he stayed for more than 90 minutes posing for pictures with fans and signing autographs, even signing his name on one man’s cheek and another’s bald head.\n\n\"One thing he understands is he has to touch base with the people,\" Sanders’ business partner Bam Hogue told USA TODAY Sports. \"He has to deal with the people. He’s not just about social media. It’s about actually meeting people in real life and meeting your supporters.\"\n\nBy the time he left, Sanders − son of Colorado head football coach Deion Sanders − had helped sell nearly $15,000 in merchandise under his signature brand: SS2 Legendary, according to a Hogue’s estimate. Hundreds of people had come through and waited to see him during the three-hour pop-up, including two on the way to the Denver airport and another woman who had come all the way from Florida.\n\nFew other athletes in college sports could pull this off, besides his Colorado teammate Travis Hunter, the two-way star who held his own pop-up retail event Saturday at a different restaurant. It was NIL in action at an elite level – college athletes organically profiting off their names, images and likenesses by using their own brand to sell products and their own social media accounts to promote the event.\n\nShedeur Sanders – NIL money machine\n\nThe NCAA didn’t even allow college athletes to profit from their NIL until 2021. But Shedeur and his business team have shown how to master it, generating the buzz and demand for a pop-up retail event by promoting it on Instagram to his 1.8 million followers. It shows why Shedeur ranks No. 1 in college sports in NIL valuation at $4.6 million, according to projections by sports website On3. Hunter ranks fourth at $2.6 million.\n\nShedeur’s event was held at Peckish, a chicken wings restaurant with an upstairs bar area where he was allowed to set up his retail business free of charge in exchange for bringing all those customers into the establishment.\n\nOne man came over on the way to the Denver airport after seeing it promoted on Instagram.\n\n\"A lot of quarterbacks wouldn’t even come out and do an event like this,\" said Manny Lopez, who came down from the Fort Collins area. \"I think it’s cool that he comes out and meets with his fans.\"\n\nGrowth of the Shedeur Sanders brand\n\nLopez had purchased shirts at the pop-up store upstairs, where they sold for $40 ($60 for long sleeves). Hoodies and football jerseys cost $80. Trucker hats cost $40, and wristbands sold for $10.\n\nMuch of the merchandise comes with the Sanders logo: $2. That’s a dollar sign (or his initial \"S\") combined with his jersey number at Colorado, where Sanders played in the annual spring game the next day.\n\nShedeur Sanders’ brand also has something else that sets it apart − a licensing deal to use Colorado’s own marks on the merchandise. Hogue said they’re paying around 12% in royalties for any merchandise sold with a Colorado logo.\n\n\"His brand has started from nothing to something like this,\" said Hogue, who knew Shedeur from Dallas, near where he grew up. \"It’s almost like a dream come true man.\"\n\nHogue said they also did pop-up events like this at Jackson State, where Shedeur played before he transferred to Colorado last year. This was only their second pop-up retail event in Boulder, however. And it was rife with colorful moments, including the scene outside the restaurant when Shedeur’s brother Shilo arrived in his own Tesla Cybertruck and had it parked on the street in front of Shedeur’s.\n\nShedeur Sanders autographed several heads\n\nAt one point, a young man asked Shedeur Sanders to sign his right cheek. Sanders obliged, but the ink soon smeared. After another man asked the quarterback to sign his forehead, Sanders tried but struggled.\n\n\"Ah, he’s sweating too much!\" Sanders said with a laugh. The ink wouldn’t stick to the sweaty skin.\n\nOne restaurant worker did successfully get Sanders to autograph the side of his bald head and proudly posed for pictures afterward.\n\nElsewhere in the crowd, videographers were asking fans to sign forms granting them permission to be filmed as part of the ongoing documentary series project about Deion Sanders. This indicates a third season of \"Coach Prime\" is in the works after the previous two seasons of the documentary series streamed on Amazon.\n\n\"Please be advised that SMAC Productions, Inc., is filming scenes and background material in this area, related to the production of the project currently entitled 'Coach Prime,'\" said a notice taped to the wall in the restaurant stairs.\n\n'He takes care of everybody'\n\nBefore Shedeur pulled up in his Cyberbeast, Kimberly English, a woman from Sanford, Florida, waited for his arrival downstairs after buying five shirts and four wristbands. She came to town for the spring game and also went to Atlanta to see Deion Sanders on his recent book tour.\n\n\"I’m just a big fan of theirs,\" English said.\n\nAfter Shedeur arrived, she went upstairs to get his autograph, where he patiently smiled and signed countless items, in addition to obliging all the photo requests that bombarded him in the warm crowded environment.\n\nHogue called him a \"humble young man.\"\n\n\"He takes care of everybody around him,\" he said. That includes two of his new offensive linemen at Colorado who came to the event Friday to see him – Indiana transfer Kahlil Benson and UTEP transfer Justin Mayers.\n\nHogue said more pop-ups with Shedeur are planned for the fall football season, his last one in college before he is expected to be a first-round draft pick in 2025.\n\nFollow reporter Brent Schrotenboer @Schrotenboer.

It might as well have been stitched together with paper towels and duct tape, and it usually leaves the wearer’s behind hanging out.\n\n“They are horrible. They are demeaning. They are belittling. They are disempowering,” said Camilla McRory of Olney, Md., who has had multiple hospital stays.\n\nBut if efforts by some health systems are an indicator, the design may be on its way out of style.\n\nThe Cleveland Clinic was an early trendsetter. In 2010, it introduced new gowns after being prompted by its chief executive, who often heard patient complaints about the garment when he was a practicing heart surgeon. That feedback led to a search for something new, said Adrienne Boissy, the Cleveland Clinic’s chief experience officer.\n\nThe prominent academic medical center ultimately sought the help of fashion icon Diane von Furstenberg, settling on a reversible gown with a front and back V-neck, complete derriere coverage and features such as pockets, softer fabric and a new bolder print pattern.\n\nPatients “loved the gowns,” Boissy said. “People felt much more comfortable in the new design, not just physically but emotionally.”\n\nThe redesign is part of a trend among hospitals to improve patient reviews and their own bottom lines, fueled in part by such federal initiatives as the Affordable Care Act’s focus on quality of care. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services increasingly factors patient satisfaction into its quality measures, which are linked to the Medicare payments that hospitals get.\n\nSometimes the efforts involve large capital improvement projects. But they can also mean making waiting rooms more comfortable, improving the quality of food served to patients and even updating hospital gowns. Ultimately this focus leads to “a better patient experience,” said John Combes, senior vice president of the American Hospital Association.\n\nThe Detroit-based Henry Ford Health System is updating its gowns, an initiative that began when the system’s innovation institute challenged students at the city’s College for Creative Studies to identify and offer a solution to one hospital problem.\n\nThe students responded with a suggestion to redo the uncomfortable, flimsy gown. The process took three years, but last fall the institute unveiled a new and improved version. It’s made of warmer fabric – a cotton blend – that wraps around a patient’s body like a robe and comes in navy and light blue, the hospital’s signature colors.\n\nPatient expectations are also part of the calculus. They “are demanding more privacy and more dignity,” which is sparking hospitals’ growing focus on redesigning gowns, said Michael Forbes, a product designer at the institute who developed the gown that the students inspired.\n\nWhen the institute tested his design in 2013, patient-satisfaction scores increased noticeably in a few days, Forbes said.\n\nThe new gown “was emblematic . . . of an attitude that was conveyed to me at the hospital – that they cared about me as a whole human being, not just the part they were operating on,” said Dale Milford, who received a liver transplant at Henry Ford Hospital while the gown redesign was being tested. “That was the subtext of that whole thing, was that they were caring about me as a person and what it meant for me to be comfortable.”\n\nReplacing the traditional design is more complicated than it might seem. What patients wear needs to be comfortable yet allow health professionals proper access during exams, meaning it needs to open and close easily. The gowns also need to be easily mass-manufactured, as well as efficiently laundered and reused.\n\nNew designs, though, can be expensive. After Valley Hospital of Ridgewood, N.J., switched to pajamas and gowns that provide extra coverage, for instance, costs went up $70,000 per year, said Leonard Guglielmo, the facility’s chief supply chain officer, because the new garments cost more to buy and maintain.\n\nAt the same time, the hospital culture can be slow to change, said Todd Lee, an assistant professor of medicine at McGill University, who co-authored a 2014 study that looked at whether gowns were important and whether patients might be fine wearing their own or hospital-provided pants, instead of or along with gowns.\n\nOften, doctors reported that pants or undergarments beneath gowns would have been okay, but patients said they were never given those options. Traditional gowns make it easier to examine patients quickly, and several doctors Lee spoke to seemed shocked at the idea that patients might wear garments other than the open-backed gown during their stay.\n\nThe most common impediment to rethinking the gown, said Dusty Eber, president of PatientStyle, a California-based company that designs alternative gowns, is that hospital decisions are often made by committees, not individuals.\n\n“There’s a lot of bureaucratic runaround,” Eber said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/04/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/memphis200/2019/04/17/memphis-bicentennial-history-trivia/3301701002/", "title": "Memphis Bicentennial: Here are 200 Bluff City historical facts", "text": "Memphis — the city established on the bluffs of the Mississippi River and named after an ancient capital on the Nile delta — turns 200 this year.\n\nIn recognition of this bicentennial, here are 200 markers along the road of history that led to the present day.\n\nThe events cited range from the comic to the tragic, from the risible to the world-shaking, from the all-but-forgotten to the never-to-be-forgotten. But they barely scratch the surface of the rich, silty soil that enabled Memphis to become \"the Hardwood Capital of America,\" to cite just one of the city's nicknames.\n\nIn other words, this is not a definitive Memphis timeline. With a few exceptions, it ignores music and sports (which will be celebrated by this newspaper later in the year with their own bicentennial tributes). You will have complaints about omissions. But we hope you will enjoy or appreciate the inclusions.\n\nSo, here it is — a Memphis 200 for a Bluff City Bicentennial.\n\n1. May 22, 1819: Modern Memphis is founded by planter and judge John Overton, Revolutionary War officer James Winchester and future president Andrew Jackson, a year after the federal government purchased the territory from the Chickasaw Nation in negotiations partly led by Jackson. Planned as a grid of streets along the river, the city is named for a former great river town, the ancient capital of Egypt.\n\n2. Progress was slow. \"From its founding in 1819 until about 1840, Memphis was a primitive and pestilential little mudhole striving to survive as a town.\" — John E. Harkins, \"Metropolis of the American Nile,\" 1982.\n\n3. The city's founding came 270 years after the first Memphis-area encounter between American Indians and Europeans, led by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto. Both France and Spain would build forts on the \"Chickasaw bluffs\" in the 18th century.\n\n4. Memphis' first grand jury indictment arrives in 1820, when Patrick Meagher is charged with two counts of assault and battery after indulging in too much \"fire water\" and brawling with bartenders. His fine: $2.\n\n5. 1826: Encouraged by Memphis Mayor Marcus Winchester, Davy Crockett is elected to the U.S House of Representatives, representing Tennessee's 9th Congressional District — the seat (with very different boundaries) later held by Harold Ford and Steve Cohen.\n\n6. Memphis' oldest noise ordinance, from 1827, prohibits \"whooping, halloo-ing and swearing loudly,\" punishable by a $5 fine — or $10, if the offense occurs on a Sunday.\n\n7. In Memphis, traffic problems predate automobiles: An 1837 law makes driving a horse-drawn conveyance \"faster than a trot\" punishable by a $10 fine.\n\n8. April 21, 1841: Henry Van Pelt publishes the first issue of The Appeal. The paper later merges or buys out the Monitor, the Western Mercury and the Avalanche; in 1894, it is renamed The Commercial Appeal.\n\n9. 1848: Free public school opens.\n\n10. 1851: Nathan Bedford Forrest moves to Memphis and opens a slave trading company, one of a dozen in the city during the decade.\n\n11. March 15, 1851: Memphians pay an astronomical $20 per ticket to see Jenny Lind, the so-called \"Swedish Nightingale,\" perform at Odd Fellows Hall. Her manager for the tour: P.T.

Wells makes an international reputation: \"Miss Ida B. Wells is a negress, a young lady of little more than twenty years of age, a graceful, sweet-faced, intelligent, courageous girl. She hails from Memphis, Tenn.

Ellett, grandly introduces the 24th president of the United States and then promptly drops dead on stage. The newspaper calls it “one of the saddest incidents that ever characterized a gala occasion,\" and offers this recounting: \"Judge Ellett was placed upon the platform, his shoes removed, and all that mortal effort and medical science could suggest applied to bring resuscitation. It was useless, his spirit had fled.\"\n\n32.

In about 1901, Natch the black bear — who over a century later would be weirdly reimagined as NBA mascot Grizz’s chief romantic rival — is put on display in Overton Park, stoking the public interest that results in the April 1906 founding of the Memphis Zoo. Natch, who lived chained to a tree, is poisoned by a bruincidal maniac in 1906; his head is removed, stuffed and put on display at the zoo, but reportedly is petted and hugged so often by the Natch-loving public that it literally falls to pieces.\n\n38. Prohibition advocate Carrie Nation, notorious for attacking bars and taverns with her signature hatchet, makes the rounds of several Memphis saloons on Oct. 23, 1902.

Binford is appointed head of the Memphis Censor Board; he reigns as America's most inflexible, eccentric and subjective censor until 1955, banning movies with Charlie Chaplin (\"a London guttersnipe\") and Ingrid Bergman (due to her \"notorious adultery\"), and penning the types of condemnations that transformed the targets of his ire into instant must-sees. Banning David O. Selznick's \"Duel in the Sun\" in 1947, Binford wrote: \"It is sadism at its deepest level. It is the fleshpots of Pharaoh, modernized and filled to overflowing.

Reviewing Elvis' acting debut in \"Love Me Tender\" in 1956, an unimpressed Time magazine critic wrote: \"Is it a sausage? It is certainly smooth and damp-looking, but who ever heard of a 172-pound sausage, 6 feet tall? Is it a Walt Disney goldfish? It has the same sort of big, soft beautiful eyes and curly lashes, but who ever heard of a goldfish with sideburns?\"\n\n79. Known for his black outfits, Bogart sneer and prowess with a bullwhip, movie cowboy Lash LaRue is arrested for buying and concealing stolen property — sewing machines — in connection with car thefts that occur while he is a \"Wild West\" performer at the 1956 Mid-South Fair.

Its striking modern design by Memphis architect Roy Harrover now partially obscured by an ugly parking garage, the current Memphis International Airport terminal opens on June 7, 1963.\n\n88.

A beloved and seemingly ubiquitous harbinger of summer from the 1960s through the mid-1970s, the Memphis-born circular ice-cream delivery vehicle known as the \"Merrymobile\" roams the streets at a puttering 15 mph, making it easy prey for loose change-wielding, popsicle-craving urchins.

Opening night movies include \"The Glass Bottom Boat,\" with Doris Day, and \"How to Stuff a Wild Bikini.\"\n\n97. 1967: Inspired by Oakland's Black Panthers, young Memphis militants organize a \"black power\" group called the Invaders.

Feb. 12, 1968: Some 1,375 city workers do not show up for their jobs, launching the sanitation strike.\n\n101.

About a dozen Memphis and Shelby County library titles — including \"Valley of the Dolls,\" \"Myra Breckenridge\" and \"Portnoy's Complaint\" — are placed off limits to readers under 18 in the summer of 1969 after Mayor Henry Loeb attended a library board meeting and \"shooed all women out of the room and read aloud passages he had underlined in red ink\" from \"Portnoy,\" according to The Commercial Appeal.

Visionary Memphis State University theater director Keith Kennedy courts controversy and causes a sensation in March 1970 by staging a student production of Broadway's Age-of-Aquarius \"tribal love-rock\" musical, \"Hair\" — the first licensed production outside New York. One compromise: In Memphis, no nudity.\n\n112. May 21, 1970: Inspired by the new availability of liquor-by-the-drink, Memphis investors open the first Friday's restaurant and bar outside of New York, spurring what would become the Overton Square-centered nightlife explosion of the next two decades.

Prior to that decision by Pope Paul VI, the entire state of Tennessee had been encompassed by the Diocese of Nashville.\n\n114. 1971: Outraged by the use of nude models and an exhibition of nude photography at Memphis College of Art (then known as the Academy of Art), brick mason Newton C. Estes kidnaps the 14-year-old son of art instructor Richard Batey, in order to force the school to remove the offending pictures. College officials quickly comply, and the boy is released unharmed two hours later.\n\n115. March 1971: In a victory for the citizens who organized to fight plans to extend Interstate 40 through Overton Park, the U.S. Supreme Court overturns decisions by district and appellate courts and rules that the federal Secretary of Transportation had failed to demonstrate the lack of “feasible and prudent” alternatives to the park route, as required by a 1966 highway bill intended to protect public spaces. The decision preserves the park.\n\n116. June 7, 1971: After years in Ellis Auditorium, professional wrestling relocates to the Mid-South Coliseum, attracting 9,253 fans for opening-night matches showcasing such suplex superstars as Tojo Yamamoto, Bearcat Brown, the Fabulous Moolah, Len Rossi and Sputnik Monroe.

In what comes to be regarded as a revolutionary moment in the history of photography, an exhibit of color work by William Eggleston goes on display on May 24, 1976, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, establishing the Memphis photographer as arguably the Bluff City's most influential artist outside the realm of music.\n\n125. Nov. 23, 1976: A pistol-toting and inebriated Jerry Lee Lewis is arrested after pulling up to the gates of Graceland in a new Lincoln Continental and demanding to see Elvis.

Hooks of Memphis becomes national executive director of the NAACP.\n\n127. Jan. 15, 1977: Three months after hitting No. 1 with his novelty dance hit \"Disco Duck,\" Memphis deejay Rick Dees — recording as \"Rick Dees and His Cast of Idiots\" — releases a follow-up single, \"Dis-Gorilla.\" Even an appearance on \"The Brady Bunch Hour\" that finds Dees introduced by the kids from \"What's Happening!!\" and performing in front of a pair of swinging King Kong arms couldn't lift the song above No. 56 on the Billboard pop charts.\n\n128. The Memphis in May International Festival is organized in 1977. The first \"honored country\" is Japan.\n\n129. Out of office less than five months, former president Gerald Ford sinks a hole-in-one during the June 1977 pro-am portion of the Danny Thomas Memphis Classic golf tournament at Colonial Country Club.

Hundreds of National Guardsmen are assigned to Memphis in the summer of 1978 after police officers and firefighters go on strike. On July 1, 1,400 firefighters walk off the job; that same day, 45 fires occur in four hours, inspiring a front-page editorial in The Commercial Appeal: \"The rash of vandalism and harassment that accompanied the strike is contrary to the public image of Memphis firemen. It comes as an ugly shock.\" The next month, police also go on strike.\n\n134. 1979: Adrian Rogers, senior pastor at Bellevue Baptist Church, is elected to the first of the three terms he will serve as president of the Southern Baptist Convention.

April 5, 1982: Wrestler Jerry Lawler \"injures\" comedian/wrestler Andy Kaufman with a \"piledriver\" move at the Mid-South Coliseum, a highlight of a still much talked-about feud that reaches its apex in July when Lawler slaps Kaufman's face on \"Late Night with David Letterman.\"\n\n142.

Organized by a coalition of bar owners, restaurateurs and devotees of blarney that calls itself \"Irish Eyes of Memphis,\" the St. Patrick's Day \"pub crawl\" reaches its bacchanalian height (or depth) in 1982, when an estimated 50,000 revelers stagger from Main Street to Overton Square in search of green-dyed beer. Legal fees and other complications eventually reduce the event to its current manageable form, a parade on Beale.\n\n146. 1982: The Mud Island river park opens to the public, complete with concert amphitheater and monorail transportation between the park and the \"mainland.\" Its most impressive aspect may be its \"Riverwalk,\" a scale reproduction of the 954 miles of the lower Mississippi River, with \"every sandbar, oxbow, and topographic contour faithfully reproduced in cement,\" according to Roadside America. Starting at \"Cairo, Illinois,\" the Riverwalk ends at a \"Gulf of Mexico\" that for several embarrassing years was rebranded as a Budweiser-sponsored water park named \"Bud Boogie Beach.\"\n\n147. When the New York Metropolitan Opera brings a touring performance of \"Macbeth\" that features a topless witch to the Auditorium North Hall on May 10, 1983, a group calling itself MASH — Memphians Against Social Harassment — stage a \"strip-in\" to protest the unequal enforcement of the city's anti-nudity ordinance.

The ordinance later is declared unconstitutional.\n\n148. \"Memphis — A Diamond in the Bluff'\" is the winning entry in a 1983 contest to pick a slogan for Memphis, sponsored by The Commercial Appeal and the Rotary Club.

Jan. 7, 1984: Restored to its former glory, The Orpheum — Main Street's historic \"palace\" of a theater — reopens with a public \"Champagne and Gershwin\" party. A harbinger of Downtown's revival, the theater was built in 1928, on the site of the Grand Opera House, which had burned to the ground in 1923.\n\n152. The bizarre and \"epic\" (in the characterization of The Commercial Appeal) Georgian Hills Day Care child sex abuse scandal dominates much of the news from 1984 to 1988 and results in the indictments of four adult workers in connection with the alleged molestations of at least 19 children. Eventually, all charges are dropped and the one conviction overturned, due in part to the implausibility of much of the testimony of the child witnesses (one boy said child victims were \"baptized to the devil\"). The investigation is now regarded as a textbook case of 1980s \"satanic panic.\"\n\n153. Sept. 5, 1986: In a predecessor to the current \"Mighty Lights\" display, the \"M\"-shaped structure of the Hernando de Soto Bridge (still referred to as \"the new bridge,\" if you're old) is illuminated with 200 sodium lights, following a fundraising campaign by fashion designer Pat Kerr Tigrett and developer Henry Turley.\n\n154. \"After we moved to Memphis, I don't recall Mother's ever once saying: 'A gentleman must always' do so and so. Or: 'A lady will never' do so and so ... The old delicate balance between her wild nature and her strict Presbyterian, genteel upbringing was gone in Memphis ... When we were all in the doldrums, she more than once said: 'I sometimes think a shooting in the family would have been better than a move to Memphis.'\" — Peter Taylor, \"A Summons to Memphis,\" which wins the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1987.\n\n155. 1988: Michael Hooks becomes the first black candidate elected to countywide office when he wins the race for assessor.\n\n156. 1989: Self-promoting promoter Sidney Shlenker makes a deal to take over Mud Island, announcing plans to convert the river park to a $100 million entertainment complex called \"Rakapolis,\" a name intended to suggest ancient Egypt and modern rock 'n' roll. Rakapolis was to come complete with a huge crystal sphinx, a \"time machine\" ride and a re-created Egyptian village. Shlenker — who already had the contract to manage the then-under-construction Pyramid arena — predicts 3 million visitors a year. For some reason, people believe him. Eventually, local government has to sue to regain control of the attractions.\n\n157. Commodities trader Charles D. McVean invests about $8 million into the development of a new type of \"horse\" racing: indoor Hackney pony races with remote-controlled robots for jockeys, the reins attached to the robots' tiny metal arms. \"You put 10,000 people in here with a six-pack of beer apiece, and then by God you've got something!\" McVean told the Wall Street Journal, during a test run at the Fairgrounds in 1989. The state Racing Commission rejects the idea.\n\n158. Memphians are all shook up when the news media hypes \"self-proclaimed climatologist\" Dr. Iben Browning's prediction that a major earthquake will rock the New Madrid Fault on Dec. 3, 1990. When the much-feared date arrives, Memphis fails to shake, rattle, or even roll, at least tectonically.\n\n159. Writing in his book \"Rythm Oil\" in 1991, Stanley Booth sticks up for the Bluff City when confronted by skeptics: \"I told them that in this century, Memphis, Tennessee, had changed the lives of more people than any other city in the world. I used, I regret to report, the phrase 'cultural influence' ... I never had a chance to tell them that, like it or not, they had shopped at supermarkets, eaten at drive-in restaurants, slept in Holiday Inns, and heard the blues because people in Memphis had found ways to convert these things into groceries.\"\n\n160. July 4, 1991: Constructed around the Lorraine Motel, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated, the National Civil Rights Museum is dedicated. It opens to the public in September 1991.\n\n161. Oct. 4, 1991: Former city schools superintendent W.W. Herenton is elected mayor, defeating incumbent Dick Hackett by 172 votes out of about 250,000 cast. (Proving joke candidates can make a difference, Robert \"Prince Mongo\" Hodges, who claimed to be a resident of a planet named Zambodia, received 2,921 votes.) The city's first elected black mayor, Herenton will be elected to five terms; he resigns in 2009 to pursue an unsuccessful bid for Congress.\n\n162. Memphis' distinctive Pyramid arena opens with a concert on Nov. 9, 1991. The headliners? The mother-and-daughter country act, the Judds.\n\n163. On Nov. 16, 1991, patrons burst like scalded cats from the doors of the Madison Avenue punk club, the Antenna, when shock rocker GG Allin lived up to his reputation and began flinging his own feces into the crowd. The cover charge: $5.\n\n164. \"They left Chickasaw Gardens and drove west with the traffic toward downtown, into the fading sun ... The warm, sticky, humid Memphis summer air settled in with the dark. Softball fields came to life as teams of fat men with tight polyester pants and lime-green and fluorescent-yellow shirts laid chalk lines and prepared to do battle. Cars full of teenagers crowded into fast-food joints to drink beer and gossip and check out the opposite sex.\" — John Grisham, \"The Firm,\" 1991.\n\n165. Lionel Linder, 60, editor of The Commercial Appeal since 1988, is killed in a 1992 New Year's Eve accident on Union Avenue when a drunk driver plows into his car. Linder spearheaded the campaign to bring President George H.W. Bush to Memphis in 1989 for an event on the newspaper's lawn, where Bush designated The CA as the first \"Point of Light\" in a program honoring the nation's volunteers.\n\n166. \"In his prime, he was one of the three greatest jazz pianists of all time,\" wrote critic Leonard Feather. He was Phineas Newborn Jr., whose classic albums include \"A World of Piano!\" (1961) and \"The Newborn Touch\" (1964). He is found dead of natural causes at his Memphis home on May 26, 1989, at the age of 57.\n\n167. 1992: \"Several visitors to a zoo exhibit called 'Dinosaurs Live!' asked for refunds after discovering that dinosaurs ceased to roam the Earth 65 million years ago,\" the newspaper reports, in a story about zoo patrons who expected to find real live dinosaurs when they attended an exhibit that actually featured motorized mechanical replica dinosaurs. \"People have watched too much Fred Flintstone,\" says zoo vice president Ann Ball.\n\n168. Artist Carroll Cloar, 79, who had been suffering from cancer, dies of a self-inflicted gunshot wound on April 10, 1993.

Feb. 11, 1994: Memphians wake to the warzone-like cracks of explosive timber after the region is blanketed by a devastating ice storm that snaps trees — at least one person is killed by a falling limb — and cuts power to close to 425,000 MLGW customers, some of whom are without electricity for 17 days.\n\n170. On April 7, 1994, the crew of a Federal Express DC10 flight leaving Memphis overpowers a hammer-wielding company employee and safely lands the plane after a hijacking-suicide attempt by Auburn Calloway, 42, a pilot facing termination for falsifying his job application. Calloway is sentenced to life terms for attempted murder and attempted air piracy; he said he planned to crash the aircraft so his family could collect his $2.5 million life insurance policy.\n\n171. On July 1, 1994, Memphis State University becomes the University of Memphis — the fifth name change since its founding in 1912 as the West Tennessee Normal School.\n\n172. Longtime WHBQ-TV kiddie-show host and toy store impresario Harold \"Happy Hal\" Miller, 74, dies on Nov. 28, 1997. From the 1950s to 1973, Miller was Memphis' answer to \"Captain Kangaroo\"; his hand-puppet sidekick was the blue-hued and taxonomically indeterminate \"Lil' Bow,\" described by Miller in a 1988 interview as a bow-tie-wearing \"cross between a mouse and a chipmunk-type thing.\"\n\n173. In 1998, University of Memphis student Kelly Chandler hangs a sheet on the wall of The Edge coffee shop in Cooper-Young and hosts a group of local filmmakers, who project their work on the sheet. This is the humble origin of what is now the region's largest film event, the Indie Memphis Film Festival.\n\n174. Downtown's gem of a baseball diamond, AutoZone Park, opens on April 1, 2000, with an exhibition game between the Memphis Redbirds and the St. Louis Cardinals.

Ben Affleck, Michael Jordan and Donald Trump are among the 15,327 who reportedly attend the Mike Tyson-Lennox Lewis heavyweight boxing match at the Pyramid on June 8, 2002.

In 2002, former Shelby County Public Defender A C Wharton is elected the first black mayor of Shelby County. In 2009, he is elected the 63rd mayor of Memphis, but he loses his 2015 re-election bid to Jim Strickland.\n\n178. During Elvis Week 2002, Sun Records founder Sam Phillips, then at the height of his leonine majesty, sits atop the base of a large upwardly tilted silver \"rocket\" ship during the Elvis Beale Street parade. The suggestion that this man is the literal father of rock 'n' roll is hard to miss.\n\n179. Nicknamed \"Hurricane Elvis,\" the most damaging wind storm in Memphis history strikes on July 22, 2003, toppling trees and telephone poles, cutting service to 340,000 homes and businesses, and introducing Memphians to the term \"derecho,\" which refers to a type of devastating straight-line wind.\n\n180. After some five years of planning, the $250 million FedExForum opens to the public with a Sept. 6, 2004, \"open house.\"\n\n181.

A movie about a North Memphis hustler who \"dares to dream the pimpossible dream\" (to quote Time magazine), Craig Brewer's future Oscar-winner \"Hustle & Flow\" has its Memphis premiere at the now vanished Muvico Peabody Place 22 on July 6, 2005. Police report that some 6,000 \"well-behaved\" fans crowd the red carpet to see such celebrities as Terrence Howard and Taraji P. Henson; producer John Singleton; members of Three 6 Mafia; Brewer (“resplendent” in a Girbaud denim suit, gold Versace sunglasses, straw cowboy hat and a 3-carat diamond ring that had belonged to Sam Phillips); and — incongruously — martial-arts star Steven Seagal.\n\n183. In a spectacular blast that attracts hundreds of spectators, the 50-year-old Baptist Memorial Hospital on Union Avenue — where Elvis was declared dead, among other historic happenstances — is razed at 6:45 a.m. on Nov. 6, 2005, by the controlled detonations of 600 pounds of explosives placed on six of the building's 21 stories.\n\n184.

Graceland is known for celebrity visitors, but on July 1, 2006, Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visits Elvis' home in the company of President George W.

An off-course manatee appears on Oct. 24, 2006, in Wolf River Harbor, some 720 miles north of its usual coastal habitat.

May 23, 2015: The Memphis in May Sunset Symphony ends its 39-year annual run at Tom Lee Park. The event was perhaps best known for its 17 years of “Ol' Man River,” the \"Showboat\" tune that was a centerpiece of the symphony until the 1998 retirement of James Hyter, the sonorous-voiced singer who each year led thousands of riverside revelers in multiple singalong encores.\n\n194. In association with nationwide actions organized by Black Lives Matter in response to the police killings of black civilians, almost a thousand protesters shut down the Interstate 40 bridge over the Mississippi River for close to four hours on July 10, 2016.\n\n195. Statues of Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest and Confederate president Jefferson Davis are removed from city parks on Dec. 20, 2017, following some political sleight of hand in which the city outfoxes statue advocates in the state legislature by selling the two parks to nonprofit Memphis Greenspace for $1,000 each.\n\n196.

WSFA-TV reports Temple Mishkan Israel has sat along Broad Street in Selma since 1899. Ronnie Leet, the temple’s current president, says he had his bar mitzvah there at age 13, and his sister was married there. He says he also remembers when there was a thriving Jewish community in Selma: The city has had three Jewish mayors, and, at its peak, the community included between 350 and 450 families. And though those numbers have significantly dwindled – there are just four remaining local active members in the congregation – Leet says they’re focused on ensuring the Jewish legacy continues. He says that starts with restoration of the temple, which needs a new roof and foundation repairs.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Alaskans who routinely pack knit caps and fleece jackets in summer were swapping them for sunscreen and parasols amid a prolonged heat wave late last week. Residents of Anchorage and other south-central cities completed a fifth week of above-normal temperatures, including a record-high 90 degrees Thursday in the state’s largest city. That high at Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport was 5 degrees above than the city’s previous record of 85 degrees. Kenai, Palmer and King Salmon also set or tied all-time high temperature records Thursday. Rick Thoman, a climate specialist at the University of Alaska Fairbanks’ Alaska Center for Climate Assessment and Policy, says the record high is both a weather story and part of the ongoing changing environment story. High ocean temperatures have played a role in keeping the state warm, he says.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: More than a century ago, the federal government gave this then-new state more than 10 million acres of land, with the stipulation that revenue from the sale or lease of the land be earmarked to support public education. But for at least two decades – and perhaps much longer – the leasing of more than 8 million acres of that land for cattle grazing appears to have benefited cattle ranchers more than public education. Ranchers this year pay just $2.76 a month to graze each cow on state land. It costs almost four times as much on privately owned Arizona land. And most other Western states charge ranchers four or five times as much. In 1997, the state Auditor General made recommendations for closing loopholes that had kept the rates too low. Few were implemented. The 1997 report noted that the law says the governor shall appoint a commission periodically to re-evaluate the rates. No such commission has been appointed.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state Department of Education has released results for the 2019 ACT Aspire exam showing some improvement in English and mixed results in math, science and reading. The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that the percentage of students scoring at “ready” or “exceeding ready” levels in English and reading improved in four grades but declined in four other grades. Math and science scores improved slightly in all but fifth and sixth grades. Students in grades three through 10 take the exams before the ACT college entrance exam is available for 11th-graders. Education Commissioner Johnny Key says the results show the state is headed in the “right direction.” Just half of national eighth-graders scored “ready” or better in reading, compared with 53.2% of Arkansas eighth-graders.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A new report finds the city’s homeless population 17% higher than two years ago, due partly to more people living in vehicles. The findings, released Friday by San Francisco’s Department of Homelessness & Supportive Housing, paint a picture of a city in crisis. The one-night count of homeless in January found more than 8,000 people on the streets. Nearly 1,200 were on the waiting list for shelter beds that week. Agency director Jeff Kositsky says he’s troubled by the growing number of people who seem to have jobs but still must live in vehicles. The report identified nearly 600 passenger RVs, vans and other vehicles that appeared inhabited. Other major counties in California also have reported steep increases. Last month Los Angeles County reported nearly 59,000 people without homes.\n\nColorado\n\nDurango: Forecasters say the monsoon in the state’s southwest could arrive later and be drier than average this summer. The Durango Herald reported Thursday that the monsoon typically arrives by mid-July, but weather patterns in the central U.S. indicate it might be delayed this year. The monsoon is a period during the summer when thunderstorms are common in the afternoon. National Weather Service meteorologist Chris Sanders says troughing is developing in the area where scientists usually expect a ridge of high pressure to move moisture. He says troughing can cause drier air and shut off moisture that produces storms in southwest Colorado. The area could see above-average temperatures later this month as a result.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A state board is divided over whether to add “chronic pain” as one of the approved conditions for registration in the state’s medical marijuana program. The Hartford Courant reports Connecticut is one of the few states with medical pot programs that do not include chronic pain as a condition warranting use of cannabis. The Medical Marijuana Program Board of Physicians made five additions last month to the list of eligible conditions, but it put off a decision on chronic pain. Board member Deepak Cyril D’Souza, a psychiatry professor at Yale University School of Medicine, opposes adding chronic pain, calling it a “very broad and poorly defined clinical entity.” Other board members disagree, including William Zempsky from Connecticut Children’s Medical Center, who suggests a requirement that patients first attempt other treatments before being approved for medical marijuana.\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: The University of Delaware announced its annual tuition hike Friday, ahead of the 2019-2020 academic year. Undergraduate tuition and fees will increase $600 to $14,280 for in-state students. Out-of-state students will pay $35,710, $1,400 more than last year. Each rate increased by about 4 percent, in line with tuition hikes of the past few years. Undergraduate students in the Lerner Business College, the College of Engineering and the nursing program are also subject to an additional charge designed to offset the higher costs of delivering certain programs to students. The estimated total cost for all undergraduates living on campus will increase $946 to $27,488 for in-state students, the university says. The total cost for out-of-state students will increase $1,746 to $48,918. These figures take into account tuition, mandatory fees and room and board.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Washington, D.C., Council may remove a district transit authority representative who lied about an independent ethics investigation into a colleague. News outlets report the council may vote Tuesday about removing Corbett Price as one of the city’s representatives to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority board. Price was on the ethics committee that commissioned an outside law firm to investigate allegations against councilman Jack Evans, who’s still under federal investigation. Price, Evans and Evans’ attorney lied about the investigation, saying the committee cleared Evans of any allegations. But Evans had been found guilty of failing to disclose a conflict of interest, something he later admitted when resigning as transit authority board chair. Price didn’t immediately return requests for comment.\n\nFlorida\n\nMelbourne: A Florida zoo is welcoming two rock hyrax pups. Brevard Zoo in Melbourne said in an email that Turnip and Radish were born Wednesday. Zoo officials say they don’t yet know the sex of the pups, and zoo guests won’t be able to see them. The zoo considers them ambassador animals that would only be brought out for educational programs. Rock hyraxes weigh about 8 pounds as adults. Zoo officials say rock hyraxes are the closest living relatives to elephants and manatees. The species is typically found in rocky habitats throughout Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Human hunting has led to population decline in some areas. Turnip and Radish join siblings Gnocchi and Hashbrown, who were born last year to parents Buffy and Fangs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Area libraries are offering open-air book borrowing, free computer usage and story hours al fresco. The Library on the Lawn and Pop-Up in the Park initiatives serve as temporary replacements for library branches that are under renovation and also benefit patrons who wouldn’t usually venture into a library building. The Atlanta-Fulton Public Library System and the nonprofit community development organization Central Atlanta Progress organized Library on the Lawn in Woodruff Park last summer and reopened in April. Roswell branch manager Julia Padgett organized Pop-Up in the Park in April after her branch closed for renovations. Staff provide a children’s story time, check out books and help register library cards in different parks each week.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Big Island officials plan to employ a group of goats to keep city spaces free of overgrowth. The Hawaii County Department of Parks and Recreation announced Friday that a pilot project using the goats will begin this month to clear an area of brush near Hilo soccer fields. Director of Parks and Recreation Roxcie Waltjen says goats are “natural weed whackers,” and putting them to work is good for both the environment and the animals. The county already works with an outside group to reduce the use of pesticides in city parks. Waltjen says that if the goats do a good job, they’ll be used for weed control in other areas of the island. The goats will be corralled, and a herder will oversee their efforts throughout the day.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State and federal officials have identified 6,700 square miles in the Gem State to test a plan that allows state participation in federal timber sales to pay for restoration work on private, state and federal lands. Gov. Brad Little announced last week that the U.S. Forest Service and state officials had identified landscape-scale projects in northern and west-central Idaho as part of a federal-state agreement called Shared Stewardship. The agreement is intended to improve forest health and decrease the risk of disease and catastrophic fires. Little also announced he’s appointing a 13-member advisory group composed of federal, state and local officials as well as logging and environmental groups to implement the agreement. Idaho is at the forefront of shared stewardship efforts, and the new efforts could ultimately become templates for other states.\n\nIllinois\n\nRockford: A trio of peregrine falcons have made their debut. The Rockford Register Star reports the chicks received identification bands during a Saturday ceremony. Peaches, Freddie VanTweet and Sweeney are believed to be among the first to hatch in the city. The federally protected birds of prey were extinct for decades in the Midwest. Mary Hennen, director of The Field Museum’s Chicago Peregrine Program, says the Rockford nest is the ninth where chicks were banded this year in Illinois. The birds’ names were chosen in a newspaper contest. Peaches was named after the World War II-era women’s baseball team the Rockford Peaches. Freddie VanTweet is after Toronto Raptors basketball player and Rockford native Fred VanVleet. And Sweeney honors Rockford Register Star columnist Chuck Sweeny, who died in May.\n\nIndiana\n\nVincennes: Renovation work has begun on an ornate, nearly century-old theater where comic Red Skelton first appeared on stage. Crews began demolition in June for new construction work at the Pantheon Theatre. The $2.4 million renovation and reuse project will turn the building into a shared workspace and business incubator called the Pantheon Business Theater. The Vincennes Sun-Commercial reports the project will include new plumbing and bathrooms, a redesign of the theater’s main stage as an event space and an open-concept shared workspace. The Renaissance Revival-style theater opened in 1921 in the city about 50 miles north of Evansville. The venue was the first stage on which Vincennes native Skelton performed, and it also hosted the Marx Brothers, Spike Jones and Duke Ellington.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: State Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig says the federal government will give Iowa a $1.5 million grant to install wetlands in targeted locations to improve water quality. The Environmental Protection Agency grant will help install up to six wetlands in the Middle Cedar River watershed. The project is designed to reduce the nitrogen content in the river. Naig says his department will work with Cedar Rapids, Cedar Falls, Waterloo and agriculture groups to design and implement the wetland areas. The areas will be seeded with pollinator-friendly plants to attract bees, butterflies and other pollinator species in addition to providing a filtering mechanism for nitrogen that comes from fertilizer placed on cornfields. Naig says his staff, city officials and industry associations are identifying potential project locations.\n\nKansas\n\nJoplin: A recently awarded grant will help local teachers who are Hispanic or who teach in districts with large Hispanic populations. The Joplin Globe reports that the Laura Bush 21st-Century Librarian program awarded Pittsburg State University’s College of Education a $530,281 grant to provide scholarships, mentoring and laptops to 25 teachers from Kansas, Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas. University officials said school districts in those four states have experienced significant growth in their Hispanic populations in the past five years. The project to be funded by the grant is called Building Bridges Across Cultures. It will enable 25 future school librarians to earn master’s degrees online with an emphasis in library media.\n\nKentucky\n\nFranklin: A thoroughbred retirement organization says it will close a satellite division based at a racetrack in southern Kentucky. Old Friends officials say the division based at the Kentucky Downs track in Franklin will close at the end of July. It says the Franklin operation is home to seven Old Friends retirees, including Canadian Horse of the Year Thornfield, Kentucky Turf Stakes winner Rumor Has It, and Grade 2 winner Ball Four. The Franklin division opened to the public in June 2015, and tours were scheduled and conducted by staff at the Simpson County tourism office. Old Friends officials say the seven retired horses will be returned to the organization’s Georgetown farm in central Kentucky. The horses are currently expected to ship July 25.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The Zydeco Scream roller coaster stands motionless, as does the Big Easy Ferris Wheel. Scampering rabbits, slithering snakes and lurking alligators are the only visitors to the abandoned Six Flags amusement park on the city’s eastern edge – perhaps the most high-profile, lingering and ghostly reminder of Hurricane Katrina’s devastation. Ever since the levees failed and flooded the city with water in 2005, the park has stood empty, creating a nuisance for neighbors, a target for graffiti artists and an eerie landmark for sightseers. Now the city’s mayor says she’s getting close to tearing it all down. Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s office says an assessment is currently being done to determine the best use for the site, and the administration is committed to improving the quality of life for residents of New Orleans East.\n\nMaine\n\nWestbrook: An iconic sign that has stood for nearly 60 years is now a national historic landmark. The sign was built in 1962 by Al Hawkes for his TV repair business and recording studio on Route 302. Dubbed the “Walking Man,” the sign featured a 13-foot TV repairman with a mechanically moving arm and toolbox. The sign has endured even though the business closed long ago. Hawkes died Dec. 28, 2018. The Westbrook Historical Society and members of the community worked to get the sign designated as a landmark. The National Park Service granted the request to place the sign on the National Register of Historic Places on May 31.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Voters in the state will no longer be required to identify themselves as male or female when they register to vote. The Baltimore Sun reports that the Maryland State Board of Elections will soon allow voters to choose “X” or “unspecified” as a gender when they fill out voter registration forms. The new option comes after the state moved recently to give Marylanders a third option for gender on their driver’s licenses. Elections officials say the change can be made without any costs incurred. Existing paper forms that only offer the option of “male” and “female” will be used until they run out, and new forms will contain the third option. The state elections board voted unanimously in favor of the change last week.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is conducting a well-being check on a reclusive salamander. Volunteers and staff from MassWildlife’s endangered species program plan to survey areas of the state where spring salamanders have been known to live. Once considered rare, spring salamanders were removed from a state list of species of special concern in 2006. Officials now want to reassess the health of the species, particularly amid concerns about how climate change may affect cold water streams in higher elevations of southern New England. That’s where the salamanders typically reside, and they aren’t very fond of attention, spending much of their lives hiding under large, flat stones in remote and hard-to-reach areas. Spring salamanders are often pinkish or orange in color with faint black spots. They can grow up to 8 inches long.\n\nMichigan\n\nFlint: A science-and-history museum in the city is undergoing a roughly $26 million renovation to create more hands-on activities for children. The project is expanding the Sloan Museum of Discovery to better engage visitors with interactive exhibits. The plans include a new science center, an early childhood exhibit and an automotive gallery. The museum’s executive director, Todd Slisher, says the goal is to get children excited about science, history and technology. He says Flint needs stronger educational opportunities for children. Officials say the project is almost fully funded. They still need to raise about $4 million to cover renovation costs. The museum held a groundbreaking ceremony in June. Officials expect the museum to reopen in 2021.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state that calls itself the Land of 10,000 Lakes has a dock problem. Department of Natural Resources officials tell the Star Tribune they are seeing more people building platforms that are larger than the maximum allowable size of 170 square feet for a dock. Officials say the large docks can interfere with natural shoreline vegetation and affect fish spawning areas. DNR hydrologist Darrin Hoverson says the huge platforms also make people feel they are “in a city on the lake” and not “much in tune with nature.” Wildlife agents have not been assertive about enforcement. Rather than writing tickets and ordering cabin owners to dismantle docks, they are giving owners information about size regulations and asking them to change their dock configurations next year.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state Department of Archives and History is seeking items to tell the story of when liquor was illegal. An exhibition titled “Mississippi Distilled: Prohibition, Piety, and Politics” will open in March at the Museum of Mississippi History and the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson. Prohibition lasted in Mississippi from 1907 until 1966, but the exhibition will cover a longer period. The department says in a news release that it’s seeking Prohibition enforcement items, such as a uniform or badge from an officer involved in a raid. Collections director Nan Prince says museum officials are interested in “anything related to alcohol consumption and production in Mississippi,” including photos of taverns and saloons. They are also seeking artifacts related to temperance activists. To contribute, call 601-576-6930, or email collections@mdah.ms.gov.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Truman State University students and faculty might notice more stars in the sky when they return to campus this fall. KWMU-FM reports that after four years of research on how artificial light brightens the night sky, scientists are planning to change lighting on campus to direct light away from the sky. Light pollution prevents people from seeing stars and galaxies and can disrupt sleep patterns. Truman State gave a researcher a $10,000 grant to install shields on 60 outdoor light fixtures to direct light to the ground and away from the sky. The campus also will replace blue and white bulbs with bulbs that emit warmer colors, like yellow and red. NASA satellite imagery shows light pollution worldwide has increased over time, and scientists say it could get worse.\n\nMontana\n\nPhilipsburg: A local brewery has flowed into a new market by pouring its mountain-fresh spring water into resealable aluminum bottles. Philipsburg Brewing Co. began bottling Montana Silver Springs water last year and cornered a unique market when Xanterra Parks & Resorts sought out the company for water it could sell in Yellowstone National Park. “We just got a contract with them this year,” says Nolan Smith, co-owner of the brewery and Granite Mountain Water Works. “We’re distributing in the Greater Yellowstone Area right now and being very well accepted.” A portion of the sales in the park go to the Yellowstone Forever, a nonprofit that raises money to help fund park projects, the Billings Gazette reports. In 2016 Xanterra stopped selling water in plastic bottles out of concern for the environment.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Officials say transportation problems persist on county roads following massive floods this spring. The Omaha World-Herald reports that although most interstates and state roads have been cleared for use, damaged bridges and unending repairs still obstruct traffic outside major metropolitan areas. Heavy rain is to blame for the delay in road repairs. Officials also say they’re struggling to find contractors, equipment, fill dirt, gravel and money. Federal aid is expected to cover 75% of costs, while the state is responsible for 12.5%. Counties must come up with the rest. Scott Huppert, highway superintendent for Dodge County, says he took out a $5 million loan to pay contractors after he spent the department’s $4 million emergency fund. Total repair costs aren’t yet final because damage is still being assessed.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Authorities are cracking down on public nudity at Lake Tahoe beaches that have been considered clothing-optional for decades. Washoe County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Bob Harmon says the increase enforcement of clothing rules was prompted by a recent encounter deputies had with nude sunbathers. Harmon says nude men at Creek Beach made inappropriate and lewd gestures at deputies, leading to a confrontation. Harmon says he is not aware of any beaches in the state that are legally sanctioned to allow for nudity. Carson City Sheriff Ken Furlong says public nudity is against state and local laws, but enforcement at Lake Tahoe has not been a high priority. He says authorities did a sweep of the beaches Sunday, telling the nude to put on clothes.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nPortsmouth: A new program will offer training for military veterans who are small-business owners. The Veteran Owned Small Business Growth Training program will equip veterans with resources and networks to grow their businesses. Applicants must be a current business owner with at least one year of operation and one employee, as well as annual revenues of $75,000 or more. The 26-week program based in Portsmouth starts in September and will feature classroom and mentoring sessions. The program was recently announced by the U.S. Small Business Administration in a partnership with the Veteran Entrepreneurial Training and Resource Network.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The public is getting a chance to weigh in on the state’s business tax incentive drama that led to the program’s expiration this month. A task force investigating tax credits set up by Gov. Phil Murphy is set to hold its third hearing Monday. The public is invited to testify about the programs that have been at the center of a political and policy disagreement in New Jersey’s Democrat-led state government. Tax credits enacted under a 2013 bill expired July 1, and Murphy and lawmakers have disagreed over how to move forward. But the task force also concluded that special interests helped write the legislation to benefit stakeholders.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Environmental advocates are pushing for the state to change its policies around beavers – pesky animals they say provide ecological benefits for river and stream. The Santa Fe New Mexican reports that WildEarth Guardians and other groups want New Mexico wildlife officials to rethink how it manages beaver populations, including policy revisions on beaver removal and relocation. The push comes two months after Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham appointed seven new members to the State Game Commission, which is responsible for creating regulations regarding fish and wildlife in the state. The Department of Game and Fish doesn’t have current data about how many beavers live in New Mexico, but an agency document from about eight years ago estimated there were about 6,000 in the state.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state is offering up to $55 million in incentives for commercial and residential energy storage projects on Long Island. The funding, announced last week, is intended to reduce the costs of storage systems for renewable energy. Gov. Andrew Cuomo says the idea is to use the state’s resources to make it easier to expand Long Island’s use of green energy while also creating new energy-sector jobs. The money will be awarded over the next several years. State lawmakers earlier this year approved the nation’s most aggressive targets for reducing emissions and ramping up renewable energy sources. Officials say state incentives are a key way to leverage private investment and make New York state a leader in energy innovation.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nBuxton: More than 100 people gathered last week to mark the move of the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse 20 years ago. They praised the engineering feat of moving a 4,800-ton tower standing 198 feet tall over more than a half-mile of unstable sands in unpredictable winds. A few yards away, dozens of visitors lined up to climb the iconic black-and-white striped beacon while tickets were free for the day. Artifacts and photos from the move were on display in the restored keepers quarters close by. The National Park Service owns the lighthouse, and the Coast Guard still maintains the beacon that flashes seaward about 20 miles. The 1999 move took 23 days. The first day the lighthouse moved only 10 feet. A couple of days, it did not move at all. On July 1, it moved 355 feet, the most of any day.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: New exhibits on the moon landing and women’s suffrage are opening at the North Dakota Heritage Center and State Museum. The Bismarck Tribune reports that objects commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing will be on display until the end of July. The exhibit includes fragments of moon rocks and small state flags that were flown to the moon. The women’s suffrage exhibit will be open until summer 2020. Women first gained the right to vote in 1920 when the 19th Amendment was enacted. American Indian women were granted voting rights with citizenship in 1924.\n\nOhio\n\nJackson Center: The company that makes Airstream travel trailers will be representing the state at a White House showcase of American-made products. The Sidney Daily News reports the Made in America Product Showcase will be held July 15. The event is in its third year. A White House official said businesses from all 50 states will be present as Republican President Donald Trump seeks to highlight job creation. Airstream Inc. is based in Jackson Center, roughly 80 miles northwest of Columbus. The company was founded in 1931. Its 1,000 skilled employees customize Mercedes-Benz touring coaches and hand-build trailers, including the iconic Airstream “silver bullet” travel trailer. Airstream announced a factory expansion last year.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state Department of Transportation is starting a new office to focus on coordinating statewide efforts to expand mass transit. The Journal Record reports the Office of Mobility and Public Transit will take on the responsibilities of the department’s Transit Division. That includes oversight and management of public transit systems and the federal grants. Mobility and Public Transit will also work to develop a policy to address major expansions to the state’s current public transit networks, especially into rural Oklahoma. ODOT Executive Director Tim Gatz says organizing that policy will take about a year. Gatz says the new office will also work with the state auditor and inspector’s offices to determine where system improvements are needed.\n\nOregon\n\nKlamath Falls: An animal advocacy group has launched an online fundraising drive to help safely separate wolves and livestock. The Herald and News reports that KS Wild set up a GoFundMe account to raise money for an electric fence to keep wolves off private property in Prospect. The crowdsourcing drive by the Ashland-based group has raised more than $6,000 for the fencing that will stand 6 feet high. The fence is expected to cost about $45,000, with additional funding from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Oregon Department of Agriculture. Property owner Ted Birdseye says he has lost cows to an area wolf pack. The rancher has cared for wolf pups in the past, but he wants to keep his family and livestock safe.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state will allow school districts to turn school cancellations into school days by delivering lesson plans to students at home. The bill signed last week by Gov. Tom Wolf writes a three-year pilot program into law to let all school districts participate in the flexible instruction day program. Under the law, students do not physically attend school. Rather, they must get and complete lessons at home so that a flexible instruction day counts toward the 180 days of instruction currently required annually. The law caps a school’s flexible instructional days at five a year. A district that wants to participate must show the state Department of Education how it will record attendance, institute the program and accommodate students who lack the right technology at home, such as internet access.\n\nRhode Island\n\nSouth Kingstown: A dead llama discovered on a beach a week ago has been hauled away for burial, but authorities are not quite sure how it ended up there. The llama was spotted at the waterline of East Matunuck State Beach in South Kingstown on June 29. The carcass was loaded into a state Department of Environmental Management dump truck Wednesday for burial at the nearby Great Swamp Management Area. Marisa Coates, a veterinary paramedic for the state Department of Environmental Management, determined the animal didn’t have a microchip, showed no evidence of abuse and hadn’t been shot. Department spokesman Michael Healey tells The Providence Journal the town wanted the roughly 150- to 200-pound llama off the beach before the holiday weekend because it presented a health hazard.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGeorgetown: A retired tugboat is now the state’s latest artificial reef. The state Department of Natural Resources sank the tugboat Susan Richards about 30 miles off the coast from Georgetown last month. The tugboat will end up 120 feet underwater as part of the Vermilion Reef. The reef also includes a New York City subway car and a U.S. Navy troop transport ship. It’s home to a variety of fish, like snapper, grouper, jacks, triggerfish and Spanish hogfish. The state’s wildlife agency has been sinking items to create artificial reefs for more than 40 years. The items used for reefs also include bridge spans. The agency used fees from saltwater fishing licenses and donations from the Coastal Conservation Association of South Carolina to sink the tugboat.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: One of the country’s most popular tourist attractions is getting to the core of a multimillion-dollar upgrade. The Rapid City Journal reports that major construction projects at the Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota are scheduled to begin this week. The National Park Service says work will continue through much of 2020. Mount Rushmore spokeswoman Maureen McGee-Ballinger says the upgrades are designed to make it easier to traverse the park and provide clearer views of Gutzon Borglum’s sculpture, which features the faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. Many parts of the park will be closed during construction, including a visitor’s center and amphitheater. McGee-Ballinger says visitors will still have good views of the sculpture, and the finished product is “going to be beautiful.”\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A hospital system says it’s suspending legal actions against patients who have unpaid medical bills amid mounting public outcry over the practice. Methodist LeBonheur Healthcare is suspending the practice for the next 30 days as it reviews its policies. An investigative report by MLK-50 and ProPublica last week explored how the hospital has been suing low-income patients and employees over outstanding bills, even using the legal system to garnish their wages. Hospital system CEO Michael Ugwueke said in a Sunday opinion piece that the system only takes legal action when those who can pay refuse to do so. Shelby County court records show the system affiliated with the United Methodist Church filed more than 8,300 lawsuits from 2014 through 2018.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The latest state review of juvenile lockups shows no apparent improvement in operations, as inspectors found teenagers shouting obscenities at guards, little supervision, assaults and severe understaffing. The Houston Chronicle reports that the Office of the Independent Ombudsman for the Texas Juvenile Justice Department released findings last month showing troubling conditions continue at the agency’s five secure lockups. It was found that a power outage in April at the facility in Gainesville, long seen as having the most severe problems, led to a “chaotic scene” where juveniles ran freely around the dorms. Lawmakers this year approved a bump in pay for correctional officers. But juvenile justice experts says broader issues must be addressed, such as closing large facilities in favor of smaller ones that promote individualized therapy for troubled teens.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: The city has been chosen to host the U.S. Quidditch World Cup in 2021. Mayor Jackie Biskupski announced the selection Friday and said the city was chosen for its proximity to an airport and its walkable downtown area. The event is expected to host 84 teams and draw in more than 7,000 people. Quidditch is a full-contact sport inspired by the “Harry Potter” book series that combines elements of rugby, dodgeball and tag. Seven players per team mount brooms made of PVC pipes and attempt to score by throwing balls through tall hoops. The sport began in 2005 and has quickly spread to more than 300 school and community teams nationwide.\n\nVermont\n\nBarre: Gov. Phil Scott has returned to stock car racing at a local track after taking much of last year off. Vermont Public Radio reports that the Republican had opted not to race at Thunder Road in Barre last year after opponents of gun legislation that he signed into law in April 2018 threatened to demonstrate at the track. Scott says he didn’t want there to be protests. He says he didn’t want “to have the politics come into something that’s supposed to be there for entertainment and enjoyment.” He raced a few times at the end of the summer and has returned to Thunder Road on a regular basis this year. He recently won the main event at the track and says, “It’s good to be back.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Researchers say the breeding population of bald eagles along the James River has hit a new milestone. The Center for Conservation Biology announced Wednesday that this year’s survey of eagles nesting along the river found 302 pairs. In previous decades, the species had completely disappeared as a breeder along the river. The center says that makes the new milestone “particularly gratifying.” Eagle strongholds along the river include Charles City, James City, Surry and Prince George counties. The center is a research group within The College of William and Mary and Virginia Commonwealth University.\n\nWashington\n\nLongview: The state Department of Fish and Wildlife has closed all fishing on the Chehalis River until further notice due to lower-than-normal stream flows. The Daily News reports that the agency also closed fishing on South Fork Chehalis River, North Fork Newaukum River, South Fork Newaukum River and Skookumchuck River. The agency says streams and rivers where spring Chinook hold and stage through the summer are experiencing lower-than-normal stream flows. Low stream flows decrease holding and staging refuges and elevate vulnerability and pressure on the Chinook. Any encounters of spring Chinook could subject these fish to stress, injury or death, the agency says.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: A state agency says it is seeking an outside vendor to take over the foster care and adoption system. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the Department of Health and Human Resources released its bid for the managed care organization. The move is billed as a way to help streamline care for children in state custody and adoptive families. DHHR deputy secretary Jeremiah Samples says the 3.5-year contract would be about $200 million per year. The state’s move to an MCO comes after lawmakers passed a bill requiring DHHR to transfer children in foster care to an MCO by January 2020. This came after the Department of Justice threatened to sue the state over possible violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act within its foster system.\n\nWisconsin\n\nHurley: Six months after dropping its controversial nickname, a northern Wisconsin high school has a new moniker. The Hurley School Board decided to drop the Midgets nickname in January, after scrapping the idea of having a community vote on whether to dump the mascot. Wisconsin Public Radio reports that after a months­long community engagement effort, the team will now be known as the Hurley Northstars. A committee of 36 people, including students, teachers and parents, received 76 nominations for new mascots. A recent graduate who served on the committee, Ally Rye, says people were ready for the change. Multiple schools in the region are still nicknamed Midgets, including Butternut, Wisconsin; Freeburg, Illinois; Estherville, Iowa; and Dickinson, North Dakota.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: Coal workers who were locked out of their jobs after Blackjewel LLC filed for bankruptcy protection are wondering whether they’ll ever be called back to work. The Gillette News-Record reports the West Virginia-based company has 580 employees at two open-pit mines in northeastern Wyoming, Eagle Butte and Belle Ayr. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last week. About 1,700 Blackjewel workers were locked out nationwide. Melissa Peterson-Worden, who worked in a Blackjewel warehouse, says she and other workers were at first optimistic when company officials told them the bankruptcy would allow the business to reorganize and improve its position. She says workers were told a few hours later that something went wrong with financing the company was expecting, and they were told to go home.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/14/many-fish-hot-rocks-gun-insurance-news-around-states/39957761/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nTuscaloosa: Officials say they expect new arrangements between the University of Alabama and the city’s business incubator to help entrepreneurs and generate new jobs. The Tuscaloosa News reports that the Bama Technology Incubator, which features on-campus support for startup companies, will now be known as Edge Labs. Officials say the name change is significant, as it will emphasize the connection between Edge Labs on the northern end of UA’s campus and the Edge, an off-campus business incubator. The Edge opened in February as a collaboration among UA, the city of Tuscaloosa and the Chamber of Commerce of West Alabama.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Researchers have begun questioning whether there’s too much of a good thing in the waters of the North Pacific Ocean. Wild populations of pink salmon are flourishing. Their numbers are enhanced by the annual release of 1.8 billion fish from Alaska hatcheries, and critics say they’re having an effect on other species. Biological oceanographer Sonia Batten examined 15 years of data and noticed that zooplankton was abundant in even-number years and less abundant in odd-number years. That corresponds with even-odd variations in pink salmon abundance. University of Alaska professor emeritus Alan Springer sees reproduction effects on seabirds that also feed on zooplankton. State regulators say they have no evidence the ocean has reached its carrying capacity for hatchery fish, which brought sales averaging $120 million for 2012 through 2017.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Experts say a federal court ruling against a planned mining project in the state is expected to have national repercussions if upheld by higher courts. The Arizona Daily Star reports the mining industry has decried the ruling against the proposed $1.9 billion Rosemont Mine. The U.S. Forest Service’s approval of plans for the new copper mine in southeastern Arizona was overruled July 31 in U.S. District Court. The project was planned to spread across federal, state and private land. Mining company attorneys say the decision usurps the role of government agencies, could bring chaos to federal mining reviews and will add permitting delays. Conservation and tribal groups praised the ruling, saying it recognized the Forest Service’s failure to protect public land and resources.\n\nArkansas\n\nBentonville: An accident involving a ride that derailed on the last night of the Benton County Fair and injured at least two has prompted a state investigation. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports the ride shut down Saturday after a cart from a miniature roller coaster derailed, sending two people in an ambulance to a nearby hospital. Their conditions weren’t immediately available. Bentonville Fire Department Battalion Chief Justin Scantlin says a third person also rode in a car to the hospital. Arkansas Department of Labor general counsel Denise Oxley says investigators will examine the ride and its maintenance records as well as talk to the owner, operator and any witnesses. Oxley says the ride was inspected before the fair opened last week.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Jose: The mayor has proposed requiring gun owners in the nation’s 10th largest city to carry liability insurance to cover taxpayer costs associated with firearm violence. The Mercury News reports that, if approved, Mayor Sam Liccardo’s strict new measure would be the first of its kind in the nation to curb gun violence. The city of 1 million was home to two children killed in a July 28 mass shooting at the Gilroy Garlic Festival. Liccardo announced his proposal Monday. It would require approval from the City Council. He likened the proposal to attempts to lower smoking rates and car crashes. Gun rights groups are vowing that if the City Council approves the measure, they will take San Jose to court.\n\nColorado\n\nAspen: The U.S. Forest Service has put a logging project in the state on hold as it deals with a lawsuit. The Aspen Times reported Monday that the agency had authorized the plan to clear-cut about 2.5 square miles in the Upper Fryingpan Valley, saying it would improve forest resiliency and increase the amount of young forest. The logging near Basalt was planned to begin this summer. A group of residents near the project area filed a lawsuit earlier this year, claiming logging would increase carbon emissions and harm tourism and recreation. District ranger Curtis Keetch says the project will proceed after the litigation is resolved.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Consumers, businesses and health care providers in the state will be able to compare the cost and quality of medical care at hospitals and provider networks online. The Connecticut Office of Health Strategy has launched HealthscoreCT.com, which includes a quality scorecard and a cost estimator that is scheduled to be released at the end of September. OHS Executive Director Vicki Veltri says the website, which includes interactive tables and graphs, “gives people the resources to make better health care decisions” and gives providers an opportunity to improve on the cost and quality of the care they give patients. Once fully implemented, the free service will help consumers determine if the high cost charged by a particular network means good quality.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A fire department official says dozens of pet snakes died when a blaze ripped through a home. No people were injured in the fire that broke out Sunday morning in Dover. The homeowner told firefighters that approximately 60 snakes were in the house. All of them are believed to be dead. There was no immediate word on what kinds of snakes were being kept in the home. Deputy Chief Michael O’Connor Jr. of the Dover Fire Department says the snakes were kept in bedrooms throughout the house. O’Connor says the fire apparently started in the kitchen and caused extensive damage to the house.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A D.C. Council staffer is accused of firing a gun outside a pop-up marijuana market this month. News outlets report 24-year-old DaVon Lorenzo Fuller was arrested Saturday and charged with assault with a dangerous weapon and possession of a firearm. A police statement says Fuller and another man were being robbed by two people. Both men shot at the robbers, firing at least a dozen rounds. Fuller’s attorney Daniel K. Dorsey says Fuller fired in self-defense. Police are looking for Fuller’s companion. The statement says Fuller was denied a concealed-carry permit, making it illegal for him to take the weapon outside his home. Fuller is a staffer for councilwomen Brianne K. Nadeau, who has passed several laws to help reduce gun violence. He’s been placed on administrative leave.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Republican lawmakers from the state are postponing an immigration “listening tour,” saying a charged atmosphere after the El Paso, Texas, shootings and the Mississippi immigration raids won’t lead to a productive discussion. State Sen. Joe Gruters said Monday that the tour scheduled to begin next week will be pushed back, probably until November. Gruters also chairs the state Republican Party. Gruters and state Rep. Cord Byrd planned to lead the tour with stops across Florida. They’re the lawmakers who sponsored bills requiring local governments to cooperate with federal authorities enforcing immigration laws. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the sanctuary policy ban into law. Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani said Gruters and Byrd should cancel the tour, calling it politically motivated rather than a sincere attempt to listen to Floridians on immigration issues.\n\nGeorgia\n\nStonecrest: A local high school graduate has won a $30,000 college scholarship through the “Doodle for Google” competition. Citing a Google statement, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports Arantza Pena Popo’s design was featured on the tech giant’s homepage Tuesday. The nationwide contest asked grade schoolers to redesign Google’s logo based on what they hoped for the future. Popo’s doodle titled “Once you get it, give it back” shows a framed picture of Popo’s mother carrying her as an infant sitting above an adult Popo caring for her aging mother. The Colombia native graduated as a valedictorian from Arabia Mountain High School in Stonecrest. Google says the school will get $50,000 to establish a computer or technology lab. Popo plans to study graphic design at the University of Southern California this fall.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Geologists have measured high temperatures in rock ripped up by road crews during reconstruction of a Big Island highway inundated by lava. Hawaii News Now reports that Hawaii Volcano Observatory geologists recorded temperatures of cooling lava rock on Highway 132 above 700 degrees Fahrenheit from the 2018 Kilauea volcanic eruption. Geologists say the drill bit used to hammer the rock into pieces has changed colors from the intense heat, and rocks take most of the day to cool. Hawaii County officials say the construction will grant access to some residents’ landlocked homes and farms about 24 miles southeast of Hilo. Officials say reconstruction began in July and is expected to be completed by Oct. 5 to qualify for 100% federal reimbursement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s sage-grouse numbers have dropped 52% since the federal government decided not to list the birds as an endangered species in the fall of 2015. It’s not yet clear whether the three-year decline is part of a cyclical pattern or indicative of a more serious issue, but the Idaho Statesman reports the trend could force state and federal wildlife and land managers to take a closer look at how sage grouse are faring in Idaho and other western states. Under Idaho’s sage grouse management plan, wildlife managers must work to determine the cause of population declines and come up with an appropriate response any time numbers drop below a certain level. Idaho Fish and Game biologist Ann Moser says it looks like populations are low enough in several parts of Idaho to trigger the plan.\n\nIllinois\n\nWilmington: A group conducting an archaeological dig has found pieces of broken pottery, projectile points and other artifacts dating to the 1600s. Two University of Notre Dame professors have been leading summer volunteers on an exploration at the Midewin National Tallgrass Prairie in northern Illinois. The project at the Middle Grant Creek Site is revealing how people of the Oneota culture lived in the area four centuries ago. Earlier this month volunteers digging in a 6-foot-deep pit found projectile points made of rock that would have been used for hunting. They’ve also found painted pottery and needles made from bones, which were likely used to weave mats from tallgrass. The group is gathering evidence to reconstruct the environment and ecology of the last prehistoric culture of the upper Midwest.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: An agriculture economist is projecting a nearly 20% drop in revenue for the state’s corn and soybean crops this year. That prediction from Purdue University professor Chris Hurt comes after Indiana farmers faced several weeks of planting delays because of persistent spring rainfalls, followed a long summer dry spell. Hurt says those troubles and the ongoing U.S. trade fight with China could lead to a $1.3 billion revenue drop for Indiana’s corn and soybean crops from last year’s $6.8 billion. Purdue agricultural experts spoke Monday during a program at the Indiana State Fair. They said the state’s farmers face a risk that late-planted corn and soybeans won’t mature before the fall freeze.\n\nIowa\n\nMaquoketa: City leaders have promised to work with a company they know little about – including its name – but they say it could bring up to 200 new manufacturing jobs to town. The Telegraph Herald reports that Maquoketa leaders signed a nonbinding letter of intent to the company that says if Maquoketa is chosen for the project, city leaders will propose a development agreement. The objective is to have that agreement in place “within the next 120 days, if not sooner.” Nic Hockenberry, director of Jackson County Economic Alliance, says that “this isn’t usually how it works if you’re being considered for a site, but we take all inquiries seriously.” The city would provide the land and help install utilities to the site, if the city were chosen.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state Department of Transportation plans to spend $5 million this year to help cities and counties repair 3,800 bridges that are in poor condition or structurally insufficient. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports the department is restarting a program suspended in 2014 when state government struggled with revenue shortfalls. An estimated 20% of the 19,000 county and city bridges in Kansas need to be repaired or replaced. The department will provide up to $150,000 toward replacement or rehabilitation of a bridge on a local roadway system. The agency also offered $50,000 to a city or county in exchange for permanently closing a functionally obsolete bridge. Funding was drawn from $216 million in sales tax funneled to the state highway fund in fiscal year 2020, which began July 1.\n\nKentucky\n\nSlade: State parks officials say a wilderness advanced first aid training course will be offered later this year at Natural Bridge State Resort Park. Officials say the five-day course will be presented Dec. 2-6 and geared toward people who work or play in remote wilderness areas. They say it’s recommended for backcountry guides, canoe trip leaders, college outdoor programs, hiking club leaders, emergency medical technicians and adventure race safety personnel. Officials say the course will focus on stabilizing patients, treatment and evacuation guidelines for patients in remote areas. Learning will take place in the classroom as well as outdoor settings. The fee of $375 covers the course only. Lodging and meals at Natural Bridge are available at discounted rates.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Police say Baton Rouge’s African American history museum has been reported vandalized exactly a month after its founder was found dead. News outlets report police are investigating the damage to the Odell S. Williams African-American Museum founded by Sadie Roberts-Joseph. Photos posted online Monday show flipped benches, windows on the ground, and other damage including torn and ruined landscaping. It’s unclear if the inside of the museum suffered any damage. It’s been closed since Roberts-Joseph’s death. The 75-year-old was found dead last month in the trunk of a car. Preliminary autopsy results showed she was strangled before being shoved into the trunk. Police later arrested 38-year-old Ronn Bell on a charge of first-degree murder. He had been renting from Roberts-Joseph and was about $1,200 behind in rent.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A Republican lawmaker says a legislative fix would address a problem with timing of a handful of potential “people’s veto” votes. In a “people’s veto,” residents gather signatures to force a ballot question to veto a state law. Secretary of State Matt Dunlap at first incorrectly told “people’s veto” petitioners their attempted vetoes could go on ballots in June. He then announced they would go on ballots in March, alongside Maine’s presidential primary. Citizen petitioners fear a heavily Democratic turnout at the primary would doom their effort. They want to overturn laws including one that bans so-called conversion therapy for gay people. Rep. Patrick Corey, of Windham, says his proposal would exempt “people’s veto” votes from presidential primary elections. He says it’s about treating voters equally.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: An animal rights group has filed a federal complaint against Johns Hopkins University researchers over a lab experiment in which nine dogs had to be euthanized after spinal surgeries. The Baltimore Sun reports that Stop Animal Exploitation Now wants the U.S. Agriculture Department to impose fines of $10,000 per animal under the Animal Welfare Act. The group says Hopkins told the National Institutes of Health that it ended the federally funded experiment to study gastrointestinal issues when some dogs suffered acute paralysis. Hopkins spokeswoman Kim Hoppe says that the program rigorously complies with animal welfare regulations and that the remaining dogs were adopted. Federal law requires animal testing of drugs for humans.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNantucket: The island’s first pot shop is up and running. The Green Lady Dispensary opened Sunday on an appointment-only basis after receiving approval to operate from the state’s Cannabis Control Commission. Massachusetts voters legalized recreational pot for adults in 2016, but marijuana businesses faced additional obstacles to opening off the mainland because it remains illegal to transport marijuana through federal waters or to fly it there. The Green Lady Dispensary is cultivating marijuana on the island and received permission from regulators to conduct on-site laboratory testing in lieu of the normal requirement that products be tested at a licensed independent lab. The family-run store says appointments will be required through Labor Day.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Researchers say the state may have more than twice as many sand dune acres as previously known. Alan Arbogast of Michigan State University recently oversaw development of what he calls the most detailed and comprehensive map of the state’s dunes, which total 230,000 acres. He tells MLive.com the project mapped previously unrecognized dunes on the west coast of the Lower Peninsula. It also documented dunes on the eastern side of the state along Lake Huron that hadn’t been included in previous surveys. Arbogast is chairman of the university’s Department of Geography. His team gathered and analyzed remotely sensed imagery and compared aerial photos, topographic maps and soil data. They verified the findings in the field. Roughly half of the dune acreage is publicly owned or controlled by a local land conservancy.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz says he still wants Senate Republicans to hold hearings on Democratic proposals for gun control and emergency insulin supplies. The governor told reporters Monday he finds it “absolutely unacceptable” that none have been scheduled following the latest mass shootings in Ohio and Texas. He contrasted the impasse in Minnesota with states with Republican governors and legislatures that have adopted gun safety measures, as well as President Donald Trump’s recently stated willingness to consider stronger federal background checks. Proposals for tighter gun controls and easier access to emergency insulin stalled out during the 2019 Legislature’s regular session amid GOP opposition. Walz says it wouldn’t be productive to call lawmakers back if they’re not willing to do anything, but voters are demanding action.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: It’s painfully hot in the state now, but residents suffering through a blistering heat wave can take solace in the news that ice skating will be available this year at the Mississippi State Fair. State Agriculture Commissioner Andy Gipson says a temporary ice rink will be installed inside the Mississippi Coliseum on the fairgrounds in Jackson. Gipson announced that a Florida-based company called Magic Ice USA will build and manage the 8,000-square-foot rink. Construction will begin in late September, and the fair runs Oct. 2-14. The cost of skating will be $10 per person. Admission to the fair costs $5 for every person older than 6.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: A bidder from Nebraska has paid $920,000 for a house designed and built by iconic architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The Kansas City Star reports that Heritage Auctions says the new owner wants to remain anonymous for now, but the bidder plans to honor the integrity of the Sondern-Adler house that sold Monday. Wright designed the home in 1939 for Clarence Sondern. He designed a later addition for the second owner, Arnold Adler. Heritage Auctions spokesman Eric Bradley says the winning bidder plans to keep it a national or regional destination. The home had been on the market for 11 months at $1.65 million. Bidding began at $450,000. Bids quickly soared to $775,000, with the Nebraska bidder on the phone going head-to-head with a representative for a local bidder.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Members of a state task force whose goal is to help various agencies work together in reporting and searching for missing Native Americans want to add more people to the panel. The Missing Indigenous Persons Task Force met in Great Falls on Saturday and decided it wanted to add representatives from Indian Health Services and the U.S. attorney’s office. The task force was created by the Montana to help state, local, federal and tribal law enforcement agencies identify jurisdictional barriers that prevented the agencies from working together. The task force members were told the Department of Justice has not yet found the right candidate for the new job of missing persons specialist to work with the various agencies and oversee databases of missing persons.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office is giving people the opportunity to get rid of unwanted or unsafe guns, ammunition and leftover fireworks. People can turn in those items from 9 a.m. until 2 p.m. Aug. 17 at a drop-off location at the Sarpy County Sheriff’s Office south parking lot garage in Papillion. The amnesty day event allows the items to be dropped off with no questions asked, but police will document all firearms. If a gun is linked to a crime or reported stolen, police will investigate. Officials say all guns, ammunition and fireworks turned in at the event will be safely disposed of by the sheriff’s office and Omaha Police Department.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: As students head back to school this week, the nation’s fifth-largest school district is dealing with one of its biggest teaching shortages. KVVU-TV reports the Clark County School District has more than 700 vacant teaching positions. Officials say there have not been such a large number of openings during the first week of school since 2014. Some teachers say there is no way staff and students won’t feel the strain of having fewer instructors. Teacher Maria Zuniga says she sometimes has to substitute for another class in situations like this at the expense of her break time. District officials have said that teacher recruitment and retention are top priorities in their Focus 2024 plan.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampton: The state’s Department of Environmental Services has lifted a ban on most shellfish harvesting along the ocean coastline and Hampton-Seabrook Harbor after a drop in toxic algae bloom known as red tide. The harvest closure went into effect May 9 in response to elevated levels of paralytic shellfish poisoning detected in blue mussels. Chris Nash, the department’s shellfish program manager, said Maine and Massachusetts have been reporting similar red tide declines. He said the one exception is that surf clams along the Atlantic Coast continue to show unacceptably high levels of the toxin. He said surf clams typically retain it much longer than other types of shellfish. The DES says paralytic shellfish poisoning is life-threatening. Symptoms include tingling, burning, numbness, drowsiness, incoherent speech and respiratory paralysis.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: Residents began picking up bottled water Monday, days after elevated lead levels were found in homes where city-issued filters had been distributed months ago as part of an ongoing effort to combat contamination. Newark has given thousands of filters to residents in homes with lead service lines. But the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said recent tests showed drinking water in a few locations was still testing high for lead despite the filters. Water was available at four locations Monday. The process was successful for some people, not so much for others. Emmett Coleman, a senior citizen who said he is a heart transplant recipient, said he waited an hour for his two cases of water. He lugged them down the stairs and began to carry them up the street to his car before a worker came out to help him.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: State officials say visits to museums and historic sites have fallen. The Albuquerque Journal reports New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs says overall attendance for the fiscal year that ended June 30 dipped 2% from last year. According to the agency, in fiscal 2019, 992,574 visitors were counted for the eight state-run museums and the six historic sites. In fiscal 2018, attendance was at 1,014,041 and was largely led by the blockbuster “Da Vinci – The Genius” exhibit at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque. The biggest drops in attendance came at the Fort Sumner/Bosque Redondo site and the New Mexico History Museum, with a 30% and 17% decrease respectively.\n\nNew York\n\nBethel: State police are warning travelers in the Hudson Valley of likely traffic delays coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the Woodstock festival. Troopers say traffic congestion is expected on routes 17 and 17b in Sullivan County on Thursday through Sunday. Traffic is expected to be particularly heavy on Route 17 westbound between the Thruway in Harriman and exit 104 onto Route 17b in Monticello. Peak traffic for westbound lanes is anticipated between 1 and 7 p.m. and for eastbound lanes between 11 p.m. and 2 a.m. all four days of the anniversary concert weekend. Local officials expect up to 100,000 visitors to the Woodstock festival site in the town of Bethel on Thursday through Sunday. The site is hosting separate shows by festival veterans like Carlos Santana and John Fogerty.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWrightsville Beach: Volunteers who watch sea turtles nest fear more than 100 hatchlings were lost because they were attracted to artificial lights instead of the light of the moon. Nancy Fahey of the Wrightsville Beach Sea Turtle Project tells The StarNews of Wilmington that 112 sea turtle hatchlings broke through their shells early Aug. 1 after volunteers had quit watching the nest. She says she found turtle tracks under a pier and other places. She hopes the city can find a way to address problems with artificial lights. Wrightsville Beach Town Manager Tim Owens says most structures with problematic lighting predate the city’s lighting ordinance. He says one solution may be to ask property owners to shield bright lights when a nearby nest is nearing the end of its incubation period.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State agriculture officials say anthrax has been confirmed in a group of cows in a pasture in eastern Billings County. The case was confirmed Friday. It is North Dakota’s first reported case of anthrax this year. State veterinarian Susan Keller says producers in Billings County and surrounding areas should check with their veterinarians to see if they should start vaccinating their cattle for anthrax. Anthrax vaccines are readily available, but it takes about a week to establish immunity, and the vaccine must be administered annually. Anthrax is caused by bacterial spores that can lie dormant in the ground until they are activated by heavy rains, flooding or drought. Scattered heavy rains may have triggered the recent case. No anthrax cases were reported in North Dakota last year.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Opponents hoping to overturn a financial rescue for the state’s nuclear power plants and two coal-fired plants have failed to clear an initial hurdle to put the issue before voters next year. Ohio’s attorney general says there were inaccuracies in the petition summary submitted by Ohioans Against Corporate Bailouts, so it wasn’t certified as a fair and truthful representation of the proposed statewide referendum. The campaign says it will submit revised language. Lawmakers approved the $1.5 billion rescue package last month. It tacks a new fee onto every electricity bill in Ohio and scales back requirements that utilities generate more power from wind and solar. Backers say it saves jobs and protects nuclear plants that account for nearly all of Ohio’s clean energy. Opponents criticize it as a bailout.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state district judge has blocked implementation of a new law that requires top brands of wine and spirits to be sold to all Oklahoma alcohol wholesalers. The Oklahoman reports Judge Thomas Prince in Oklahoma City ruled the new law violates the state constitution. The state Supreme Court had remanded the legal challenge launched to the new law by a group of liquor wholesalers. Currently, manufacturers can designate a single wholesaler to distribute their products. The group argued the law unconstitutionally changed the amendment passed by voters in 2016 that also allows the sale of strong beer in grocery and convenience stores and the sale of cold, strong beer in liquor stores.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Far-right groups are traveling to the city from around the United States this weekend to rally against self-described antifascists who are planning to oppose them. Portland’s leadership is mobilizing in hopes of avoiding clashes similar to those in June and in 2018 that attracted national attention. Since President Donald Trump’s election, Portland has become a political arena for far-right and far-left groups to face off. None of the city’s nearly 1,000 police officers will have the day off Saturday. The Oregon State Police and the FBI are also helping out. Mayor Ted Wheeler says he may ask Democratic Gov. Kate Brown to call up the Oregon National Guard. The Southern Poverty Law Center says the groups coming to Portland include far-right militias, white supremacists, white nationalists and other hate groups.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The governor says at least four children from the state were recently separated from their parents by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and wrote Monday to demand the agency halt the practice until it has a plan to ensure the welfare of children. Gov. Tom Wolf asked Homeland Security Acting Secretary Kevin McAleenan to account for all children separated from their parents this year in Pennsylvania and to tell him how long they were kept apart and about any steps the federal government took to ensure their well-being. Wolf said in the letter that the four children are U.S. citizens and come from at least three migrant families. He said that “information relayed” to state officials indicated federal agents did not make sure that the children had adequate temporary guardianship.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State health officials are cautioning people to avoid contact with seven lakes and ponds because of potential risks from blue-green algae. The locations are Almy Pond in Newport; Sisson Pond in Portsmouth; JL Curran Reservoir in Cranston; Mashapaug Pond in Providence; and several lakes within Roger Williams Park in Providence, Pleasure Lake, Roosevelt Lake and Elm Lake. All recreation – including swimming, fishing, boating and kayaking – should be avoided. The Rhode Island Department of Public Health also warned that people and pets should not ingest water or eat fish from the locations. Contact with water containing blue-green algae commonly causes irritation of the skin, nose, eyes and/or throat.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nRidgeland: The leader of the state’s health and environmental agency says putting out a trash fire that has been smoldering for months is the department’s top priority. The fire at a recycling company in Jasper County started in early June with hazardous levels of smoke particles and a voluntary evacuation of a neighborhood nearby happening earlier this month. Department of Health and Environmental Control Director Rick Toomey said at an agency board meeting Thursday the department hired an outside company to put out the fire at Able Contracting Inc. The Island Packet of Hilton Head reports Toomey also said it can’t wait for delayed federal testing of water and air samples near the fire and is paying a private firm to see if there are more hazards than just smoke.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Prosecutors in Pennington County have declined to issue charges resulting from a police seizure of hemp-derived CBD oil that contained THC, the compound in marijuana that produces a high sensation. Officers raided a health food store in Rapid City in May and seized 16 individual or bundled packages of CBD oil products worth about $3,000. The raid was the result of an earlier purchase by a Rapid City police officer who had a CBD product tested and found it was positive for THC. The Rapid City Journal reports state’s attorney Mark Vargo says he chose not to charge the owner of Staple and Spice Market because it would be difficult to prove she knew the CBD products she was selling contained THC. The manufacturer, Plus CBD Oil, says on its webpage that its products contain less than 0.3% THC.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state is holding events to celebrate the 99th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which ushered in women’s right to vote. Bicentennial Capitol Mall State Park, the Tennessee State Museum, and the Tennessee State Library and Archives are collaborating on events Friday and Saturday in Nashville. Congress passed the 19th Amendment in June 1919. Three-fourths of state legislatures were required to ratify it for its nationwide adoption. Tennessee became the 36th and final state needed for ratification in August 1920. The park and museum will feature living history programs and hands-on activities. Historians will depict stories related to the women’s suffrage movement at the park. Keeping with Tennessee’s “Perfect 36” nickname, the Tennessee State Parks Run Club will host the Perfect 3.6 Race for Ratification on Saturday.\n\nTexas\n\nLa Porte: Officials say Aug. 25 is the last date for public visits to the Battleship Texas near Houston before the 107-year-old vessel undergoes repairs. The Texas Parks & Wildlife Department says staff and contractors, starting Aug. 26, need full access to the ship at La Porte to prepare for $35 million in renovations. The agency in June announced a pared-back summer schedule for visitors at the Battleship Texas State Historic Site so personnel could begin cataloging thousands of artifacts. The historic items will be put into storage before the Battleship Texas goes into dry dock to fix the leaking hull. The Battleship Texas Foundation in May announced the ship would get a new home following repairs. No site was announced.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Imprisoned polygamist leader Warren Jeffs has suffered a mental breakdown and isn’t fit to give a deposition in a sex abuse case against him, according to a recent court filing. Forcing Jeffs, 63, to testify would be “futile,” said lawyers representing a community trust that once belonged to a polygamous sect run by Jeffs on the Utah-Arizona border. The trust and Jeffs were sued in 2017 by a woman who says she was sexually abused by Jeffs when she was a child. Lawyer Zachary Shields said Monday that he isn’t trying to cover for Jeffs, who he says has done many awful things, but that he doesn’t want attorneys to waste time and money traveling to the Texas prison where Jeffs is housed until he is determined to be mentally competent.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Admission to state-owned historic sites will be free on Bennington Battle Day this Friday. It’s a state holiday commemorating the Revolutionary War victory over the British on Aug. 16, 1777. The Vermont Division of Historic Preservation says three sites are key to Vermont’s role in the American Revolution. They are Mount Independence, a fortification built by American troops in 1776 and 1777, in Orwell; the Hubbardton Battlefield marking the site of the Revolutionary War battle fought on what would become Vermont; and the 306-foot-high Bennington Battle Monument. Other sites that will be free to visit are Chimney Point in Addison; the Senator Justin S. Smith Morrill Homestead in Strafford; and the President Calvin Coolidge Birthplace and Homestead in Plymouth Notch.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Researchers at the University of Richmond believe a burial ground of enslaved Africans may lie beneath the campus. The Richmond Times-Dispatch and The Collegian, the university’s student newspaper, report researchers say they’ve discovered evidence suggesting an unknown number of slaves may be buried behind Puryear Hall. Dywana Saunders, a research associate at one of the university’s libraries, says a history book describes campus land that once belonged to lumber plantation owner Ben Green, who likely owned slaves. A 1947 Richmond News Leader article added to the evidence, describing a small pile of bones that had been unearthed on campus. Researchers say they hope a ground survey using radar technology will provide more answers.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A wildfire-triggered thunderstorm has provided an unusual opportunity for scientists to fly through its clouds and take photos and measurements. The Seattle Times reports information collected from Thursday’s flight could inform new research about wildfire-induced thunderstorms, which only recently have been studied in detail. Philippe Papin, a postdoctoral atmospheric scientist at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, says such thunderstorms don’t produce much precipitation that reaches the ground but can create lightning strikes with potential to spark new fires. The research is part of a project between NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration aimed at better understanding wildfire smoke’s impact on air quality and the climate.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Officials say the number of HIV cases in Cabell County has risen to 71. The state Department of Health and Human Resources posted the figure Monday, saying the virus has spread primarily among intravenous drug users. The cluster, tracked since January 2018, represents a drastic increase from the baseline average of eight cases annually over the past five years. Officials confirmed last month that one person associated with the cluster has died. Dr. Cathy Slemp of the state Department of Health and Human Resources told The Register-Herald that there haven’t been any indications the cases have spread outside Cabell County. The health department says it is working to find gaps in health care and prevention coverage.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Republican legislators are reintroducing a bill that would punish students who interfere with campus speeches and presentations. The state Assembly passed a bill last session that would suspend University of Wisconsin System students twice accused of disrupting others’ free speech. Students who disrupt others’ free expression a third time would be expelled. The measure died in the Senate, but UW regents adopted the sanctions as policy in October. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, Sen. Chris Kapenga and Reps. Cody Horlacher and Dave Murphy reintroduced the bill Tuesday. Passage would cement the sanctions in statute.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Under threat of legal action, federal wildlife managers are pledging to start weaning elk that winter on the National Elk Refuge in northwest Wyoming off supplemental feeding. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has been talking with Wyoming wildlife managers for about a dozen years about the feeding program. But the threat of litigation by the Earthjustice environmental group has forced the agency to act. Earthjustice attorney Tim Preso tells the Jackson Hole News & Guide that the federal agency has agreed to have a plan in place by the next feeding season, which typically begins in late January or early February each winter. Earthjustice contends the supplemental feeding of elk increases the risk of spreading chronic wasting disease among wildlife in the area.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/20/red-panda-triplets-paul-simon-miracle-house-news-around-states/39985535/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nHuntsville: The slenderclaw crayfish is barely surviving in northern Alabama. The tiny animal is now known to survive in just two creeks near Sand Mountain, where it burrows under rocks in shallow, slow-moving waters, Al.com reports. The animal lost most of its original habitat when the Tennessee River was dammed to create Lake Guntersville in 1939. And the population is still dwindling. Biologists who study the slenderclaw crayfish are not entirely certain why the population is still declining. More uncertainty surrounds whether the animal will get formal protections from the federal government. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed to list the crayfish as a threatened species, but the change may not be as protective as in the past, due to recently announced changes by the Trump administration.\n\nAlaska\n\nKenai: The Kenai River Foundation hosted its 13th annual Wounded Warriors fishing trip this month, bringing 68 active-duty soldiers stationed in the state down to the Kenai Peninsula to fish for salmon on the river. The trip is free for the soldiers and is made possible thanks to donations from sponsors including the Central Peninsula Hospital, Alaska Communications, Fairweather, LLC, Price Gregory International and Siemens Building Technologies. Professional fishing guides volunteered their services for the two days, and riders from several chapters of the American Legion provided a military escort for the buses that brought the soldiers primarily stationed at the Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson to and from Anchorage.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: State lawmakers could make cities pay for raising the minimum wage. A new law that takes effect Aug. 27 requires the state to calculate the cost to Arizona’s government when cities and counties raise the minimum wage above the statewide rate. If the state has to pay more for services in those communities because of a higher minimum wage, legislators could force local governments to cover the additional costs. Proponents of the measure argue it is only fair after Flagstaff voters elected in 2016 to raise the minimum wage above the state’s rate, in turn requiring government contractors to increase pay for some low-wage workers. But others view it as an effort by the Republican-controlled Legislature to curtail the power of local governments.\n\nArkansas\n\nFayetteville: Officials say two more medical marijuana dispensaries are expected to open in the state’s northwest this year. Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration spokesman Scott Hardin says both dispensaries will be in Fayetteville. They’ll join the region’s first dispensary, The ReLeaf Center, which opened earlier this month in Bentonville, and another called The Source, which opened last week in Bentonville. The two Bentonville dispensaries are the seventh and eighth to open in the state since voters legalized the use of medical marijuana in 2016. The state has licensed 32 dispensaries to sell medical marijuana. The Northwest Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports that the state had issued more than 19,000 patient or caregiver cards as of Friday.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Barbara: Scientists have installed an underwater sound system they hope will reduce collisions between whales and ships in the Santa Barbara Channel off Southern California. A listening station on the channel floor is able to capture whale calls as far away as 30 miles, the Los Angeles Times reports. That device is connected by cable to a buoy floating above that transmits data by satellite to scientists on shore. From there, captains can be alerted to slow their ships down or reroute. It’s the latest attempt to prevent ships from running into whales in the channel, where cargo vessels in and out of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach cross feeding grounds of endangered blue, fin and humpback whales.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The Environmental Protection Agency has announced the North Front Range region missed its air quality standards deadline. The EPA is expected to mark the nine-county region that includes Denver County in serious noncompliance with a federal standard. Experts say this region has high concentrations of ground-level ozone and smog that could lead to respiratory health issues and heart disease. Officials say the Air Quality Control Commission passed a zero-emission vehicle standard Friday in the region to reduce the effects. Experts say air quality improved on average over the past decade despite the announcement, and the region has plans to adopt more regulations for emission-producing industries.\n\nConnecticut\n\nWilton: The town has halted guardrail improvements following complaints about the look of new, steel barriers on some residential streets. Wood and wire guardrails traditionally have lined the roads in Wilton, a Fairfield County town on the line with New York state. First Selectwoman Lynne Vanderslice imposed a moratorium on upgrades this month after residents raised issues with the aesthetics of the steel replacements. The town had been installing steel guardrails in sections, such as along bends and near culverts, on two roads where the old guardrails were showing their age. Public works officials say the moratorium will provide an opportunity to conduct engineering studies and assess alternative guardrail styles and whether guardrails are even needed on those roads.\n\nDelaware\n\nDewey Beach: Busted boats and outdated laptops are among 2,000-plus items that will be going to auction next month as town officials try to wipe away the scars from participating in a military surplus program. The goal for now, Mayor T.J. Redefer says, is to get the number of items as close to zero as possible to help to rebuild the community’s trust in the government. The stockpile is cited in a federal lawsuit regarding public access to a report on the program, which had found there was little town oversight and questionable accounting. The surplus items were requested by Dewey Beach police working with the Law Enforcement Support Office program, which helps local agencies reuse Department of Defense equipment. The only cost is shipping and transportation of the items, but sometimes the available items look better online than in person, Redefer says.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Confidential documents show the former chairman of the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority sought to limit an ethics investigation and prevent its findings from being made public. The Washington Post reports Jack Evans’ actions are detailed in investigative documents obtained from WMATA’s ethics committee. Records show Evans threatened the jobs of a board lawyer and secretary while trying to hide the findings of an ethics probe, which found he failed to disclose a profitable conflict-of-interest. Evans’ lawyer, Mark Tuohey, says Evans never intended that anyone be fired. Clarence C. Crawford, who chaired the ethics committee, made the findings public at the request of state and local officials. Evans resigned his transit job days later but remains a city councilman.\n\nFlorida\n\nDavie: The state’s iconic palm trees are under attack from a fatal disease that turns them to dried crisps in months, with no chance for recovery once they become ill. Spread by a rice-sized, plant-hopping insect, lethal bronzing has gone from a small infestation on the Gulf Coast to a nearly statewide problem in just over a decade. Tens of thousands of palm trees have died from the bacterial disease, and the pace of its spread is increasing, adding to environmental woes of a state already struggling to save its other arboreal icon, citrus trees, from two other diseases. Florida’s official state tree – the tall, broad-leafed sabal palm – is especially susceptible, and Florida nurseries, businesses and homeowners are taking a financial hit as they scrap infected palms. Some preventive measures can be taken, but once infected, uprooting the tree is the only practical solution.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Experts say the state is among those most at risk of its residents not being counted accurately in the 2020 census. The Urban Institute says children under the age of 5 are especially at risk of being undercounted due to Georgia’s changing demographics. WABE Radio reports that nationwide, 4.5 million children live in areas that are difficult to count for the 2020 census. Statewide, 22% of Georgia’s population lives in areas considered hard to count. The radio station reports there are several reasons why so many Georgia children are difficult to count: They are often in young families, immigrant families and multigenerational homes.\n\nHawaii\n\nAuwahi: Musician Paul Simon has joined environmentalists attempting to reinvigorate a woodland by planting a tree during a ceremony on Maui. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Friday that the celebrated singer-songwriter joined Auwahi Forest Restoration Project volunteers seeking to revive the area’s plant life. Simon helped plant a lama tree and participated in chants with the group following a helicopter tour. The part-time Maui resident performed two environmental benefit concerts at the Maui Arts & Cultural Center earlier in the week that drew more than 8,000 attendees. Simon plans to donate his proceeds to the Auwahi project and Hawaii environmental group Kuaaina Ulu Auamo. Simon was put in contact with the environmentalists after visiting Hoolawa Farms in Haiku to view a rare kanaloa plant, one of only two in existence.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Federal officials have approved two open-pit phosphate mines that include environmental protections intended to prevent the type of pollution caused by past phosphate mining in the area. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management says it approved the Caldwell Canyon Mine project in Caribou County, about 13 miles northeast of Soda Springs. Bayer subsidiary P4 Production will develop the mines on three phosphate leases. Bayer acquired agricultural giant Monsanto, which previously mined the area, for $63 billion last year. The area contains one the nation’s most abundant deposits of phosphate ore that’s turned into fertilizer needed by farmers to grow food. Idaho-based Simplot also has a mine in the area. But the area also contains Superfund sites because of pollution from past phosphate mining.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum has received more than $400,000 in grants for a project that aims to publish every document written by the nation’s 16th president. The Springfield-based library says the Papers of Abraham Lincoln project was awarded up to $350,000 from the National Endowment for the Humanities. The National Historical Publications and Records Commission awarded the project $87,125. Alan Lowe, executive director of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum, says the grants show that experts in the field are confident the project “is on the right path to fulfill its important mission.” The project launched online in 2018. It gives people access to documents from private collections and archives held around the world.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: The new home of Indiana University’s art school will be modeled after an unbuilt fraternity house a famed modernist architect designed in the 1950s. IU’s trustees recently approved construction of the $10 million Mies van der Rohe Building. When completed in 2021, it will bring the Eskenazi School of Art, Architecture and Design’s programs together within one building. The Herald-Times reports the 10,000-square-foot structure will be made of limestone, steel and glass, with second-floor windows spanning floor to ceiling. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was a German-born architect known for his “less is more” approach emphasizing open space and industrial materials. He designed a fraternity house for Phi Lambda Phi in the early 1950s, but it went unbuilt. The new building will be similar to his design, with modern upgrades.\n\nIowa\n\nFort Dodge: Robert Wolf has about 250 boxes of rock samples sitting in his garage waiting for a crew from the University of Iowa to come pick them up with a 20-foot truck. The collection took the better part of 30 years to find. Each rock sample has a number and is recorded in a log book that tells what it is, where it was collected and when he found it, The Messenger reports. And the collection is all Iowan. “There’s a sample of every formation in Iowa,” he says. “There are 350 rock units in and around Iowa. I have all the families and 95% of the members. That’s what makes this collection unique. It’s a good representation of the state of Iowa.” What makes his collection valuable and of interest to a university is that it’s properly cataloged. Without the information Wolf recorded, it’s just a big pile of rocks.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State education officials are expressing concern after a recent survey found more than 1,000 motorists illegally passed stopped school buses in one day. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports a task force is expected to make recommendations during the next legislative session on how to reduce the number of violations. In the April survey, 220 districts in Kansas that use 3,300 school buses reported 1,040 violations by motorists. That compares with April of 2018, when 214 districts operating 3,347 buses documented 1,030 infractions. Jim Porter, the southeast Kansas representative on the Kansas Board of Education, noted the sample included only three-fourths of the state’s districts.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Tourism officials say more people visited the state in 2018 and spent more money. Officials say visitor trips to and within the state topped 71.6 million last year, and visitor spending rose to nearly $7.6 billion, up nearly 4% over the prior year and a 21% increase since 2013. The figures are the result of a study from Tourism Economics, the state Department of Tourism’s new research partner. Using the Tourism Economics model, officials say the industry’s economic impact in Kentucky went from $10.9 billion in 2017 to $11.2 billion in 2018, generating more than 94,500 jobs and $787 million in state and local taxes. The tourism department says it continues to build on Kentucky’s signature tourism industries of horses, bourbon, music, arts, outdoors and culinary to reach new audiences.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Three days of public events will honor former Gov. Kathleen Blanco, the state’s first female governor, who died after a years­long struggle with cancer. The Democrat who led Louisiana during hurricanes Katrina and Rita will be memorialized Thursday at an interfaith service in downtown Baton Rouge at St. Joseph’s Cathedral. Her casket then will be taken to the Louisiana Capitol, where Blanco’s body will lie in Memorial Hall for public visitation. On Friday, mourners in Louisiana’s Acadiana region can attend a prayer service for the former governor in Lafayette at St. John the Evangelist Cathedral. Blanco’s funeral Mass will be Saturday in Lafayette, followed by a private burial service. Blanco died Sunday. She was 76.\n\nMaine\n\nOrono: Nature lovers who encounter fluttering butterflies might also be able to contribute to research about the colorful insects. Researchers at the University of Maine say residents can use a mobile app called the Monarch Model Validator to provide details about areas where butterflies are likely to be found. They plan to use the data as part of a model designed to predict the location of monarch butterfly nesting sites. The UMaine researchers say monarch butterflies begin a 3,000-mile migration south every fall. They also say the number of monarchs that complete the migration has fallen by 90% in the past two decades. App users will be able to answer a short survey and provide photos. They’ll be able to head to predetermined sites or find locations of their own.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Lawyers for a man whose murder conviction was chronicled in the hit podcast “Serial” are asking the Supreme Court to step into the case. Lawyers for defendant Adnan Syed said in court papers Monday that the justices should order a new trial for Syed and reverse a Maryland court ruling against him. Syed claims his trial lawyer violated his constitutional right to competent representation because she failed to investigate an alibi witness. Syed is serving a life sentence after he was convicted in 2000 of strangling 17-year-old Hae Min Lee and burying her body in a Baltimore park. Syed and Lee were high school classmates who had dated. In its debut 2014 season, the “Serial” podcast shined a spotlight on the case that led to renewed court proceedings.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The memorial to the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing is complete. Three stone pillars representing the three people who died at the finish line were installed Monday, marking the final step of the $2 million project, which took four years to plan and develop and underwent significant redesigns and other delays. Bolivian-born sculptor Pablo Eduardo said it was important that the final work reflect the hopes and expectations of families who lost loved ones. The monument includes four bronze and glass spires installed last month to illuminate the site. Cherry trees to bloom each April have also been planted, and two bronze bricks have been set in the sidewalk to honor the police officers killed in the bombing’s aftermath. The pillars installed Monday were gathered from places around Boston significant to the bombing victims.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A copy of the original land contract for Motown Records’ Hitsville U.S.A. will be unveiled as part of the music company’s 60th anniversary celebration. Officials with the Motown Museum, located where Berry Gordy Jr. launched his music empire, say they will share the rarely seen document via Facebook at 3 p.m. Tuesday. That coincides with the 1959 date that Gordy purchased the house on West Grand Boulevard. Museum CEO and Chairwoman Robin Terry called it “the start of a journey that would ultimately rock the world.” The event is part of a series of “archive dives” this year to coincide with milestone dates. The Supremes, the Miracles, Martha and the Vandellas, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and many others recorded hits there before Motown moved in 1972 to California.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud: Almost 90 musical acts will descend on the city this week for the Common Roots Festival, performing myriad styles on 12 different stages. The festival, now in its third year, was originally conceived as a way to breathe life back into downtown venues, restaurants and businesses during a major street construction project in 2017. Although that project has been completed, the volunteer team behind the festival has continued the mission to bring folks to downtown St. Cloud. “Downtown is now under a deluge of construction again, and we are hearing from business folks in that area that it is affecting business. So we’re right back where we started three years ago,” says festival coordinator Dawn Yilek. It all kicks off Wednesday at 5 p.m. at Beaver Island Brewing Company.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A group that advocates limited government is suing the state over its licensing requirement for people who earn money by plucking eyebrows with thread. Mississippi Justice Institute filed the lawsuit Monday on behalf of Dipa Bhattarai, a University of Mississippi graduate student. She grew up in Nepal, where she learned the technique of using a single strand of cotton thread to remove hair. Mississippi requires people who receive money for eyebrow threading to earn an esthetician’s license. The license requires training and exams, but none of the training deals with threading. The Mississippi Board of Cosmetology shut down Bhattarai’s business, and she wants to reopen it. She says she started earning money by threading eyebrows while she was a student at Mississippi University for Women in Columbus. “It’s going to sound cliche, but I just started my business with $240,” Bhattarai says.\n\nMissouri\n\nSedalia: Authorities are looking for an inmate who escaped from a crew that was helping to clean up after the Missouri State Fair came to an end for the year. Department of Corrections spokesman Karen Pojmann says 34-year-old Shannon Dewayne Watts, of Springfield, was reported missing about 12:45 a.m. Monday when he didn’t return to a van to head back to the Tipton Correctional Center. He was serving a 15-year sentence there for charges that included burglary, resisting arrest and tampering with a motor vehicle. The search was expanded beyond the nearly 400-acre fairgrounds in Sedalia several hours later when law enforcement couldn’t find Watts. He is described as 6 feet tall and 195 pounds. The 11-day fair began Aug. 8 and ended Sunday night.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A University of Montana art historian has called for a new state flag after receiving a top research award. The Missoulian reports Hipolito Rafael Chacon announced the idea Thursday to redesign the state’s identity with a new flag. Officials say his research received an award last month from the International Congress of Vexillology, a worldwide association of flag researchers. Officials say the design originated from just the seal because Montana troops needed a banner to carry in the Spanish-American War. Officials say the Legislature added the name of the state in 1981. Chacon says a public design competition could be the best way to select a new design. Experts say former historians tried to change the design decades ago, but state officials laughed at the idea.\n\nNebraska\n\nWinslow: Residents of this tiny community who are reeling from flooding this year are considering whether to move their entire town uphill. The Omaha World-Herald reports that the swollen Elkhorn River flowed in mid-March over a levee built to protect Winslow, damaging almost all 38 homes and 10 other buildings in the Dodge County town. Town leaders have proposed moving Winslow out of the flood plain to a new site, possibly a hilltop about 2 miles away. Town officials say that if residents stay, they’ll be at the mercy of the river. Zachary Klein, a village trustee and the volunteer fire chief, says the move could take two years. Klein says funding is available from federal, state and local sources.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Health officials in the city are using the word “outbreak” to describe a sharp spike in hepatitis A cases reported mostly among homeless people and drug users. The Southern Nevada Health District reports that in seven months from November to June, it counted 83 cases of the virus that causes liver damage and can lead to death. That’s far more than the 58 cases reported in 2016, 2017 and 2018 combined. The district says more than 80% of reported patients were people without a permanent place to live, and 92% use drugs, some intravenous. The district has begun posting weekly outbreak updates on its website. Hepatitis A is most often transmitted through consumption of water or food contaminated with feces.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nDurham: A University of New Hampshire researcher says oyster production in the state is only a small fraction of what it could be. Ray Grizzle, research professor of biological sciences, says the total number of farms is probably nearing the maximum for the Little Bay area, but production isn’t yet. USDA data in the 2017 Census of Agriculture says the state has 32 commercial mollusk operations in Strafford and Rockingham counties representing $419,000 in sales. Most of them are oyster farming. New Hampshire only had two licensed oyster farms when Grizzle began conducting research about 10 years ago. Grizzle, who’s with the university’s New Hampshire Agricultural Experiment Station, says some farms have included improved farming methods and marketing networks that involve wholesalers as well as directly selling to local chefs.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: The mayor says it could take another month before additional testing is completed on lead levels in the city’s water supply. That means residents in affected neighborhoods will have to continue receiving bottled water. Mayor Ras Baraka’s comments on a radio show Sunday were first reported by Politico. Newark began distributing bottled water a week ago after lead levels tested high in a few homes even though residents have been given water filters. About 14,000 homes are affected. In addition, a federal judge is expected to rule this week on an environmental group’s effort to force Newark to distribute water to thousands more residents who are served by a different water system. The Natural Resources Defense Council says those residents also are at risk from excessive lead levels.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLos Alamos: Officials at Los Alamos National Laboratory say they have plans for $13 billion worth of construction projects over the next decade at the northern New Mexico complex. They outlined their plans at a recent meeting attended by hundreds of representatives of construction firms from around the country. Most of the projects are related to the lab’s assignment to ramp up production of key nuclear weapon components known as plutonium cores. Other work would be aimed at serving a growing workforce, such as housing projects, parking garages and a potential new highway that would reduce commute times from Albuquerque and Santa Fe. Lab Director Thomas Mason tells the Albuquerque Journal the lab currently has 1,400 openings and plans to add another 1,200 jobs to its workforce of 12,000 by 2026.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: State officials are asking the public to help choose a new license plate design. Gov. Andrew Cuomo says people can vote on the governor’s website for one of five plate designs. Four of the designs include the Statue of Liberty, while one features the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge over the Hudson River. Voting runs through Sept. 2. The design with the most votes will become available in April. The new ones will replace the state’s blue-and-white plates, most of which are more than 10 years old. As vehicle owners renew their registrations, owners with license plates 10 years old or older will be issued new plates for a $25 fee. Once the new plates become available, the Department of Motor Vehicles also will stop issuing the newer blue-and-gold plates.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper’s administration is proposing a plan to reduce greenhouse gases. The News & Observer of Raleigh reports that the plan calls for cutting greenhouse gases from electricity production by 60% to 70% of 2005 levels by 2030, with a goal of getting to zero emissions by 2050. The state Department of Environmental Quality says North Carolina already has made progress toward cutting emissions, which are 34% lower than 2005 levels. Some of the plan’s suggestions include requiring the retirement of coal power plants and requiring utilities to increase use of renewable energy. It also suggests setting carbon dioxide budgets or carbon caps, or a combination of those approaches. The proposal stems from an executive order Cooper signed last year.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: A landfill north of the city could soon become the first facility in the state to accept higher levels of radioactive oil-field waste under new state regulations. The Bismarck Tribune reports Secure Energy Services is seeking permits allowing it to dispose of radioactive material at its 13-Mile Landfill, which already accepts other types of waste generated by oil development. The Health Department increased the allowable concentrations of technologically enhanced radioactive material to be disposed of at approved landfills from 5 picocuries per gram to 50 picocuries per gram in 2016. Picocuries are a measure of radioactivity. The change was controversial at the time, drawing lengthy hearings and a lawsuit from environmental groups.\n\nOhio\n\nCanton: Eighty years after Rhoda Wise first claimed she was a receiver of Christian miracles, people are still visiting her home to see for themselves. Busloads of the faithful and curious come to Wise’s home in Canton to see the room where it is believed she was cured of a terminal illness and regularly was visited by Jesus Christ. The small wood-frame house is an unlikely Roman Catholic shrine nestled in a frayed neighborhood next to a nine-hole golf course. But every year it attracts visitors from all over the world. Visitor numbers are getting a boost this summer thanks to the local Roman Catholic diocese formally petitioning the Vatican to have Wise declared a saint. Wise died in 1948 at age 60.\n\nOklahoma\n\nCushing: Officials have closed a recreational lake while they monitor a dam breach in the area. City Manager Terry Brannon said Sunday that a breach has been detected in a concrete structure beneath the dam at Cushing Lake near this city about 55 miles northeast of Oklahoma City. Officials say the breach is allowing water to pass unrestricted, but the flow remains controlled, meaning there hasn’t been a complete dam failure. Owned by the city of Cushing, Cushing Lake is about 9 miles west of Cushing, an oil hub with 300 storage tanks. Officials say the area affected by the breach includes fields and livestock but no structures. Authorities say police are notifying property owners and others with livestock downstream of the dam.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde have finalized their purchase of the former Blue Heron paper mill site at Willamette Falls. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the site that was once home to the Charcowah village of the Clowewalla now belongs to the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde. The 23-acre property is located within the tribes’ ancestral homelands and holds significant historical and cultural importance for the Grand Ronde. Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde chairwoman Cheryle A. Kennedy says they have reclaimed a piece of their homeland and are resurrecting their role as caretakers to Willamette Falls.

A new dig started this month on a 4-acre area, and archaeologists and volunteers hope to uncover evidence that would help reveal the exact location of Camp Security. A few 18th-century items, such as wrought iron nails and Westerwald stoneware, have turned up, but “nothing yet that screams site,” says John Crawmer, lead archaeologist for the Friends of Camp Security. During the Revolutionary War, colonists held British prisoners of war from the Battle of Saratoga and the Siege of Yorktown at Camp Security from 1781 to 1783. It’s believed to be the last known Revolutionary War prison camp to remain undisturbed in the country. The public can visit the site Aug. 27 to learn more about the archaeological work.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Advocates for gun control demanded reforms at a gathering over the weekend. The Rhode Island chapter of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America staged a rally Saturday to honor victims of the latest U.S. mass shootings and call for tougher gun legislation. Several dozen people attended the event. Some of the signs they held said “Disarm Hate,” “Enough” and “No One Needs a Weapon of War at Home.” Organizers say they’re pressing for a strong federal “red flag” bill to allow seizure of weapons in certain cases and legislation requiring background checks on all gun sales. Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America describes itself as a grassroots movement fighting for public safety measures that can protect people from gun violence.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nCharleston: A major building at the College of Charleston is set for a $50 million overhaul. The Post and Courier reports the state’s Joint Bond Review Committee agreed last month to borrow $45 million to renovate the university’s main arts building, the Albert Simons Center. Another $5 million will come from a one-time state appropriation. Architects are still designing the building’s new exterior. A previous renovation planned in the mid-1990s stalled amid exterior design disputes. School of the Arts Dean Valerie Morris says the renovation will create a black box theater for student productions, plus upgraded classrooms, bathrooms, and heating and cooling. Mold problems are promised to be fixed. Work could begin in summer 2020, with the art school temporarily relocating. The overhaul could be complete by fall 2022.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The U.S. Department of Agriculture says farmers in the state were unable to plant more than 3.8 million acres this year, the highest number in the nation. KSFY-TV reports the tally includes 2.8 million unplanted corn acres and nearly 851,000 acres for soybeans. The USDA says the total number of unplanted acres nationwide was more than 19 million acres, the highest since the agency began reporting those figures in 2007. Many states across the Midwest were hit hard by flooding this spring, leading to fields being too wet for farmers to plant.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The University of Memphis has launched a new initiative in hopes of raising graduation rates among its black male students, the school announced Monday. The African American Male Academy will start with a group of black male students in middle school and pair them with peer and faculty mentors, provide textbooks and other educational supplies, and give them access to early academic and career preparation. “Most students are in good academic standing when they leave the U of M before graduation – they leave for financial reasons,” university officials wrote in a statement announcing the program, adding that 60% of its students work more than 20 hours a week and have to help provide for their families. Students inducted into the academy will also be informed of scholarship programs and other “culturally responsive” initiatives meant to keep them in school and make their educations more affordable.\n\nTexas\n\nKemah: The Galveston Bay Foundation has seen the first structure go up on 30 acres of bayfront land it acquired in 2016. The Galveston County Daily News reports a pavilion designed and built by students from the University of Texas School of Architecture’s Gulf Coast DesignLab will be used to host as many as 75 students at a time in grades five to 12 from across the upper Texas coast region, helping them learn on-site about Galveston Bay’s wildlife, organisms, natural habitat and environmental threats. In June, DesignLab, an advanced studio design class, reached out to the foundation, offering its services.

A dedication is planned for Saturday.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A report says more women in the state are earning STEM-related degrees, but completion rates are still behind the national average. The Deseret News reports the Utah Women & Leadership Project released a study this month showing an additional 467 women graduated with science, technology, engineering and math degrees from 2012 to 2017. Officials say the 1% increase could be higher, but gender stereotypes have been attributed to women switching disciplines more frequently than men. Officials say girls who are introduced to women in STEM careers have increased their chances of engaging in a STEM curriculum by more than 60%. Officials say of the 44% of women in the workforce in Utah, there are a “particularly low” number of women who continue on to work in STEM industries.\n\nVermont\n\nWoodbury: The state Fish & Wildlife Department is seeking volunteers to become “Let’s Go Fishing” instructors who can pass on the fishing tradition to the next generation of Vermonters.

Information can be found on the department’s website.\n\nVirginia\n\nNorfolk: The Virginia Zoo has announced the birth of red panda triplets. The zoo in Norfolk announced Monday that the triplets were born two months ago and are thriving in a climate-controlled den that’s out of sight from the public. Zoo veterinarian Collen Clabbers says red panda triplets are a “unique situation” for the endangered species from Asia. But she says the mother is “doing a great job.” The two males and one female were born to mother Masu and dad Timur. The cubs will live in the red panda exhibit after zoo staff members feel the little ones can navigate the exhibit’s trees and other features. The zoo is auctioning naming rights in support of red panda conservation. Bids can be placed online.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: The last four members of a wolf pack that preyed on cattle in a rural area of the state bordering Canada have been killed by state hunters, prompting protests from environmental groups. The four wolves were part of a pack that originally had seven members and attacked cows, killing or wounding them 29 times since 2018 and nine times over the past month, the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife said in a statement Friday. Agency director Kelly Susewind authorized the killings of the remaining pack members July 31. Environmental groups opposed the killings, which they contended benefited one ranching operation in Ferry County in the remote Kettle River Range. Hunters for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife who were inside helicopters tracked down and shot the wolves from the air Friday, agency spokeswoman Sam Montgomery says.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Mountain Valley Pipeline has suspended some construction activities that could affect threatened or endangered species. WVPR-FM reports pipeline officials sent a letter last week telling federal regulators about the voluntary suspension in areas where construction could affect protected bat and fish species. The move follows a lawsuit filed by the Sierra Club and other environmental groups last week that challenged approvals by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Conservation groups are asking the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to toss two key permits issued to the 303-mile natural gas pipeline in Virginia and West Virginia. The 4th Circuit last month threw out the same Fish and Wildlife approvals for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline. Regulators say the pipeline may not resume the suspended construction without first seeking approval.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Two Native American tribes in the state are receiving federal grants for renewable energy projects that tribe members say will help reduce costs and lead to energy independence. The Bad River Band of Lake Superior Chippewa in Odanah received a nearly $1 million grant, and the Forest County Potawatomi Community in Crandon got a grant for more than $1.5 million. Wisconsin Public Radio reports the grants will be used to install solar panels at tribal buildings. The move is expected to save the tribes millions of dollars in energy spending over the next 25 years. The Wisconsin tribes are among 12 nationwide that received a total of 14 grants from the federal Office of Indian Energy Policy and Programs worth a total of $16 million.\n\nWyoming\n\nPowell: Wildlife officials say fewer grizzly bears have been euthanized this year in Yellowstone National Park compared to previous years. The Powell Tribune reports the U.S. Geological Survey says nine grizzlies were euthanized in Wyoming this year, but the number could increase before the bears go into hibernation in December. Officials say the Wyoming Game and Fish Department killed a record-high 32 grizzly bears in 2018, including 17 by mid-August last year. Officials say grizzly bears are euthanized to manage conflicts at the park that spans across Wyoming, Montana and Idaho. Wildlife officials say three bears have also died in automobile collisions. Officials say they encourage people in the region to carry some type of defense in case of an encounter.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/20"}]}

The club has a maximum occupancy rating of 99. The party for rapper D-Aye packed the club with 342 people, meaning it was 243 over the rated capacity. Because of this, the city fined the club $100 per person over the limit for a total of $24,300. Xscape owner Frank Walker appeared in front of the City Council on Tuesday to review the violation. Walker asked the Council to reduce what his attorney called an excessive fine, but was told he would need to appeal the fine to city administration. He argued he was bringing people together for a positive event to celebrate a rare success in Montgomery, but more people showed up than expected. Walker’s attorney, Preston Presley, said Walker was looking into installing a $30,000 sprinkler system that would allow him to expand capacity of the club. Councilwoman Audrey Graham brought up a past violation in March 2019 when Xscape was 42 people over capacity. “The first time there was a small amount and you paid the fine and we are here again,” Graham said. Graham did ask if the Council could reduce the fine. Councilman CC Calhoun said the fine was set by ordinance and the only way it could be reduced was by an administrative process through the mayor’s office. When asked if the mayor’s administration would appeal the fine, Director of Public Information Michael Briddell said he didn’t know what the mayor’s response would be, but other mayors have been reluctant to throw out a fine.\n\nAlaska\n\nGalena: A dog musher participating in an event near Galena was injured when she was struck by a snowmobile. Kirsten Bey, 64, of Nome was flown from Galena to Fairbanks with what Alaska State Troopers called “significant” injuries. Bey on Sunday night was participating in the Serum Run.

The driver of the snowmobile who struck Bey later contacted troopers and is cooperating with the investigation, troopers said.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:K-12 public district school spending increased in the state by $475million from 2018 to 2019, but the boost to teacher salaries promised by Gov. Doug Ducey fell short, according to a new report. The state Auditor General’s annual report examining classroom spending found that school districts spent 54.7% of their funding in the classroom in fiscal year 2019, a slight increase from 54% in 2018. It’s the third year in a row that classroom spending rose. The report also examined Arizona teacher salaries. Ducey in 2018 promised a 20% teacher raise by 2020. According to Ducey’s plan, about 10% of that raise would have been sent to schools by July 2019 to distribute. But during that period, according to the report, the average teacher salary actually went up 8.4%. The report does not include classroom spending data on public charter schools.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he will commute the life sentence of a woman convicted more than three decades ago of fatally shooting her husband, who had physically abused her. Hutchinson announced his intent to make Willie Mae Harris, 72, immediately eligible for parole, citing the physical abuse Harris suffered. Harris was convicted of first-degree murder in 1985. Harris admitted to shooting her husband, Clyde, but said it was an accident related to self-defense. Harris is legally blind and the state Parole Board several times over the years has recommended she receive clemency. Her case has gained renewed attention in recent months following columns by Arkansas Democrat-Gazette columnist Mike Masterson and a story by The Appeal, a website focused on criminal justice issues. In her most recent application for clemency, Harris said she did not receive a fair trial because none of the evidence of the abuse she suffered was presented. She included an affidavit from her aunt, who said Clyde Harris once broke Willie Mae’s hand with a universal joint from a car. Hutchinson also said planned to commute the sentence of Robert R. Johnson Jr., 36, who was sentenced in 2008 to 86 years in prison on multiple nonviolent drug offenses.\n\nCalifornia\n\nTemecula:A man who became wedged deep inside a narrow storm drain was extricated Tuesday following an hours-long rescue operation mounted by firefighters. The man, whose name was not released, was discovered about 1 a.m. about 270 feet inside the tunnel in the 31000 block of Hickory Place, near Aspen Way, according to the Riverside County Fire Department. There was no immediate word on how or why he got into the drain. A half-dozen engine crews and three truck companies, as well as a hazardous material unit, were sent to the location and initiated attempts to pull the man out of the 18-inch diameter passage, but he was uncooperative for unspecified reasons, and personnel had to switch strategies, according to the fire department. The ensuing technical rescue using industrial equipment, and relying on assistance from the Eastern Municipal Water District and the Temecula Department of Public Works, succeeded in removing him from the drain shortly after 9 a.m., according to the fire department. The man was taken to Inland Valley Medical Center in Wildomar for treatment of what were described as moderate injuries.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:The city has reached a $325,000 settlement with a woman who said she was beaten by a police officer in 2018 while being arrested on suspicion of shoplifting at a Target store, attorneys said. Natasha Patnode has said former police officer Todd Hopkins struck her with his fist and baton 50 times, sat on her and tased her, the Coloradoan reported Tuesday. Patnode reached the settlement with the city on Feb. 13, defense attorney David Lane said. City attorney Carrie Daggett confirmed the agreement. Hopkins responded to a shoplifting call from Target, authorities said. He was not wearing a body-mounted camera because his shift had just ended, but Target surveillance footage showed Hopkins grabbed Patnode by the collar, took her to the ground, used pepper spray and sat on Patnode as he tried to handcuff her, the newspaper said. Then-interim Police Chief Terry Jones requested an investigation of Hopkins, who resigned after it determined he should be fired. Patnode pleaded guilty to assault and resisting arrest. A shoplifting charge was dismissed.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The largest organization of cities and towns in Connecticut has called on the state and businesses to provide them with more help in addressing the expensive environmental fallout from chemicals in firefighting foam and similar products. The Connecticut Conference of Municipalities said the $2 million in borrowing Democratic Gov. Ned Lamont proposed in his budget is good but not enough. The funding is supposed to help cities and towns get rid of the foam, which contains toxins often called “forever chemicals,” and replace it with different firefighting products through a new buy-back program. There’s also more than $857,000 proposed in Lamont’s budget for things like replacing firefighting foam used by state agencies and to plan and test for the chemicals in statewide surface water and sediment. High levels of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, collectively called PFAS, have been found in drinking water systems in Greenwich, Willimantic and Enfield, the Hartford Courant reported in February. There were also multiple spills of thousands of gallons of firefighting foam containing the chemicals that entered the Farmington River last year.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:A Muslim cemetery that failed a code inspection and was ordered closed was granted special permission to bury a 1-year-old child, officials said. The Muslim Cemetery of Delaware in New Castle County was issued the permit this week, and will be able to continue burying people regularly once safety concerns are met, County Executive Matt Meyer said at a news conference Wednesday. The county closed the cemetery last week after learning it did not meet state code because it failed to provide designated parking spaces or paved paths through the grass, The Delaware News Journal reported. Officials were alerted to the problems after a rainy day this winter when visitors were seen placing wood planks over the ground to avoid mud, said Imam Muhammad Salaam of the Muslim Center of Wilmington. The Islamic Cemetery of Delaware remains registered with the state Department of Health and Social Service to have a cemetery on the property, and is legally permitted to perform funerals there once the safety issues are addressed. The county granted the cemetery a special permit for the Friday burial of infant Ja-Ziyah Gordon, who was set to be taken off life support after a battle with a terminal lung condition, the newspaper reported.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Librarians at some district public schools could see cuts in their positions next year, according to the Washington Teachers’ Union, WUSA-TV reported. The school district confirmed that it received “some” petitions regarding librarians in the budget submissions, but could not confirm the number. According to DCPS policy, librarians are classified as a “Level 2 staff member,” which means “flexible with petition.” Essentially, schools are not required to maintain the position if they state a case for the reallocation of that money to other needs. The union tweeted that 25 petitions have been submitted to get rid of librarians, saying the announcement came at a meeting with librarians Tuesday night. DCPS confirmed 25 petitions have been submitted to get rid of librarians. All but three came from East of River. The union and librarians said they’re concerned that increased budget cuts could cost them their jobs, and cost children the access to resources that Boyd said they will need to succeed.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Fears of the new coronavirus have led to postponement of the three-day Ultra electronic dance music festival, city officials said. The festival that draws thousands of people from around the world was set to begin March 20 at Miami’s downtown Bayfront Park. Steven Ferreiro, chief of staff for City Commissioner Manolo Reyes, said the event will be postponed, with an official announcement expected Friday. It’s likely Ultra could be postponed until 2021, meaning there would be no festival this year, officials said. Mayor Francis Suarez had said at an earlier news conference that Ultra should not go forward because of the coronavirus concerns. It wasn’t immediately clear how the postponement will affect people who bought tickets or whether other satellite events would still take place. Among the acts scheduled to perform at the main event are David Guetta, The Chainsmokers, Afrojack, Cash Cash, Martin Garrix and Galantis, according to the Ultra website.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state Senate unanimously passed legislation to restrict practices by pharmacy benefit managers – companies that run prescription drug coverage for insurers and other groups – just a day after the state House took similar action. The bill would require pharmacy benefit managers, called PBMs, to pass along discounts they receive from drug manufacturers for a particular medication to consumers. It would also subject PBMs to surcharges for ordering patients to use an affiliated pharmacy and require them to cover the cost of prescriptions at other pharmacies, among other provisions. It passed the Senate by a vote of 52-0, after the House passed a companion bill 165-1 on Wednesday. Supporters of the measure are concerned that PBMs – viewed as middlemen by critics – are overcharging patients, squeezing pharmacies and stifling competition that could bring down drug costs. PBMs argue that drug makers are responsible for setting initial prices, and they use their purchasing power to achieve savings.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A councilman accused of leading a methamphetamine ring must be held without bail, a U.S. judge ruled Wednesday. Arthur Brun led a major drug-trafficking conspiracy involving 11 other defendants since at least June 2019, while serving as an elected member of the Kauai County Council, prosecutors said after his arrest last week. Brun, vice chair of the council’s Public Safety and Human Services Committee, has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors argued in court documents that Brun must be denied bail because in allegedly leading the meth ring, he supplied guns, conspired with a gang leader, requested sexual favors for drugs and assaulted a law enforcement officer. Brun obtained meth from a leader of the United Samoan Organization gang and had the drugs mailed to Hawaii from California, prosecutors said. Another co-defendant is a convicted felon whom Brun used for protection, prosecutors said. Crystal meth is the drug of choice in Hawaii, where it’s known locally as “batu” or “ice.” Mailing or shipping drugs to Hawaii became more common with increased airport security after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when it got more difficult to smuggle drugs through air travel.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Legislation significantly increasing what it will cost nonresidents to hunt deer and elk in Idaho has been signed into law by Gov. Brad Little. The Republican governor signed the measure Tuesday that the Idaho Department of Fish and Game said resident hunters asked for so there will be less overcrowding in the field. Fish and Game is doing that by capping how many nonresidents can hunt deer and elk. But that will result in reducing Fish and Game revenue with fewer nonresident hunters. Estimates put the loss at $5.4 million and $9 million a year. To make up for that, Fish and Game is increasing hunting and fishing costs for nonresidents. Most notably, the costs for elk and deer hunting are going up dramatically, which are the two most profitable areas for Idaho Fish and Game. An elk tag for a nonresident hunter would cost $650. A fishing license would cost about $106. The increases will go into effect on Dec. 1. Fish and Game officials said the increases are the first in 10 years for nonresidents and put the state more in line with what neighboring states charge nonresidents for hunting and fishing. About 39,000 nonresidents bought elk and deer tags in 2019.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Casey Urlacher, a brother of Chicago Bears Hall of Fame linebacker Brian Urlacher, pleaded not guilty Wednesday to federal charges alleging he was part of an offshore sports gambling business. Urlacher, the mayor of the suburban Chicago village of Mettawa, entered his plea with nine others in U.S. District Court. He is charged with conspiracy and running an illegal gambling business. Prosecutors alleged Urlacher and the others were part of a ring that raked in millions of dollars. Urlacher, 40, acted as an agent for the gambling ring. He is accused of recruiting bettors in exchange for a cut of their eventual losses. acting with Urlacher as an agent was Nicholas Stella, 42, a Chicago police officer, prosecutors said. Stella has been stripped of his police powers. Among the other “agents” charged were Matthew Knight, 46, of Mokena; Justin Hines, 40, of Algonquin; Todd Blanken, 43, of Cary; Matthew Namoff, 23, of Midlothian; Vasilios Prassas, 37, of Chicago; and Keith Benson, 49, of Lombard. The ring was headed by 54-year-old Vincent DelGiudice of Orland Park, who paid a Costa Rica-based sportsbook a service fee to use its online platform and recruited gamblers to place wagers on the website, according to prosecutors. DelGiudice pleaded not guilty during Wednesday’s hearing and was released on his own recognizance. DelGiudice’s father, Eugene, 84, was also charged. Urlacher was elected mayor of Mettawa in 2013 and re-elected four years later. He said at a village meeting this week he intended to stay on as mayor while he fights the charges. However, he did resign from his position on the Illinois Civil Service Commission, to which he was appointed in 2013 by then-Gov. Pat Quinn.\n\nIndiana\n\nCarmel:Hamilton County Parks officials believe a 10-year-old turtle named Sputnik was stolen from Cool Creek Nature Center and are appealing to his abductor to return him, no questions asked. “Don’t just release him in the wild, he wouldn’t be able to survive,” said Parks and Recreation Director Al Patterson. “Our only goal here is to get Sputnik safely back in his enclosure.” Authorities said Sputnik was last seen during feeding time on Feb. 15 but was not discovered missing until Feb. 18 after President’s Day. He lived in a 50-gallon glass case on a stand, about eye level for small children, and was apparently lifted out and smuggled through the doors. “Unfortunately, we can’t keep our eyes on everyone at all times,” Patterson said. Sputnik is described as 8 inches tall and 6 inches wide, weighing 11/ 2 pounds with a ruddy brown shell, four claws and a happy disposition. He needs vegetables daily and sunlight and is accustomed to regular veterinarian care. There are no security cameras at the center and leads about Sputnik’s whereabouts have been few, Patterson said. Anyone with information about the tortoise can call Cool Creek Nature Center at (317) 774-2500 or the county parks offices at (317) 770-4400.\n\nIowa\n\nDecorah:A bald eagle known as Mrs. North laid her third egg on March 4, according to a livestream by the Raptor Resource Project. The Project estimated that Mrs. North would lay her first egg between Feb. 17 and Feb. 23, and she ended up laying her first egg on Feb. 21 and the second on Feb. 24 – just as she did in 2019. The nest is high in a white oak tree on private property near a stream. Another bald eagle named Mom Decorah laid her first egg on Feb. 26 and second on Feb. 29. According to the Project, this likely will be Mom Decorah’s last egg of the 2020 season. She is almost 17 years old and has now laid 36 eggs on the property, the project said in a Facebook post. Mom Decorah is mated to Decorah Male Two. Her original mate disappeared in April 2018. Their nest is settled in a tree near a trout hatchery. According to the project, eggs typically hatch in about 35 days, so viewers could be seeing at least one eaglet from either Mrs. North or Mom Decorah by late March or early April. A livestream of the Decorah eagle nest, which began last June for this mating season and has been following the eagles for 10 years, is consistently watched by more than 1,000 people. To view the livestream, visit www.raptorresource.org/birdcams/decorah-eagles.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A private school was closed Thursday after thieves broke in and stole technology, sports uniforms and damaged at least 10 rooms. Police said thieves broke into Topeka Lutheran School early Thursday. The damage was discovered when teachers and staff arrived to work, WIBW reported. More than 20 laptops and Chromebooks, several iPads, food, a document camera, cash, a security storage system and sports uniforms were taken, police said. The school canceled classes Thursday so teachers and staff could clean up the damage.\n\nKentucky\n\nWhitesburg: Letcher County Schools has removed a Bible verse from an athletic locker room after receiving a complaint from the Freedom from Religion Foundation. The decision came after the organization sent a letter to the district stating that the message violated the Constitution, schools Superintendent Denise Yonts told WYMT-TV on Wednesday. Yonts said officials decided to paint over the verse after consulting with the school board attorney becuase it was not a student-generated display. Freedom from Religion Foundation co-president Annie Laurie Gaylor said in a statement that she applauded the action.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport:Bossier Parish deputy Verdis Walker was promoted to Command Sergeant Major of the Louisiana National Guard. “It’s been a long time in the making. This is my 30th year as a guardsman and I’ve reached the pinnacle in the enlisted ranks,” Walker said. The ceremony was held at the Bossier Parish Sheriff’s Training Academy because Walker is going through police training at the academy. He is set to graduate from the academy on April 24.During the ceremony, Walker expressed this thanks and appreciation to multiple people in the audience, including his mother and father, who sat in the front row. Walker graduated from Haughton High School in 1984 and enlisted in the Louisiana National Guard a few years later. He started in the Army band in Bossier City and then moved into the Recruit Sustainment Program to help recruits prepare for basic training. Later, he deployed to Baghdad, Iraq, with the 39th Military Police of Camp Minden. For his service there, Walker was awarded a Bronze Star. He was sworn into the Bossier Sheriff’s Office by Sheriff Julian Whittington in March 2019. As of August 2019, Walker was assigned to the Bossier Maximum Security Facility.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A proposal to beef up health insurance benefits for retired emergency responders has received the approval of a state legislative committee. The bill from Democratic Sen. Nate Libby is designed to make stronger the state’s law about the health insurance program for retired firefighters and law enforcement officers. The Labor and Housing Committee unanimously approved the proposal on Wednesday. A previous law sponsored by Libby created a change in which counties and municipalities that employ first responders must notify them of the Retired County and Municipal Law Enforcement Officers and Municipal Firefighters Health Insurance Program less than two months after they are hired. Libby’s new proposal makes changes such as removing the requirement of five years of contributions by enrollees. It also changes the percentage of gross wages for contributions. The bill must pass the full House of Representatives and Senate to become law.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A measure to extend the state’s sales tax to most professional services has been rejected by a House subcommittee on Wednesday night. The measure would have raised an estimated $2.9 billion in fiscal year 2025. It was proposed to pay the state’s share of a major education funding plan that is advancing in the legislature. However, the extension of the tax was widely opposed by Maryland business groups. Del. Eric Luedtke sponsored the bill. He said a House subcommittee has advanced a smaller package of revenue measures for the education proposal, which would be phased in over 10 years. The Montgomery County Democrat said on Twitter that officials will have more work to do in the future to fund later years in the education measure.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The city’s first recreational marijuana shop – and the state’s first black-owned one – is set to open next week. The Cannabis Control Commission on Thursday authorized Pure Oasis to begin operations in three calendar days or later. The “commence operations” notice was the last administrative step needed after regulators awarded it a final license last month. Owners Kobie Evans and Kevin Hart said they plan to welcome the first customers to their storefront in Boston’s Dorchester neighborhood at 11 a.m. Monday. Pure Oasis is the first store to open after participating in the state’s “equity” programs to help black, Latino and other businesses owners from communities impacted by the war on drugs enter the legal marijuana industry. Massachusetts has nearly 40 retail marijuana locations, but only one is in Greater Boston: New England Treatment Access, in the affluent suburb of Brookline. Black and Latino groups have voiced their frustration for months at the slow pace of approvals for minority-owned businesses in Massachusetts and nationwide. And in Boston, Democratic Mayor Marty Walsh has faced criticism for his city’s particularly slow rollout of pot shops since voters approved legalizing marijuana in 2016. On Wednesday, Walsh announced he had appointed five people to a new Cannabis Board meant to oversee the local approval process.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:Art Van Furniture, the metro Detroit-based company and the Midwest’s top furniture and mattress retailer, said it is shutting down and will begin liquidation sales at all of its company-owned stores in Michigan, Illinois, Missouri and Ohio. The shock announcement comes just three years after the company’s sale by the Van Elslander family to a private equity firm. Boston-based private-equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners bought a majority stake in Art Van Furniture in early 2017, about a year before the death of company founder Archie Van Elslander at age 87. Art Van is expected to declare bankruptcy early next week. The filing would be a Chapter 11 reorganization, yet could potentially result in the permanent closure and liquidation of all Art Van Furniture stores – unless one or more buyers step forward to rescue the retailer. The liquidation sales will begin Friday at all Art Van Furniture, Art Van PureSleep and Scott Shuptrine Interiors in Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana and Missouri, as well as select Levin & Wolf stores in Maryland and Virginia. The Art Van stores are to close in 60 days. Art Van has about 190 stores and about 3,100 employees. Twenty of the stores are franchise locations, situated in the company’s “outmarkets” including the Upper Peninsula, Alpena, Mount Pleasant and Owosso in Michigan and in Indiana.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSartell:Riders of the Metro Bus ConneX on-demand ride service could see fares double for the remainder of the program’s pilot phase this year. The Metro Bus Board of Commissioners will hold a public hearing on the proposed change at 3:30 p.m. March 17 at Sartell City Hall, according to a release from Metro Bus on Tuesday. After a period of public comment, the board will vote whether to increase the fare for a single ride from $1.25 to $2.50, effective April 1. Fares for regular bus routes and Dial-a-Ride service will remain unchanged, and the increase wouldn’t affect free transfers. The service began its pilot program in January 2019, and was originally scheduled to last six months. It has been extended twice and ran through the end of December. Beginning February, the service began reduced hours and expanded its service area into the portion of Sartell east of the Mississippi River. Riders on the ConneX service can call to request pickup, after which a bus picks them up and anyone else requesting the service along the way. The service drops off at destinations or connects to regular bus lines. The service replaced most of Route 32 to cut down on expenses from constantly moving empty buses. The pilot program will end Dec. 31, after which the board will decide whether to make it a permanent service.\n\nMississippi\n\nStarkville: A man sentenced to 120 years in prison on a drug charge will soon be free. Circuit Judge Lee Howard freed 66-year-old Felix Wynn of Starkville during a hearing Tuesday at the Oktibbeha County Courthouse based on new sentencing guidelines, news outlets reported. Wynne was convicted in 2006 on two counts of selling cocaine. As a habitual offender, he was given 60 years for each count and a $2 million fine. Howard resentenced Wynne for the time he has served, 13 years and 10 months, and dropped the fine. Wynne will be held in the county jail until the Mississippi Department of Corrections processes his paperwork. His attorney, Roy A. Perkins, and the judge believe the paperwork process should take about four days. Perkins argued that the 120-year sentence was a misinterpretation of the law. Howard initially sentenced Wynn under a statute that orders the maximum sentence with no parole and no chance of early release, according to circuit court documents. Perkins said Howard was wrong to believe the maximum sentence was the only option, and he cited state Supreme Court precedent from 2017 that a person can, but does not have to, receive a double prison sentence for a second charge, the Commercial Dispatch reported. Wynne briefly spoke before the court during Tuesday’s hearing, during which he apologized and took full responsibility for the crime, WTVA-TV reported.\n\nMissouri\n\nUniversity City: A suburban St. Louis man accused of livestreaming threats to bomb and kill people in a bustling entertainment district while dressed as the Batman villain the Joker has been charged with terrorism. Jeremy Garnier, 48, of University City was charged Tuesday with a felony count of making a terrorist threat. A judge ordered Garnier held without bail, with court documents noting that he was a “danger to the community.” Court records did not list an attorney who can speak on his behalf. The charging document doesn’t indicate whether he was in possession of any explosives or was otherwise armed. Police responded Monday night to the Blueberry Hill restaurant and music club in the Delmar Loop neighborhood in University City after receiving a call about an active shooter, according to the charging document. The charges said Garnier had made threats while dressed as the Joker. A nearly hourlong livestream posted to the Facebook account for a Jeremy Joseph Garnier showed a man dressed as the Joker, complete with makeup, talking to the camera in a bedroom where he is putting on a costume. He’s later seen driving in his car, smoking a pipe and going to the St. Louis Galleria shopping mall in Richmond Heights, where he’s stopped by security and asked to leave. The video then shows him talking about ending the country’s opioid epidemic before he enters the venue where he orders a soda, saying: “I can’t be inebriated when I’m planning on, you know, killing a bunch of people.” Within minutes, the man was handcuffed with the livestream still rolling. Garnier has eight burglary and stealing convictions dating to 1990.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman:A snowmobile trail groomer survived after accidentally triggering an avalanche on Feb. 27 and being swept in his vehicle about 165 feet downhill. Daniel Kristensen, 30, of Belgrade, president of the Gallatin Valley Snowmobile Association, was working his way up an old logging road in the Gallatin Canyon that climbs out of Storm Castle Creek up and over the divide to Swan Creek. At about 8 p.m., he was about 3 to 5 miles from finishing when he encountered a large drift across the road. Using the PistenBully snow groomer’s front blade, he began breaking up the drift, pushing the snow off the road on the downhill edge. It was a route he had driven once earlier this winter. While grading the ,snow Kristensen triggered an avalanche on the slope above him. It broke 2 to 3 feet deep and 100 feet wide before crashing downhill on a 38-degree slope. In the 470 feet before reaching the road, the snow picked up speed and grew larger before striking the groomer on the driver’s side. When the machine came to a stop against some pine trees, it was right-side up and still running. Snow filled three-quarters of the cab because all of the windows had been broken out. Kristensen said he took about 30 seconds to assess the situation: he was alive, no limbs seemed broken and there was no blood gushing. Yet his mind was still in disbelief about what had happened. If the avalanche had been larger, if logs or rocks had been tossed into the cab as it rolled, or if his arm had been thrust out the window when the machine tumbled, the situation could have been much worse. “I got so lucky,” Kristensen said. “It’s a blessing for me.” He said he has a sore neck from the crash and scratched up his hands digging through the glass-filled snow in search of his gloves, but other than that, he’s OK. The club will now reasses where they groom because the route he was on doesn’t get a lot of traffic.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Dangerous weather conditions for brush fires were forecast Thursday for much of the state, meteorologists said. A red flag warning from the National Weather Service said low humidity and wind gusts up to 45 mph were expected. Brush fires have blackened thousands of acres across Nebraska this week, officials said. Regional 26 emergency manager Alma Beland estimated that firefighters battled flames Monday on between 1,500 and 2,000 acres between Thedford and Stapleton. A blaze north of Lodgepole forced closure of U.S. Highway 30 for a time Wednesday. It was contained by 6 p.m., officials said. It’s not clear how many acres were charred.\n\nNevada\n\nReno:Firefighters contained a blaze in an apartment building where two people were rescued by firefighters on ladders and a young child was dropped to safety from a third-floor window and caught by a passer-by Thursday. No injuries were reported. There was no immediate word on cause of the fire. Battalion Chief John McNamara said a fire truck on a nonemergency call diverted to the apartment building after firefighters spotted a large smoke column. Once there, they saw heavy smoke coming from second- and third-floor apartments. Arriving firefighters saw a crowd outside the building and a child being dangled out of a window, McNamara said. “Before they could stop them, the child was dropped and was caught. Then we threw some ground ladders up to the third floor windows and assisted the two residents out the windows,” he said. Other residents were evacuated without incident. Regarding possible injuries, it“made a huge difference” that the child was caught and that firefighters quickly rescued the two other people, he said. Firefighters quickly contained the fire but at least 12 units suffered damage, McNamara said. “It could have been a lot worse,” he said. Twelve fire trucks with approximately 50 firefighters responded to the three-alarm fire.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A female bear who journeyed thousands of miles to return home after being saved and relocated by Gov. Chris Sununu is preparing to emerge from her den with three new cubs. Sununu joined Fish and Game officials on Wednesday to check on “Mink,” who was set to be euthanized along with three of her offspring in 2017 after repeated problems with them feeding from trash and bird feeders culminated with two bears entering a home in Hanover. Sununu instead ordered them to be moved to far northern New Hampshire, but by last spring, Mink had found her way back to her preferred home near Dartmouth College. The bear is hibernating in a den in the same area. Sununu said her three male cubs weigh just over 6 pounds each and are all in good health. Mink’s three yearlings were moved soon after the public outcry over the euthanasia plan in 2017, but one was killed within weeks by a hunter in Quebec, Canada. Mink wasn’t captured then because she left town to mate and later returned with four cubs in 2018. She was fitted with a tracking collar in June of that year and moved about 120 miles north, but returned to Hanover last May after traveling thousands of miles in a looping route through New Hampshire and Vermont. Officials favoring euthanasia had argued the animals were no longer afraid of humans and likely would find new neighborhoods to frequent if moved, or would eventually find their way back to Hanover.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nBridgewater Township:Two state troopers pulled a trucker to safety just seconds before his burning tractor-trailer exploded. Trooper Robert Tarleton had stopped a vehicle on Interstate 287 on Monday when he saw the truck become engulfed in flames after it hit a guardrail and bridge abutment, state police said. “He immediately returned the driver’s credentials and ran back to his troop car to request for fire and emergency medical services personnel to respond to the crash,” state police said. Tarleton drove to the scene of the crash, where State Police Lt. Edward Ryer, who was headed home from work, was trying to rescue the driver. Police body camera video showed the two troopers worked together to drag the trucker from the cab to safety seconds before it exploded. The driver sustained minor injuries. His name has not been released. The cause of the crash was under investigation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCuyamungue: A woman is facing a larceny charge after authorities said she stole a neighbor’s anatomical skeleton model that allegedly was making an offensive gesture toward her. Court documents filed Monday showed that Diana Hogrebe was charged with one count of larceny in connection with the skeleton heist, the Santa Fe New Mexican reported. Hogrebe told Santa Fe County Sheriff’s deputies she was offended by the way the skeleton’s hand was posed – with the middle finger pointed up. Hogrebe told the Santa Fe New Mexican the episode was the culmination of a monthslong feud between her and neighbor Joseph Downs, who she said has hassled her family and other nearby residents. “I just, you know, had it,” Hogrebe said. “It was like the last straw that broke the camel’s back, and I don’t know what to do.” The skeleton has not been located, authorities said. According to the deputy’s statement of probable cause, the skeleton was a gift to Downs from a family member and was worth about $1,500.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: A reptile breeder in upstate New York has paid a $500 fine related to the possession of more than 150 venomous snakes in his home, the state Department of Environmental Conservation said. The DEC said in a report that investigators got a warrant to search the Orange County home of Darren Paolini after the man was hospitalized for a venomous snake bite last June. He had been bitten by a Taiwanese pit viper at his home, where he had a sophisticated breeding operation in the basement. Officers seized 157 live venomous snakes and several years of breeding records from Paolini’s Newburgh home. The snakes, which included 29 species, were turned over to the Bronx Zoo. DEC said Paolini told an investigator he gets snakes from importers, breeds them and trades the babies for new snakes. Paolini pleaded guilty to misdemeanor commercialization of wildlife charges in February and agreed to pay a fine, DEC said. In June, Paolini told News12 Westchester that he had studied Asian pit vipers for 30 years and was an expert on breeding them. “It’s just been a love in my life. A passion since a young child,” he said. He said he had believed reptile permits he obtained in 2005 were still valid.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nHillsborough: A federal inmate has died from injuries sustained in a fight with at least one fellow prisoner, authorities said. A verbal altercation between Maurice Antoine King, of Durham and at least one other inmate escalated late Wednesday at the Orange County Detention Center, a county sheriff’s spokeswoman said in a statement. King, 35, was taken to a hospital following the fight and was pronounced dead, the statement said. The other inmates involved were not immediately identified. Sheriff’s officials didn’t comment on the circumstances leading to the fight or the nature of King’s injuries. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office was continuing to investigate.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMinot: State regulators voted Wednesday to reject a permit for a proposed wind farm in Ward and McLean counties. The Public Service Commission denied the permit for Southern Power’s Ruso Wind project by a 2-1 vote, the Bismarck Tribune reported. But the commission left open the possibility of reconsidering the project. The project had difficulties complying with a 2017 state law requiring new technology to stop lights atop the turbines from blinking red all night. Southern Power planned to use radar-based light-mitigating technology, which would have turned off the lights at night except for when aircraft pass in the vicinity of the turbines. But the Minot Airforce Base raised concerns that the blinking lights could tip off an enemy to a helicopter’s location – the Air Force flies hundreds of helicopter missions annually to intercontinental ballistic missile sites, some near the proposed turbines. Others complained that flashing red lights would ruin the dark night sky. A message left with Southern Power was not immediately returned to the Associated Press.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: The city’s police chief will not discipline a police supervisor who detained a 12-year-old black youth’s sister the day the youth was fatally shot by a white police officer while playing with a pellet gun. Cleveland.com reported that Chief Calvin Williams dismissed the civilian complaint against Sgt. Janell Rutherford on Monday. Cleveland police Sgt. Jennifer Ciaccia said the decision would not become official until the end of a 30-day period during which an appeal can be made to the city’s Public Safety Director. The city’s Civilian Police Review Board had recommended in November that Rutherford receive an unpaid suspension of six to 10 days for keeping Tamir Rice’s 14-year-old sister, in the back of a police cruiser for over an hour after Tamir was shot in November 2014. Rice’s sister filed the complaint against Rutherford in 2015. Subodh Chandra, an attorney for the Rice family, issued a statement that said the children’s mother, Samira, “is no longer shocked by the unwillingness of the police chief to hold anyone accountable, but she is disappointed.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Voters rejected a citizens’ initiative for a dedicated parks sales tax largely on the strength of voters’ opposition in Cleveland and Canadian counties, The Oklahoman reported. The loss was a blow to former Ward 2 Councilman Ed Shadid, who promoted the initiative campaign that collected nearly 8,000 signatures to qualify for the ballot. Former Ward 4 Councilman Pete White ran a shoestring campaign to pass the initiative. The campaign was a rare case of citizen legislating in Oklahoma City. Only five previous citizens’ initiatives had made it to the ballot since 1930. All five were approved. Two of those, in 1989 and 1990, created dedicated sales tax revenue streams for public safety and for the Oklahoma City Zoo.\n\nOregon\n\nKlamath Falls: Because of low snow pack and precipitation, Gov. Kate Brown signed an executive order this week declaring a drought in Klamath County. Brown issued a drought declaration saying that the extremely low water supply is causing natural and economic disaster conditions heading into spring and summer, the Capital Press reported. The declaration gives state agencies the ability to expedite water management tools such as emergency water permits, exchanges, substitutions and in-stream leases to mitigate conditions on the ground. Snowpack is 35% below normal in the Klamath Basin as of March 4, according to the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service. Mountain snow is crucial because it acts as a natural reservoir, replenishing streams and lakes during the irrigation season. Neighboring Rogue and Umpqua basins in Southern Oregon are also lagging behind typical nowpack , as are the Lake County and Goose Lake areas. Ken Stahr, surface water hydrology manager at the Oregon Water Resources Department, serves as co-chair of the state’s Drought Readiness Council, which considers requests from counties for drought aid. He said no other counties have filed applications yet, though now is the time of year when communities might begin to sense the impacts of drought.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State troopers will now be allowed to have tattoos on their arms, but those who do will have to wear long-sleeved uniform shirts that conceal them when they are on duty, the agency announced Wednesday. In a statement, Col. Robert Evanchick, the state police commissioner, said the policy change reflects an “evolving public perception” about tattoos. The agency hopes the new policy will widen its field of potential recruits. Before Wednesday’s announcement, troopers could have tattoos, as long as they were not visible to the public. Troopers still cannot have tattoos that are above their neckline or below their wrist, the state police said. Tattoos that could be seen as hateful or discriminatory toward any race, national origin, gender, religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity are prohibited. A committee will review tattoos on prospective cadets during the hiring process.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A man authorities have said is the leader of the Rhode Island chapter of the Hells Angels motorcycle club will remain behind bars after failing to “keep the peace” while out on bail. Superior Court Magistrate Richard Raspallo ordered Joseph Lancia, 28, of Smithfield to be locked up after being arrested over the weekend for a scuffle at a strip club, WPRI reported Wednesday. He was charged with disorderly conduct and simple assault in connection with a fight late Saturday night outside the Cadillac Lounge after a Providence police officer said he witnessed Lancia punch someone, knocking him unconscious. At the time, he was out on a $100,000 bail in a separate case after he was indicted by a grand jury for allegedly firing a gun at a truck as the driver was passing by the Hells Angels headquarters. Prosecutors at Tuesday’s hearing said that the Saturday night brawl broke the terms of his bail and asked that he remain in custody. His attorney, Joseph Voccola, said security video showed his client was coming to the defense of his fellow club members when he punched the off-duty member of the strip club’s security team. The judge ordered Lancia to be held without bail. He is due back in court on March 10.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nLancaster: Two people were accused of having 10 dead dogs and 26 malnourished animals on their property. Steppes Stagvelt Starwolf, 62, and Stevie Jenna Starwolf, 53, have been charged with ill treatment of animals, news outlets reported. The relationship between the pair was not stated. The dead and sick animals were found Friday during a welfare check at a home in Lancaster, according to a news release from the Lancaster County Sheriff’s Office. Ten dog carcasses were found in a trash bag outside the house, the sheriff’s office said. No one answered the front door when officers arrived, but officials obtained a search warrant and entered the home. Authorities said 25 huskies and a cat were inside the house, some in cages. “None of the animals had accessible food or water, and all appeared to be malnourished and in ill health,” the release stated. Both suspects returned to the home Friday night with another dog in their vehicle. They appeared before a magistrate on Saturday. Both were released after posting $10,000 bond. It was unclear whether they had attorneys to comment on their behalf. The sheriff’s office said all of the animals were taken to a shelter for treatment.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: A proposal to give South Dakotans the option to take the written portion of driver’s license examinations in Spanish is headed to a final vote in the House after a committee approved it Thursday. Proponents from the Latino community in South Dakota told lawmakers it would empower them to get to work, take their kids to school and participate in community events. A similar proposals died last year, but the measure this year appears to have broad support, including from business groups. It has passed in the Senate. Alex Ramirez, a member of the Hispanic Business Network in Sioux Falls, said South Dakota is one of three states that does not allow driver’s license exams to be taken in Spanish. It has sent a message to Latinos that they are not welcome in the state, he said. Sen. V.J. Smith, a Brookings Republican who introduced the bill, said he has had to overcome attitudes from constituents and some lawmakers that people should only speak English. He pointed out that there are German-speaking communities in the state. The House Transportation committee passed the bill on an 8-3 vote. Lawmakers opposed to the measure said drivers should be able to read road signs in English.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Two mobile units have been deployed to help residents who lost state driver’s licenses or photo identification in severe storms that ravaged Tennessee counties this week. Tennessee’s Department of Safety and Homeland Security said Wednesday that mobile units that can issue duplicate licenses or photo IDs have been sent to Nashville in Davidson County and Cookeville in Putnam County.Fees for duplicate licenses or IDs will be waived, officials said. Meanwhile, Tennessee’s Department of Commerce and Insurance has set up a facility at Centennial SportsPlex in Nashville to answer questions about insurance policies and storm coverage. Major insurance carriers will be in attendance also for people to make claims in person, officials said. Officials are also helping residents with insurance questions at the Wilson County Emergency Management Center in Lebanon and the Putnam County 911 Center in Cookeville. State emergency officials said 24 people died when fast-moving storms crossed Tennessee early Tuesday. Eighteen of them, including five preteen children, died in Putnam County, some 80 miles east of Nashville. Eighty-eight more were injured in the county.\n\nTexas\n\nPort Arthur: A 24-year-old man was sentenced Wednesday to 30 days in jail for posting on social media a video last August of himself removing an ice cream container from a Texas market freezer, licking the contents and returning the container to the freezer. D’Adrien Anderson, 24, also was sentenced to an additional six-month jail term probated for two years and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and $1,565 in restitution to Blue Bell Creameries, which had to replace all of its products in the freezer. Anderson began serving his jail term immediately after sentencing. The incident happened Aug. 26 at a Walmart in Port Arthur. Store surveillance cameras showed that he finally took the Blue Bell ice cream from the freezer and bought it, which wasn’t captured in the social media video, authorities said. Anderson could have been sentenced to up to a year in jail and fined $4,000 for misdemeanor criminal mischief. Port Arthur is about 85 miles east of Houston.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Brigham Young University reiterated Wednesday that “same-sex romantic behavior” is not allowed on campus – dashing the hopes of LGTBTQ students who thought they could be more open after the college previously revised its code of conduct. The university, owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, posted a letter online, saying it was clarifying a misinterpretation after it dropped a section of the code banning behavior that reflected “homosexual feelings.” A college administrator wrote that the recent revision doesn’t change the “moral standards” of the church or the faith’s opposition to same-sex marriage. The letter and an accompanying Q&A posted online don’t provide details about what romantic behaviors are and aren’t allowed, but seem to shut the door on the notion that gay and lesbian couples will be allowed to kiss and hold hands on campus like their heterosexual classmates. “Same-sex romantic behavior cannot lead to eternal marriage and is therefore not compatible with the principles included in the honor code,” wrote Paul V. Johnson, commissioner of the church education system. BYU officials said on Feb. 19 that questions about permitted behaviors by same-sex couples would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, but the issue hadn’t been addressed again until the letter was released Wednesday. The clarification letter caused fury and heartbreak among LGBTQ students and allies, said former BYU student Addison Jenkins, a past president of a campus support group for gay and lesbian students. He called it “cruel” to dash the hopes of LGBTQ students who felt the campus climate would become more welcoming, and then two weeks later issue this new letter that shows “anti-queer rules” remain.\n\nVermont\n\nBennington: Twelve towns have voted to become founding members of a regional communications group to spread high-speed internet to underserved neighborhoods. Residents approved their town’s participation in the Southern Vermont Communications Union District this week, the Bennington Banner reported Wednesday. Tim Scoggins, the head of the task force that worked to create the group, said the new internet system will likely be in place within three to five years. The group plans to form a governing board made up of representatives from each member town. The board is expected to meet in April. The towns included in the group are Arlington, Bennington, Dorset, Landgrove, Manchester, Peru, Pownal, Rupert, Sandgate, Shaftsbury, Sunderland and Woodford.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: For the fourth year in a row, nature lovers will be able to watch a livestream of a peregrine falcon nest in downtown Richmond. The Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheries has set up a live video feed of the nest on the 21st floor of the Riverfront Plaza building. The feed is available for viewing online at www.dgif.virginia.gov/falcon-cam. The department said in a news release that wildlife officials have confirmed that last year’s new male – identifiable by his bands – is back again with an unbanded female. In the past two years, there has been a lot of turnover in falcons at the site and no nesting, although the birds have appeared on camera. Officials said the return of the male falcon is a sign of some stability, and they are optimistic that the pair will breed successfully. The department, which manages the threatened birds, has collaborated for the last four years with Comcast Business to provide connectivity for the live broadcast. March is typically a busy month as falcons tend to nest during this time following a period of courtship, with the first egg laid around mid- to late-March. The falcon cam will remain live until July.\n\nWashington\n\nMoses Lake: A police dog had his left removed during surgery after being shot while chasing a suspect, authorities said. The suspect led police officers on a car chase for several miles Feb. 28 before getting out of the vehicle and running away, KING-TV reported. The suspect was pursued by an officer and his police dog partner, Chief, authorities said. The suspect shot Chief in the eye during the pursuit before officers returned fire, fatally shooting the suspect, police said. Chief initially needed a breathing tube, but was stabilized and treated over a few days by veterinarians at Washington State University. The bullet destroyed Chief’s eye and broke his jaw, but did not cause other permanent damage, health officials said. Chief had eye-removal surgery Wednesday before going home to recover, officials said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State officials announced a restoration project was underway to bring back bobwhite quail, which disappeared from the state in the late 1970s because of habitat destruction and harsh winters. The five-year plan launched last week when 48 of the birds were captured in Texas and released at the Tomblin Wildlife Management Area, news outlets reported. The West Virginia Division of Natural Resources was working with the Texas Parks and Wildlife agency on the plan, according to a news release from the governor’s office. Transmitters have been placed on some of the quail for monitoring. The goal is to create “a self-sustaining population” of quail, said Michael Peters, DNR Game Bird and Small Game Project Leader, in the release. The restoration effort has been underway for the past several years. The state DNR acquired the Tomblin WMA, a 32,000-acre tract of former surface-mined land in Logan and Mingo counties, in 2015.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Part of a city-owned closed landfill at 1600 E. College Ave. near Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport will be dedicated to generating solar power, under a resolution adopted by the Common Council. Aldermen on Tuesday unanimously approved leasing to We Energies about 8 acres, where the company will build and operate a 2.25-megawatt solar array through its Solar Now pilot program. The lease lasts 20 years. The resolution states that revenue from the lease “is intended” to be put toward other climate action initiatives. The lease payments will depend on what’s generated, but they’re estimated to be between $90,000 and $100,000 each year, Ald. Scott Spiker said. The city won’t pay anything to build or maintain the solar array, he said. It will be built next to the 128th Air Refueling Wing of the Air National Guard, and in an emergency, the solar field would provide a source of energy for the base should something happen to the electrical grid.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: Actor Harrison Ford and rapper Kanye West will take part in a celebrity softball game for charity in Wyoming. The game June 13 in Cody will raise money for cancer research, organizer Ryan Brown told the Casper Star-Tribune. Other confirmed players include former Denver Broncos football players Byron Chamberlain, Spencer Larsen and Shawn Moore, said Brown, athletics director for the city of Cody and host of a local radio show. “The crazy thing is they don’t know who I am,” Brown said. “They’re just like, ‘Yeah, I’m in.’ It’s just amazing how people jump on stuff like this.” Tickets for the game and related events can be purchased online for as low as $2.24. Sponsorships range from $50 to $5,000. Ford is best known for his roles in the “Star Wars” and “Indiana Jones” movie franchises. He has a home in Jackson. West recently bought two ranches in the Cody area and has become active in the community.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/05"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/11/22/sequoia-toll-daffodil-project-ferret-release-news-around-states/49419721/", "title": "Sequoia toll, Daffodil Project: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A television station has donated thousands of items including historic footage from the civil rights era to the Alabama Department of Archives and History, which will make the material available to the public. WSFA-TV in Montgomery announced it had given the agency materials dating to the 1950s, including footage from news conferences by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., coverage of the Freedom Riders in 1961 and original film from the “Stand in the School House Door” by then-Gov. George C. Wallace in 1963. The video also includes scenes from a visit to the NASA center in Huntsville by the President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon Johnson in 1962 and special reports on the death of former University of Alabama football coach Paul “Bear” Bryant in 1983. As the TV station was planning to switch locations, managers determined it wasn’t practical to move the large numbers of delicate film reels and boxes full of video and other items. Steve Murray, the state archives director, said archivists had long suspected the WSFA studios held valuable content for historical preservation, and his department jumped at the opportunity to add to its collection when a phone call came in late 2019.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Members of the Biden administration have launched a series of events aimed at exploring the Arctic’s potential to act as a “living laboratory of clean energy innovation.” Officials participating in the online event, billed as “ArcticX,” spoke of the challenges faced by remote communities in Alaska’s Arctic region, such as high energy costs and impacts from climate change. During the event’s broad discussions, they said they see opportunities for sustainable or renewable energy systems. Wednesday’s meeting was the first of four planned online events, with an in-person gathering set for May in Alaska. Among the speakers was U.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm. Offices that fall under the department co-hosted the event. “We hope to combine the world-class expertise of our national labs, of our 17 national labs, with the know-how that Arctic communities have developed over centuries of innovation in the far north so together we can get new technologies out of the lab and into the field and onto the market and support communities in taking control of their own clean energy future,” Granholm said. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, renewable sources accounted for about 30% of Alaska’s electricity generation in 2019. Many rural communities rely largely on diesel electric generators for power.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The state’s Motor Vehicle Division failed to notify more than 34,000 drivers that their licenses had been suspended, revoked or canceled and also lagged for months in alerting prosecutors. The MVD notified county attorney’s offices around the state of the problem Wednesday, saying in an email that notices weren’t mailed “beginning in late 2020 and ending in March.” A glitch with the agency’s mailing process was the cause. “When MVD discovered this issue in February 2021, the first step was to understand what caused the problem, the extent of customers affected and how to resolve the problem,” MVD spokesman Doug Parcey said in an email. “Once those were known, the affected customers were immediately notified.” Some prosecutors learned about the issue from defense attorneys. Potentially thousands of drivers might have been arrested and prosecuted or paid hefty fines because they unknowingly drove with a suspended license. Prosecutors in Maricopa and Pinal counties have already flagged more than 1,000 cases. Municipal and justice courts will also have to review cases involving suspended licenses. “Our first priority is to look at convictions,” said Rachel Mitchell, acting division chief of the Maricopa County Attorney’s Office. “We are focusing on prison. … It is certainly scary for me as a prosecutor.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: State lawmakers on Friday delayed a vote on whether to allow state-run health care facilities to require employees to get COVID-19 vaccines – a move officials say is needed to protect millions of dollars in federal funding. The Arkansas Legislative Council voted to delay considering the requests by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, the Department of Human Services and the Department of Veterans Affairs for an exemption from a state law banning vaccine requirements by government entities. The law conflicts with a federal COVID-19 vaccine requirement for health care workers issued by President Joe Biden’s administration that’s set to take effect in January. A group of Republican-led states, including Arkansas, have asked a federal judge to block its enforcement. UAMS could lose $600 million in Medicare and Medicaid funding and another $100 million in federal contracts if it doesn’t comply with the federal rule, Chancellor Dr. Cam Patterson told the panel. Patterson said the exemption was needed to ensure that the university’s workers are in compliance with the federal requirement and that funding isn’t threatened. The panel did not set a date for considering the exemptions. But legislative leaders said they hoped to meet before Dec. 5.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Lightning-sparked wildfires killed thousands of giant sequoias this year, leading to a staggering two-year death toll that accounts for up to nearly a fifth of Earth’s largest trees, officials said Friday. Fires in Sequoia National Park and surrounding Sequoia National Forest tore through more than a third of groves in California and torched an estimated 2,261 to 3,637 sequoias, which are the largest trees by volume. Nearby wildfires last year killed an unprecedented 7,500 to 10,400 giant sequoias that are only native in about 70 groves scattered along the western side of the Sierra Nevada range. Losses now account for 13% to 19% of the 75,000 sequoias greater than 4 feet in diameter. Blazes so intense to burn hot enough and high enough to kill so many giant sequoias – trees once considered nearly fireproof – put an exclamation point on climate change’s impact. A warming planet that has created hotter droughts combined with a century of fire suppression that choked forests with thick undergrowth have fueled flames that have sounded the death knell for trees dating to ancient civilizations. “The sobering reality is that we have seen another huge loss within a finite population of these iconic trees that are irreplaceable in many lifetimes,” said Clay Jordan, superintendent of Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The Denver suburb of Aurora has agreed to pay $15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the parents of Elijah McClain, a Black man who died after police stopped him on the street and put him in a neck hold two years ago, the city and family attorneys announced Friday. A federal magistrate judge accepted terms of the settlement after a mediation session, said Qusair Mohamedbhai, an attorney for McClain’s mother, Sheneen McClain. Outside court, Sheneen McClain said she was glad to have the agreement finalized but noted the work of fighting for justice for her son just makes her miss him more. “The money is just the world’s way of saying, ‘We’re sorry,’ but it’s not going to help me heal the hole in my heart,” she said. The settlement amount was agreed to in July but not officially disclosed until now because of a dispute between McClain’s parents about how the wording of the agreement could affect their dispute over how the money should be divided. Sheneen McClain said Elijah’s father, LaWayne Mosley, was not involved in raising him. How the money will be divided will be addressed separately. In a statement, Mosley did not address the dispute but said he hoped the settlement would send a message to police. “I hope Elijah’s legacy is that police will think twice before killing another innocent person,” he said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nPlymouth: Officials believe nearly 40 drug overdoses across the state since July may be linked to marijuana laced with the powerful opioid fentanyl and are warning the public about the potential danger. State health officials said marijuana seized in Plymouth after an overdose in early October tested positive for fentanyl at the state crime lab. “This is the first lab confirmed case of marijuana with fentanyl in Connecticut and possibly the first confirmed case in the United States,” Dr. Manisha Juthani, the state’s public health commissioner, said in a statement Thursday. Officials had been investigating reports of people across Connecticut who overdosed and were revived with naloxone but denied using opioids. They told authorities they only smoked marijuana. There were 11 such overdoses in July, nine in August, nine in September and 10 from Oct. 1 to Oct. 26. No deaths were reported. Brian Foley, an aide to state public safety Commissioner James Rovella, said the state crime lab will now be testing all marijuana that police submit for fentanyl. An estimated 100,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in a recent one-year period – a never-before-seen milestone that health officials say is tied to the COVID-19 pandemic and a more dangerous drug supply.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: In October, as the state allocated $78 million in federal money to health care facilities struggling with staffing shortages, hospitals received $25million total – only about one-third of what they requested. Health care workers, who have been fighting the coronavirus for nearly two years, have said they’re burned out and exhausted. Some chose to leave the hospital bedside or the profession entirely. Others declined financial incentives of several hundred dollars offered to fill shifts, citing mental health reasons. Many are jumping ship to other hospitals in Delaware or the Philadelphia area because health systems are providing hefty signing bonuses and significant increases in pay. Hospitals are also relying on travel nurses, who work in three-month shifts, to fill the gaps. Travel nurses can make twice as much or more what permanent hospital nurses take home in pay. ChristianaCare requested $40 million in federal aid, according to documents provided by the governor’s office. Instead, the state’s largest hospital and private employer received $12 million, the biggest sum any health system received. ChristianaCare, like others, continues to offer $10,000 signing bonuses for a number of open nursing positions.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser’s decision to ease mask requirements in the nation’s capital has sparked a public debate about timing, with the majority of the D.C. Council pleading with her to reconsider. It’s a localized debate that reflects a broader national dynamic in the country’s coronavirus-mitigation stance, with some leaders and businesses pushing for more normalcy after the successful reopening of schools and others preaching caution against reckless pre-winter moves. Starting Monday, masks will no longer be required in many indoor spaces in D.C. They must still be worn in multiple settings, including schools, libraries, public transportation, ride-share vehicles, and group-living facilities like nursing homes, dorms and jails. Private businesses will still be able to require customers to wear masks. Bowser has cautiously hailed the step as a “shift in where we are with the pandemic,” saying the return of the mask mandate earlier this year helped blunt the late-summer surge of the delta variant. The nation’s capital originally lifted its indoor mask requirement for fully vaccinated individuals in May but reinstated it in late July as cases began to rise again. According to D.C. Health Department statistics, the current seven-day average of new cases is higher than it was in May but still well below the late-summer delta-variant peak.\n\nFlorida\n\nStuart: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has completed work on a $339 million Everglades restoration project aimed at cleansing water runoff before it flows into a troubled river. Corps and local officials held a ceremony Friday for the 12,000-acre project in Martin County known officially as the C-44 Reservoir and Stormwater Treatment Area. It’s a key part of a broader effort to restore the vast Florida Everglades. The reservoir will capture, store and clean fertilizer-laden runoff from farms and development before it is routed into the St. Lucie River and ultimately the Indian River Lagoon. Both have been plagued by harmful algae blooms and other long-term problems associated with water pollution that threatens wildlife and human health. “I think it’s huge” for the east coast, said Chauncey Goss, chair of the South Florida Water Management District. “Not only symbolically, but it’s also going to be taking water, cleaning it up and helping to get rid of some of these discharges, which is really the goal of all of this.” The project can store 19.7 billion gallons of water, according to state water managers. It will use plants such as cattails to suck up about 35 metric tons of phosphorus every year before the water makes its way into the St. Lucie River.\n\nGeorgia\n\nCumming: Leaders with Forsyth County Schools, Congregation Beth Israel and the OneForsyth Council have planted 500 daffodil bulbs outside the school district’s new Forsyth County Arts and Learning Center as part of the Daffodil Project, a worldwide initiative aiming to plant the flowers all over in honor of each of the 1.5 million children who died during the Holocaust. Thanks to the partnership, Forsyth County will now be home to 500 of those daffodils, which will bloom in the spring on Holocaust Remembrance Day. FCS Superintendent Dr. Jeff Bearden, Rabbi Levi Mentz with Congregation Beth Israel and OneForsyth Council Chair Kristin Cook all gave opening remarks at a Nov. 8 ceremony before county and school district leaders began planting each of the bulbs. Cook said she was proud to be there, speaking on behalf of OneForsyth, the Forsyth County Chamber of Commerce’s diversity initiative, and modeling their guiding principles of uniting, celebrating and promoting inclusion in the county. “Our hope is that, by continuing to support events like these, we will all grow to appreciate the unique identities that embody us all,” Cook said. Metz said he was overjoyed to see the project coming to Forsyth County, his involvement feeling personal to him and his family since his grandfather was a survivor of the Holocaust.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is considering additional protections for waters off the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. NOAA announced the proposal to designate oceanic areas of Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument, which is already one of the largest protected natural areas in the world, as a national marine sanctuary on Friday. The agency opened the plan to public comment through January. The designation would build on existing protections meant to maintain marine habitats and wildlife. The new rules would apply only to oceanic areas, not the islands that are already part of the monument. “Papahānaumokuākea’s ecosystems are increasingly under pressure from threats such as marine debris, invasive species, and climate change,” NOAA Administrator Rick Spinrad said in a statement. NOAA, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the state of Hawaii and the Office of Hawaiian Affairs currently co-manage the monument. Papahānaumokuākea is larger than all other U.S. national parks combined and is home to endangered Hawaiian monk seals, green sea turtles, seabirds and extensive coral reef ecosystems. The area is home to many species found nowhere else on Earth.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: If anyone has a good idea on how to put a nuclear fission power plant on the moon, the U.S. government wants to hear about it. NASA and the nation’s top federal nuclear research lab on Friday put out a request for proposals for a fission surface power system. NASA is collaborating with the U.S. Department of Energy’s Idaho National Laboratory to establish a sun-independent power source for missions to the moon by the end of the decade. “Providing a reliable, high-power system on the moon is a vital next step in human space exploration, and achieving it is within our grasp,” Sebastian Corbisiero, the Fission Surface Power Project lead at the lab, said in a statement. If the effort is successful in supporting a sustained human presence on the moon, the next objective would be Mars. NASA says fission surface power could provide sustained, abundant power no matter the environmental conditions on the moon or Mars. “I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth,” Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement. The reactor would be built on Earth and then sent to the moon.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A new store at the Illinois State Museum will feature products from the state, along with themed souvenirs, specialty foods and toys. The Shop opened to the public Saturday. Families were invited to attend an opening event in their flannel and fleece pajamas. The store is located in the first floor of the Illinois State Museum, which owns and operates the Shop to fund programs and research. Cinnamon Catlin-Legutko, the museum’s director, called the opening an important moment in the museum’s return to operations. Former Gov. Bruce Rauner’s administration shut down the museum in 2015 during an ongoing budget impasse. It reopened the following year but since then has seen closures related to the coronavirus pandemic. The museum was established in 1877 and has branch facilities in Lewistown and Lockport.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: A renewed push for the state to join more than two-thirds of states with some form of legalized marijuana use appears to face the same roadblock from Statehouse Republicans who have opposed such a step for many years. Legislative Democrats and the state Democratic Party united last week in urging approval of marijuana legalization during the legislative session that starts in January, arguing that it could benefit those wanting to use it for medical purposes, create new jobs and become an additional state tax revenue source. The Republican-dominated Legislature has not taken any action on bills submitted over the past decade for allowing medical marijuana or removing criminal penalties for possessing small amounts of the drug, even as recreational marijuana sales have won approval in Michigan and Illinois and as medical use is allowed in Ohio. Legalization advocates haven’t yet changed the minds of legislative leaders, who reject arguments that Indiana is losing money to neighboring states and point to pot still being illegal under federal law. “I think when you make the argument about having that substantial a public policy change just because you’re trying to chase dollars makes no sense to me, so I’m in the same place I’ve been,” Republican House Speaker Todd Huston said.\n\nIowa\n\nAmes: A city park will now be named Ioway Creek Park to align with the creek’s name change earlier this year. The Ames City Council voted unanimously last week to change the name of Squaw Creek Park to Ioway Creek Park. In February, the U.S. Board on Geographic Names changed the name of Squaw Creek, a 42-mile-long tributary of the South Skunk River, to Ioway Creek, as the original name is considered derogatory to Native Americans. The Ames Tribune reports that an Indigenous teen, Fawn Stubben, pushed for the change in the 1990s, but the proposal wasn’t considered until Ames resident Jasmine Martin applied to the federal board in 2019. The Ames City Council and Story County Board of Supervisors both voted in support of the change. The current name honors the Ioway, an Indigenous tribe that once lived in parts of Iowa. Creek sign names have since been adjusted around Ames, but there were still remnants of the former name, including Squaw Creek Drive. The street was renamed Stonehaven Drive as part of the meeting’s consent agenda. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland on Friday formally declared “squaw” a derogatory term and said she is taking steps to remove it from federal government use and to replace other derogatory place names.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Next year, the state will start requiring employers, individuals and health insurance companies to pay some costs associated with coronavirus testing. The state Department of Health and Environment announced Friday that it will start phasing out free screening tests for people who aren’t showing COVID-19 symptoms or haven’t potentially been exposed. The agency said it expects the policy to begin in March 2022. The department said it can’t sustain having public health agencies cover the cost of all testing indefinitely. The agency said it initially allocated $141 million in federal funds to make coronavirus tests available and support commercial and university labs to expand processing and sampling capacity. But the department said infections from the delta variant depleted the funds faster than expected. “Testing has become an increasingly important way in which those who choose to be unvaccinated may still be able to work, attend events, and travel,” Ashley Goss, the department’s acting secretary, said in a statement. The changes will mainly affect programs used by employers to test 10% of their workers on a regular basis and programs by community organizations to offer free rapid tests.\n\nKentucky\n\nLexington: The city has received a perfect 100 score from the Human Rights Campaign, a national civil rights organization, for its laws, policies, services and programs to protect and support lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender communities. The city received a total score of 106 for additional steps it has taken over the past few years to benefit the LGBTQ community. It’s the highest ranking of any city in Kentucky, though Louisville has received a perfect score for several years. A 100 is considered a perfect score, but cities can earn up to 122 additional points for programs and services. “We’ve worked hard to create an atmosphere welcoming all people,” Lexington Mayor Linda Gorton said. “That hard work has resulted in the highest score received by a Kentucky city.” It’s the first time since the rankings began eight years ago that Lexington has earned a perfect score. In 2020, it received a 95 out of 100. Lexington received high marks despite Kentucky not having a statewide LGBTQ nondiscrimination law. The Human Rights Campaign evaluated more than 506 cities across the country. Other evaluated Kentucky cities include Berea, Bowling Green, Covington, Frankfort, Morehead and Owensboro. Covington’s score was 96. The lowest-scoring Kentucky city was Owensboro with 18.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: State lawmakers on Friday lambasted Louisiana’s temporary housing program enacted after Hurricane Ida, saying it continues to move too slowly to help people living in damaged homes and tents since late August. “We’re moving at a snail’s pace. It’s just unbelievable,” said Sen. Mike Fesi, a Houma Republican who represents Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes, which were among the hardest hit by Ida. The state has spent $90 million in federal disaster aid on more than 2,000 trailers to provide temporary shelter to residents in southeastern Louisiana. Half have been placed on residents’ properties and other community housing sites, and 653 families have moved into the trailers so far, the Governor’s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness told lawmakers. The program has received near-constant criticism about the time it’s taking to place trailers since Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration launched the Hurricane Ida Sheltering Program on Oct. 4. That critique spilled over into Friday’s meeting of the Joint Legislative Committee on the Budget, as the homeland security agency asked lawmakers to approve $500 million in authority to spend federal disaster recovery aid. Director Casey Tingle defended the housing program, telling lawmakers: “We have a brand new program that’s never been done before.”\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: The developer of a $1 billion electric transmission line is suspending construction at the request of the governor after she certified election results Friday in which residents firmly opposed the project. Democratic Gov. Janet Mills had urged New England Clean Energy Connect Transmission LLC to stop construction on the 145-mile project until legal challenges are resolved. Thorn Dickinson, president and CEO of NECEC, said work will be temporarily halted until a judge rules on a request for a preliminary injunction in its lawsuit contending the referendum was unconstitutional. “This was not an easy decision. Suspending construction will require the layoff of more than 400 Mainers just as the holiday season begins,” Dickinson said in a statement Friday evening. Mills supports the project but said she also supports “the rule of law that governs our society and the will of the people that informs it.” Funded by Massachusetts ratepayers, the project would supply up to 1,200 megawatts of Canadian hydropower to the New England power grid. That’s enough electricity for 1 million homes. Critics said the project is damaging the woods and changing the character of a part of western Maine with little if any benefit for its residents.\n\nMaryland\n\nFrederick: With sailboats taking over Carroll Creek, a unique holiday tradition has returned to downtown Frederick for its sixth year. About two dozen sailboats were launched in the creek Saturday as part of the annual Sailing Through the Winter Solstice project. Volunteers rushed about Saturday morning, lowering the boats off the banks of the creek into the water. Some volunteers had the unenviable task of wading through the water on the chilly November morning to ensure the boats were anchored in place. Peter Kremers, who co-founded and serves as the chair of the event, said there were about 25 sailboats in and around the creek this year. Now in its sixth year, the project has quickly grown into a beloved part of the holiday season in the city. This year’s event has more sailboats than ever. “We started with one boat in ’16,” Kremers said of the project’s speedy growth. “I think last year we had maybe 19 in the water; this year we have 22 boats in the water and three on land.” The sailboats will stay on Carroll Creek until March, each fitted with lights and decorations to brighten up the dark nights of winter. But the goal isn’t just to make the downtown look nice. The project also helps raise a significant amount of money for a number of local charities.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A 48-foot white spruce chosen as the city’s Christmas tree has arrived from Nova Scotia as part of a decades-old tradition. This year’s tree was donated by L’Arche Cape Breton, a nonprofit that provides homes and work for people with disabilities. The 60-year-old tree was on the nonprofit’s property on Canada’s Cape Breton Island. A police escort brought the tree to Boston Common on Thursday, WCVB-TV reports. Nova Scotia donates a tree to Boston every year as a token of gratitude for relief efforts by Bostonians after a munitions ship exploded in Halifax Harbor in 1917, killing or injuring thousands of people. It will be lit Dec. 2. For Massachusetts residents buying a Christmas tree locally, finding the perfect one may prove difficult this year. Tree sellers are expecting one of their busiest and most challenging seasons yet, The Boston Globe reports. Last year, with many people cooped up at home during the pandemic, everyone wanted a tree – sometimes more than one, the National Christmas Tree Association said. Many local Christmas tree farms cut and sold trees they normally would have left in the ground. That means some sellers this year have fewer, shorter trees.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Pure Michigan is marketing the state’s upcoming winter season in an advertising campaign running in key regional and state markets. The Still Pure Michigan campaign is expected to run through the end of February and use broadcast and connected television, online video and digital ads, and social media, the Michigan Economic Development Corp. said. Much of the focus of the tourism and marketing campaign will be on travel and shopping. Advertising spots will run in Detroit, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, Battle Creek, Lansing, Flint, Saginaw, Bay City, Traverse City, Cadillac, Marquette and Alpena. They also will be seen in Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Kentucky. This year’s total winter advertising budget tops $3 million. The launch of the Pure Michigan campaign comes just ahead of the opening of many of Michigan’s ski resorts for the year, according to the MEDC. “As winter approaches, adventure awaits us in the form of downhill skiing, fat-tire biking or snowshoeing epic backcountry landscapes,” Travel Michigan Vice President Dave Lorenz said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Farmers across the state who grow about 45 million turkeys annually will benefit from higher prices this year, according to agriculture experts. The Minnesota Department of Agriculture said the price of turkeys has steadily increased as demand has risen following a year when there were fewer family gatherings, and restaurant traffic was down due to the coronavirus pandemic. “USDA is actually predicting this year to be a record-high price for turkeys,” said Tim Petry, a livestock marketing economist with the North Dakota State University Extension Service. “From a price standpoint, these are the best prices they’ve seen for a number of years. So, you know, that’s good news for producers.” The good news on prices is tempered somewhat by rising costs to raise the birds on more than 500 farms in the state, Minnesota Public Radio News reports. Higher prices for corn and soybeans to feed the turkeys are cutting into profits, growers said. “Those are our two biggest ingredients, and and those prices were substantially higher than last year or past years,” said Jessica Westbrock, the president of the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association. While turkey prices are up 17 cents a pound from last year, Petry said consumers are still likely to find bargains, as many stores sell turkeys below cost.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi School Boards Association is joining a handful of other states in breaking ties with the National School Board Association after the nonprofit sent a letter to President Joe Biden asking for federal support investigating harassment and threats of violence against school board members. Mississippi School Boards’ leadership wrote this week in a letter explaining the decision that the National School Boards Association’s “inflammatory language and the request for federal agencies to intervene in our communities, was just one in a series of lapses in governance.” It said Mississippi will end its relationship with the nonprofit NSBA on June 30, 2022, the end of the term for which the Mississippi School Boards Association has paid its dues to the national organization. Mississippi will then work with school board associations in other states to form a new organization that “will provide services to its member state school boards associations which are requested by and tailored to each member state school boards associations’ unique needs.” Local school boards across the country have become political battlegrounds over issues such as COVID-19-related mask rules, the treatment of transgender students, and how to teach the history of racism and slavery in America.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: A couple who gained fame after waving guns at protesters near their home in 2020 are seeking to keep their law licenses by arguing their actions were justified because they were defending their property from a violent and threatening mob. Mark and Patricia McCloskey, who are both lawyers, made that claim in response to a complaint asking the Missouri Supreme Court to suspend their licenses. The demonstrators went past the McCloskeys’ home June 28, 2020, at the height of racial injustice protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. The couple, who were eating dinner on the patio with their daughter, responded by waving two weapons at the protesters. No shots were fired, and no one was hurt. Their actions gained praise from conservatives, including then-President Donald Trump. Mark McCloskey is now a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate. They contend in their legal response that the demonstrations “involved significant unlawful and violent conduct,” KCUR reports. The response cites a report by the Major Cities Chiefs Association finding nearly 89% of protests in St. Louis in June 2020 involved unlawful activity, and 11% involved some level of violence. Still, special prosecutor Richard Callahan has said his investigation determined the protesters near the McCloskeys’ home were peaceful.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: The Biden administration on Friday said it will consider new measures to protect greater sage grouse, a bird species once found across much of the West that has suffered drastic declines in recent decades due to oil and gas drilling, grazing, wildfires and other pressures. The announcement of a range-wide evaluation of habitat plans for greater sage grouse came after the Trump administration tried to scale back conservation efforts adopted when Biden was vice president in 2015. A federal court blocked Trump’s changes. But Biden administration officials said the attempt set back conservation efforts – even as the chicken-sized bird’s habitat was further ravaged by wildfires, invasive plants and continued development. U.S. Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., said he believed Bureau of Land Management Director Tracy Stone-Manning – a former aide to the lawmaker – would pursue a collaborative, balanced approach that will keep sage grouse from becoming an endangered species. But Gov. Greg Gianforte and Sen. Steve Daines criticized the action, saying states should be given deference to manage wildlife and federal lands kept open for energy exploration and grazing. Daines said state and local conservation efforts needs to be protected from “federal overreach,” while Brooke Stroyke, a spokesperson for Gianforte, said Montana already has a plan that balances conservation and rural economies.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state’s unemployment rate fell to a mere 1.9% last month – the lowest any state has reached since data collection began in 1976, according to labor statistics released Friday. The October rate reported by Nebraska’s labor department and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics marked the first time any state’s unemployment rate dropped below 2%. Spokespeople for both agencies confirmed that Nebraska’s rate is the country’s lowest on record. Nebraska has maintained its status as the state with the lowest rate through much of the pandemic. Its 1.9% rate for October was down slightly from the September rate of 2%. Nebraska Labor Commissioner John Albin said total nonfarm employment has risen by more than 30,000 from October of last year. The state reported 1,031,001 filled jobs in October, which was 10,718 more than the previous month. Nebraska has struggled with a chronic worker shortage since even before the pandemic, and it has driven up wages and made it difficult for employers to hire and expand. Earlier this month, the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce & Industry released a survey of its members in which 92% said finding skilled workers was a top priority.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A big southern Nevada sewage pumping facility failed last year, spewing an estimated 500,000 gallons of wastewater and leaking into a creek that leads toward the Lake Mead reservoir on the Colorado River, a television station investigation found. Officials want to spend $40 million to rehabilitate the Clark County Water Reclamation District wastewater lift station, where the January 2020 spill was blamed on a corroded underground pipe, KLAS-TV in Las Vegas reports. Most of the spilled sewage was vacuumed up from land outside the Whitney Lift Station, KLAS-TV reports, citing documents, photos and emails obtained with a public records request. But an estimated 10,000 gallons – about enough water to fill an average kidney-shaped backyard swimming pool – went into a nearby creek that feeds the Las Vegas Wash. The wash flows to Lake Mead, the drought-stricken reservoir that provides about 90% of the Las Vegas-area drinking water supply. The Whitney Lift Station is one of 24 similar facilities operated by the reclamation district, which was formed in 1956 to reclaim wastewater from unincorporated Clark County, the largest jurisdiction in the Las Vegas area. The district treats nearly 106 million gallons of wastewater per day, according to its website.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: State lawmakers accepted $22.5 million in federal COVID-19 vaccine funding Friday that has sparked intense debate and angry protests for the past two months. The Joint Fiscal Committee had tabled a request from the Department of Health and Human Service in September to spend the money to hire new workers to promote the vaccines and help providers comply with the state’s new vaccine registry system. Meanwhile, the Executive Council, which approves state contracts, initially rejected the money before reversing course earlier this month. On Friday, three Republicans joined the committee’s three Democrats in voting to accept the money. Four Republicans voted no, with some citing concerns that language in the grant would require the state to follow future federal directives and mandates related to COVID-19. “The action we take today will be historic,” said Sen. Bob Giuda, R-Warren. “It will be historic because we will either reject the notion of subservience to government coercion, or it will be historic because we accede to that notion and violate the most fundamental premises of freedom upon which our state and nation were founded and which are imperiled as never before in our nation’s history.” Giuda predicted the vote would become a campaign issue next year. At least one audience member agreed, shouting at Sen. Chuck Morse, R-Salem: “Treason! You will never get elected again, Morse! You’re done!”\n\nNew Jersey\n\nJersey City: The decades­long odyssey to find the remains of Jimmy Hoffa, a tenacious leader of the Teamsters union, apparently has turned to land next to a former landfill that sits below an elevated highway in the Garden State. The FBI obtained a search warrant to “conduct a site survey underneath the Pulaski Skyway” last month, said Mara Schneider, a spokeswoman for the Detroit field office. She didn’t indicate whether anything was removed. The FBI’s disclosure is another turn in a mystery that has gripped law enforcement for more than 45 years. Hoffa was last seen July 30, 1975, when he was to meet with reputed Detroit mob enforcer Anthony “Tony Jack” Giacalone and alleged New Jersey mob figure Anthony “Tony Pro” Provenzano at a restaurant in suburban Detroit. The focus now is in Jersey City, below a four-lane bridge where the sound of cars and trucks doesn’t stop. Wild overgrown brush thrives in the gritty industrial area, and green dumpsters abound. No one nearby at Interstate Waste Services offered a comment. “I’ve been assured that the body hasn’t been dug up yet,” journalist Dan Moldea said, referring to the FBI’s work in October.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Internet problems continue to slow down many students in the state, but a pilot project using TV signals to transmit computer files may help. On Thursday, state public education officials distributed devices to eight families in Taos that allow schools to send them digital files via television. The boxes the size of a deck of cards allow digital television receivers to connect with computers using technology called datacasting. Many rural areas of New Mexico are too far from internet infrastructure such as fiber cables and cell towers but do get TV reception. In October, local broadcasting affiliates of New Mexico PBS finished testing the technology to make sure they could set aside bandwidth not taken up by TV show broadcasts and dedicate it to broadcast downloadable digital files. The pilot program in Taos relies on a broadcast from northern New Mexico PBS affiliate KNME, while two others are planning to roll out pilot programs in the cities of Silver City and Portales. Remote learning during the pandemic highlighted the digital divide for New Mexico students, many of whom had to learn using paper packets while their peers could participate in virtual lessons via video chat.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The New York Assembly’s investigation into former Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s conduct in office concluded the Democrat’s administration misrepresented how many nursing home residents died of COVID-19, according to a lawmaker who reviewed the committee’s still-secret report. Assembly Member Phil Steck was among the Assembly Judiciary Committee members who were able to review a copy of the approximately 45-page report Thursday and Friday in advance of its public release, possibly as soon as this week. The report, compiled by the New York City law firm Davis Polk & Wardwell, covers a wide array of allegations of misconduct by Cuomo, including sexual harassment claims and the participation of his staff in writing his book on the coronavirus pandemic. Other topics include the Cuomo administration’s manipulation of data on COVID-19 deaths as presented to the public. Gaps in the state’s statistical accounting of fatalities include the administration’s decision to exclude from its nursing home death totals thousands of patients who died after being transferred to hospitals. The Davis Polk investigators confirmed press reports that the state Department of Health wanted to include those hospital deaths in the state’s nursing home fatality count.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: A bear cub wandering around a neighborhood with a jug stuck on its head is running free in the forest again thanks to wildlife biologists and some observant residents. Wildlife biologists with the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission spent two days searching for the bear cub, according to a news release. The commission said the bear likely got stuck while going through some trash and was wandering around an Asheville neighborhood. District Biologist Justin McVey got the initial report about the bear Monday night. Commission officials reached out to the public to help identify its location. McVey said a combination of responses to a message posted to NextDoor by the commission and direct calls to biologists, local residents led personnel directly to the bear cub. The bear was anesthetized before the jug was taken off its head. Biologists performed a health check before relocating it to a remote area in western North Carolina.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nMedora: The Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library has agreed to take a controversial equestrian statue of the 26th president that has stood on the steps of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City since 1940. The bronze statue, designed by James Earle Fraser, was commissioned by the Board of Trustees of the New York State Roosevelt Memorial in 1929. The library opening next year in Medora will be getting it as a long-term loan. The statue, which depicts the former president on horseback with a Native American man and an African man flanking the horse, has been the subject of years of criticism that it symbolizes colonial subjugation and racial discrimination. Objections grew more forceful after the death of George Floyd sparked a racial reckoning and a wave of protests across the U.S. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio announced plans to remove the statue in 2020, calling it “problematic,” which drew an angry response from President Donald Trump, who tweeted: “Ridiculous, don’t do it!” With the support of members of the Roosevelt family, the North Dakota library will establish an advisory council composed of representatives of Indigenous and Black communities, historians, scholars and artists to “guide the recontextualization” of the statue.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed into law a map of new congressional districts Saturday that will be in effect for the next four years, despite objections from Democrats and voting rights groups. DeWine said in a statement that, compared with other proposals from House and Senate lawmakers from both parties, the Senate legislation he signed “makes the most progress to produce a fair, compact, and competitive map.” The redistricting measure cleared the Legislature along party lines with House approval Thursday after a breakneck sprint through both chambers, amid praise from majority Republicans. Democrats blasted the Republican-led mapmaking process as unfair, partisan and cloaked in secrecy. The Senate approved the bill Tuesday, only about 16 hours after the new map was released. The nonpartisan Princeton Gerrymandering Project gave the map an F grade. The new law creates at most three safe Democratic districts out of 15 new U.S. House seats in a state where voters are split roughly 54% Republican, 46% Democratic. Populous Cuyahoga and Hamilton counties – home to Cleveland and Cincinnati, respectively – are divided three ways each. Franklin County, home to Columbus, is divided two ways, and the western Cleveland suburbs in Lorain County are part of a district that stretches to the Indiana border, a nearly 3-hour drive.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The state’s building code commission has undermined the efforts of its own committee tasked with reviewing energy conservation standards by shooting down proposed changes and completing a takeover of the committee itself. Last week’s actions leave green building in Oklahoma a dozen years behind, stuck in 2009, standing pat with current minimum standards, said Kelly Parker, chairman of the committee whose months of work was spurned. The committee started its work in May as part of a state-mandated code review every six years to update the state’s modified versions of various building codes. But committee members had not seen the commission’s recommendations on energy conservation until they were presented Tuesday. Commission Chairman Cary Williamson, Ardmore’s fire chief, wondered why and argued that the energy committee, effectively shut down in October, should have been allowed to do its job. Commissioner Kyle Lombardo, an architect with Rees Associates, complained that he was not given time to review the complex, technical recommendations, which will go to state lawmakers next year. The Oklahoma Uniform Building Code Commission further eroded efforts to make home construction in the state more environmentally friendly, Parker said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: A man who was protesting outside the city’s federal courthouse when a federal law enforcement officer shot him in the face with a “less lethal” impact munition is suing in federal court. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports the lawsuit filed by Donavan LaBella calls the unnamed officer’s actions “unprovoked, unjustifiable, and unlawful.” LaBella’s injury July 11, 2020, was captured on video and shared widely. The video depicts then-26-year-old LaBella holding a speaker over his head, pointed at the courthouse. Federal officers turn on a bright light, and then an officer fires a less lethal munition striking LaBella. Like other protesters who have tried suing federal law enforcement agencies over injuries at protests for racial justice, LaBella’s attorneys have struggled to identify the officers. The lawsuit names “John Does 1-10″ as unknown federal law enforcement officers, believed to be with the U.S. Marshals Service, present or responsible for shooting LaBella. Desiree LaBella, Donavan’s mother, said the people responsible for injuring her son need to be held accountable. “As much as we wish it didn’t have to come to this, he’s irreparably damaged,” she said. He now suffers from a debilitating, permanent frontal lobe brain injury that has negatively altered the course of (his) life,” the lawsuit says.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Frozen vials labeled “Smallpox” that were discovered in a freezer at a vaccine research facility in the state “contain no trace of virus known to cause smallpox,” federal health officials said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday that testing showed the vials contain “vaccinia, the virus used in smallpox vaccine,” and not the variola virus, which causes smallpox. The CDC had said Monday that the vials “were incidentally discovered by a laboratory worker” who was wearing gloves and a face mask while cleaning out the freezer. The CDC said no one was exposed to the contents. Mark O’Neill, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania Department of Health, told the New York Times that the vials were found at a Merck facility in Montgomery County. It was not clear why the vials were in the freezer. The CDC said it was “in close contact with state and local health officials, law enforcement, and the World Health Organization” about the findings. Smallpox is a deadly, infectious disease that plagued the world for centuries and killed nearly a third of the people it infected. Victims suffered scorching fever and body aches, followed by spots and blisters that would leave survivors with pitted scars.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island Public Transit Authority is getting a $900,000 federal boost to develop plans for a high-capacity transit corridor to connect Central Falls to Warwick via Providence, according to the state’s congressional delegation. The corridor was one of five goals included in RIPTA’s Transit Master Plan for the next 20 years. The planning grant could enable RIPTA to complete the preliminary work needed to eventually bring a bus rapid transit or light rail project to the region. The $900,000 planning grant is made available through the Rebuilding American Infrastructure with Sustainability & Equity grant program, for capital investments in surface transportation that will have a significant impact on or directly benefit areas of persistent poverty. The state’s congressional delegation and RIPTA CEO Scott Avedisian have scheduled a news conference for Monday at the agency’s Chafee Transportation Center in Providence to discuss the study and its potential impacts.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nSeneca: One of the most wanted fugitives in the United States apparently died about four months ago in a South Carolina home about 16 years after he was first wanted in San Diego for sexually assaulting children, investigators said. Frederick Cecil McLean, 70, died of natural causes in July, but his body wasn’t found until Nov. 6, when someone asked deputies to check on a neighbor who hadn’t been seen in a while, Oconee County Coroner Karl Addis said. McLean has been on the U.S. Marshal Service’s 15 Most Wanted list since 2006, a year after the San Diego Sheriff’s Department issued arrest warrants for sexual assaults on a child and determined he was a high risk to continue attacking girls. One girl was assaulted more than 100 times before she turned 13, marshals said in a statement. McLean had been living in South Carolina for 15 years, going by the name of James Fitzgerald, marshals said. “The discovery of Frederick McLean’s body marks an end to the manhunt, but the investigation continues,” U.S. Marshals Service Director Ronald Davis said. Investigators are now trying to determine if anyone helped McLean avoid being found by police. They have determined he used several other aliases and also lived in Anderson, South Carolina, and Poughkeepsie, New York.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nMcIntosh: The work of two wildlife management agencies has resulted in the release of 28 endangered black-footed ferrets on the South Dakota side of the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, which straddles the Dakotas. The push behind the effort by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe Game and Fish Department and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is twofold: to maintain control of black-tailed prairie dogs in an area of the reservation used primarily for grazing and to save from extinction the black-footed ferret, considered the most endangered mammal in the U.S. They are yellowish-buff in color and weigh 11/ 2 to 2 pounds. The forehead, muzzle and throat are white, and the feet are black. They have a black mask around the eyes that is well-defined in young ferrets. The ferrets were released Oct. 20 in prairie dog towns between McIntosh and Bullhead, said Michael Gutzmer, ecologist with New Century Environmental, the Nebraska company that provides biological services to the tribe, The Bismarck Tribune reports. Prairie dogs make up 90% of the black-footed ferrets’ diet. The ferrets live in prairie dog burrows, and each eats a prairie dog about every three days, said Seth Gutzmer, biologist on the Standing Rock project and Michael Gutzmer’s son. The ferrets were considered extinct in the wild in 1987.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: Friends and associates of slain rapper Young Dolph handed out Thanksgiving turkeys at a neighborhood church Friday, two days after he was gunned down in broad daylight inside his favorite bakery. Known for acts of charity in his hometown, the hip-hop artist and label owner had helped organize the event at St. James Missionary Baptist Church and was going to participate before he was fatally shot Wednesday. Undaunted, members of his music label, Paper Route Empire, along with church volunteers and community activists, distributed dozens of turkeys, stuffing mix and cranberry sauce to people driving past the church. It was the type of event Young Dolph, who grew up in the Castalia neighborhood where the church is located, has been organizing for years, often without the reporters and cameras present Friday. Before the event, volunteers spoke quietly among themselves or sat in solemn reflection as his music played outside the church on the sunny afternoon. Label employee Bee Bee Jones, 38, helped hand out the food, honoring his friend of 30 years. “When I hear his music, I just break down,” Jones said. “The truth in all of it, and where he came from, that’s what really gets to me sometimes. This is what he would want us to do right here, still keep on giving. He came from nothing, but he wanted to make sure everybody got some.”\n\nTexas\n\nBig Spring: A pickup truck heading the wrong way on a West Texas highway slammed into a bus carrying members of a high school band, killing three people, officials said Friday. Two students from the bus were critically injured in the late Friday afternoon crash on Interstate 20 in Big Spring, about 250 miles west of Fort Worth, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. The bus from Andrews High School was headed to a football game with 25 students aboard when it was hit by the wrong-way truck, which burst into flames, killing the truck’s driver, said DPS Sgt. Justin Baker. One of the adults from the bus was also pronounced dead at the scene, he said. A third adult and two students were airlifted to University Medical Center in Lubbock, 95 miles north of the crash site. The adult died at the hospital, and the two students were listed in critical but stable condition, Baker said. Other students were taken to the Scenic Mountain Medical Center for treatment of minor injuries, he said. The football playoff game between Andrews and Springtown in Sweetwater was postponed.\n\nUtah\n\nBeaver County: Climate change has been making droughts more frequent and intense and limiting Utah farmers’ ability to grow crops. In the past two years, a growing number of farmers have signed up for a state program that helps fund projects to increase their water use efficiency, KUER-FM reports. Among them is Trent Brown, a longtime rancher and farmer in Beaver County who’s also the county assessor, since farming doesn’t pay all the bills. It’s a family tradition: His father and grandfather were ranchers and farmers and worked government jobs, too. Brown finished the switch from growing alfalfa to grass five years ago to save water, but it wasn’t enough to overcome this summer’s drought. Earlier this year, he used a grant from the state’s Water Optimization Program to replace the cement in a ditch that brings water from the nearby Manderfield Reservoir to him and other farmers in the valley. “The concrete ditch was put in in the ’60s, and it was just falling apart, failing,” he said. “We were losing a lot of water. We figure probably 20%.” Utah established the Water Optimization Program in 2020. It got $3 million in state funding that year and another $3 million in 2021. During the latest round, the program got 81 applications totaling $10.6 million – more than triple the money available to spend, according to the program’s director, Jay Olsen.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Captain Snowpants; Yo Bro, No Snow; Plow-A-Tron 6,000; and Jennifer Snowpez are among the names that will be on some of the state’s snowplows this winter. Vermont school students participated in the state transportation department’s Name a Plow contest to come up with names for the plows serving their communities. The entries ranged from “creative and clever to cute and silly,” the agency said. Participating schools got a visit from their newly named plows last week. One child was so upset she had missed the visit from the snowplow named Super Snow Storm that the driver and plow will visit again, said Amy Tatko, spokesperson for the Vermont Agency of Transportation. The full list of the Vermont names – including Snowbegone Kenobe, Plowy McPlowFace, Brr-rito and Steve – can be found on the transportation department’s website.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam issued an executive order Thursday aimed at improving how the state receives and evaluates input from tribal nations when making decisions about permits related to environmental, historical or cultural resources. The order directs four agencies to draft their own policies within 90 days for working with tribal nations before a permit is approved or denied. The Northam administration said this would help Virginia identify and understand concerns from tribal nations before finalizing permits, according to the Richmond Times-Dispatch. The directive applies to the Department of Conservation and Recreation, the Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Historic Resources, and the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. Northam’s executive order also directs the secretary of the commonwealth to appoint an ombudsman who can work with both state agencies and tribal nations. Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin will take office a month before Northam’s deadline and could potentially cancel the executive order. The Youngkin transition team didn’t immediately respond to the Times-Dispatch’s requests for comment.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: As lawmakers prepare for a new legislative session to craft and pass a supplemental budget, they’ll have more money to work with thanks to a steady increase of state revenues over the past year. Updated numbers by the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council released Friday show that projected revenue collections for the 2021-2023 budget cycle are $898 million above what had been originally forecasted in September. And projections for the next two-year budget cycle that ends in mid-2025 increased by more than $965 million. Revenues for the current budget cycle that ends mid-2023 are now projected to be $60.2 billion. And projected revenues for the next two-year budget cycle that starts July 1, 2023, are projected to be about $64 billion. Steve Lerch, the chief economist and executive director of the council, said compared to the first forecast this year in March, overall revenues increased $3.6 billion for the current biennium and $4.1 billion for the next. Republican legislative members of the Economic and Revenue Forecast Council said in response to the strong growth, tax cuts should be part of any final plan. Democratic budget writers said nothing is off the table but expressed caution.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBramwell: A 128-year-old church collapsed suddenly in the middle of the night Thursday, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. Bramwell’s historic Holy Trinity Episcopal Church, which has stood since 1893, caved in about midnight, Mayor Louise Stoker told the paper. The church’s original congregation included many of the town’s first residents, Stoker said. The Independent Bible Church later occupied the building before donating it to the town, which had been planning to conserve the historic structure. “I’ve been in dialogue with a preservation contractor,” Stoker said. “This week, in fact, we had sent him photos.” Workers clearing the debris noted things that could be saved such as large wooden beams and the old church bell. Some of the church’s Queen Anne-style stained glass windows were also mostly intact. Stoker said the town council will discuss what to do next, but it’s possible that a portion of the building that didn’t collapse will have to be taken down. Standing outside the church Friday, she pointed out six circular stained glass windows in the remaining structure. “Not one of them has a broken piece,” she remarked.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: As the state kicked off its 170th deer gun season Saturday, some hunters were feeling ill-equipped for the second straight year. A nationwide ammunition shortage due to the supply chain issues affecting other products has left hunters searching far and wide for ammo in the first place and then shelling out more money if they do find it. Randy and Tiffani Rogness, who own Paddock Lake Sporting Goods in Salem, had empty ammunition shelves Friday. When a new supply is delivered, it lasts two to three hours, even with a one-box limit per customer, they said. “We search everywhere. We’ve ordered so much, and it’s just not coming in,” Tiffani Rogness said. One of the nation’s biggest ammunition manufacturers, Vista Outdoor in Anoka, Minnesota, said it’s “ramping production ahead of schedule at its Remington facility to meet unprecedented demand.” The price of almost any caliber ammunition is double what it was a year ago. Manufacturers say the pandemic created new gun buyers, along with more hunters looking for something to do outside, WISN-TV reports. More than 570,000 deer hunters from around the world are expected to try their luck in this year’s nine-day season, Department of Natural Resources officials said. Wisconsin has more than 7 million acres of land open for hunting.\n\nWyoming\n\nGillette: For the past four months, people have been protesting the presence of sexual education and LGBTQ books in the children’s and teen sections of the Campbell County Public Library. The movement, part of a national trend, is being led by the Wyoming chapter of MassResistance, a national group headquartered in Waltham, Massachusetts, that prides itself on “pro-family activism.” The local chapter was formed in July. Since then, the group has worked to get its message out to the community that the library is actively corrupting the youth with its books, the Gillette News Record reports. “It’s been hard on the library staff,” said library director Terri Lesley. “It’s been a long time, and I’m very proud of them for how well they’re doing, how well they’re holding up. It’s not easy to be in the middle of a big controversy.” MassResistance’s goal is to protect “the traditional family, school children, and the moral foundation of society.” It believes in marriage between a man and a woman and that people are not born homosexual. Library board member Charlie Anderson said he’s been called names, and Lesley said she and some of her staff have received angry emails and letters, some from out of state. Lesley said she’s also received a lot of support, which has helped balance out the calls for her resignation.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/11/22"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/30/star-wars-wing-lands-dc-disney-delays-cruise-truman-museum-news-around-states/117326470/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: State House Speaker Mac McCutcheon said he will not seek reelection next year. McCutcheon, 68, said in a statement that he is stepping away from politics to spend time with his family and to do some traveling with his wife during retirement. “It’s been an honor and a privilege to represent the people of District 25 in the House and the citizens of the State of Alabama as speaker, but after four terms it’s time to go home,” McCutcheon said. McCutcheon, a Republican from Monrovia, is a former police officer and crisis negotiator. He was first elected to the House in 2006. He served as the chairman of the influential House Rules Committee, which decides which bills come up for debate, from 2012 to 2016. A new speaker will be selected in the organizational session in 2023.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state House reached in dramatic fashion an agreement that Gov. Mike Dunleavy said would avert a government shutdown. House Speaker Louise Stutes indicated the outcome was not assured when she called the House to order, and House Minority Leader Cathy Tilton, who had been negotiating with Stutes, said things were “absolutely, completely close” to unraveling. Involved was adoption of a statement of the House, calling for creation of a House-Senate working group to make recommendations on a “comprehensive fiscal plan” for the next special session. There also was another vote on the effective date provisions attached to the state spending package lawmakers approved earlier this month. Those provisions failed in the House at that time but squeaked by on Monday. The new fiscal year starts Thursday.\n\nArizona\n\nChandler:A new casino will open on Gila River Indian Community land south of Chandler, the tribe recently announced. This will be the tribe’s fourth casino, allowed because of Arizona Native American tribes’ newly negotiated tribal compact with the state. Before, the Gila River Indian Community was allowed three casinos, which it operates at Wild Horse Pass and Lone Butte in Chandler and Vee Quiva in Laveen. The new casino will be on community trust land south of Gilbert Road and Hunt Highway, outside Chandler’s southern border. The casino is expected to open in 11/ 2 to 2 years. Gov. Doug Ducey in April signed a historic agreement with Arizona’s tribes, marking the biggest update to gambling in the state in decades. In addition to allowing sports betting, the compact provides for casino expansions and at least four new casinos, including at least two in metro Phoenix.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith:The River Valley Regional Food Bank and Antioch for Youth and Family have partnered to fill in the gap with the Summer Picnic Basket for Kids program. The Summer Picnic Basket for Kids program was made possible through a grant from Feeding America. The program was designed to help students attending eight elementary schools with the highest levels of food insecurity in Fort Smith. Arkansas ranked fourth-highest in the nation for child food insecurity in 2020, according to Feeding America, the largest domestic hunger relief organization. A 2019 study conducted by the Urban Institute found that 1 in 4 children was food-insecure in Sebastian County. Food insecurity refers to the lack of access to enough food and the limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate foods for a healthy, active lifestyle, as defined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Health officials in Los Angeles County now strongly recommend that people wear masks indoors in public places – regardless of their vaccination status – to prevent the spread of the highly transmissible delta variant of the coronavirus. The move came two weeks after Gov. Gavin Newsom reopened California and lifted the statewide mask mandate. The LA County recommendation – which is not a mandate – in the nation’s most populous county does not match what the state government and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, which is that vaccinated people in certain public indoor settings do not need to be masked. Unvaccinated people are supposed to wear masks in public. The World Health Organization, however, is urging vaccinated people to wear masks as cases of the delta variant spike worldwide, which was first identified in India. Hong Kong said it will ban all passenger flights from the U.K. starting Thursday. More than 95% of COVID-19 cases in the U.K. are of the delta variant.\n\nColorado\n\nGlenwood Springs: A portion of Interstate 70 in western Colorado was closed Monday following a series of mudslides triggered by rainfall over the weekend near where a wildfire burned last year. Although eastbound lanes of I-70 through Glenwood Canyon were expected to open later in the day because of cleanup work overnight, there is no estimate for when westbound lanes of the highway will reopen, the Colorado Department of Transportation said. The largest of the mudslides that happened on Sunday along Colorado’s main east-west highway flowed down the same drainage as the one that happened Saturday along the Grizzly Creek Fire burn scar, the Glenwood Post Independent reported. The fire, which started in August, burned about 51 square miles. Sunday’s main mudslide reached 80 feet wide and 5 feet deep in areas. Travelers might have to expect on-and-off closures of I-70 in Glenwood Canyon when rainfall is expected in the area this summer, said Kane Schneider, a CDOT transportation maintenance employee.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont’s office said rebates under the state’s Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Automobile Purchase Rebate program will increase to between $750 and $7,500, depending on the type of vehicle purchased. That’s up from between $500 and $5,000. The state is also extending the program to the purchase of used electric vehicles. Connecticut has about 7,000 electric vehicles on its roads, the administration said. The administration estimated that state consumers need to be driving 125,000 to 150,000 electric vehicles by 2025 and 500,000 by 2030 to meet the state’s statutorily mandated greenhouse gas reduction target. The move comes the same day the administration announced it has been awarded a $7.4 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration for the purchase of 10 battery electric buses and 10 DC fast chargers. The buses are earmarked for CTtransit’s Waterbury division and will help make that city’s bus depot the first bus facility in the state capable of running a 100% battery electric bus transit fleet, the governor’s office said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington:City officials are reminding area residents that city pools are open and free electric fans are available for eligible older adults as dangerous hot temperatures and high humidity are expected to linger through at least Wednesday. The National Weather Service has issued an excessive heat warning for New Castle County through 8 p.m. Wednesday. The temperature Monday afternoon at New Castle County Airport was 90 degrees and was expected to climb to a high of 92 degrees. Wilmington Parks Director Ian Smith said most city pools and spray parks are now open with COVID-19 health protocols in place. The city operates five indoor and outdoor pools, but the Foster Brown Pool is closed for repairs and the P.S. du Pont Middle School indoor pool does not open until July. The three operating pools, William \"Hicks\" Anderson Community Center Pool, Eden Park Pool and Joseph R. Biden Jr. Aquatic Center (formerly Prices Pool), are staffed by Red Cross-certified lifeguards and have changing facilities and showers. There is no cost to use the pools during public swim hours. The city also operates six water spray parks daily from 9 a.m. until 6 p.m. City residents who want a free fan must bring a photo ID showing proof of age and address to the lobby of the Louis L. Redding City/County Building, 800 N. French St., Monday through Friday between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., or call the City Customer Service Center by dialing 311.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Starting in 2022, the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum will display an X-Wing Starfighter model from the latest \"Star Wars\" trilogy, WUSA-TV reported. The X-wing will sit at the entrance of the museum's Albert Einstein Planetarium, located on the National Mall. The detailed replica with a 37-foot wingspan is housed at the museum's reservation hanger in Fairfax County for restorations, where it is also on public display. \"Star Wars introduced generations of fans here on Earth to outer space as a setting for adventure and exploration,” said Margaret Weitekamp, chair of space history at the museum. “All air-and-space milestones begin with inspiration, and science fiction so often provides that spark. The iconic X-wing displayed amid our other spacecraft celebrates the journey from imagination to achievement.” The Smithsonian did not provide a specific date in 2022 for when the X-Wing would be moved to its main site. Lucasfilm -- the producing studio of the \"Star Wars\" series -- has indefinitely lent the model to the Smithsonian Institute. The museum previously curated a 1997 \"Star Wars: The Magic of Myth\" exhibit that displayed props and costumes from the original trilogy. The museum remains closed because of COVID-19 restrictions, though it is set to reopen July 31.\n\nFlorida\n\nCape Canaveral: Disney Cruise Line is postponing its first test cruise since the pandemic brought the cruise industry to a standstill after a handful of participants had inconsistent test results for the coronavirus, the company said. The Disney Dream had been scheduled to set sail Tuesday from Port Canaveral, Florida, with 300 employees who had volunteered for the “simulation” cruise. But the trip was postponed until next month, pending approvals, because a small number of employees had inconsistent results for the coronavirus, “which is considered positive by the CDC,” Disney said in a statement. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had approved the cruise line’s request to conduct a two-night test cruise. The federal government is starting to allow cruises to sail again, but only if nearly all passengers and crew are vaccinated against the virus. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill banning business from requiring proof of vaccination, so cruise lines must prove the effectiveness of their COVID-19 safety protocols on test cruises. Last weekend, Celebrity Edge departed Fort Lauderdale, Florida, becoming the first cruise ship to leave a U.S. port in 15 months.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSocial Circle: A federal grant has been awarded to sample, grow and save 14 rare plant species in Georgia. The $780,000 grant will support work by a partnership led by the state Department of Natural Resources, the agency said in a news release. It will also increase the capacity to preserve plants at the State Botanical Garden of Georgia, Atlanta Botanical Garden and the Chattahoochee Nature Center and to spread expertise and support to others in the Georgia Plant Conservation Alliance. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Recovery Challenge grant was awarded for a five-year project to protect the 14 plants, which are all listed as endangered or threatened by federal authorities, and to all members to the alliance to help do that work. Safeguarding the plants includes protecting species’ genetic stock, growing the plants in a nursery and planting them in the wild, the release says. Protecting and restoring habitats is also crucial to saving at-risk plants.\n\nHawaii\n\nLihue: Officials want to study parking lots at crowded beach parks on the Hawaiian island of Kauai and explore the possibility of imposing fees on tourists’ vehicles. Kauai has allocated $30,000 of the county’s federal coronavirus relief money to study parking at Poipu, Lydgate and Hanalei’s Black Pot beach parks, The Garden Island reported Monday. The measure that directs the Department of Parks and Recreation to conduct the study was in the works before the COVID-19 pandemic, when Kauai was feeling the strain of too many tourists, Councilmember Luke Evslin said. When officials imposed travel restrictions to try to protect Hawaii against the spread of the virus, there were days when fewer than 100 people entered Kauai County. Now that restrictions are easing, more than 32,000 people traveled to the state one day last week, with more than 2,500 going to Kauai, according to the Hawaii Tourism Authority. The ordinance allows the parks department to impose parking fees on visitors and directs it to conduct a study to determine those rates. The department will be facilitating the study but would need council approval to enact such a program. Violating the parking fees would come with a $100 fine for the first offense. More than two offenses would mean a fine of up to $500.\n\nIdaho\n\nRigby: The Jefferson County Sheriff’s Office said a woman drowned in eastern Idaho on Sunday after she became trapped in a log jam. The 50-year-old woman and her husband were kayaking on the Snake River near Rigby when the accident happened about 5 p.m., EastIdahoNews.com reported. The sheriff’s office said in a prepared statement that the woman’s kayak overturned in the log jam, causing her to be pinned underwater against the logs and current. It took first responders about an hour to recover the woman’s body, the sheriff’s office said. The woman and her husband are both from Jefferson County. Authorities did not release their names.\n\nIllinois\n\nNaperville: A man who said he sprayed trees in a suburban Chicago park to protect them after a dog chewed off the bark has been ticketed by authorities. Asher Thomas is accused of “altering flora” in a Naperville dog park. The ticket from the Will County Forest Preserve carries a $225 fine, the Aurora Beacon-News reported. “Just as you can’t go around doing things to other people’s property, even if intentions are good, you can’t allow your dogs to do damage or spray a foreign substance on trees,” said Forest Preserve Deputy Police Chief Dave Barrios. Thomas said he regularly takes his dog, Dixie, to Whalon Lake Dog Park and learned that another owner’s German shepherd had gnawed away the bark on more than a dozen trees. He said he used a can of tree pruning sealer to cover the wounds. “The whole purpose was to prevent trees from being lost,” said Thomas, who works for the U.S. Coast Guard. “What if I saved the trees? What if the other nine I did not spray died and the ones I treated lived?” He said a “tree is worth more than gold” in his native state, Colorado. Thomas said he will ask a judge to dismiss the ticket for “good Samaritan” reasons.\n\nIndiana\n\nNoblesville:Firefighters and police officers in Noblesville will receive coronavirus-related bonuses of $2,000 each and other city workers will get $1,000 each. “We didn’t give raises this year, and this is our way of saying thank you for working through the health crisis. … People will spend a lot of this money locally,” Mayor Chris Jensen said. The money will come from Noblesville’s share of federal aid for the COVID-19 pandemic. Hamilton County gave $3,000 to each of its workers. Jensen said police and firefighters are getting larger bonuses because they were at risk of getting COVID-19, the Indianapolis Star reported. “They were out answering calls and in close contact with people,” he said.\n\nIowa\n\nAnkeny: Police arrested an Ankeny man Saturday after he allegedly threatened to blow up a McDonald’s restaurant for neglecting to include dipping sauce with his order of chicken McNuggets. Television station WHO 13 reported that police in the Des Moines suburb arrested the 42-year-old man after he admitted to investigators that he called the Ankeny restaurant Saturday night upon realizing his order mistakenly didn’t include the dipping sauce. During the call, he threatened to blow up the restaurant and punch an employee. The man was charged with a felony of false report of an explosive or incendiary device. He was booked into the Polk County Jail on Saturday and released on a bond Sunday.\n\nKansas\n\nManhattan: The government’s latest crop snapshot Monday showed the Kansas winter wheat harvest is running slower than usual for this time of year. The National Agricultural Statistics Service reported that about 41% of the state’s wheat has been cut. That is behind the 44% at this time last year and the 48% five-year average. The report reflects crop conditions as of Sunday and comes amid recent rains that have kept many combines out of fields. The agency also reported that 83% of the wheat had matured. It rated the condition of the crop still in the ground as 12% excellent, 50% good, 25% fair and 13% as poor or very poor. Planting for two other major Kansas crops also is nearly finished with 95% of the soybeans and 94% of the sorghum now seeded. The state’s corn crop is also mostly in good shape with just 6% rated as poor or very poor.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: A startup spirits producer is reviving an old name as it plans to open a distillery at the same Kentucky site where whiskey was made starting in the late 1860s. The new E.J. Curley distillery will be located at Camp Nelson in Jessamine County. It’s at the same site as the original E.J. Curley & Co. operation. Spirits production is scheduled to begin by May 2022, along with the opening of a tasting room. Company leaders said they expect to welcome more than 100,000 visitors annually. The new distillery will offer two Kentucky mash bills that will reflect traditional bourbon whiskey, with plans to launch a first-of-its-kind Kentucky-blended international spirit, according to a news release announcing the project. The company is reviving the E.J. Curley name, which dates to the Civil War-era. After Prohibition, it was known as Kentucky River Distillery until it closed in the late 1960s, early 1970s, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles: A volunteer organization that mobilizes veterans for disaster recovery efforts has helped a southwest Louisiana woman return to her hurricane-damaged home. Team Rubicon renovated the home of Susan Stewart of Lake Charles. The American Press reported that Stewart returned to the house late last week – months after hurricanes Laura and Delta struck the area. “My house was shuffled during Laura, but rain came in during Delta and fell through the cracks,” Stewart said. She met Team Rubicon members when they were cutting trees down in the neighborhood. Volunteers initially signed her up for gutting and mold treatment but ended up completely restoring the home, including heating and air conditioning, plumbing, electrical work, flooring, roof and windows. A Team Rubicon press release said the organization was founded following the Haiti earthquake of 2010. The volunteer veterans use skills and experience gained from their time in the military to help people prepare, respond and recover from disasters.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Maine Hospital Association wants the state to mandate that all health care workers get the COVID-19 vaccination once the federal government grants full approval for the vaccines. Health care worker vaccination data showed wide variations in vaccination rates among the state’s hospitals and nursing homes. “We would prefer if there is a mandate, that we want the mandate to cover all health care providers,” said Steven Michaud, president of the Maine Hospital Association. “Job No. 1 for us, however we can get it done, is to get them vaccinated.” A blanket requirement would prevent health care workers who don’t want the shot from switching jobs to employers who do not mandate the vaccine. Such clusters of unvaccinated workers could lead to more outbreaks, Michaud said. The vaccines in use – Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson – were approved in 2020 and early 2021 by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. Studies showed the vaccines worked, and have worked safely and effectively as they’ve been given to millions of people worldwide starting in December.\n\nMaryland\n\nOcean City:The Ferris wheel at a historic amusement park on the Ocean City boardwalk has reopened following a zoning violation. Trimper’s Rides said on June 9 that it would move the ride after a surveyor contracted by the company found that the Ferris wheel overhung town property by at least 10 feet, the Salisbury Daily Times reported. When company president Antoinette Bruno confirmed that the ride would be dismantled and relocated, she said it wouldn’t operate this summer. But Trimper’s Rides said “It’s baaaaack!!” in a Facebook post on Saturday with an accompanying photo of its 149-foot-tall Ferris wheel. The Ocean City town council said at its meeting on June 7 that the company would continue to be penalized with fines if it didn’t move the ride. Bruno told the council that the ride’s placement was the result of human error. She estimated that moving the Ferris wheel and other rides could cost more than $100,000 – an expense she said the company couldn’t afford. Trimper’s Rides received multiple fines from Ocean City before the ride was removed from town property, according to the Daily Times.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The Massachusetts Department of Transportation has scheduled two virtual meetings to discuss plans to replace the Bourne and Sagamore bridges. Officials at the public information meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday will present an overview of the proposed Cape Cod Canal Area Transportation Improvement Program, which not only includes replacing the two bridges across the Cape Cod Canal, but improving the approach road networks. The purpose of the meetings is to provide the public with the opportunity to become acquainted with the proposed project and to gather feedback. The state’s policy concerning land acquisitions for the project will also be presented. The $1 billion effort to replace the bridges – both more than 80 years old – will be done in three phases, with construction not expected to start until 2025 at the earliest, state transportation officials have said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: COVID-19 vaccinations will be mandatory for employees at one of Michigan’s largest health care providers. Henry Ford Health System in southeastern Michigan said the policy starts Sept. 10 and covers employees, medical students and contractors. Nearly 70% of 33,000 staff members have been fully vaccinated, Henry Ford Health said Tuesday. “We acknowledge the magnitude of this decision and we did not make it lightly. … Safety and infection prevention are everyone’s responsibility,” said Wright Lassiter III, president and chief executive. There will be exemptions for people with medical or religious reasons. Henry Ford Health said employees already are required to get a flu shot every year and stay current with vaccinations for other diseases. The Detroit-based health system has five acute care hospitals: four in the Detroit area and one in Jackson. It has treated thousands of people with COVID-19.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: June’s dry weather has impacted Minnesota’s pastures, and might soon force cattle farmers to make tough decisions before they run out of grass. Cattle veterinarian and University of Minnesota extension educator Joe Armstrong said those decisions include possibly weaning calves early to lower the amount of energy cows need, or selling cattle early to reduce the size of the herd, the Star Tribune reported. Minnesota is abnormally dry. A majority of the state is declared to be in a moderate or severe drought, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor at the University of Nebraska. Monday’s crop report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture said roughly half of Minnesota’s pasture and range land is in very poor or poor condition. Only 14% of the state’s pastures are in good condition and none was deemed excellent for the week ending Sunday, the USDA said. “At this point, if we get rain, it may help regrowth a little bit, but we’ve lost so much that even a decent amount of rain is just not going to benefit the crop this year,” said Armstrong. Jared Luhman, who raises Red Angus with his family near Goodhue, said he has never experienced anything like this, and his father told him this is the worst it has been since the drought of 1988. Their pasture usually gets 60% of its grass growth in May and June before conditions dry out in July, Luhman said. “But we are already dry in what is usually the wet season, so we don’t know what that means for the rest of the year,” he said.\n\nMississippi\n\nGreenville: A historic northwest Mississippi building complex with 19th century roots has been purchased by a nonprofit economic development group and will reopen as a hotel this fall after closing down during the pandemic. The Delta Democrat-Times reported that the Greenville Inn and Suites building was purchased from the Mississippi Levee Board in June by Main Street Greenville, a division of Greater Greenville Development Foundation. The plan is for it to reopen as a 36-room, boutique hotel in September. The Levee Board most recently leased the building to TROP Casino, which operated it as a hotel. The hotel closed last year during the COVID-19 pandemic and TROP did not renew its lease. “The Levee Board is thrilled that the Greater Greenville Development Foundation wanted to purchase the hotel. It is a win-win for downtown Greenville, GGDF, and the Levee Board,” said Peter Nimrod, the chief engineer of the Levee Board. “They will do an excellent job in preserving a downtown landmark and will run a very successful and unique hotel for visitors to stay while visiting Greenville.” The property was originally comprised of a bank built in 1880 and the Levee Board Building built in 1883. The Levee Board acquired the bank in 1919. In 1997 the property was converted into a hotel and a third building was erected, creating a courtyard between the two original buildings.\n\nMissouri\n\nIndependence: After nearly two years of renovations complicated by COVID-19 restrictions, the Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum is ready to welcome visitors back with an updated focus on how Truman’s legacy resonates today.The museum opens to the public Friday, with hours and visitor numbers initially restricted because of pandemic regulations. Visitors will find a museum reimagined during its most extensive renovation since it opened in 1957 in Truman’s hometown, an eastern suburb of Kansas City. The nearly $30 million project includes a sparkling new entrance; many more artifacts, photographs, videos and films; and exhibits that encourage visitors to touch and interact with displays. One solemn gallery showcases Truman’s first four months in office, some of the most consequential months in U.S. history. Germany surrendered, the U.S. dropped nuclear bombs on Japan to end World War II, and world leaders at the Potsdam conference determined the makeup of the postwar world.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: A federal judge said a management plan for the Flathead National Forest failed to adequately protect imperiled grizzly bears and bull trout, but he’s leaving the plan in place while officials review their policies. The ruling from U.S. District Judge Donald Molloy will allow several planned timber harvest projects on the 3,750-square-mile forest to proceed, the Missoulian reported. The development came in a 2019 lawsuit from environmental groups who alleged that allowing new road building in the forest could harm threatened species like grizzly bears. Molloy agreed that the Fish and Wildlife Service did not properly analyze how the plan for the forest could harm grizzlies and trout. But the judge said shutting down timber projects could have yielded severe economic damages to local communities, and that the new forest plan was better than a previous one from 1986.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Nebraska will formally end its coronavirus emergency this week, Gov. Pete Ricketts said, even though rural parts of the state continue to lag larger cities in vaccinations. Ricketts said he will let the state’s current virus emergency expire as scheduled on Wednesday along with its remaining social-distancing guidelines that were made mandatory earlier in the pandemic. He said he also expects all schools to be open for in-person learning this fall without imposing any mask or vaccination requirements. “We need to get back to normal,” he said at a news conference. His comments came as the number of virus-related hospitalizations dropped to 27 on Sunday after more than a month of declines. Still, Nebraska continues to show a wide disparity in vaccination rates between urban and rural areas. In Lancaster County, encompassing Lincoln, more than 52% of the population is fully vaccinated, according to the state’s coronavirus dashboard. But in the rural Panhandle, the proportion is 31%. In Sioux County, on Nebraska’s northwestern border, less than 19% of the population has been fully vaccinated.\n\nNevada\n\nCarson City: MGM Resorts International switched on a giant solar farm Monday that will power up to 90% of the company’s 13 Las Vegas properties and 36,000 hotel rooms. “As Nevada’s largest private employer and operator on the Strip, MGM Resorts is uniquely positioned to use our scale and resources to make a significant and positive difference. It’s an obligation and commitment to take incredibly seriously,” MGM Resorts President and CEO Bill Hornbuckle said. “It’s fair to say that much in Las Vegas Strip has now gone solar.” The 323,000-panel system will produce an estimated 100 megawatts, roughly enough to power 27,000 U.S. homes annually. The company said the energy will be enough to supply 90% of its daytime energy needs. MGM called the solar farm the hospitality industry’s largest renewable energy project. It said it wants to transition toward renewable energy sources to reduce carbon emissions by 45% per square foot throughout its roughly 65 million square feet by 2025. The array of solar panels sits in the desert northeast of Las Vegas and will be managed by Invenergy, which owns and operates renewable energy developments throughout the world.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is selling its FM radio station, meaning that for the first time since at least 1958, the college will not broadcast on either AM or FM frequencies. The sale of the school’s FM radio show that goes by the name 99Rock on WFRD-FM could take up to a year to complete, the Valley News reported Saturday. WFRD-FM had been operating at a loss, Dartmouth spokesperson Diana Lawrence told the newspaper, and the school decided that it was not, “fiscally prudent or sustainable to continue to operate the station.” The sale of the FM station will also mean the elimination of the station’s one remaining employee. The Federal Communications Commission first granted Dartmouth a commercial license for its AM frequency in 1958, and that station, WDCR-AM, stopped broadcasting and moved online in 2008. Students will continue to produce radio programming online after the FM station’s sale, the college has said. Proceeds from the sale will support the ongoing work of Dartmouth Broadcasting, which is the student umbrella organization that had overseen both AM and FM stations, the school has said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: New Jersey’s prison system is about to begin housing inmates based on gender identity, the result of a lawsuit filed in 2019 by a transgender woman who said she was forced to live in men’s prisons for a year and a half. The new policy goes into effect Thursday and provides greater protections for transgender, intersex and nonbinary people in state prisons, most importantly by housing them based on the gender they identify with rather than by sex assigned at birth. Inmates can provide information about their gender identity at anytime during their incarceration, under the policy. Other protections include single-cell housing while final housing determinations are being made; being able to shower separately from other inmates; the right to have input into housing decision and to appeal those decisions, and a prohibition of physical examinations to determine an inmate’s genital status. Pat-down searches or strip searches by transgender women by male officers will be prohibited. The policy will be maintained for at least one year, according to the settlement. Under terms of the settlement, the woman, identified in court papers as Sonia Doe, will receive $125,000 in damages and $45,000 for attorneys’ fees, and won’t face any sanctions in connection with an assault that occurred in prison in May 2019.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: An organization that represents thousands of racehorse owners and trainers is accusing New Mexico regulators of violating their civil rights. The New Mexico Horsemen’s Association said it is suing the New Mexico Racing Commission in U.S. District Court, saying it had no other recourse since the commission had barred the group and its members from contacting any commissioners or attending the panel’s regular public meetings. The commission took action to limit communication after the horse owners sued in December to stop the commission from using purse money to cover operating costs at the state’s five privately owned race tracks. The commission also voted earlier this year to prohibit association members from contributing 1% of their purse winnings to the association and ending the contribution of starter fees that fund medical expenses as well as fees that go toward advocacy efforts. That prompted another legal challenge by the association in state district court. The commission has not commented on any of the pending litigation.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Tenants and their advocates hope New York’s revamped rent relief program will finally help renters and landlords who have struggled to get assistance since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Paperwork requirements made it tough for tenants and landlords to get relief funds in a previous round of pandemic assistance. Last year, New York dedicated $100 million from the federal CARES Act to rental relief and received 94,000 applications. But it ended up rejecting most applicants. It has dispersed $47 million to date to 18,000 applicants, far fewer than officials had hoped to reach. Now, it has a new $2 billion fund, passed in April, but people can only submit online applications and the website has been crashing in recent days and weeks. Ernesto Tohom, an undocumented immigrant from Guatemala studying business at Baruch College who lost his job in a deli last year, said the state denied his application for rental relief last year because he could not provide documentation that he had lost his job, which was off-the-books. This year, he’s trying again because of expanded eligibility criteria – which does not consider immigration status – but has not been able to submit the required documents because that part of the website has malfunctioned each time he’s tried to load it. In New York City alone, renters owe at least $1 billion in back rent, according to a survey of rent-regulated apartments by Community Housing Improvement Program, a landlord trade group.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Textile executives joined advocates for the environment and the poor to urge state legislators to reject a major energy bill pushed by state House Republicans. The coalition held a news conference to criticize the wide-ranging proposal, which would order an early retirement of several coal-fired plants operated by Duke Energy subsidiaries. The bill, which got a committee hearing earlier this month, also would expand solar production and allow the electric utility to seek multiyear rate increases from the North Carolina Utilities Commission. Textile companies are worried about the financial expense the likely rate increases would have upon Duke Energy customers like themselves. They warned the burden would be so great it would discourage efforts to expand in the state. North Carolina is home to 30,000 textile industry positions, which in turn support 90,000 additional related jobs, Dan Nation with Gastonia-based yarn maker Parkdale Mills said. Significantly higher electricity costs would push industry investments out of North Carolina and into other states, Nation said.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nGrand Forks: Col. Timothy Curry is the new commander at Grand Forks Air Force Baser, replacing Col. Cameron Pringle during a change of command ceremony Monday for the 319th Reconnaissance Wing. Pringle was named commander in June 2019, the same month Curry took over as vice commander. Curry has been in charge of organizing, training, and equipping the base’s RQ-4 Global Hawk unmanned aircraft fleet. He has been recognized with numerous awards, including the Meritorious Service Medal. Curry graduated from the United State Air Force Academy in 1999, He has earned three master’s degrees, in strategic intelligence, military strategy and pastoral counseling,\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine signed legislation directing about $2.2 billion in federal COVID-19 relief to children’s behavioral health care, water and sewer infrastructure projects, local government budgets and paying off the state’s unemployment insurance loan. “There are bill signings you’re OK with, then there are bill signings that you’re very happy with,” the Republican said at a Statehouse signing ceremony. “This is one I’m very happy about.” The bill allocates all but $500 million of Ohio’s first payout from the American Rescue Plan Act, with decisions yet to be made on how the rest will be spent, DeWine said. It includes $84 million for pediatric behavioral health initiative, $250 million for water and sewer infrastructure, $422 million for more than 2,000 local governments and roughly $1.5 billion to repay a federal loan that shored up the Unemployment Insurance Trust Fund.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Oklahoma National Guard troops who have been assisting with the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic will begin ending their assignment beginning Thursday, health officials said. Over a 15-month deployment, Guard troops helped sanitize long-term-care facilities that were particularly hard hit during the first several months of the pandemic. Troops also helped distribute personal protective gear and transport testing specimens and supplies across the state. Meanwhile, data from Johns Hopkins University showed Oklahoma’s seven-day rolling average of daily deaths and daily new cases have increased over the last two weeks. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Oklahoma increased from 120.29 new cases per day on June 12 to 196.43 new cases per day on June 26. The rolling average of daily deaths also increased during the same time period from 1.29 deaths per day to 4.29 deaths per day. Oklahoma ranks 40th in the nation with just 37.9% of its population fully vaccinated, compared to a national average of 45.8%, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Oregon hospitals over the weekend saw a sharp increase in the number of people experiencing heat-related illnesses, according to the Oregon Health Authority. Agency spokesperson Delia Hernández said 128 people visited Oregon hospitals for heat-related illnesses on Sunday, The Oregonian/OregonLive reported. That compared with 24 heat-related hospital visits Friday and 56 such visits Saturday. The heat has broken state records, with Portland reaching 112 degrees on Sunday. That record was broken again Monday when temperatures reached 113 degrees. Hernández said the state health authority couldn’t immediately confirm whether anyone had died from the recent heat-related illnesses, or the severity of any of those illnesses. Richard Leman, a public health expert with the Oregon Health Authority, among other things urged people to use fans or air conditioning, avoid hot food and heavy meals and to close windows and shades during the afternoon, the hottest part of the day.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nGoldsboro:Authorities said dozens of freight train cars derailed in Pennsylvania, but no injuries or hazardous spills were reported. Chief Steve Lutz of the Newberry Township police force said 33 of the 133 cars on the eastbound Norfolk Southern train derailed and overturned shortly after 3 p.m. Monday in northern York County near Goldsboro. Lutz said all of the cars were intact except for one car that contained pellets of polyvinyl chloride, or PVC. One of the overturned tanks carried crude oil, but none of it leaked, he said. The York County emergency management office said no injuries, evacuations or environmental hazards occurred. Lutz said there was no concern about anything leaking into the Susquehanna River or drinking water. The cause of the derailment wasn’t immediately known. Norfolk Southern spokesperson Jeff DeGraff said the company is investigating and will complete a report for submission to the Federal Railroad Administration.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state and the city have committed a combined $600,000 to revive the WaterFire Providence arts installation this year. Gov. Dan McKee and Commerce Secretary Stefan Pryor said $150,000 would be provided through a state discretionary fund, with another $150,000 provided from the Commerce Department’s budget if approved by the board, WPRI-TV reported. Also, the Providence City Council reversed course and pledged to provide $300,000 in federal relief funding for WaterFire, which was canceled last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. The future of the event founded in 1994 was in jeopardy. Peter Mello, managing director of WaterFire, told city councilors last week that the organization had gone into debt during the pandemic after losing private sponsorships. Employees were furloughed, but the organization wants to bring them back this summer to reinstall infrastructure. WaterFire brings hundreds of thousands of visitors to the city to see the arts festival backlit by burning braziers on the city’s rivers.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: State officials gave initial approval Tuesday to a $6 million settlement to resolve dozens of prisoner lawsuits against the Department of Corrections following a riot that killed seven inmates. With one abstention because of a conflict of interest, the State Fiscal Accountability Authority voted unanimously to approve the deal, which it said would work toward resolving a total of 81 lawsuits filed by or for inmates in state and federal courts against the prison system. The 2018 riot raged for more than seven hours at Lee Correctional Institution in Bishopville, about 40 miles east of Columbia. Most of the slain were stabbed or slashed; others appeared to have been beaten. One inmate described bodies “literally stacked on top of each other, like some macabre woodpile.” Corrections officials have blamed the violence – the worst U.S. prison riot in 25 years – in part on illegal cellphones, which Department Director Bryan Stirling has said represent the greatest security threat inside prisons because they give inmates an unmonitored way to communicate with the outside world and each other. Stirling told the Associated Press after the vote that the deal next goes to the plaintiffs for signatures, before a court decides how to divvy up the money.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said she will join a growing list of Republican governors sending law enforcement officers to the U.S. border with Mexico. Noem’s announcement that she will send up to 50 South Dakota National Guard troops to Texas comes as the GOP ramps up a political fight with President Joe Biden over border security. The issue has drawn a host of prominent GOP figures: former President Donald Trump was expected to travel to the border this week and Republican governors from Florida, Nebraska and Iowa have committed to sending law enforcement officers for border security. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott this month announced plans to build more barriers along the border.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Tennessee plans to suspend construction-related lane closures on interstates and state routes during the Fourth of July holiday weekend to reduce traffic delays, transportation officials said. Suspension of lane closures in construction areas will start Friday morning and end on the morning of July 6, Tennessee’s Department of Transportation said. “It is estimated that 939,000 motorists will travel Tennessee’s interstates and state routes this July 4 holiday,” Tennessee Transportation Commissioner Clay Bright said. “To help motorists reach their destinations safely and without unnecessary delays, we are suspending lane closures during this holiday travel time.” Drivers will still face some long-term lane closures on construction projects, the department said. Workers might be on the site of construction zones, and reduced speed limits in work zones will still be in effect, the department said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin:As coronavirus hospitalizations and cases continue to decrease in Austin and Travis County, Dr. Desmar Walkes, the area's top health chief, said she's growing increasingly concerned about one variant of the disease and the threat it poses for unvaccinated residents. Walkes, who began her role as Austin-Travis County health authority earlier this month, said Austin and Travis County health leaders are closely monitoring the highly contagious Delta coronavirus variant making its way across the nation. Walkes said although the strain has yet to be confirmed in Austin and Travis County, the Delta variant will put the area's unvaccinated residents most at risk. Seven cases have been confirmed in Dallas County, according to the county's website last updated on Tuesday. Although residents who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 can still be infected by the variant, they are likely to have a milder case and not experience severe illness leading to hospitalizations, Walkes said. Unvaccinated residents, even if they were previously infected with COVID-19, though, will likely be at greater risk of contracting the coronavirus if exposed to the Delta variant.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Doug Emhoff, the husband of Vice President Kamala Harris, is planning to visit Bryce Canyon National Park in southern Utah this week as part of a tour through southwestern states, the White House announced Monday. Emhoff will be visiting the park on Friday as part of a Biden administration tour to celebrate the country’s progress against COVID-19. Emhoff’s visit comes as many U.S. states continue to experience lagging vaccination rates. No additional details about his visit were immediately available. First lady Jill Biden also announced Monday that she and Emhoff will tour a vaccination site in Houston on Tuesday and another vaccine clinic at a middle school in Phoenix on Wednesday. Biden’s office said the trips are intended to highlight the ease of getting vaccinated and mobilize outreach efforts. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland visited southern Utah in early April as she prepared to submit recommendations on whether to reverse President Donald Trump’s decision to downsize the Bears Ears National Monument and Grand Staircase-Escalante.\n\nVermont\n\nRutland: The long-awaited extension of the Amtrak line from Rutland to Burlington might be delayed until later in 2022 because of issues in the supply chain. Vermont Rail Action Network Executive Director Christopher Parker told the Rutland Herald on Monday that work is under way at the station in Rutland and the yard and station in Burlington, but some parts are proving difficult to get. “It turns out the switches are on back order,” Parker said. “I don’t know how serious that is.” That could delay the opening of the line from early 2022 to sometime later in 2022, Parker said. The Ethan Allen Express train is being extended north from Rutland to Burlington with stops in Middlebury and Vergennes. The Vermont Rail Advisory Council recently discussed the schedule for the line, Parker said. Southbound trains would leave Burlington at 10:15 a.m. and then depart from Rutland at 12:25 p.m., arriving at New York’s Penn Station at 5:50 p.m. The northbound trips leave from New York City at 2:21 p.m., reaching Rutland at 7:46 p.m. and Burlington at 9:55 p.m. Amtrak service to Vermont was suspended last year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Service from Washington and New York City will resume on July 19.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Virginia is expanding its Medicaid program to provide a comprehensive dental benefit to poor adults, meaning more than 750,000 Virginians will be eligible for the benefit starting Thursday. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported that it is part of a two-year state budget that includes $35 million in state and federal funds to provide a wide range of dental care to adults for the first time. Currently, Medicaid will pay only for emergency tooth extraction for adults. The benefit expansion includes checkups three times a year to prevent oral disease that can lead to bigger medical problems. The safety-net program serves more than 1.8 million Virginians, including 558,000 people who receive health care coverage because of expanded eligibility. The change will likely mean a significant jump in demand for dentists and about 1,500 dentists have committed to serving adults under the Medicaid benefit. Virginia Dental Association Executive Director Ryan Dunn said more dentists will be needed. Currently, about 2,000 dentists provide dental services through Medicaid, but to get more to participate in the program, Dunn said the state must raise reimbursement rates.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Most of the COVID-19 restrictions that have been in place and modified several times since March 2020 will be lifted Wednesday, meaning restaurants and bars and other businesses can resume full indoor occupancy levels and physical distancing requirements will be lifted. Since May, all of the state’s 39 counties have been in the third phase of a four-stage reopening plan, with indoor capacity limited at 50%. Now, businesses across the state can resume normal operations. Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee had set the June 30 date for reopening, and the state fell short of an option that would have allowed earlier opening if 70% of residents age 16 and older had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Even with the creation of lottery incentives with prizes up to $ million, the statewide vaccination rate for those 16 and up is just over 68%. Residents age 12-15 have been eligible for vaccinations since last month, and more than 37% of that group have initiated vaccination, and about 28% are fully vaccinated.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Federal regulators are proposing a $12,288 fine in response to an explosion and fire at a West Virginia chemical plant that killed a worker and injured three other people. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration proposed that Optima Belle LLC pay the penalty in a citation issued this month, saying the plant in Kanawha County violated federal code that requires employers to provide a workplace “free from recognized hazards that were causing or likely to cause death or serious physical harm to employees,” the Charleston Gazette-Mail reported. The agency found that the company left employees exposed to hazards while they conducted a chemical drying process on a solid chlorinated product, according to regulators. John Gillenwater, 42, of Hurricanewas killed in the Dec. 8 explosion. Optima Belle can abate the violation by developing policies and training to prevent similar occurrences in the future, regulators said. The company could also contest and litigate the case, OSHA spokeswoman Lenore Uddyback-Fortson said. If the company accepts the citation as issued, the fine would become a final order, she said. Optima Belle has scheduled an informal conference to discuss the citation, she said.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A former drug smuggler can practice law in Wisconsin, the state Supreme Court ruled Tuesday. The 4-3 ruling reverses a decision from the Wisconsin Board of Bar Examiners to block Abby Padlock from becoming an attorney in the state. According to court documents, Padlock became a drug smuggler to earn money so she could become an international language instructor. Police stopped her and a friend as they were driving through Minnesota in 2015 and discovered 114 pounds of marijuana in their vehicle that they were moving from Oregon to Wisconsin. Police also discovered $30,000 in her house that she had been paid for the job. Padlock was charged with two felony drug counts. The charges were reduced to one count of misdemeanor marijuana possession. She was sentenced to three days in jail, placed on probation for two years and ordered to pay a $30,000 forfeiture. She applied to the University of Wisconsin Law School while she was still on probation, but noted on her application that the charges had been dismissed. Applicants also are required to supply a host of details about any criminal violations. Padlock failed to provide any details about her arrest. She did not divulge the amount of marijuana she was carrying, the initial charges she faced, that she spent three days in jail or that she was ordered to pay a $30,000 forfeiture. She was admitted to the law school and began her studies. Officials there didn’t learn of her criminal history until she joined a program that required a background check. The law school chose not to discipline her and allowed her to finish school. She applied for admission to the state bar in 2019. This time, she did include details of her crime on her application.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The U.S. Supreme Court decided Monday that it won’t allow Wyoming and Montana to sue Washington state for denying a key permit to build a coal export dock that would have sent coal to Asia. Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito voted in the minority in the ruling against letting the states sue the third in a case that would have gone directly before the high court. The two major coal mining states have sought to boost exports to prop up an industry in decline for a decade as U.S. utilities switch to gas-fired power and renewable energy. The Washington state Department of Ecology in 2017 denied a permit for the export dock, saying the facility on the Columbia River would cause “irreparable and unavoidable” environmental harm. Denying the permit violated the U.S. Constitution’s prohibition against trade protectionism between states, the coal states argued in 2020. Washington state officials were not trying to block Wyoming and Montana coal but acted because of “valid environmental concerns” about the dock, attorneys for the state argued in a court filing later that year In any event, the developer of the Millennium Bulk Terminal project went bankrupt and the project wouldn’t proceed, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar argued in May. Wyoming this year set aside $1 million to help Gov. Mark Gordon’s office pursue the lawsuit and potentially file others against states with policies leading to the early shutdown of Wyoming coal-fired power plants.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/08/30/two-headed-turtle-quake-off-oregon-hungry-sharks-and-gators-news-from-around-our-50-states/40046419/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nFairhope: Gov. Kay Ivey said Wednesday that a proposed Mobile Bay toll bridge is “dead” after Baldwin County officials took a decisive stand against the controversial proposal to build one of the nation’s largest bridges. The Eastern Shore Metropolitan Planning Organization voted 8-1 on Wednesday night to remove the bridge from the area’s transportation plan. The project must be in the plan detailing the region’s transportation priorities to qualify for federal funding. The planning group’s decision came after a four-hour meeting in which some residents in Baldwin County expressed outrage over the tolls that could cost up to $6 each way. They described how the cost would make it a struggle to travel to jobs or care for aging relatives on the opposite side of the bay. The crowd applauded after the vote, according to video streamed by news outlets. The proposed Interstate 10 bridge across the Mobile River and Mobile Bay would have spanned about 10 miles and soared hundreds of feet above the water near downtown. State officials had said the tolls were needed to finance the proposed $2.1 billion bridge.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A state regulatory agency has proposed changes that would limit activities at city breweries and distilleries. The Juneau Empire reported Tuesday that the Alaska Alcoholic Beverage Control Board has proposed changes to a state statute that would further prohibit onsite activities at alcohol manufacturing businesses. Officials said the regulation includes prohibiting breweries and distilleries from allowing festivals, games and competitions, classes, public parties, presentations or performances and other social gatherings advertised to the general public. Officials said a regulation draft was discussed in June 2018, and the change being considered is a revised proposal. Some owners oppose the changes saying it prohibits them from creating a new social space for the community. Officials said the plan is open to public comment through Oct. 4.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Severe weather roared back into the Phoenix area Wednesday night, bringing heavy rain to some areas, mostly on the Valley’s east side, along with wind, dust and lightning, which apparently triggered numerous tree fires. As of 9:30 p.m., the Phoenix Fire Department’s fire dispatch board showed more than 20 tree fire calls, most of them in the north or east Phoenix and Scottsdale, as storms converged into that area. In addition, at least three house fires in Phoenix were caused by lightning strikes. The National Weather Service said on Twitter that some of the storms were moving west and expected to converge over central or northern Phoenix as the night progresses. The storms began building late afternoon in areas of Gila County as they moved west through northwest Pinal County toward Maricopa County. Outflows from the storms began pushing their way into the far southeast Valley. The storms arrive amid one of the drier monsoon seasons in the Phoenix area in recent years. As of Wednesday, just .27 of an inch of rain had officially been recorded at Sky Harbor International Airport.\n\nArkansas\n\nHelena-West Helena: Authorities said a nearly seven-hour standoff at a home ended when state troopers shot and killed an armed man suspected of killing two women who were found dead in the front yard earlier that day. The State Police identified the man killed Tuesday night as 37-year-old Raymond Lewis Williams Jr. and the slain women as 40-year-old Christine Fulmer and 28-year-old Deanna Thomas Banks. Police said the women were found dead Tuesday in the front yard of Williams’ home in Helena-West Helena, about 100 miles east of Little Rock. The city’s police chief, James Patrick Smith, told Memphis, Tennessee, television station WMC that investigators believe Williams shot them before barricading himself inside. State Police said troopers tried to communicate with Williams for hours before they used tear gas in the home. They say Williams emerged from the home with a rifle and a shootout ensued, resulting in Williams’ death.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Coast Guard officials said they have seized $38.5 million worth of cocaine from suspected drug smugglers in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The crew of the Coast Guard Cutter Robert Ward and another cutter recovered more than 2,800 pounds of pure, uncut cocaine in their latest busts. The Robert Ward returned to the Port of Los Angeles on Thursday after 50 days patrolling the coast off Central and South America. Authorities believe cartels have been smuggling the narcotics and said seizing the cocaine will save lives because the drugs won’t reach the streets.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: City officials are moving forward with plans to ban the sale of flavored electronic cigarette products containing nicotine. The Daily Camera reported the City Council on Wednesday also completed plans to raise the minimum purchasing age to 21 for tobacco and nicotine products. Only tobacco-flavored vaping products will be allowed under the new rules. The city will also ask voters on the November ballot to approve a 40% sales tax on e-cigarette products. The town of Carbondale earlier this week also banned the sale of flavored e-cigarette and tobacco products. The town will require tobacco retailers to be licensed, and it will raise the minimum purchasing age to 21.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A report predicts a major increase in demand for home care for older residents and people with disabilities. The analysis was conducted by Mercer Human Services Consulting, a firm retained by the Department of Social Services to help plan for future Medicaid-funded services. It projects the growing demand for alternatives to institutional care will lead to excess capacity in nursing homes, reducing need by nearly 6,000 beds by 2040. Office of Policy and Management Secretary Melissa McCaw said Connecticut has been “moving in the right direction on long-term care for a number of years,” including various Medicaid-funded services to help people live at home. McCaw said the state must “continue to adapt” and make sure policies also address excess capacity at nursing facilities, which will still be needed.\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: Authorities found no evidence of hazardous chemicals or substances at a bank that was evacuated after five people complained of headaches and a strong chemical smell. New Castle County Emergency Management coordinator Dave Carpenter Jr. told The News Journal of Wilmington that the manager of the PNC Bank in New Castle evacuated the building early Monday after the people developed headaches. Hazmat teams from local agencies and the state Department of Natural Resources responded to the scene. Carpenter said state and local authorities said they didn’t detect any harmful substances in the bank. No one was hospitalized, and state authorities said they planned to retest the building to determine the source of the strong chemical smell. It’s unclear if they found the source.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Two D.C., agencies knew a row house that appeared to be illegally rented had “life safety violations” for months before a fire killed two tenants last week. City Administrator Rashad M. Young told reporters Tuesday a police officer complained about the home to the city and fire department in March, prompting a city inspector to visit it. He said the inspector never gained entry and contacted the home’s owner, but neither agency fully probed the officer’s complaint. Four workers from the agencies are now on leave. The U.S. attorney’s office is investigating. The officer’s complaint “strongly recommended” inspectors investigate an apparently unlicensed rooming house with possible fire code violations. Authorities have said the house contained a deadly mixture of broken smoke detectors, narrow halls and barred exits.\n\nFlorida\n\nNew Smyrna Beach: Authorities said a surfer caught air on a wave and landed on a shark that, in turn, bit him on the hand and calf. Donald Walsh told The Daytona Beach News-Journal that he had been surfing at New Smyrna Beach for several hours Tuesday when he decided to try going airborne before leaving for the day. Ocean Rescue Capt. Tamra Malphurs said that’s when Walsh landed on the 6.5-foot shark in waist-deep water and suffered cuts that weren’t considered life-threatening. Walsh, 40, said he didn’t see the shark below him as he landed in the water, but the shark’s bite brought it into focus. Walsh said he will be back in the water as soon as his wounds heal a bit.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAugusta: A kayaker said he could only think of paddling faster after realizing he wasn’t alone in a pond. Bo Storey told WRDW-TV, “I just paddled and paddled. …” on Monday to get away from a 10-foot, 360-pound alligator that got as close as 5 feet from the back of his kayak. News outlets reported Richmond County deputies received a call from Storey saying he was being chased by the behemoth. Storey was practicing for a bass fishing tournament. Deputies arrived on the scene and wrestled the massive gator with help from hunter Trey Durant and his friend Robby Amerson. The alligator was clearly not afraid of humans and was deemed a nuisance so it was legally killed by Durant.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The reopening of the USS Arizona Memorial has been scheduled for Labor Day weekend following a 15-month closure. The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Wednesday that walk-on access to the memorial will begin Sunday. A malfunction with the concrete dock’s anchoring system forced the closure of the memorial to foot traffic beginning in May 2018. Exceptionally high tides in 2017 are believed to have dislodged concrete blocks sunk into the sediment of Pearl Harbor and connected by chains to the dock. Park employees last week installed a visitor ramp for walk-on visits to the 105-foot floating dock and reinstalled the memorial’s bridge spanning 30 feet and weighing 4 tons. Officials said the repair project has cost more than $2.1 million.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Gallagher, a comedian known for smashing fruit and vegetables with giant wooden hammers, said he was escorted out of Idaho’s Statehouse when he entered the building carrying two of the hammers. Gallagher told the Idaho Statesman in a story Wednesday that he was looking for the state’s film office on Monday for a possible project. The state doesn’t have a film office. A person who answered the phone at the state agency that provides security said Wednesday that no one was available to comment. The 73-year-old comedian who rose to fame in the 1980s said he’s in Boise to scout locations for a film about an ancient poet. He also said he would like to build a retirement project in the area where old celebrities could live among regular folks.\n\nIllinois\n\nArlington Heights: The owner of Arlington International Racecourse has announced the company will not seek a license to add casino gambling at the track. Churchill Downs CEO Bill Carstanjen on Wednesday said state law requiring the track to dedicate a portion of casino earnings to racing purses makes placing casino games at the suburban Chicago track untenable. Carstanjen noted Arlington would enter the gambling market with a tax rate that would be approximately 17.5% to 20% higher than the existing Chicago-area casinos because of contributions to the thoroughbred purse account. Churchill Downs also owns a majority interest in Rivers Casino in nearby Des Plaines. Carstanjen also said horse racing at Arlington is guaranteed until 2021, after which the company might move to a track at another location in Illinois. The Illinois Thoroughbred Horsemen’s Association said the decision on casinos by Churchill Downs means the company is snubbing the men and women of thoroughbred horse racing.\n\nIndiana\n\nMadison:The Ku Klux Klan is planning a second annual “kookout” in Madison for Saturday, an event that was met last year with hundreds of protesters. The group plans to hold the event at Jaycee Park from 1-3 p.m. on Saturday on the riverfront, according to an event flier. The flyer for the event reads “Make America Safe! Make America Drug Free! Make America White! Make America Great! Take a Stand!!! Join the Klan!!!” And at the bottom of the page, “Never! Never! Apologize for Being White!” About 300 people protested last year’s event, saying the Klan’s message was divisive and not welcome in their town. Residents from surrounding towns have said they don’t want to be associated with the KKK. After World War I, Indiana was a platform for the “most powerful Ku Klux Klan,” according to the Indiana State Library’s website. Madison, named after the country’s fourth president, is about an hour’s drive northeast from Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nIowa\n\nClive:City officials now know what caused a portion of Walnut Creek to turn bright green. A water sample collected on Tuesday showed traces of cyanobacteria, which can produce the cyanotoxin microcystin, a news release said Thursday. However, the sample collected was within the allowable range for safe water recreation. The concentration of the microcystin was 2.9 ug/L. The Iowa Department of Natural Resources posts beach advisories for concentration levels greater than 20 ug/L and the Environmental Protection Agency's Health Advisory Level is 8 ug/L. Because the bloom is ongoing and there could be areas in the water where microcystin are more concentrated, the city recommends people and pets stay out of the discolored water until the algae bloom subsides.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: The Lawrence Humane Society has trapped the first feral cats under a program designed to manage the wild cat population. The Community Cat Program traps, neuters and vaccinates feral cats and returns them to the areas where they were found. As part of the program, the shelter clips the ear of a cat when it’s neutered so animal control will not pick it up again. Kirk Putman, the Humane Society’s interim director, said that the shelter trapped a total of 15 cats in two separate efforts in the last week. The organization is asking for volunteers and donations to help with the program. Previously, the city had not allowed cats to roam free. The Lawrence Journal-World reported the program went into effect May 1, despite opposition from some citizens.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: A U.S. sailor from Kentucky who died at Pearl Harbor will be buried in his hometown this fall. The Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency said 25-year-old Navy Machinist’s Mate 1st Class Ulis C. Steely of Corbin was assigned to the USS Oklahoma battleship when it was attacked by Japanese aircraft on Dec. 7, 1941. He was among 429 crewmen killed. Most of the remains were not identified at the time. Unidentified remains have been buried in Hawaii. The agency said in 2015 it exhumed unknown remains from the USS Oklahoma for analysis. Using dental and anthropological analysis, as well as DNA, Steely’s remains were identified last fall. Gov. Matt Bevin’s office said he would order flags lowered to half-staff in Steely’s honor on Oct. 5, the date of his funeral.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The police department has authorized a minor uniform change as the city prepares for an annual festival of gay culture in the French Quarter. A department news release said that some officers will be sporting “Pride Edition Badges” during Southern Decadence, which began Thursday and runs through the Labor Day weekend. The special badge is designed like the department’s traditional badge, a star framed by a crescent. But this star is rainbow-striped. The department said the badge was introduced in June to mark Pride Month when it was made available as an option for officers to purchase and wear. It can be worn again during the weekend Southern Decadence Festival. The department said it will also be an option during future Pride Month and Southern Decadence celebrations.\n\nMaine\n\nWaldoboro: Fishery regulators are postponing a round of meetings with lobstermen in the state aimed at preparing for potential new restrictions designed to protect endangered whales. Department of Marine Resources spokesman Jeff Nichols said the department hasn’t set dates yet for any new meetings. The meetings were set to start in September. A federal government team called for the removal of many vertical trap lines from the Gulf of Maine to reduce risk to North Atlantic right whales, which number about 400. The state held a series of meetings with lobstermen about the new rules earlier this year. The last took place in late June. Nicholas said the commissioner wants to do another review of right whale and lobster industry data before presenting a plan about the next steps to the industry.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: City officials have decided to use $6 million in park and public facility funds to help pay for the recovery of a ransomware attack that crippled the city for weeks. The Baltimore Sun reported the city’s spending panel voted Wednesday to use the funds for recovery and “hardening of the environment.” A May ransomware attack on city computer servers is estimated to have cost Baltimore about $18.2 million in restoration costs and delayed or lost revenue. The attack came about a year after one hit Baltimore’s 911 system. Mayor Bernard C. Young has said Baltimore might purchase insurance against hackers. The spending panel delayed a vote Wednesday on an $835,000 contract for $20 million in cyber liability coverage. Young said the two panel members need to be briefed on the proposal.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The governors of five East Coast states, including Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, are urging federal regulators not to put any additional roadblocks in the way of the country’s nascent offshore wind industry. The governors of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Maine, New Hampshire and Virginia said in a letter Tuesday to Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross that offshore wind power will help strengthen America’s energy independence while creating thousands of jobs. The group said they’re disappointed by a recent decision to delay final permitting of the planned 84-turbine Vineyard Wind project. The group urged federal overseers to give the project a green light by next March. An Interior Department spokeswoman said the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is working to develop a permitting timeline for the project.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: State regulators and Native American tribes are temporarily removing juvenile lake sturgeon from two Michigan rivers to protect them from chemical treatments targeting sea lampreys. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service treats rivers in the Great Lakes region to kill invasive lampreys. It doesn’t harm most fish. But when the treatments are applied in the Big Manistee and Muskegon rivers, lake sturgeon are at risk. Over the next two months, the Little River Band of Ottawa Indians and the Gun Lake Tribe will join the state Department of Natural Resources to catch juvenile sturgeon and keep them in rearing facilities until the treatments are completed. Afterward, they’ll be released. During the last sea lamprey treatment on the Big Manistee River three years ago, 117 lake sturgeon were collected and released.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:Clean-up after a July fire at St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Catholic School will delay the start of the school year. “The turnaround time is just not fast enough,” said Kelly Vangsness, principal at the south side parochial school. The first day of school was scheduled for Aug. 26, but in early August, the administration pushed the first day to Sept. 4, which is the first day of school for most students in the St. Cloud school district. Continued clean-up has delayed the first day – again – to Monday, Sept. 9, Vangsness said Tuesday. The school was damaged by a July 4 fire that started in a light fixture that had been updated with LED bulbs, according to St. Cloud police. No one was inside the building at the time and the fire was isolated to the vestibule area and adjoining hallway, including the ceiling above that area. Painting and carpet installation is expected to be completed by Sept. 4, Vangsness said, but the administration is waiting for the installation of the fire system and for state officials to sign off on an asbestos abatement.\n\nMississippi\n\nOxford: The University of Mississippi said it’s moving ahead with plans to transfer a Confederate soldier monument from its central location on campus to a spot near a secluded Confederate cemetery. In an email sent to students, faculty and staff, interim Chancellor Larry Sparks wrote that the university submitted plans Tuesday to take down, move and reassemble the monument. The Mississippi Department of Archives and History must review and approve the university’s plans. College Board trustees, who govern Mississippi’s eight public universities, must also approve the move. Sparks agreed in March to calls from faculty, students and staff to move the marble soldier and base from near the school’s historic heart. The monument has stood sentry there since 1906, when the United Daughters of the Confederacy commissioned it. The monument is 29 feet tall and weighs 40,000 pounds. Plans call for moving it outside a cemetery in a less prominent area of the campus that holds graves of Confederate soldiers killed in the battle of Shiloh. A new concrete walkway would be built leading to the cemetery, with the monument installed along with it.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Commuters who prefer to cross the Mississippi River on the Martin Luther King Bridge will have to wait quite a while longer for the bridge to reopen. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported that flooding this spring and summer has delayed a construction project on the bridge that closed in August of last year. It was originally expected to reopen this fall. Now, according to the Illinois Department of Transportation, the bridgework won’t be complete until next summer. IDOT spokesman Guy Tridgell said the flooding impacted train routes. He said the diverted trains were rerouted to tracks under the bridge project, preventing IDOT from being able to safely remove a section of the existing bridge. The construction work is on the Illinois side.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A fire burning in grass and shrubs northwest of Billings has led to the evacuation of about 15 residences near the community of Molt. The Billings Gazette reported the fire started Wednesday and had burned up to an estimated 15 square miles by Thursday morning. Yellowstone County Commissioner Dennis Pitman said residents were watching the fire Wednesday night when the wind changed direction, sending the flames toward homes and prompting the evacuations. No structures have been damaged and fire crews were protecting homes. The cause of the fire is still under investigation.\n\nNebraska\n\nSpencer: Drinking water is being restored in Boyd County after a disastrous flood washed out a water main in March. The Omaha World-Herald reported that workers began installing a new pipe beneath the Niobrara River on Tuesday. Boyd County Rural Water District officials said water could be provided to Spencer, Lynch, Anoka and nearby farms in about two weeks. Potable water will not be available until testing and sanitation work is complete. The district has provided no timeline. The water district has refurbished three irrigation wells to provide water temporarily for showering, washing and toilets, and it has been distributing free bottled water. Rex Black, the water district board chairman, said restoring water service will cost about $2 million. The Federal Emergency Management Agency will cover 75% of that.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A Las Vegas-area teachers’ union has struck a teacher pay deal Wednesday with the country’s fifth-largest school district that organizers said will avert a threatened strike Sept. 10. Members of the Clark County Education Association threatened to walk off the job next month over a dispute about paying teachers more for continuing education. Union leaders and the Clark County School District announced at a news conference late Wednesday that the district will fund the salary increase for continuing education, in addition to honoring a commitment for 3% raises and more money for health insurance. The deal came days after the school district filed an emergency court motion to block the strike and have a judge issue an order against it. If the order was imposed, the striking union could have faced fines of up to $50,000 a day. The deal still needs to be ratified by the union’s executives and the school district’s trustees, but both sides say they expect that will happen soon.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nNew Castle Island: Some residents are protesting a plan to recruit archers to kill as many as 20 deer on New Castle Island. News outlets are reporting that nearly 2,000 residents have signed a petition opposing the plan proposed by condo managers of Wentworth by the Sea to stop deer from eating private gardens. Residents estimated there are about 24 deer total on the island. They said they like the animals and don’t want them killed. The Portsmouth Herald reported that some residents said the plan is not a hunt but “a kill” because the archers will take aim from tree stands while the deer feed. The condo association hasn’t responded to requests for comment.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nEwing Township: The state has honored a team that competed in the Little League World Series after winning the state and Mid-Atlantic championships. Gov. Phil Murphy and State Police Superintendent Col. Patrick Callahan hosted the Elmora Troopers and their families Thursday at the State Police Museum in Ewing. Elizabeth’s Elmora Youth League team is named in honor of Trooper Thomas Hanratty, who was struck and killed during a traffic stop in 1992. Hanratty played baseball for the league and players wear a patch with his badge number. The Troopers were knocked out of the double-elimination Little League World Series tournament last week by a team from Louisiana that went on to win the championship.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nRoswell: Investigators have determined a fireworks explosion that killed a firefighter and severely injured another was accidental. Roswell firefighters were packaging fireworks on June 5 for the city’s Independence Day celebration when the explosion happened, the Roswell Daily Record reported Wednesday. The city’s fire department has organized the event in recent years. The blast led to the death of Jeff Stroble, 46, on July 21. Hoby Bonham, 36, was sent home from the hospital in late June. Ten other firefighters were treated for minor injuries. The firefighters were handling the fireworks inside a concrete building at the Roswell International Air Center. They were fusing aerial shell fireworks with electric matches when one went off, the report from the state fire marshal’s office states. Investigators from state agencies and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives assisted in the investigation. The city declined to comment.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: The second span of the new Kosciuszko Bridge between Brooklyn and Queens has opened to traffic. The span opened early Thursday. A ceremony on Wednesday night included a light show with music from Billy Joel via satellite from Madison Square Garden. The bridge features five Queens-bound traffic lanes and four Brooklyn-bound lanes, as well as a 20-foot-wide pedestrian and bicycle pathway. A 7-acre site beneath the bridge in Brooklyn will be turned into a public space and park. The first part of the new bridge was completed in April 2017. The $873 million project is the first major bridge built in New York City since the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge in 1964. The original Kosciuszko Bridge opened in 1939.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A man’s body has been exhumed from a gravesite on a court order after a funeral home discovered it mistakenly sold the same plot twice. WRAL reported Kizzie Sewell bought a plot at Montlawn Cemetery in Raleigh for her husband, Winfred Barnes, upon his death in 2014. But last year, Sewell said Montlawn informed her they realized they had sold her husband’s plot to another customer who started paying for it six months before Barnes was buried there. On Wednesday, Barnes’ body was dug up after five years in the plot. A judge ruled the man with the original contract was entitled to the site. Montlawn said in a statement to the outlet that they abided by the court order.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe filed a motion Wednesday to intervene on a proposed expansion of the Dakota Access pipeline that would double the line’s capacity. The tribe, which led original opposition to the crude oil pipeline, petitioned for status as an intervenor in the case before the Public Service Commission arguing its “interests … are not adequately represented.” North Dakota regulators have set a Nov. 13 public hearing on the proposed expansion. The public hearing, which was requested by the tribe and the Sierra Club, will be held in the south-central city of Linton, near where a pump station would go in to increase the line’s capacity.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati:Cincinnati Metro could be out of the streetcar business by New Year’s Day. On Wednesday, City Manager Patrick Duhaney released a 25-page “Cincinnati Streetcar Transition Plan” that details the timeline and who will be responsible for what during the separation. The target date is “on or around” Jan. 1, according to the plan. The separation is expected to cost around $553,000, which would come from the streetcar’s budget. As is, the Cincinnati Bell Connector has a complicated management structure. The city owns it, but Metro oversees it. Metro, in turn, contracts with a private company called Transdev to run the streetcar day-to-day. With the divorce, the city would take over complete management of the streetcar, cutting out Metro as a middleman. Transdev would carry on with day-to-day operations. The city administration is expected to present its financial plan for the separation during a city council meeting on Sept. 4.\n\nOklahoma\n\nWebber Falls: One of two runaway barges that crashed into a dam and sank on top of the other in the Arkansas River has been removed from the dam. The barges carrying a total of about 3,800 pounds of fertilizer sank May 23 after crashing into the lock and dam at Webbers Falls, about 70 miles southeast of Tulsa. They had broken free from their mooring at the Port of Muskogee during historic spring flooding that waterlogged much of the Midwest down into Arkansas. Port manager Fred Taylor said Tuesday it could take several weeks to completely remove both barges, which are to be used for scrap. The McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System runs from Tulsa to the Mississippi River and has been closed to barge traffic since the flooding began.\n\nOregon\n\nCoos Bay: A 6.3-magnitude earthquake struck Thursday off the Oregon coast but did not generate a tsunami or cause any damage or injuries, authorities said. The epicenter of the quake, which hit just after 8 a.m., was located about 150 miles from land at a depth of 7 miles in the Pacific Ocean. The quake was caused by slipping along an offshore fault called the Blanco Fracture Zone and has nothing to do with the more well-known Cascadia fault, which is believed to be overdue for a major earthquake in the Pacific Northwest, said Paul Bodin, manager of the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network at the University of Washington. The event is also unrelated to a cluster of “episodic slips” along the Cascadia tectonic plate boundary that have been releasing energy across the coastal Pacific Northwest over the past week to 10 days, he said. Those slips are not felt by humans but have been picked up by monitoring devices around the Olympic Peninsula in northwest Washington state and also stretching from Eugene to the Siskiyou Mountains along the Oregon-California border, according to the Pacific Northwest Seismic Network.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: State officials are hoping to lower the risk of lead poisoning through mandated blood testing for children and other measures. Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf is backing legislation to require testing that meets federal guidelines and is rolling out other strategies to address the problem. The administration is working on ways for regional response teams to care for children with dangerous amounts of lead in their system. There are also proposals to train more people in remediating lead and to provide more resources online about lead poisoning, testing and remediation. Officials said about 3 in 10 children in the state have been tested for lead exposure, and just under 5% had elevated lead levels.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Residents are facing about an 8% hike in their electricity bills beginning in October after state regulators approved a rate increase. WPRI-TV reported that the cost increase affects National Grid’s residential electricity customers, who on average will pay about $9 more per month for at least the next six months. The Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission, which decides whether to approve or deny rate changes, also approved rate increases for commercial and industrial customers on Wednesday. The higher costs are typical during the winter months when generating electricity becomes more expensive. The commission’s decision was made without objection or controversy.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nHilton Head Island: A group that monitors sea turtles has reported finding a two-headed loggerhead hatchling. News outlets reported Sea Turtle Patrol Hilton Head Island said the hatchling was found alive Tuesday and released into the ocean. The group’s leader, marine biologist Amber Kuehn, said a genetic mutation caused the second head on the turtle, since named Squirt and Crush. The group shared a picture of the turtle on Facebook on Wednesday that showed the creature’s small body partially eclipsed by a gloved hand. The post wished the turtle good luck. Kuehn said Crush and Squirt couldn’t really swim, as the heads controlled separate flippers and weren’t working together.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem and Oglala Lakota County school officials plan to partner on building the first local public high school on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Noem said Thursday that building a career and technical education high school in Oglala Lakota County “will bolster the area’s workforce” and “empower students with real-life skills and career opportunities.” The school district serves 22 communities and operates from virtual locations that can serve 50 to 250 students at a time. The only other high schools on the reservation are private or federal Bureau of Indian Education schools. District superintendent Anthony Fairbanks said building a physical high school will “create a launchpad for our students’ career development.” The school is scheduled to open in August 2020 and enroll about 400 students.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Former Gov. Bill Haslam isn’t ruling out a future run for office, though he said he isn’t planning on it. During an event alongside former GOP Sen. Bob Corker, Haslam said he would be sad if he never serves in some kind of public role again. Haslam told reporters it was a hard decision, but the right one, not to run to replace retiring Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander in 2020. President Donald Trump tweeted last month that former Ambassador to Japan Bill Hagerty would launch a Senate bid and endorsed him. Haslam said he’s “really excited” about the presumed Republican run by Hagerty, Haslam’s ex-economic development commissioner. Corker said he wants to let the race evolve, saying he’s friends with Hagerty and trauma surgeon Manny Sethi, another Republican who has launched a campaign.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A nonprofit that advocates for children said the rate of student suspensions has fallen by nearly a third since the state implemented a law barring suspensions except in extreme circumstances. The 2017 Texas law permits suspensions for major violations such as assault or bringing a weapon or drugs to school. The Dallas Morning News reported that Texas public schools suspended more than 101,000 students in prekindergarten to second grade during the 2015-16 school year. Texans Care for Children released a report Wednesday revealing that those figures dropped by 31% to 70,197 in the 2017-18 school year. Youngsters in foster care, black children and those in special education are more likely to be suspended.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: State officials are unveiling a gun safety program aimed at preventing accidental shootings that will be optional for schools. The program had been mandated three years ago by state lawmakers who have consistently rejected gun-control measures. Utah Attorney General Sean Reyes said Thursday at a news conference that the program avoids the politically sensitive issues of gun policy and instead acknowledges that many children are bound to come across guns in a state where an estimated 4 in 10 households have a firearm. Utah is also one of several states that allow teachers with concealed carry permit holders to carry guns in schools. The program features a 5-minute video and would be taught to children in 5th through 12th grades by law enforcement officers who already work with students. School districts will have to approve the course, and parents will have to provide written permission.\n\nVermont\n\nOrange: A farmer said most of the 250 pigs that escaped from his fenced-in area earlier this month are back. Walter Jeffries of Sugar Mountain Farm in Orange said Thursday the fence has been fixed. Jeffries said roughly 50 adults and 200 piglets escaped after fencing was damaged by vandals. He said 99% of the pigs have been wrangled. He and workers placed a trail of hamburger and hot dog buns to lure the stragglers. Agriculture Secretary Anson Tebbetts said his agency provided Jeffries guidance on how to remedy the problem.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A power company is launching an initiative to provide electric school buses to school districts in Virginia. Dominion Energy said in a statement Thursday that electric buses will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and save school districts money. Dominion said the initial phase of the program aims to put 50 electric buses in its Virginia service territory by the end of 2020. The company hopes to expand the program with state approval to bring 1,000 electric school buses online by 2025. Dominion said it hopes to replace all diesel buses. It said replacing one is like taking 5.2 cars off the road. The company said bus manufacturers will be able to submit bids to build the buses. School districts will be able express interest in participating in the program.\n\nWashington\n\nYakima: A radio station has returned on air nearly a year after burglars robbed the station of essential production equipment. The Yakima Herald-Republic reported that KYNR 1490-AM station on the Yakama Indian Reservation hosted its first shows Thursday using a makeshift system. Authorities said burglars took the station’s control board, microphones, printers and the emergency alert system in October. Station hosts said they are still waiting for a replacement control board after the first new one had programming issues. Hosts said a mixing board that relies on analog radio transmission allowed the station to get back on the air for now, but with fewer channels. Authorities said the Federal Communications Commission wanted to know whether the theft was an attempt to impede the station’s ability to inform the public.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHuntington: Marshall University will work with the investigative division of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to fight the opioid crisis. The Herald-Dispatch reported Sen. Shelley Moore Capito announced Wednesday the partnership between Marshall University and Homeland Security Investigations. Capito said the school will receive more than $4 million to develop a tool to disrupt and dismantle criminal activity related to opioids. John Sammons, director of Marshall University’s digital forensics and information assurance program, said students, faculty and staff are looking forward to the project because they’ve seen the impact of the epidemic in their community. Sammons said the partnership will focus on transnational criminal activity, including cybercrimes.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State officials said the gray wolf population might have stabilized after nearing extinction decades ago. The state Department of Natural Resources said it counted from 914 to 978 wolves in the year to April 2019. The agency said that is a 1% increase from the last count. Wisconsin Public Radio reported that state data shows there were just 25 wolves in Wisconsin 1980. A federal judge placed the gray wolf on the endangered species list in 2014. The federal government this year launched an effort to delist it. Adrian Treves, a professor of environmental studies at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said Wisconsin hasn’t been transparent with its count and that the federal government shouldn’t rely on the state’s numbers. The DNR stands by the count.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A U.S. bankruptcy court has ruled that a coal company can sell two large Wyoming mines separately from one in West Virginia. Contura Energy originally sought to buy all three mines from Blackjewel in a deal held up while U.S. officials seek payment of federal royalties. Contura would have paid $9.7 million for the Belle Ayr and Eagle Butte mines in Wyoming and Pax Surface Mine in West Virginia. The Casper Star-Tribune reported that the court in West Virginia on Wednesday approved a deal in which Contura would pay $1.1 million to complete the sale of the West Virginia mine. The Wyoming mines have been shut down since Blackjewel declared bankruptcy July 1. Federal records show no production at the West Virginia mine since 2006.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2020/11/30/military-thanksgiving-kauai-quarantine-holiday-cheer-curtailed-news-around-states/6461435002/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:Preliminary reports indicated that more than 5,000 Alabama public school students haven’t shown up for any sort of classes, virtual or in-person, state Education Superintendent Eric Mackey said. The students are likely to have a hard time catching up and the enrollment drop could mean the loss of hundreds of teachers, he said. “It’s a very difficult year instructionally and that doesn’t even touch the surface on the issues we will have with these 5,000 students who are not in school and we don’t know where they are,” he said. Because the state funding formula is based on enrollment, losing the students could hit next year’s budget hard. Mackey told The Montgomery Advertiser he’s hoping the Legislature will make a temporary change to avoid that, perhaps basing allocations on average enrollment for the past couple of years. Mackey said some of the missing students might have enrolled in private schools. Others have returned, but too late for the official enrollment count, which ends each year 20 days after Labor Day.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: A lab in Alaska failed to report over 1,600 positive coronavirus tests to the state health department in the past month, according to a state official. Dr. Louisa Castrodale, an epidemiologist with the state, said Friday that Beechtree Labs did not report 1,636 positive test results out of 13,169 conducted, most of which were done in the last two weeks. Beechtree is a new commercial lab based out of Anchorage. The announcement is a sign that climbing daily case counts reported by the state reflect only a part of total cases, the Anchorage Daily News reported. Castrodale said that understaffing at clinics, labs and the state’s Department of Health and Social Services have also caused backlogs that have affected the entire coronavirus data system. The results not reported to the state include 357 positive cases in Anchorage and 880 positive cases in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:Dr. Jill Jim, executive director of the Navajo Department of Health, has been selected as a member of President-elect Joe Biden’s COVID-19 Advisory Board, according to the Biden transition team. For the past 18 years, Jim has served in nonprofit, state and federal agencies, the Biden team said in a news release. Jim became a Cabinet member in the Navajo Nation in 2019. According to the news release, Jim has dedicated her career to “preventing chronic diseases and addressing health care and health disparities among American Indians/Alaska Natives.” The Navajo Nation closed between March and August while recording the highest COVID-19 per capita infection rate in the country. In May, the Navajo Nation surpassed New York based on the number of cases per 100,000 residents. The nation ordered a new three-week lockdown earlier in November as cases rose again. In a statement posted on Facebook on Saturday night, Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said he recommended that Jim be appointed to the board and is “very proud” of her accomplishment.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The number of people hospitalized in Arkansas with COVID-19 climbed again Friday. The state reported 1,011 people were hospitalized with the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, an increase of eight from Thursday. Arkansas health officials reported 1,052 newly confirmed and probable cases but no additional deaths Friday. The state has had 153,677 total cases and 2,436 deaths, according to the Arkansas Department of Health. The actual number of coronavirus cases is believed to be far higher because many people haven’t been tested and some who get the disease don’t show symptoms. More than 13% of coronavirus tests in Arkansas came back positive over the last seven days, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: More counties in California announced new COVID-19 restrictions Saturday to prevent rising caseloads from spiraling into a hospital crisis. San Francisco is joining a statewide curfew and Silicon Valley is banning all high school, collegiate and professional sports and imposing a quarantine for those traveling into the region from more than 150 miles away. Santa Clara County has the highest case rate in the Bay Area, leading to the stricter rules, said Santa Clara County Health Officer Dr. Sara Cody. The changes in Santa Clara County are less strict than a statewide lockdown issued in March by Gov. Gavin Newsom but still ratchets up measures that aim to slow the expanding number of people who have become infected with COVID-19 and those ending up in hospitals. It stops short of a full business shutdown that could cripple the holiday sale season by reducing the number of people allowed in stores to 10% capacity. The order, which takes effect Monday and will last until at least Dec. 21, exempts church services and protests, which county health officials said are constitutionally protected.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins:An act of vandalism that led neighbors to rally around and a Fort Collins resident and rebuild a COVID-19 memorial earlier this month. Sara Steen started working on the memorial a few months ago. It features circles roughly the size of small dinner plates, each with a different color scheme and, at their center, a small stick-figure person. There are 63 total, with each representing 63 people in Larimer County who had died from COVID-19 as of Nov. 14 – the last time Steen updated the memorial. Steen, a sociologist, said she wanted a way to visually represent the hole the virus was leaving in our community. But on the morning of Nov. 5, Steen said she walked outside to see the memorial vandalized with each circle marred with streaks of black spray paint. “Honestly, I kind of just curled up on the sidewalk,” Steen said. “It just made me so sad someone would choose to do that.” Steen posted a new sign to the fence announcing plans to start the memorial over again. She asked any interested neighbors to craft new circle emblems as replacements, and many did just that – dropping off newly designed circles at Steen’s home. One neighbor volunteered to laminate the new circles and another spent hours cleaning the paint off of Steen’s original emblems. By Nov. 15, Steen said the memorial had been fully rebuilt, featuring 63 handmade emblems representing a COVID-19 death in Larimer County. The emblems are now a mix of Steen’s originals that had been cleaned and 36 that had been submitted to her by neighbors.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The number of Connecticut residents hospitalized with COVID-19 topped 1,000 on Friday, the first time it has been that high since mid-May. The new data also showed the number of nursing home residents who have been infected since the pandemic began has topped 10,000. The state reported 49 more people were in the hospital compared with Wednesday, bringing the total to 1,017. During the first wave, hospitalizations reached a peak of 1,972 on April 22. Gov. Ned Lamont has said the number of people in the hospital is one of the most important metrics he is watching when considering whether to impose more virus-related restrictions, with concerns about hospitals running out of space and staffing being inadequate. The Democratic governor said he would consider reimposing restrictions that were in place during the first wave in the spring “if I heard from the leading hospital executives that we’re getting close” to full capacity. Yale New Haven Health, which operates several hospitals in southern Connecticut, reported recently that only about 20% of its intensive care unit capacity was available.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Gov. John Carney said he’s canceling events after the director of the state’s emergency management agency tested positive for the coronavirus. Carney said in a statement Saturday that AJ Schall, the director of the Delaware Emergency Management Agency, tested positive for the virus on Friday. The Democratic governor said he spent time around Schall on Tuesday but was not in close contact. Still, Carney said he’s canceling his public events this week out of caution. Carney said Schall is at home with mild, cold-like symptoms.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:Officials of the Solidcore fitness center told WUSA-TV that it has closed amid a visit from DC officials, but want’s Mayor Muriel Bowser to do more for gyms and fitness centers that have to close. “DCRA did visit studios and we have temporarily closed DC studios while we continue conversations with the mayor’s office, advocating for her to reconsider the closures,” according to an email statement. The order suspending indoor group exercise and limiting outdoor groups to 25 people or less took effect on Wednesday. The CEOs of F45 Training on U Street, DC Hustle and Solidcore sent a letter to Bowser on Tuesday afternoon insisting they are not the source of community spread and their facilities should remain safe to continue operation. It is unknown if the other businesses that are a part of the letter have decided to stay open or will also temporarily close. Solidcore’s eight D.C. locations have been open since June with strict safety protocols, including social distancing, limiting classes to 10 participants, mandated masks, disinfecting everything in between uses and increased air filtration.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: South Florida Congressman-elect Carlos Gimenez has tested positive for the coronavirus, his campaign said Friday. The former Miami-Dade County mayor and his wife, Lourdes, tested positive Thursday after having mild symptoms, according to a statement. They said they’re self-isolating at home, in accordance with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines and advice from medical professionals. Gimenez served as Miami-Dade mayor from 2011 until this month. The Republican won his congressional race in the Nov. 3 general election, defeating a first-term Democrat. He is set to assume office Jan. 3. “I will continue attending New Member Orientation virtually and preparing our office to serve the people of Florida’s 26th Congressional District from Westchester to Key West until I can resume my normal schedule,” Gimenez said in a statement. “I am extremely grateful for all of the incredible health care workers who are tirelessly dedicated to their patients.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah:Revenue losses and an uncertain economy because of the pandemic continue to be at the forefront of the city’s budget planning for 2021. Although revenue from sales and hotel/motel tax collections have dropped because of COVID-19, one revenue source the city has lost altogether is the preservation fee. The fee that was charged to sightseeing tour companies was ruled as a tax on free speech by a federal judge in a lawsuit against the city. The suit filed by Old Town Trolley Tours has now been settled by the city for $2.7\n\nmillion. The fee brought in $786,000 in revenue in 2018. It was enacted in 1998. Those funds were used to help the city maintain elements of the historic district. Revenue for the city’s enterprise funds, water and sewer, parking and mobility have also taken a pandemic hit. Parking revenue is expected to be lower by $5.2\n\nmillion, and hotel/motel tax revenue are projected to fall $9.8\n\nmillion. Water and sewer collection impacts will be moderate, with losses from commercial closures being offset some by increases in home use from those working remotely.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Travelers to the island of Kauai will have to spend 14 days in quarantine regardless of whether they obtain a negative COVID-19 test, Gov. David Ige said. Ige approved a request from Kauai Mayor Derek Kawakami to temporarily opt out of the state’s pretravel testing program. This program allows travelers to bypass a two-week quarantine requirement if they test negative up to 72 hours before arriving in the islands. The new policy will take effect on Tuesday. Kawakami said he would gladly repeal it once Kauai has the virus under control again. Travelers to Hawaii’s other counties will be able to continue to avoid quarantine with a negative test. Kawakami said the county’s pretravel testing moratorium will allow Kauai’s children to play in youth sports and businesses to stay open as officials conduct surge testing and contact tracing. Kauai had no cases of community spread of the coronavirus for several months starting in July. But it has had six cases of community spread since Oct. 15, when the state began allowing travelers to bypass quarantine with a negative test.\n\nIdaho\n\nSandpoint: Bonner County Commissioner Steven Bradshaw has proposed defunding the local health district after the district instituted a mask mandate to slow the spread of the coronavirus as it surges in the area. The Bonner County Dailey reported that Bradshaw proposed the resolution Tuesday to pull about $250,000 from the Panhandle Health District. Commission Chairman Dan McDonald said the resolution will have to be placed on the agenda before it can be considered at this week’s meeting. The health district ordered the mask mandate on Nov. 19. Bonner County Sheriff Daryl Wheeler said his agency won’t enforce the mask mandate. The Panhandle Health District covers five northern Idaho counties. The district reported the area has more than 9,000 virus cases and 106 deaths. The district reported 185 new cases on Wednesday, and that 74 people were hospitalized in the district because of the virus.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield:The coronavirus pandemic has extinguished some traditional holiday cheer at the state Capitol. There will be no Christmas tree nor any holiday displays inside or outside the building, The State Journal-Register, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported. The Capitol for months has been closed to all but employees and others with permission. Tours were suspended months ago because of the pandemic. Lights on the Capitol dome won’t be used for the second straight year. Engineers have recommended that an observation deck, which is typically used to anchor the lights, should be fortified. Secretary of State Jesse White’s office typically puts up a giant artificial tree in the rotunda, stretching from the first floor to the second. Not this year because of public access restrictions, White’s office said. The prohibition on temporary holiday displays includes a Christian Nativity scene. Rabbi Meir Moscowitz said he’s looking for another place in Springfield to place a menorah to celebrate Hanukkah. “It’s a reminder of religious freedom and, I think in today’s climate, on so many levels, it’s very encouraging and important to have this symbol of light, this symbol of positivity even more than ever,” Moscowitz said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Mayor Joe Hogsett and his wife have tested negative for the coronavirus but will continue to quarantine after having close contact last weekend with an infected person, his office said Saturday. Neither the Democratic mayor nor his wife, Steph, have symptoms of the respiratory illness, the mayor’s office said in a statement. Hogsett announced Wednesday that the couple had started a 14-day quarantine period and would undergo testing. Hogsett, 64, will remain in quarantine through Dec. 4. Gov. Eric Holcomb and first lady Janet Holcomb tested negative Nov. 20 after several members of his security detail were confirmed infected with the coronavirus. The Holcombs planned to remain in quarantine until Tuesday.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines:Long-term care facilities in Iowa continue to see additional outbreaks. As of 10 a.m. Saturday, 153 facilities had coronavirus outbreaks, according to the state’s website. Last week, Gov. Kim Reynolds announced that there were 120 facilities with outbreaks. A facility is considered to have an outbreak if there are three or more positive tests among residents. Outbreaks at long-term care facilities have preceded many of Iowa’s deaths, which total 1,059.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A study that tests for parts of the coronavirus in sewage is giving public health workers advance notice of virus surges. The Lawrence Journal-World reported that the city has been taking weekly sewage samples at both of its wastewater treatment plants to test for components of the virus shed in feces as part of a study contracted through the University of Kansas School of Engineering. The city has also been sharing that data with local and state health departments. Lawrence-Douglas County Public Health spokesman George Diepenbrock said that the presence of the virus in wastewater has served as an early predictor of surges in positive cases, providing about a week’s notice and giving the health department valuable lead time. Research has shown that COVID-19 concentrations in wastewater rise about a week before a surge in new cases, and that symptomatic and asymptomatic people with the virus shed components of it in their feces.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear on Saturday announced 2,437 new cases of COVID-19 across Kentucky and 14 additional deaths, lifting the case total to 174,182 and the death toll to 1,885. “I know we’re tired. I know many of us are disappointed we couldn’t celebrate Thanksgiving or enjoy Black Friday shopping the way we usually do. But I promise you: we have come so far and we are almost there,” Beshear said in a written update Saturday afternoon. He urged Kentuckians to support small businesses, but to do so safely by shopping online if possible, and if not, by spending limited time in stores with other people, and always wearing a mask and practicing social distance. “Shopping small supports some of our local businesses that have suffered the most economically as we’ve battled COVID-19,” he said. “Let’s show them we have their backs.” Counties reporting the most new positive cases on Saturday were Jefferson, Fayette, Warren, Boone, Madison, Kenton and McCracken. The deaths announced Saturday included people in their 50s, 60s, 70s and 80s.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The U.S. Supreme Court is for now staying out of a dispute involving the state of Louisiana and a Baton Rouge-area pastor charged with violating state coronavirus restrictions by repeatedly holding large church services. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito on Friday night turned away a request from Life Tabernacle Church pastor Tony Spell to get involved in the dispute. Alito denied the request himself, without asking Louisiana officials to respond and without referring the matter to the full court, as often happens when a case is particularly significant or contentious. Spell sued state and local officials in May after being charged with violating state restrictions. Lower courts ruled against him.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A memorial has been set up at Longfellow Square to honor lives lost to COVID-19. The tribute went up Friday, WMTW-TV reported. Organizers encouraged people who have lost friends or loved ones to the virus to bring flowers or other small remembrances. The temporary memorial was to be removed at the end of the weekend. On Saturday, public health authorities in the state reported one death from the virus, bringing Maine’s total to 191 since the start of the pandemic. The seven-day rolling average of daily new confirmed cases in Maine has risen over the past two weeks from 170 on Nov. 13 to 186 on Friday.\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown:Washington County Public School students will continue virtual learning into 2021. District officials last week updated the “Return to Learn” plan in response to the continued rise of COVID-19 cases in Washington County, pushing back the date for in-person classes to resume by nearly a month and into next year. The date had been Dec. 7. In-person learning now will not begin before Jan. 11. The announcement said a decision on whether the Jan. 11 target comes to fruition will rest on community health metrics. “The reported positivity rate over the last week has ranged from 7.58% to 8.89%,” the update said. “The number of positive cases continues to rise. Based on these metrics, students will not return to in-person learning on the original anticipated December date. WCPS will continue to follow the governor’s guidance regarding the potential January return date. School systems are advised to follow these metrics when welcoming students back to schools.” Superintendent Boyd Michael expressed concern over the worsening statistics from the Maryland Department of Health on Washington County’s number of new COVID-19 cases and average daily positivity rates per 100,000 people. The announcement said WCPS will provide additional information on in-person learning on Jan. 4.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A shuttered mall is being considered as a site to hold jury trials when they resume early next year, officials said. The state Trial Court’s Chief Justice Paula Carey in a letter to Berkshire District Attorney Andrea Harrington said The Berkshire Mall in Lanesborough is a possible location for trials. “We have made some appreciable progress in identifying and obtaining space to conduct jury trials at the Berkshire Mall,” Carey wrote, according to a story Thursday in The Berkshire Eagle. “We are hopeful that together we can move the ball forward with respect to that location.” The retail outlet just outside of Pittsfield shut down last year. Jury trials have been suspended during the coronavirus pandemic, but the state court system announced a plan recently to resume six-person jury trials in January to deal with a massive statewide backlog, but only at sites that can be made coronavirus-safe. It was determined that Berkshire County courthouses could not be made safe.\n\nMichigan\n\nSandusky: A Big Boy restaurant in Michigan’s Thumb region has lost its name after the owners refused to stop indoor dining as part of statewide restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Customers were greeted Friday with Sandusky Diner instead of Sandusky Big Boy, the name for 35 years. The company that grants franchises took action. Big Boy restaurants are known by their statue of a boy in checkered overalls holding a burger over his head. The Sandusky location, about 88 miles north of Detroit, was one of four eateries cited this week for violating the state’s order against indoor dining. Three other establishments, including one of the restaurants, also had their liquor licenses suspended. Big Boy’s corporate office told the owners that they had 24 hours to comply with the state’s order, said Troy Tank, part owner and operations manager for the restaurant. “We had already decided we weren’t going to do that,” Tank told the Associated Press. “We would be open only for carry-out. We were not in a position to do that again. We had already done it for three months earlier in quarantine.” Tank said his restaurant struggled during that period.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Cloud:The state reported far fewer coronavirus cases in the past week, adding 41,071 new cases through Friday. That’s down 12.5% from the previous week’s total of 46,924, according to a USA TODAY analysis compiled Sunday. Meanwhile, the state’s latest daily totals reported Sunday showed 8,680 more confirmed cases statewide Saturday, along with 57 deaths, including eight in Stearns County, which tied a single-day record set Wednesday. The Minnesota Department of Health reported Sunday the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases reached 306,603 and the death toll hit 3,507 since the pandemic began in March.\n\nMississippi\n\nPearlington: A Gulf Coast science museum is limiting hours and planning to close for a few months because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Sun Herald reported that Infinity Science Center in Hancock County will be open on the weekends only in December. It will close completely from Jan. 1 through March. Fred Haise, an Apollo 13 astronaut who serves on the board of Infinity, said officials are hoping to reopen when a coronavirus vaccine is available. Infinity Science Center is an educational museum with rides, exhibits and tours of Stennis Space Center, a NASA rocket testing facility. Like museums everywhere, attendance is down at Infinity because of the pandemic, Haise told The Sun Herald. Many museums that are able to stay open receive government funding. Staff members will be laid off during the closure.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: Researchers at St. Louis University said preliminary evidence from a study suggests how effective masks can be, St. Louis Public Radio reported. Epidemiologists at the university said the rate of coronavirus cases significantly decreased in St. Louis and St. Louis County after government officials in July began requiring people to wear masks in public. Researchers compared data in the city and county to three neighboring counties without mask mandates – St. Charles, Jefferson and Franklin. Preliminary findings showed that three weeks after the mask mandate, St. Louis city and county infection rates were 44% lower than those of the other counties. Missouri does not have a statewide mask mandate but several hospital and political leaders have urged Republican Gov. Mike Parson to require face coverings to slow the spread of the virus. Parson has steadfastly refused to do so but has urged Missourians to take personal responsibility.\n\nMontana\n\nKalispell: A lawsuit against a long-term care facility in Whitefish has been amended to add claims that it was part of a multistate network of facilities that enriched corporate owners while residents received negligent care. The lawsuit was initially filed last month by the estates of three residents at Whitefish Care and Rehabilitation who died because of complications caused by COVID-19, the Flathead Beacon reported. The lawsuit initially represented the estates of Alton Johnson, Berton Pew and Stanley Webber, and said at least 13 people died at the facility because of the outbreak. The county had 23 coronavirus-related deaths. Court filings said Johnson died Sept. 7, a day before his family was set to remove him from the facility. Pew developed COVID-19 symptoms while at the home and was transferred to the virus wing without his family being immediately notified, the lawsuit claimed. Webber lost about 40 pounds before he died Sept. 14, the lawsuit said, adding that he was in good health before he was admitted to the facility. The lawsuit initially named the 100-bed facility and its administrator Reid Crickmore and has since been amended to include other plaintiffs and allegations.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: More employees of the Nebraska prison system have tested positive for the coronavirus. The Nebraska Department of Correctional Services said in a statement Saturday night that four staff members had tested positive for COVID-19. Two of those work at the Omaha Correctional Center, one works at the Tecumseh State Correctional Institution and one works at the department’s central office. The infected staff members are isolating themselves at home, and officials plan to notify anyone who had been in close contact with them so they can quarantine themselves. The latest cases bring the number of Nebraska prison staffers infected since the pandemic began to 325. Of those, 228 have recovered. The department also said Friday that 677 inmates have tested positive for the virus and four have died. Nearly half of the affected inmates – 312 – have recovered from the virus.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The city welcomed nearly 1.9 million tourists in October, a greater total than September but only about half the 3.7 million it played host to throughout the month in 2019, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority reported this week. The slow and incomplete return of tourists continues to imperil the city’s overall economy and experts haven’t begun to analyze how new restrictions put into effect on Tuesday to contain the spread of COVID-19 could jeopardize efforts to bring back the concerts, conventions and trade shows that traditionally draw visitors to Las Vegas, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reported. Tourists’ hesitance to travel has caused air traffic to plummet in most parts of the United States, including Las Vegas, however the market for tourists who live within driving distance grew in October, compared to 2019. Under Nevada’s current guidelines, events and gatherings are limited to 25% capacity and large events with more than 250 attendees are canceled while the state undergoes a three-week “statewide pause” to reel in the rapidly spreading pandemic. The National Finals Rodeo, which brings more than 170,000 fans to Las Vegas each December, relocated to Arlington, Texas, where coronavirus restrictions are less stringent.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Food Bank is holding 19 drive-through mobile food pantries during December across the state to meet growing demand during the coronavirus pandemic. The food bank has held dozens of mobile food pantries since March. Food will be brought to Lakes Region Community College in Laconia on Dec. 1, 8, and 15 from noon to 2 p.m.; Runnings in Claremont on Dec. 1, 8, 15, and 29 from 10 a.m. to noon; the New Hampshire Liquor and Wine outlet parking lot in Colebrook on Dec. 3, 10, 17, and 31 from noon to 2 p.m.; Chapman’s in Gorham on Dec. 3, 10, 17, and 31 from 10 a.m. to noon.; the Comcast parking lot in Manchester on Dec. 4, 11, and 18 from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.; and the New Hampshire Electric Co-Op in Plymouth on Dec. 4. from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. The New Hampshire Food Bank estimated an additional 71,000 people are now food insecure in the state, meaning 1 in 7 residents don’t know where their next meal is coming from.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nNewark: A convicted sex offender serving 19 years for traveling to Thailand and molesting young boys is among inmates seeking early release from a New Jersey prison that has experienced a COVID-19 outbreak. In recent court filings, Wayne Nelson Corliss has said his health is in danger at the federal prison at Fort Dix because he suffers from diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity. The facility had reported 255 cases through Wednesday, the most of any federal prison in the country according to data on the Bureau of Prisons website. “It is clear that Mr. Corliss is in grave danger at Fort Dix and that the COVID-19 outbreak at the BOP, coupled with his medical risks, are exceptional and compelling circumstances warranting compassionate release or home confinement in this case,” Corliss’s attorney wrote in a filing this week. Corliss, 71, is scheduled to be released in 2025. Messages were left Friday with his attorney and with the U.S. attorney’s office in Newark, which prosecuted him initially and is expected to file a response in coming days or weeks to his petition for early release.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: New Mexico’s daily count of confirmed COVID-19 cases has been trending down over recent days from the record highs reported earlier this month, but nearly every county remained deep in the red zone Friday as the state was just days away from launching its new “red to green” system for reopening. State officials announced that the transition will begin Wednesday to the tiered county-by-county risk system. Counties will be able to shed burdensome public health restrictions as soon as they meet key metrics related to positivity and spread rates within their boundaries. Only Los Alamos County in north-central New Mexico is anywhere near meeting the benchmarks. All other counties, including the state’s most populous, will have significant ground to make up, meaning it could be many more weeks before they see relief. New Mexico has some of the toughest public health restrictions in place, with closures extending to all restaurants and many other businesses. Essential businesses such as grocery stores are still open but can have only a certain number of customers inside at a time – a restriction that has led to waiting lines. Face masks are mandatory, gatherings of more than five people are prohibited and there’s no indication when schools will be able to bring students back to the classroom.\n\nNew York\n\nBuffalo: Coronavirus cases continued climbing Friday in New York and hospitalizations rose even as the state recorded a record high in testing. Western New York’s positivity rate spiked to a seven-day average of 6.28%, outpacing other parts of the state, according to figures released by the state. And Erie County, which includes Buffalo, reported more coronavirus deaths – six – than any other county in the state for a second straight day. The state reported 8,176 new cases and statewide hospitalizations climbed to 3,103. “We’re seeing an increase with the numbers across the country and within our own state,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in a news release. “It started with the fall, and it’s going to continue and probably worsen in the winter.” Cuomo insisted this week that New York is “doing phenomenally well” compared to the rest of the country. The governor said 219,442 COVID-19 test results were reported to the state on Thursday – a record for the second straight day.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nFayetteville:The threat of COVID-19 is changing the way the holidays will be celebrated across the Cape Fear region. Although concerns of public safety have led to the shelving of several annual traditions in the region, several organizers are planning to adapt. In some cases, technology will blend with tradition. In others, social distancing and adjustments to holiday interaction (quick hint: holiday hugs and sitting on Santa’s lap are definitely out of fashion this year) have been necessary. “COVID has changed how we sing but not why we sing,” said Richard Suggs, music minister at Snyder Memorial Baptist Church. For more than 40 years, the church in Haymount has presented its Singing Christmas Tree as a gift to the community, and Suggs said the church is determined to continue as a ray of light in what could otherwise be a darkened season. There will be some changes. The tree, a three-story creation of green tinfoil and lights that towers over the church sanctuary, will not be built. Pews will be vacant, and the choirs and musicians won’t be packed together like holiday ornaments. Instead, the tree is going online – available to a worldwide audience. It’s a hybrid approach blending talent and technology and requiring months of preparation and production. Suggs said that health precautions were a major part of the process.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: North Dakota has tens of thousands of COVID-19 antibody tests that still await a plan for their use, months after the state acquired them. The state acquired 178,000 COVID-19 antibody tests last spring using $3.68 million from the federal CARES Act coronavirus aid package, the Bismarck Tribune reported. Only about 8,000 have been used, health officials said. A forthcoming plan is dependent on a new, full-time state health officer coming on board. Four people, all chosen by Republican Gov. Doug Burgum, have served in the role since May, but all have quit. Interviews for a new person are ongoing. The tests analyze patients’ blood for antibodies and identify how the virus is spreading. Experts said it still has its limitations, and they look to its usefulness long-term. If someone who has never had symptoms of COVID-19 tests positive for antibodies, it’s an indication they contracted the virus but were asymptomatic.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The oldest inmate on Ohio’s death row has died, and a prison spokesperson said it was likely because of the coronavirus. James Frazier, 79, died Nov. 19 at the prison system’s Franklin Medical Center in Columbus, according to Cleveland.com. In recent months, his attorneys had sought to block execution, saying he suffered from dementia and had little idea where he was. Frazier had been sentenced to death in 2005 for killing 49-year-old Mary Stevenson during a robbery. She was killed in March 2004 when Frazier strangled her, cut her throat and fled with two of her purses, authorities said.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: State health officials reported 1,721 newly confirmed COVID-19 cases Sunday, and 19 more deaths linked to the disease caused by the coronavirus. The State Department of Health said the new counts bring the state to a total of 195,545 cases of the virus and 1,736 deaths. Over the last seven days, more than 21% of coronavirus tests in Oklahoma have come back positive, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Infectious diseases experts have warned that Thanksgiving could cause spikes in testing and delays in processing that might make the resulting figures erratic and difficult to interpret.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem:An Oregon hospital has placed a nurse on administrative leave after she posted a video on social media in which she said she does not follow safety directives meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19 when she is not at work. Salem Health said it is investigating the post by the nurse, in which she said she does not wear a mask in public, travels and lets her children have play dates. The nurse’s original TikTok video was deleted, along with her account, but a duet of her video with a side-by-side reaction by another user remained on the app. The nurse was wearing scrubs and had a stethoscope draped over her shoulders in her video, which appears to have been recorded in a break room. Salem Health released a statement Saturday saying the nurse’s views and “cavalier disregard” for COVID-19 safety measures do not reflect those of the hospital. The nurse declined an interview, KPTV reported. The hospital did not release the nurse’s name.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nErie:COVID-19 brought about a 3 1/2-month spring closure to the Erie Zoo, forced cancellation of the annual Zoo Parade, led to layoffs and furloughs, and put on hold a couple of new animal exhibit projects earmarked for completion later this year. And then there was the economic fallout induced by the pandemic and state restrictions. Scott Mitchell, CEO of the Erie Zoological Society, estimated the Zoological Society lost about $1.1\n\nmillion in revenue this year, but that was offset somewhat by about $500,000 in zoo donations from individuals, businesses, nonprofits and corporations, and grants. Zoo visitors on Saturday viewed wildlife under sunny skies and cool temperatures. The zoo will remain open Monday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. before it closes for the winter. Its scheduled reopening date is Feb. 27. With more than 400 animals to care for and feed weekly, Mitchell said his organization will step up fundraising efforts and become creative in finding ways to generate revenue during the zoo’s winter closure.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: A state-run psychiatric hospital has suspended all medical staff vacation in response to a rising number of coronavirus cases among patients and workers. “We regretfully are canceling all direct care patient support vacations” effective midnight Nov. 25, according to a letter to Eleanor Slater Hospital staff, The Providence Journal reported. The letter also said, “We hope this vacation hold is temporary as we recognize the hard work and dedication of our staff and the need for time off.” The letter was signed by Kathryn Power, director of the state Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals, which oversees the Cranston facility. A Slater spokesperson earlier this week confirmed that 14 patients and 35 staffers had tested positive for the virus. Another hospital group, Lifespan, previously issued an appeal for retired doctors and nurses to return to work, and even sought medical students and interns, to help relieve the medical staff shortage. Lifespan operates Rhode Island, Miriam, Hasbro Children’s and Newport hospitals.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The new rapid-result coronavirus tests promised to South Carolina schools by Gov. Henry McMaster should be at some districts by the start of school this week, education officials said. McMaster signed an executive order Wednesday giving state health officials permission to begin rolling out the program with tests provided by the federal government. The goal of the program is to give the rapid coronavirus tests to students, teachers and staff who are at school and show symptoms to quickly determine if they are infected and isolate them, officials said. The initial announcement earlier this month surprised education leaders, who said McMaster had not consulted with them before his news conference. But by the time McMaster issued his Wednesday order, the state Education Department said it would be able to start sending the tests to schools Monday. Schools will need to train employees – likely nurses or athletic trainers – how to administer the tests, which involve a shallow swabbing inside the nose. Parents will have to give consent for their children to be tested and districts are not required to give the tests, the Department of Health and Environmental Control said.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The City Council will consider a mask mandate at a special session meeting on Monday. The council will consider choosing between two ordinances and a resolution requiring face coverings, The Rapid City Journal reported. One ordinance specifies masks to be required in public indoor spaces. Officials said details of a second ordinance will be posted before the meeting on Monday. The resolution would require face coverings in certain situations, but would have no enforcement and no penalties. It also includes exemptions, including young children, law enforcement and those attending religious services. Republican Gov. Kristi Noem opposes mask mandates or other government interventions aimed at slowing the spread of infections. Cities across the state have moved to pass their own mask requirements. Sioux Falls, the largest city in South Dakota, approved a mask mandate earlier this month. The mandate applies to retail businesses and public buildings, but does not carry a penalty.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The Nashville Metro Public Health Department reported 824 new COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours on Sunday. There are 2,900 active cases in Davidson County. No new deaths have been reported in the last 24 hours. So far, 368 people in Davidson County have died of COVID-19, including both confirmed and probable cases. A total of 46,099 people in the county have tested positive for the virus, and 42,831 are listed as inactive or recovered.\n\nTexas\n\nSan Antonio: The surging coronavirus continued to strain hospitals in Texas as some hard-hit parts of the state remained under curfews aimed at stemming the spread of COVID-19 over the holiday weekend. State health authorities reported more than 8,600 Texans hospitalized with COVID-19 on Sunday, an increase from 8,500 on Friday, and more than a 50% increase from a month ago. State data showed limited intensive-care unit capacity in regions including the Texas Panhandle and El Paso area. Local leaders in El Paso and San Antonio have issued partial curfews through Monday morning. State health officials reported 6,041 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Sunday and 48 more deaths linked to the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Hospitalizations in Utah set a record Saturday, with 573 coronavirus patients hospitalized in the state. In addition, The Salt Lake Tribune reported 2,043 newly confirmed cases Saturday, which is lower than usual likely because of the Thanksgiving holiday. Testing, too, declined significantly with 7,443 people getting a test. The Utah Department of Health reported 14 more deaths on Saturday. Three of the people were between the ages of 25 and 44. In the past week, 76 Utah residents have died from the disease – marking one of the deadliest seven-day stretches since the pandemic began. The state’s total death toll stands at 863.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Health Department is urging people who attended services at the New Hope Bible Church in Irasburg on Nov. 22 to get tested for the coronavirus. At least one person who attended services that day was infectious, officials said. It can take as many as 14 days from exposure for symptoms to show, so the Health Department wants people who attended to take precautions now to help limit the spread. “Even if you are feeling well and don’t have symptoms, consider getting tested,” Health Commissioner Dr. Mark Levine said in a written statement. “If you do have symptoms or concerns about your health, call your primary care provider.” Contact tracers have been unable to get all the information they need to inform other people who might have been exposed. Health officials also stressed the need for the public to provide full information to contact tracers. Testing is available every day at the North Country Hospital in Newport.\n\nVirginia\n\nFort Lee:It was a traditional Thanksgiving, just not the usual one. The COVD-19 pandemic forced a reboot of the annual meal at Fort Lee. The guest list was pared down considerably, with no family members or civilians at the table. The dinner times were staggered, and the tables and chairs were spaced 6 feet further from each other than in previous years. But the menu did not change, and neither did the camaraderie. More than 5,500 military students and some of their leaders chowed down Thursday on more than a ton each of turkey and ham, 1,800 pounds of prime rib, and hundreds of pounds of sides and desserts. Also different from previous years was the absence of local media to capture all of the festivities. However, the press center took photos and videos, and pooled them to the local news outlets. According to a statement from Fort Lee, more than 500 personnel worked the serving lines at the post’s five dining facilities. Crews began preparing for the dinner 36 hours in advance.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Health officials in rural communities in the state are worried that Thanksgiving gatherings could take the COVID-19 pandemic from bad to worse and, in some places, overwhelm already strained health systems. The Spokesman-Review reported the small towns surrounding Spokane County have experienced a surge in cases in recent weeks, mirroring trends seen statewide. In the past two weeks, the Northeast Tri County Health District, which covers Ferry, Stevens and Pend Oreille counties, reported more than 300 new COVID-19 cases, a record accounting for a third of their total cases confirmed during the pandemic. Similarly, Lincoln County has seen more than 50 cases in the past few weeks, which account for a third of the total cases recorded in the county. Lincoln County experienced a few larger outbreaks this month in long-term care settings and one larger family cluster. In the three counties north of Spokane County, outbreaks at social gatherings, workplaces, restaurants, bars and churches have led to a surge in cases. The state Department of Health announced this week that it’s hiring 350 more contact tracers and investigators to support local health jurisdictions by mid-December, which could help smaller health departments meet the challenge of tracing all contacts with cases surging.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The governing body for high school sports in West Virginia has canceled the state football championship games because of the coronavirus pandemic and instead declared winners in each class. The Secondary School Activities Commission made the announcement Saturday night after the state Department of Education released its color-coded county map that determines whether athletic competitions can be played. St. Marys was declared the champion in Class A, Fairmont Senior in Class AA and South Charleston in Class AAA. “It is an unfortunate situation for everyone, but we knew going into the playoffs that this could be a possibility,” SSAC executive director Bernie Dolan said in a statement. Ritchie County was supposed to play St. Marys for the Class A title this weekend, but Ritchie County is in the highest-risk red category where athletic competitions are barred because of the virus. Fairmont Senior advanced to the Class AA championship game over Bluefield on Saturday. But the Sunday Class AA semifinal game between Oak Glen and Robert C. Byrd was called off by the SSAC decision, as were the Class AAA semifinal games Sunday between South Charleston and Musselman, and Cabell Midland and Bridgeport. Those games had involved some teams from counties in higher-risk categories on the state virus map. The decision came a day after the SSAC decided to move the title games from Wheeling to Charleston because Ohio County remained in the higher-risk orange category under the state’s COVID-19 metrics map.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee:Nearly 300 nursing home residents in Wisconsin died from COVID-19 in the most recent month, and The Journal Sentinel, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported that’s more than 10 times the previous month. Nursing homes in Wisconsin reported that 294 residents had died of the disease caused by the coronavirus between Oct. 12 and Nov. 8, according to data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. In the previous month, the deaths of 28 residents were reported. Health officials reported 17 more deaths from the virus on Friday, bringing the tally of deaths to 3,257. The state also reported 1,300 more people have tested positive. The state has seen a decline in the average of new cases it reports each day, but still had the nation’s eighth-highest number of new cases per capita over the last two weeks, according to Johns Hopkins researchers. One in every 145 people tested positive in the past week. The number of nursing home residents who have reportedly caught the virus has also shot up. In the latest four-week period, Wisconsin nursing homes reported 2,130 residents with newly confirmed cases, data showed. That’s up from about 387 new cases in the four-week period from Sept. 14 to Oct. 11.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: A high school teacher has received a national award for supporting students during the pandemic who struggle with attention and learning. The National Center for Learning Disabilities awarded the Everyday Champion Award to Whiting High School special education teacher Truman Solverud for giving an extra effort to help students navigate remote learning, the Laramie Boomerang reported. Whiting High School Principal Scott Shoop nominated Solverud for using every resource at his disposal to help students with their education and maintain relationships with families after the district moved to online instruction. Shoop said Solverud communicated with students through social media, by phone and hand-written letters from early morning to late-night hours, delivered meals, cleaning supplies and toilet paper to homes and transferred online assignments into hard copies for his students’ convenience. Everyday Champion Award winners were named in three categories: educators, school administrators and parents/caregivers. The award comes with a $5,000 prize. Solverud and the other winners will be honored by the National Center for Learning Disabilities’ annual benefit dinner in December.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/11/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/08/30/mile-challenge-bean-field-ravine-mountain-lion-attack-news-around-states/118483226/", "title": "80-mile challenge, bean field ravine: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state’s top health official said Friday that he and his colleagues are “intensely frustrated” as COVID-19 cases and deaths continue to rise, a surge he partly attributed to people who have refused to get vaccinated or change their behavior. The state is grappling with an intensive care unit bed shortage, and federal medical teams and mobile morgue units have been sent to hospitals in the South. “We are really in a crisis,” Health Officer Scott Harris said during his Friday briefing. “We’ve said that over and over for several weeks. We need people to understand that you, yourself – if you’re hearing these words – you’re the person who’s going to make a difference. You need to be responsible for your behavior. You need to do what it takes to not continue this situation. I don’t know how much longer we’re going to be able to do this.” Alabama ranks fourth for new cases per capita and continues to have one of the lowest vaccination rates in the country. “So much of what we’re seeing is preventable,” Harris said. “We’re seeing this because people don’t want to get vaccinated, and they don’t want to change their behavior. They would rather have an argument about masks than have an argument about how we keep our children safe or how do we protect Alabama hospitals. It is very frustrating for all of us.”\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The state last week reported its highest daily number of resident COVID-19 cases so far this year as health officials struggle to keep pace with coronavirus testing and contact tracing and as hospitals juggle a surge in patients with staff shortages and admissions for other conditions. Gov. Mike Dunleavy and members of his administration on Thursday announced plans aimed at increasing staffing to help with COVID-19 cases, including speeding the licensing process for health care workers and seeking federal contracts for more workers, the Anchorage Daily News reports. The state’s chief medical officer, Dr. Anne Zink, said hospital staffing is a concern. Alaska reported 701 resident COVID-19 cases Thursday – one of the highest daily tallies since the start of the pandemic. That number may be lower than the real number of infections, health officials said, because of testing and contact tracing backlogs. According to the state hospital association, hospitalizations of patients with COVID-19 are nearing pandemic highs. Combined with staff shortages and busy summertime admissions, Alaska’s health care system faces the threat of being overwhelmed, providers and state officials said. Health care providers are deciding which patients get intensive care unit beds and are struggling to transfer severely ill patients elsewhere.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Arizona Supreme Court is eliminating the long-standing practice of allowing lawyers in criminal and civil trials in state courts to remove potential jurors without explanation, a move that proponents said would help prevent discrimination in the selection of trial jurors. So-called peremptory challenges will end Jan. 1, under a groundbreaking rule change ordered Tuesday and released Friday by the state’s highest court. In the meantime, a court task force will recommend possible changes to current court rules that also allow opposing sides in trials to ask judges to remove potential jurors for valid reasons such as stated bias or inability to serve, the order said. Peremptory challenges are a hot-button legal issue nationally, as illustrated by jury selection in the trial that resulted in the conviction of a former Minneapolis police officer in George Floyd’s death. Robert Chang, a Seattle University law professor, said he believed Arizona’s impending outright elimination of peremptory challenges is believed to be a first such step by a U.S. state, though others such as Washington and California have placed new restrictions on the challenges. “Arizona clearly has gone further,” said Chang, the director of a legal center that endorsed a competing Arizona rule-change proposal to restrict but not eliminate peremptory challenges.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: More than 3,100 active coronavirus cases have been reported in Arkansas public schools among students and employees, according to newly released numbers from the state. Most students returned to the classroom last week, and the majority of public school students attend districts that are requiring masks. Such rules emerged after a judge in Little Rock temporarily blocked a state law that bans mask mandates in schools and public places. The Arkansas Department of Health’s latest report on schools, released Thursday, found 3,102 active cases in 173 school districts in the state. The Bentonville, Springdale, Rogers, Cabot and Fort Smith districts all reported more than 100 active cases among students, faculty and staff. A week ago, the state reported just under 1,800 active cases at schools. Meanwhile, a judge in Lonoke County on Friday ruled against a group of parents who sued to block Cabot schools’ mask requirement. Circuit Judge Barbara Elmore wrote that most of the parents who sued had already received mask exemptions for their children or withdrawn them from the district, so she denied their request to block the requirement. Arkansas ranks fifth in the country for new virus cases per capita, according to researchers at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalabasas: A mountain lion that attacked a 5-year-old boy and dragged the child across his front lawn was shot and killed by a wildlife officer, authorities said Saturday. The 65-pound mountain lion attacked the boy while he was playing near his house Thursday in Calabasas and “dragged him about 45 yards” across the lawn, said Capt. Patrick Foy, a spokesman with the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The boy suffered significant traumatic injuries to his head and upper torso but was in stable condition at a Los Angeles hospital, Foy said. “The true hero of this story is his mom because she absolutely saved her son’s life,” Foy said. The mother was inside the house when she heard commotion outside. “She ran out of the house and started punching and striking the mountain lion with her bare hands and got him off her son,” he said. The parents immediately drove the boy to the hospital, where law enforcement was notified of the attack and sent a wildlife officer to the scene. Once at the house, the officer discovered a mountain lion crouching in the bushes with its “ears back and hissing” at him, Foy said. Subsequent DNA tests confirmed that the lion was the one responsible for attacking the child, the wildlife department said in a statement.\n\nColorado\n\nBoulder: Jurors convicted two former sheriff’s deputies accused of causing the death of an intoxicated man by placing him on his stomach and squeezing him into a van to take him to a detox center. Former Boulder County sheriff’s deputies James O’Brien, 52, and Adam Lunn, 39, were found guilty Friday of manslaughter in the death of Demetrius Shankling, 23, in 2018, the Longmont Times-Call reports. According to an arrest affidavit, they put the 6-foot-tall man, with his hands behind his back, in a compartment that was less than 5 feet long. O’Brien and Lunn had to press on the compartment door to close it, causing Shankling’s leg to get wedged against the inside of the door, the affidavit said. When they reached the detox center the early hours of Sept. 9, 2018, Shankling was unresponsive and not breathing. He died after spending 27 days in a coma, Senior Deputy District Attorney Christian Gardner-Wood said. An autopsy found that Shankling died of suffocation because of his positioning, with alcohol and amphetamine as contributing factors.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state’s plan for using $110 million in federal pandemic relief funds to reopen K-12 schools for in-person learning, while addressing the effects of lost instructional time last school year and reducing education gaps over the long term, has been approved by the federal government, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Friday. Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of Education on Thursday released the remaining $369 million in federal pandemic relief funds for education to the state. With this latest batch, Connecticut will have received approximately $1.1 billion under the American Rescue Plan’s Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief Fund, according to federal figures. The state previously received $737 million in March. When combined with other federal COVID-19 relief funds for education, Connecticut has received roughly $1.7 billion since the start of the pandemic, according to the state Department of Education. “This historic level of funding allows us, as one educational community, to be bold and innovative as we forge our path to a transformative and equitable recovery,” Connecticut Department of Education Commissioner Charlene Russell-Tucker said in a statement.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Officials are now asking New Castle County residents to “squish on sight” if they see an invasive spotted lanternfly. The county’s population of the bug has surpassed the level for which the Delaware Department of Agriculture recommends reporting, Delaware State News reports. In Kent and Sussex counties, officials are still asking those who spot adult lanternflies to report them for verification. Spotted lanternflies pose a risk to the grape, orchard, nursery and landscape, and hardwood industries, Stephen Hauss, an environmental scientist with the state Department of Agriculture’s Plant Industries Section, told the newspaper. Native to China, India and Vietnam, the insect is about 1 inch long and half an inch wide at rest. Its forewings are gray with black spots, and the hindwings are red with black spots. The insect was first found in North America in 2014. The first one in Delaware was spotted in 2017, Hauss told the newspaper. Between 2018 and 2019, the insect’s numbers took off, especially in New Castle County.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Thousands of voting rights advocates rallied across the country Saturday to call for sweeping federal laws that would wipe out voting restrictions advancing in some GOP-controlled states that could make it harder to cast a ballot. The rallies, held in dozens of cities, were intended to increase pressure on Democrats to rewrite procedural rules that would allow Democrats to pass the legislation without Republican votes. But they were also aimed at coaxing President Joe Biden to become a more forceful advocate on the issue. “You said the night you won that Black America had your back and that you were going to have Black Americans’ backs,” the Rev. Al Sharpton, who helped organize the national demonstrations, said at a rally in Washington. “Well, Mr. President, they’re stabbing us in the back.” More than a thousand people turned out in sweltering heat on the National Mall on Saturday, the 58th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech. His son Martin Luther King III used the occasion to call on the Senate to scrap the filibuster rule. “Our country is backsliding to the unconscionable days of Jim Crow. And some of our senators are saying, ‘Well, we can’t overcome the filibuster,’ ” King told the crowd. “I say to you today: Get rid of the filibuster. That is a monument to white supremacy we must tear down.”\n\nFlorida\n\nOrlando: Mounting deaths from the latest COVID-19 surge have strained capacity at hospital morgues and funeral homes across central Florida. While the state’s record levels of new cases and hospitalizations for the disease have leveled off over the past week, averages of daily reported deaths have continued to climb. Hospitals across Florida have reported to the federal government that roughly 279 patients have died every day for the past week, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, though that figure includes deaths suspected, but not yet confirmed, to have been from COVID-19. The figure just a month ago was 52 deaths per day. AdventHealth’s hospitals in central Florida are scrambling to secure additional resources to deal with the surge in deaths, said the hospital group’s spokesperson, Jeff Granger. The Orlando Sentinel reports the health system had reached morgue capacity at 10 of its hospitals in five counties: Orange, Osceola, Polk, Seminole and Volusia. “We have begun utilizing rented, refrigerated coolers at 10 of our campuses,” the hospital group said in an email obtained by the newspaper. “These coolers are quickly becoming filled also.” Funeral directors also warned that their facilities are being overwhelmed, according to numerous news outlets.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal appeals court on Friday upheld a lower court’s ruling that said requiring voters to provide their own stamps for mail-in ballots and ballot applications does not amount to an unconstitutional poll tax. The American Civil Liberties Union and its Georgia chapter filed a lawsuit in April 2020 saying that Georgia’s postage requirement for absentee ballots and ballot applications effectively imposes a poll tax and is therefore unconstitutional. The challenge was brought on behalf of voters and a group seeking to empower communities of color, the Black Voters Matter Fund. “We hold that the fact that absentee voters in Georgia who decide to vote by mail must pay their own postage is not a ‘tax’ or unconstitutional fee on voting,” Circuit Judge Elizabeth Branch wrote in the opinion for a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That affirmed an August 2020 ruling by U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg in Atlanta. “We are disappointed in the outcome. The ACLU of Georgia will continue to protect the sacred fundamental right to vote,” ACLU of Georgia legal director Sean Young said. Totenberg had acknowledged the potential difficulties of in-person voting, particularly during the pandemic, but said the fact that it’s available means the postage requirement is not tantamount to an unconstitutional poll tax.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: In an effort to address vaccine hesitancy, a group of businesses and nonprofits launched a public service campaign Thursday aimed at Native Hawaiians, many of whom harbor a deep distrust of the government dating back to the U.S.-supported overthrow of the monarchy in 1893. The campaign reminds Hawaiians that they were nearly wiped out by disease in the 1800s and that the kingdom’s rulers at the time pushed people to get vaccinated against smallpox. About 20 Hawaiian leaders stood in rows 6 feet apart Thursday at a statue of Queen Lili’uokalani, the kingdom’s last monarch, imploring people to wear masks and get vaccinated to ensure the survival of the Indigenous people of Hawaii. Meanwhile, as visitors continue to fly to Hawaii and locals go about their business, state officials say the islands may need to go into lockdown if the surge in coronavirus cases linked to the delta variant continues. County mayors are asking for more restrictions, and Gov. David Ige told Hawaii News Now on Thursday that strict mandates are being considered. If case counts continue to rise, “and we push the hospitals across that line, then we will have to go to more extreme measures, lockdowns and potentially shutting businesses,” Ige said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin has been ordered to turn over several public documents regarding her education task force to journalists after a judge found she had no legitimate reason to withhold the materials. In a scathing ruling Thursday, 4th District Judge Steven Hippler said McGeachin’s attempts at withholding the documents from public view were so baseless and frivolous that her office should pay the Idaho Press Club’s legal fees plus an additional $750 penalty. “If public officials were required to disclose public records only to those, including media, they believe will support the government’s actions, we will have shed the principals of our democracy and evolved into an autocratic state where criticism of public officials is not permitted,” Hippler wrote. The Idaho Press Club sued McGeachin in July, after several journalists said they were wrongly denied access to public records about her newly created Education Task Force charged with investigating alleged “indoctrination” in the state’s public school system. McGeachin’s office responded to some of the requests well past the time limits set by state law and denied many of the records under a variety of exemptions, some so irrelevant – including one specific to fishing and hunting licenses – that it appeared she “may have blindly selected them at random,” the judge wrote.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: City officials on Friday accused DoorDash and Grubhub of harming restaurants and their customers by charging high fees and through other deceptive practices when delivery and takeout business became essential to the industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. The officials believe their lawsuits against the delivery companies are the most sweeping of their kind brought by a city. “It is deeply concerning and unfortunate that these companies broke the law during these incredibly difficult times, using unfair and deceptive tactics to take advantage of restaurants and consumers who were struggling to stay afloat,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said in a statement. Representatives for the two companies called the lawsuits filed Friday in Cook County Circuit Court “baseless.” Delivery companies have been the target of legal authorities in other cities and states before, but those efforts have targeted specific policies, compared to Chicago’s attack on numerous elements of the companies’ operations. According to the lawsuits, both companies advertise delivery services for restaurants without their agreement, hurting the businesses’ reputation when customers are unhappy about the cost or service. City investigators also found that they charge higher prices than restaurants set on their own menus and charge more fees than initially disclosed.\n\nIndiana\n\nPeru: A statue of a top Indiana suffragist has been erected outside the library where she trained and organized other activists for women’s right to vote. The bronze likeness of Marie Stuart Edwards was unveiled Thursday at the Peru Public Library, where Lt. Gov. Suzanne Crouch and Edwards’ two grandsons spoke about her dedication to the cause. The statue depicts a young Edwards standing by her bicycle and wearing a wide-brimmed hat, gazing into the distance with a look of determination, the Kokomo Tribune reports. Crouch said women like Edwards made it possible for her to become the state’s second in command. “We here in this crowd are able to participate in the democratic process, all of us, because of Marie Stewart Edwards,” she said. “We have her, and all that she did and all that she stood for, to thank for our ability to stand here as equals.” In February 1920, Edwards helped found the nationwide League of Women Voters. Within a year, about 2 million women had joined the nonpartisan organization that pushed to educate women about their new rights as voters. Congress passed the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote in August 1920. Work on the $105,000 statue and pocket park surrounding it began after Rediscover Downtown Peru was awarded a $35,000 grant last year to help pay for the project.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state’s chief justice on Friday signed an order making masks mandatory in areas controlled by the courts, a contrast to a state law that bans similar mandates in public schools where children have resumed classes amid rising numbers of coronavirus cases. The order signed by Chief Justice Susan Christensen said all people entering court-controlled areas must wear a face covering regardless of vaccination status. “This requirement applies statewide and does not depend on a particular county’s or area’s positivity rate or transmission status,” Christensen wrote. She said the Iowa Supreme Court reviewed recent revisions to the guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention regarding mask-wearing in public indoor settings in areas of substantial or high transmission. The order contradicts Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds’ long-term policy against mask mandates. In May, she signed a law that bans cities, counties and school districts from requiring masks. Reynolds has been put on notice by U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, who said in a letter last week that the Iowa law is “against science-based strategies for preventing the spread of COVID-19.” Reynolds lashed out at President Joe Biden after receiving the letter and suggested the CDC has no scientific proof masks stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: A state agency is pushing to process hundreds of applications for coronavirus relief funds from renters facing eviction and their landlords after spending weeks this spring hiring and training more than 100 new employees to do the work. The state’s Housing Resources Corporation is handling the bulk of the emergency rental assistance in Kansas, and most of its money hasn’t yet been distributed. Questions about how quickly tenants’ overdue rent and utility bills are being paid off became even more compelling late Thursday when the U.S. Supreme Court blocked a federal moratorum on evictions. States, cities and counties have until 2025 to spend some of the dollars, but the federal government hoped for 65% of the first tranche of aid – $15.7 billion total – to go out before Oct. 1. Although the state’s largest city, Wichita, has hit that target with its own program, the Kansas housing agency, like such agencies in most states and most cities and counties with their own programs, was far short at the end of July, the U.S. Treasury Department reported last week. “It’s just not getting the money to people fast enough,” said Dustin Hare, an organizer for the tenant advocacy group Rent Zero Kansas.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie and several other elected Republicans joined a “freedom rally” Saturday, where they disparaged COVID-19 restrictions and Gov. Andy Beshear in front of a supportive crowd. Massie, Kentucky Auditor Mike Harmon, and state Reps. Josh Calloway, Savannah Maddox and Felicia Rabourn gathered on the steps of the State Capitol and took turns giving speeches to a crowd of at least 300 people. The rally came at the end of a week when Kentucky repeatedly broke grim records for the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19. “COVID is a serious disease,” Massie said during his speech, noting he has known people who died from it. “But there’s another disease, another virus, in the state of Kentucky. ... It’s called the Beshear virus.” The congressman joked he thought former Gov. Matt Bevin had gotten rid of the “Beshear virus” when he succeeded former Gov. Steve Beshear as the state’s top official. But then the commonwealth ended up catching the “Andy variant,” he said, referring to Andy Beshear, the son of Steve Beshear who followed in his father’s footsteps. Symptoms of the “Andy variant” include “loss of balance in your bank account” and confusion, Massie joked. At one point he derisively referred to masks as “face diapers.”\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: A man is celebrating his 80th birthday by cycling 80 miles a day for 10 days straight. His personal challenge began last Tuesday and will continue through this Thursday. Phil Baker’s actual birthday is Aug. 28. He travels a route that largely uses River Road, with some variations, to take him 40 miles from home and then 40 miles back. He leaves his house at 5:15 a.m. and gets back about 10:30 a.m. A fellow cyclist is riding with him each day. Baker, a lifelong athlete who’s competed in Ironman triathlons, began training for his birthday-week rides about a year ago. He had been walking and hiking up to 20 miles a day, to take a break from cycling, then picked up the bike again, starting his training by traveling 10 miles in an hour, then slowly increasing his speed over longer periods of time. “I got up from 10 miles to 20, 25 miles, then 30 and 35 miles, and up to 40 and 50 miles for a longer length of riding,” Baker said. “It wasn’t all done in an hour, but the hour goal was a way to start.” Baker said he also bought a “brand new, beautiful bike” – a Canyon bike he admires that’s used by one of the teams in the Tour de France. A local bike shop helped Baker adjust the bike seat and handle bars to fit him, he said. “It’s all about where you are on the bike,” Baker said. “Fit is everything.”\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state’s annual bear hunt gets started for the season Monday as hunters prepare for another year of pandemic-era fall hunting. The Maine bear hunt runs from Monday to Nov. 27, though most of the season takes place between now and Sept. 25. That’s the period of the season in which it’s legal to hunt bears using bait. The season kicked off Saturday with Youth Bear Day, which is reserved for young hunters. The state’s other big fall hunting seasons for deer, moose and wild turkey will begin later in the fall. Maine officials have encouraged more hunting during the pandemic because it’s an outdoor activity that easily lends itself to social distancing.\n\nMaryland\n\nWilliamsport: A select group of inmates is being trained by national experts to restore weathered and disturbed gravestones at a historic cemetery. Officials announced the initiative Friday in Williamsport, saying it would provide the inmates an opportunity to learn stone masonry skills that pay between $20 to $35 an hour in Maryland. The work will take place at Riverview Cemetery, where more than a dozen headstones were damaged last month in a case still under investigation. The plan outlined Friday also calls for inmates to clean all the gravestones and reset them, as many have become destabilized over the years. Craig Rickets, 54, was one of the inmates from the Maryland Correctional Training Center south of Hagerstown who has been involved. Of all the jobs he’s done through prison training programs – including landscaping, shipping and handling, and janitorial work – Rickets said restoring gravestones was the most “productive.” “It makes me feel like I have new life,” he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A federal judge on Friday dismissed a lawsuit challenging a requirement that students at the University of Massachusetts campuses in Boston and Lowell be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in order to return to campus. Students at the schools sued in July, asking the judge to find the vaccination mandates to be unconstitutional. The UMass Boston student also alleged she was improperly denied a religious exemption. U.S. District Judge Denise Casper said the schools have a strong interest in reducing the spread of the disease. And she found that despite the students’ assertion that the policy is “arbitrary or not based in science,” the schools “based the decision upon both medical and scientific evidence and research and guidance and thus is at least rationally related to these legitimate interests.” The judge also noted that students who refuse to get vaccinated may still take online classes or defer their enrollment a semester. But even if the policy meant they would be deprived of a UMass education, their argument still fails, she said. “Moreover, the balance of equities tips in Defendants’ favor given the strong public interest here that they are promoting – preventing further spread of COVID-19 on campus, a virus which has infected and taken the lives of thousands of Massachusetts residents,” she wrote.\n\nMichigan\n\nEagle Harbor: A group of Michigan Tech University alumni have submitted the winning bid for a former U.S. Air Force radar station in the Upper Peninsula that they hope can become a tourist destination. The bid was $227,000, The Daily Mining Gazette reports, citing a statement from Keweenaw County, which controls the property. The former base, which has more than 100 acres in Eagle Harbor Township, is known locally as Mount Horace Greeley. For nearly 40 years, it served as a radar station during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. The winning bidder was identified as Zach Garner of Perry, who said he submitted an offer on behalf of himself and Michigan Tech alumni who are engineers. The school is 30 miles away in Houghton. “We are passionate about the Keweenaw Peninsula and respectful of the deep history rooted in the area, including this site itself,” said a letter that accompanied the bid. The goal is to address any environmental issues at the former base, employ local residents and turn the land into a tourism spot, the letter said. The group said it has “dreamt for years about the prospect of turning the aforementioned property into a destination that anyone and everyone can enjoy.”\n\nMinnesota\n\nClimax: Some consider it a geological wonder. A crack in the soil of a bean field in northwestern Minnesota has caused the ground to collapse 25 feet, creating a quarter-mile-long ravine. Wayne and Erllene Erickson are the fourth generation on the family farm near Climax in Polk County and say they’ve never seen anything like it, WDAY-TV reports. “(It’s) kind of scary. It is sad, sad to see it,” said Erllene Erickson as she surveyed the fallen bean field. “Mother Nature does what she wants.” The fallen land is pushing under the river bank, sending more dirt into the Red River. Wayne Erickson is trying to make sense of what happened on his farm. “When I drove out here, it looked like the Grand Canyon. We didn’t have all that slumping going on; it was just straight down. Straight up and down,” Erickson said. Geologists with the University of North Dakota say the dry weather, a drop in water levels on the Red River and recent rains can form a perfect storm for something like this to occur. Crevasses are still forming as the land continues shifting. Soil experts were expected to visit the field to study the natural phenomenon.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The board governing the state’s public universities voted Friday not to require students to be vaccinated against COVID-19 despite the objections of the two medical doctors who are part of the board. During a special meeting, nine members of the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning Board of Trustees said the vaccine should not be mandated. Many said they support students getting the COVID-19 vaccine, but shots should be voluntary. Dr. Alfred McNair Jr. and Dr. Steven Cunningham were the only two board members who voted to mandate inoculations. “This volunteer thing is ridiculous,” said McNair, who is chief of medical staff at Biloxi Regional Medical Center. “If they had polio, it wouldn’t be a volunteer thing.” Mississippi’s public universities already mandate that students be vaccinated against measles, mumps and rubella, according to Institutions of Higher Learning bylaws. Students studying in a health-related field must be vaccinated against hepatitis B. McNair said cases among young people are rising in the state, and he’s seeing children hospitalized with more severe symptoms than ever before. He said people who recover from the coronavirus can have long-term side effects.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: Intensive care units are nearly full across the area, creating challenges for hospitals battling to keep up with the high number of COVID-19 patients. The Kansas City Star reports 215 ICU beds in the region were in use last week – the most since the onset of the pandemic – and that number has grown almost every day since. As of Wednesday, 224 people were hospitalized in ICUs, according to hospital data tracked by the Mid-America Regional Council, a regional planning agency. The data includes hospitals in Jackson and Clay counties in Missouri and Wyandotte and Johnson counties in Kansas. Kansas City isn’t unique in Missouri. Data posted Friday on the state’s COVID-19 dashboard showed 690 ICU patients across the state among 2,395 people hospitalized with COVID-19. On Friday, Gov. Mike Parson rescinded the COVID-19 related state of emergency that was put in place March 13, 2020, and replaced it with a narrower state of emergency that focuses on the health care system. Parson, a Republican, said in a statement that the changes acknowledge the progress the state has made when it comes to the pandemic, particularly now that vaccines are available. But he continued regulatory and other procedures that will allow the still-struggling health care system to respond to increased caseloads.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Several parents are suing Missoula public schools over a mask requirement as the school year is set to begin amid a new wave of COVID-19 cases. An attorney representing parents of students in Missoula said the requirement is in violation of the state’s constitution, which guarantees individuals the right to make their own medical decisions. Lawyer Quentin Rhoades said Thursday that there isn’t sufficient scientific evidence that children wearing masks prevents the spread of the coronavirus for the government to override that individual right. Kevin Twidwell, an attorney at the Kaleva law office representing the schools, said they disagree with the allegation that face coverings violate the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. An online fundraiser organized to cover the costs of filing the lawsuit raised $10,000 as of Thursday. Matt Stivers, who donated $100, wrote that his son has difficulty breathing while wearing a mask because of a heart defect. “Kids need to see each others’ faces and deserve a normal experience in school. They are being deprived of non-verbal communication with other students,” Stivers wrote on the fundraiser page. The Missoula County Public Schools Board of Trustees voted earlier this month to approve the mask mandate for the first six weeks of school.\n\nNebraska\n\nGrand Island: The Nebraska State Fair has kicked off and will offer a full slate of attractions and music a year after the COVID-19 pandemic canceled the annual event’s concerts, carnival and other draws. Besides the rides, gooey fried food and livestock shows, this year’s fair in Grand Island will feature a bevy of concerts, including Modern West featuring Kevin Costner on Thursday, BandaLos Sebastianes on Friday and Jon Pardi on Saturday. Warrant and Skid Row, both wildly popular “hair bands” in the 1980s, will perform Tuesday in the Events Center. The theme of this year’s state fair is “Nothing More Nebraskan,” and the event will run through Sept. 6. Executive Director Bill Ogg said this year’s fair has more 4-H entries and FFA exhibitors than it had in 2019. “So there’s a rebound effect,” Ogg told the Grand Island Independent. “We should have one of the strongest participation years in 4-H and FFA.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: An equestrian supply store has sold out of a drug primarily used to deworm horses that vaccine skeptics are peddling as a remedy to the coronavirus. V & V Tack and Feed no longer has any of the drug, ivermectin, KTNV-Las Vegas reports. The store in the northwestern Las Vegas metropolitan area fields multiple calls daily about whether it has the drug in stock and now requires customers to show proof that they own horses to buy it. Store associate Shelley Smith told the TV station that people coming into the store have told her they were taking the drug for coronavirus and experiencing side effects including loss of vision. “You should not be taking this product. This is not for humans to take. This is to treat parasites in horses,” Smith said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued a health advisory Thursday urging people against taking ivermectin, saying that poison control centers had experienced a five-fold increase in calls for symptoms ranging from hallucinations and confusion to gastrointestinal issues. The Southern Nevada Health District warned people Wednesday that, although the drug could be used to treat conditions like head lice and worms in humans, taking doses manufactured for horses could result in hospitalization or death.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The New Hampshire Lottery generated a record $518.5 million in total sales in the fiscal year ending June 30, officials said. It surpassed its previous record from the last fiscal year of $392.2 million. “With an expanded menu of games, new offerings like KENO 603, sports betting through our collaboration with DraftKings, NH iLottery, and a consistent focus on engaging our current audience and tapping into new markets, we feel confident we have positioned the New Hampshire Lottery for continued success and growth as we look toward the future,” Charlie McIntyre, the lottery’s executive director, said in a statement. The New Hampshire Lottery and DraftKings launched mobile sports betting in the state in December 2019, and retail locations followed.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: A former government official who says she is a sexual assault survivor is demanding that the Republican gubernatorial candidate stop using her story as a “political prop” in a campaign video that bashes Gov. Phil Murphy. Katie Brennan, who has said she was sexually assaulted by a peer while they both worked on Murphy’s behalf in 2017, said Friday that she wasn’t consulted before Jack Ciattarelli launched PhilMurphyDoesNotCare.com. The site prominently features a video of Brennan publicly testifying before legislators and charges that Murphy uses women as “political props.” She said in a tweet earlier she wasn’t a prop or a pawn herself. “Take it down,” she said Friday. “I wasn’t consulted prior to the creation of the website and the ad campaign, and had I been, would have expressed my displeasure with it. It looks like an endorsement of the Ciattarelli campaign, which is not my intent,” she said in a phone interview. “There is a way to hold people accountable and talk about the mistakes of the past and what their vision and plans for betterment and equity and reform are in the future without dragging me into the fight in a way that I certainly did not ask to be.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state is flush with cash due to a quick recovery of oil and gas markets and higher-than-expected gross receipts tax revenues as consumers spend federal pandemic relief checks and tap into other recovery aid, state finance officials and legislative analysts said. The officials briefed a key panel of state lawmakers Friday and said while revenues are expected to hit record levels for the next fiscal year, the pandemic remains a risk factor that still has the potential to derail economic recovery if cases continue to surge or shutdowns are imposed again. While widespread shutdowns are not likely, the forecast shows what analysts described as a significant upward revision in recurring revenues for the current fiscal year – up more than $632 million from estimates made just six months ago. Nearly $1.4 billion in new money is expected for the 2023 fiscal year, marking growth of nearly 19%. That means lawmakers will have more money than ever before to spend on education, roads, public safety and other government programs. It also means more money is expected to be funneled into the state’s permanent endowments. Some lawmakers warned that the federal recovery aid won’t be around forever and urged others on the Legislative Finance Committee to keep building the state’s reserves.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Cutting-edge DNA technology will be used to analyze the remains of more than 1,100 victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack on the World Trade Center that have yet to be identified. Newsday reported Saturday that the New York City medical examiner’s office has been approved to use the forensic method known as Next Generation Sequencing, which is already being used by the Department of Defense to identify remains from World War II and the Korean and Vietnam wars. Thousands of human remains from Sept. 11 have yet to be identified because they’re too damaged and degraded to be analyzed by conventional methods. They’re currently being stored at the National September 11 Memorial & Museum at the World Trade Center site. The medical examiner’s office could begin using the process before the end of the year, Mark Desire, chief of the office’s missing persons and body identification unit, told the newspaper. While the remains of about 1,600 of the 2,754 World Trace Center victims have been identified, the process has slowed over the years, and the last identification was made in 2019. The medical examiner’s office began studying Next Generation Sequencing in 2018, but the COVID-19 pandemic delayed the approval process until this year.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: A panel of state trial judges refused Friday to halt its order restoring voting rights for tens of thousands of residents convicted of felonies whose current punishments don’t include prison time. The three judges denied the delay sought by attorneys for top Republican lawmakers on the same day the panel’s majority filed an explanation about why they authorized voting access for potentially 56,000 offenders in North Carolina otherwise unable to cast ballots. One of the judges announced that decision earlier last week, in advance of a written order. GOP lawmakers wanted the temporary delay while they appeal the ruling. A trial concluded last week in a lawsuit filed in 2019 by several civil rights groups and ex-offenders challenging state law on the restoration of voting rights. The two Superior Court judges who agreed to issue Friday’s preliminary injunction wrote that the harm the offenders alleged they would experience by having to wait another election without voting was “both substantial and irreparable.” Friday’s order said election officials can’t deny voter registration to any convicted felon who is on probation, parole or post-release supervision.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Human cases of the mosquito-borne West Nile virus are on the rise in the state, with the severity of symptoms resulting in some hospitalizations, according to health officials. So far, five people have confirmed cases, with four in the hospital, as well as two of six people with pending cases. The confirmed cases are in Cass, Mercer, Sargeant and Stutsman counties, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Common symptoms of the virus include fever, headache, body aches or rash. People with severe cases may experience a stiff neck, altered mental status, paralysis, coma and possibly death, health officials said. Most people infected with West Nile experience no symptoms. The number of West Nile cases in North Dakota varies year by year, with seven confirmed human cases last year and nine in 2019. But in 2018 there were 204. “Peak WNV activity historically has occurred in August,” state Department of Health epidemiologist Amanda Bakken said. “This is the time to be vigilant and take precautions, not just when people are aware mosquitoes are biting them.” Three of the five confirmed cases in people this year have affected the nervous system. “Because our cases have had particularly severe symptoms … it is especially important that people protect themselves,” Bakken said.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The state’s correctional agency terminated seven employees Friday after officials say prison guards used excessive and unjustified force against a Black inmate before he died in custody in February. The Ohio Department of Rehabilitation & Correction sent a notice of removal to five corrections officers, a supervisor and a licensed nurse following an investigation into the in-custody death of 55-year-old Michael McDaniel. Security footage released by the agency in July showed McDaniel collapsing on his own and being taken down to the floor by prison guards at least 16 times before he died at the Correctional Reception Center in Orient, a Columbus suburb, on Feb. 6. “We’re responsible for what happened in that video,” director Annette Chambers-Smith told reporters in July, after releasing surveillance footage of the incident. “There is no question about that.” One of the officers involved, Heath Causey, is accused in the records released Friday of performing a “take-down” of McDaniel while the inmate was being escorted outside without shoes and a coat and while wearing a ripped T-shirt, “causing his body to veer off the walking path and land face-down in a snow-covered area.”\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The city must pay nearly $1 million to five attorneys who successfully challenged an anti-panhandling ordinance adopted by the city, a federal judge ruled last week. U.S. District Judge Joe Heaton issued the order approving 2,474 billable hours that attorneys spent on the case for a total of $986,350. A federal appeals court determined in 2020 that the ordinance placing restrictions on panhandling on street medians is an unconstitutional violation of free speech. Plaintiffs included two homeless men who used the medians to panhandle, including one who sold issues of the Curbside Chronicle newspaper, two joggers, a journalist, and a community activist who has used medians to protest and erect signs for his legislative candidacy. Several attorneys for the Oklahoma chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union were among those who represented the plaintiffs. “We hope this fee amount will deter Oklahoma City from violating the constitutional rights of Oklahomans and encourage them to consider the concerns of the community in the future,” Megan Lambert, a staff attorney for the ACLU of Oklahoma, said in a statement. “We will continue our fight for the free speech rights of all Oklahomans.”\n\nOregon\n\nSpringfield: A COVID-19 outbreak at an assisted living facility that has infected 64 people and killed five began with an unvaccinated worker, public health officials said. The outbreak at Gateway Living in Springfield began July 5. The facility has 105 employees and 101 residents; only 63% of the staff and 82% of the residents are completely vaccinated. Lane County Public Health spokesman Jason Davis said the outbreak began with an unvaccinated employee who worked while infectious. The outbreak arrived as an immense surge of coronavirus cases hit Oregon, driven by the especially contagious delta variant as well as vaccine obstinacy in some quarters. COVID-19 hospitalizations have increased 990% in Oregon since July 9, according to health officials. Many hospitals have canceled elective surgeries, and some patients are housed in hallways instead of rooms. More than 90% of the state’s intensive care and hospital beds are full, and health officials say the overwhelming majority of people hospitalized are unvaccinated. The state is deploying crisis teams of hundreds of nurses, respiratory therapists, paramedics and nursing assistants to the hardest hit regions. Officials in Tillamook County said Friday they no longer have capacity to store the bodies of the dead and are asking for refrigerated morgue trucks.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: A juvenile detention center in western Pennsylvania will close next month after state officials revoked its license. Allegheny County Manager William McKain says the Shuman Juvenile Detention Center in Pittsburgh will close Sept. 18. Youths being housed there will likely be transferred to other facilities the state operates, but specific plans have not yet been disclosed. The state’s human services department notified the county Friday that the license for the 46-year-old facility was being revoked. Officials cited the center’s “continued failure to follow regulations and failure to improve on past violations.” The Shuman Center’s fourth provisional license was issued July 1 and was set to expire Jan. 1, 2022. Provisional licenses are issued to facilities where violations are found so that the sites have time to address the problems, officials said. Shuman has been operating under a provisional license since December 2015. The latest violations, stemming from an investigation between June 16 and July 1, included a heroin overdose and the theft of $140 from a nurse’s purse when a child was left unattended. Twenty children and young adults were being held at the facility as of last Monday. They range in age from 14 to 20.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state has made it easier for retired nurses and other health care workers to reenter the workforce without affecting their pension. Gov. Dan McKee signed the executive order Thursday to make sure there are enough health care professionals during the pandemic. Many hospitals have experienced staffing shortages, and there are concerns about another resurgence of coronavirus cases caused by the delta variant. If a retiree is determined by the state Department of Health to have the skills necessary to address the pandemic, the agency can provide a written certification that their reemployment is of finite duration and is necessitated by the good faith belief that their skills are needed, the order says. McKee previously said that workers at state-licensed health care facility are required to get fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by Oct. 1. There have been protests against the requirement. The state is also preparing a field hospital Cranston for possible reopening if it is needed to help handle a surge in new cases. The site originally opened in December and was taken out of service in March but kept stocked with medical equipment and other supplies.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The daily numbers of new COVID-19 cases are reaching levels only seen in the worst days of the pandemic before vaccines were widely available, leading hospitals to warn that unless the spike in cases is curbed soon, there will be dire consequences. There were 6,697 new cases of the disease reported Friday in South Carolina, the Department of Health and Environmental Control reported. The only days with more cases reported since the pandemic started 18 months ago were 7,680 cases on Jan. 6 and 7,450 on Jan. 8. “The expected surge in new cases once children returned to school across South Carolina and the proliferation of the highly transmissible delta variant has fueled a spike that requires our attention and legislative consideration of the removal of masking restrictions,” the health agency wrote in a statement. The Republican-dominated General Assembly in June passed an item in the state budget threating to take state money away from school districts that require masks. Back then, South Carolina was averaging 150 new COVID-19 cases a day. Now that average is above 4,500 new cases. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster is one of the biggest defenders of the mask ban and hasn’t directly addressed the pandemic since Aug. 9.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: Four universities are partnering on a new center to disrupt criminal networks. The schools will use a $4 million state grant to create the Center for Understanding and Disrupting the Illicit Economy. South Dakota Mines in Rapid City, South Dakota State University in Brookings, Dakota State University in Madison, and the University of South Dakota in Vermillion are involved in the project. Dr. Jon Kellar, a professor at South Dakota Mines, will lead a team focused on identifying counterfeit goods, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. Kellar said it’s a widespread problem that can have big implications. “Let’s say you buy a counterfeit purse – you think, well, I got a good deal, and it looks good. And, well, you probably think it’s a victimless crime,” he said. “Well, in fact, those products are being used by terrorists to generate cash to fund their networks.” Kellar said it’s important to be a conscientious consumer. “The first rule of thumb is if it seems too good to be true, it probably is,” he said. “You’ll notice some of the packaging may not look right; there may be misspellings. Or instead of a regular branded box, it comes in a white bag with some cheese cloth.” Researchers will also focus on tracking fake pharmaceuticals and exploring the dark web and other networks used by criminals.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: State House Speaker Cameron Sexton has announced the members selected to serve on the House’s redistricting committee. According to a news release, Sexton’s office on Thursday said the committee will include eight Republicans and four Democrats. Deputy Speaker Curtis Johnson, R-Clarksville, will chair the committee, and Speaker Pro Tempore Pat Marsh, R-Shelbyville, will be the committee’s vice chair. “The makeup of this panel is representative of the distinctive voices of Tennesseans from across all three grand divisions of our state,” Sexton, R-Crossville, said in a statement. Lawmakers will use newly released U.S. Census Bureau data to redraw state and congressional districts currently dominated by Republicans. The proposals will be taken up in the 2022 legislative session that begins in January. Republican Gov. Bill Lee has veto power over the finalized plan, but he’s not expected to put up many objections.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: The University of Texas is providing cash and other prizes to encourage UT community members to get COVID-19 shots. UT students, staff and faculty who have received at least one vaccine dose at any location can upload their vaccine card on UT’s portal to be eligible to enter into the university’s weekly prize drawing. The drawings will occur from Sept. 3 to Oct. 8, and the prizes will vary each week, according to UT’s Protect Texas website. Prizes for students include up to $10,000 in cash, gift cards, parking permits, wireless headphones, tickets to a home football game with UT President Jay Hartzell, and various other prizes. Faculty and staff members can win cash prizes up to $500, coolers, tumblers and the opportunity to take a tour of the new Moody Center with UT athletic director Chris Del Conte. UT is encouraging but not requiring community members to get vaccinated and wear masks. Gov. Greg Abbott has prohibited agencies that receive public funding in Texas from instituting vaccine and mask requirements. UT spokeswoman Eliska Padilla said the incentive program, which was announced Thursday and is funded by gifts from a variety of donors, aims to increase the vaccination rates of 18- to 24-year-olds. She said UT has no plans to incentivize vaccinations after Oct. 8.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Hospitals operated by Intermountain Healthcare have hit 100% capacity at their intensive care units because of increasing numbers of patients with COVID-19, and doctors and nurses are growing increasingly frustrated. During a live update Friday, Dr. Brandon Webb, an Intermountain Healthcare infectious disease physician, said health care workers are seeing two growing trends: children with COVID-19 and severe infection in those seeming to be young and healthy. “Children’s Hospitals are seeing more COVID cases this round and more children coming in because of it,” Webb said. Statewide, 16 children have been hospitalized with COVID-19 in the past week, according to the Utah Department of Health, with 1,132 children ages 5 to 13 having tested positive. There were 467 people hospitalized overall as of Friday, including 184 who were in intensive care units. One reason that more children are contracting COVID could be the high amounts of exposure in classrooms and social gatherings, Webb said. However, the different coronavirus variants have also played a role in higher infection rates across the board, not just in children. “Delta is simply a different disease in some ways than the other variants,” Webb said.\n\nVermont\n\nNorwich: Farmers and their crews from around the state are ready to battle in the Northeast Organic Farming Association of Vermont’s sixth annual Farmer Olympics. The event will be held Tuesday at Honeyfield Farm in Norwich. Teams will compete in skills ranging from physical to cerebral to ridiculous, organizers said. Among the past events were the zucchini relay, squash shot put and blindfolded seeding. Awards will go to the best-performing teams. “The Farmer Olympics are all about joy, celebration and connection, and this year, after the challenges farmers faced over the last 18 months, this event is really needed,” said Zea Luce, NOFA-VT’s events and engagement coordinator. Farms can register teams through NOFA-VT.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: Liberty University announced a temporary campuswide quarantine Thursday amid a spike in COVID-19 cases. The quarantine is set to begin Monday and last until Sept. 10, news outlets report. The university has about 15,000 students and 5,000 faculty or staff on campus. There were 159 known, active cases among students, faculty and staff as of Wednesday, according to the university’s online COVID-19 dashboard. Of those cases, 124 cases were among students. It was a sharp increase from the prior week, when 40 students and staff tested positive for the coronavirus as students were welcomed back to campus. It also surpasses the highest confirmed active caseload last September, when at least 141 people on campus tested positive, and nearly 1,200 people were quarantined. As the university began its fall semester last week, the university, which doesn’t require vaccination, lifted building capacity restrictions and distancing and masking requirements. The university changed its protocol late Thursday to enact the campuswide quarantine, moving classes online and suspending large indoor gatherings. Outdoor events will continue as scheduled, and worship services will move to the stadium.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: A state judge struck a measure on homelessness from the November ballot even as the city remains mired in a long-term humanitarian crisis. The so-called Compassion Seattle proposal would direct the city to provide 2,000 units of emergency or permanent housing within a year and require the city to ensure parks, playgrounds and sidewalks remain clear of encampments. King County Superior Court Judge Catherine Shaffer said Friday that it would conflict with state law and usurp the City Council’s power. Shaffer said she and other voters might like what the measure’s proponents are trying to do, but it exceeds what can be accomplished through a local charter amendment. “You can’t amend a city charter to conflict with state law,” Shaffer said. “I like this charter amendment as a voter. But as a judge, it cannot stand.” The American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, Seattle/King County Coalition on Homelessness and the Transit Riders Union sued to block the measure, officially known as Charter Amendment 29. They argued that it is beyond the scope of local initiative power and violates state law on how local governments can address homelessness.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nLogan: Guided tours of elk have returned to southern West Virginia. The West Virginia State Parks system announced that viewing tours will be held on weekends starting Sept. 11 and ending Oct. 24. They will start and finish at the Chief Logan State Park lodge in Logan County, the parks system said in a news release. There also will be a few midweek evening tours. Morning tours start at 5:30 a.m.. and evening tours start at 4 p.m. Each tour is limited to 12 people. The tours typically will last four hours, depending on weather and viewing conditions. Groups typically walk or hike up to 3 miles. Tickets cost $30 and can be purchased online. Elk have been transplanted over the past five years at the Tomblin Wildlife Management Area in Logan County. They were brought from the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area in western Kentucky and the Arizona Game and Fish Department.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A suburban school district is meeting to possibly reconsider opting out of a federally funded free meal program, a move that met with widespread criticism from parents after school board members said they were concerned participating students would “become spoiled.” The Waukesha school board planned a special meeting Monday to discuss its participation in the program, after parents and other advocates put pressure on the board to reconsider. The Alliance for Education in Waukesha held a rally outside the district office Friday to call for reinstating the program. Administrators opted into the supplemental program last year during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the school board has decided to end it. “As we get back to whatever you want to believe normal means, we have decisions to make,” Joseph Como, president of the school board, said in a meeting. “I would say this is part of normalization.” Board member Karin Rajnicek said the free program made it easy for families to “become spoiled.” Darren Clark, assistant superintendent for business services, said he feared there would be a “slow addiction” to the service. Waukesha students from low-income families will still be able to apply for free or reduced-price meals under the traditional National School Lunch Program.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: A judge is offering defendants a break in their court fines if they agree to get vaccinated against COVID-19, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Natrona County Circuit Court Judge Steven Brown began offering the deal earlier this summer after seeing vaccination rates stagnate. Less than 40% of eligible people in Wyoming are fully vaccinated, putting it among the bottom five states in vaccination rate. The city of Casper has a community service program that works with courts to offer a $10 reduction in fines per hour of work for local charities, nonprofits and other organizations. Getting vaccinated is “just another form of community service,” Brown said Thursday. One woman making an initial appearance in Circuit Court on Monday was offered a $200 reduction in her $560 fine if she was fully vaccinated within 30 days. The fine would be reduced when she returned with proof of receiving the shot. Brown said he doesn’t require vaccination, just incentivizes it, noting other states hold cash drawings, some with million-dollar prizes. The court doesn’t track how many people have accepted the deal. The two other judges in the circuit have not been offering fine reductions for vaccinations.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/03/09/conch-contest-golf-tree-geena-davis-news-around-states/111409522/", "title": "Conch contest, golf tree: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The state Senate passed a bill Thursday that would ban gender therapies such as prescription hormones or gender confirmation surgery for minors. The legislation would make it a felony for medical providers to prescribe puberty-blockers or hormones to anyone under age 19 or to perform gender confirmation surgery on minors. The bill, sponsored by Trussville Republican Sen. Shay Shelnutt, passed 22-3, news outlets report. The legislation now moves to the state’s House of Representatives, where a similar bill was also approved by a health committee last month. Proponents have said it would stop “vulnerable children” from getting medical procedures and medications with uncertain long-term effects. LGBTQ activists and opponents of the bill have countered it is discriminatory and spreads misinformation. The American Academy of Pediatrics advised in 2018 that such treatments can be part of certain care models for children.\n\nAlaska\n\nKodiak: Shoppers will no longer see a blue-sticker label on Gulf of Alaska cod after its sustainability certification is suspended starting in April. The label designates which fish are sustainably caught. Alaska’s Energy Desk reports the Marine Stewardship Council, which sets standards for sustainable fishing, will suspend the label starting April 5. Gulf of Alaska cod have had the certification for about 10 years. The impacts of losing certification are unclear. An independent audit found there were not enough young cod entering the gulf fishery, which led to the suspension. But auditors blame a climate change-caused heatwave from 2013 to 2016 for reducing gulf cod by more than half and pushing them to near-overfished status last year.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: The U.S. Forest Service has given final approval to a project to replace and upgrade a ski lift at the Arizona Snowbowl. The Forest Service’s decision allowing replacement of the current chairlift is based on an environmental assessment published in October. Forest officials concluded that replacing the new lift would not significantly impact the land and environment, despite claims that it would affect Native American cultural values, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. Arizona Snowbowl is located on the Coconino National Forest on the west side of the San Francisco Peaks, near Flagstaff. Arizona Snowbowl said the current chairlift will be replaced with a high-speed combination version that includes enclosed eight-person gondola cars and open-air six-person chair seats. The new lift will be installed in time for the 2020-21 season, the ski area said.\n\nArkansas\n\nBentonville: A film festival co-founded by Academy Award-winning actress Geena Davis announced Friday that it’s moving to later in the year because of concerns about the new coronavirus. The Bentonville Film Festival, in northwest Arkansas, announced it will move this year’s festival, originally scheduled for April 29-May 2, to Aug. 5-8. The festival said it will honor passes and badges that have already been purchased for the festival. The official lineup will be announced by June, organizers said. “Our number one concern is the safety of our content creators and our community of attendees,” Davis, who is also the festival’s chairwoman, said in a statement. The Bentonville Film Festival began in 2015 and last year screened 162 films. Arkansas has not had any cases of coronavirus, which causes the illness called COVID-19.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Los Angeles International Airport will experiment with a limited restoration of taxi pickups in the central terminal area beginning later this month. Taxi drivers have been pushing to resume pickups there since taxi and ride-hailing pickups were moved to a lot outside the terminal loop last fall to ease traffic amid major construction. Airport officials said one taxi pickup location will be established in a parking structure near the Tom Bradley International Terminal and adjacent Terminal 3. Another taxi stand will be put back into service for travelers passing through Terminals 7 and 8. Last October, the airport moved all taxi and ride-hailing pickups from curbside to a satellite lot, dubbed LAX-it. Airport officials said the move was necessary to reduce traffic for construction of an automated people-mover train and its stations, as well as redevelopment of every terminal. Passengers can walk there or take constantly circulating shuttles.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The owner-operator of a Denver-area oil refinery will pay $9 million to settle air quality violations dating to 2017, state officials announced Friday. The settlement with Calgary-based Suncor Energy is the biggest leveled by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to resolve air pollution violations. The Colorado Sun reports the settlement was announced by John Putnam, the agency’s environmental director, at a news conference. Suncor’s Commerce City refinery produces about a third of gasoline used by motor vehicles in Colorado and most of the jet fuel used at Denver International Airport. It processes about 98,000 barrels of oil daily, most of that from drillers along Colorado’s Front Range. On Dec. 11, the refinery released an ashy substance that blanketed adjacent neighborhoods. Suncor called the clay-like material catalyst and said it wasn’t hazardous.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Britain: The state’s wine and spirits industry has joined forces with environmentalists to reduce litter, especially mini bottles of wine and spirits known as nips. The anti-litter partnership, known as Three Tiers for Connecticut, plans to launch the retail portion of its “Don’t Trash Connecticut - Nip it in the Bin!” campaign Tuesday. The campaign will focus on signage at retail locations, urging consumers to properly dispose of the bottles. A news conference is planned Tuesday at CT Beverage Mart in New Britain. The partnership has already held two community cleanup events in Norwalk and West Haven. More more cleanups and initiatives are scheduled for the coming year. Wine and spirits companies and organizations in Connecticut formed the partnership last year with the group Live Green CT, a statewide environmental organization that’s dedicated to eradicating land-based litter by 2025.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A federal judge has refused to dismiss a whistleblower lawsuit against the state’s largest hospital system. The lawsuit filed by former Christiana Care compliance officer Ronald Sherman and backed by the federal government alleges that the hospital system defrauded taxpayers by funneling Medicaid payments to independent doctors as kickbacks in exchange for patient referrals. The judge denied Christiana’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit after holding a hearing Friday. Christiana Care argued that Sherman had no standing to file the lawsuit because he had previously executed a release discharging all causes of action against the hospital system when he was terminated in 2014. Christiana also argued that Sherman, on behalf of Christiana Care, had disclosed the allegations contained in his complaint to the government through compliance disclosure logs submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services’ inspector general’s office.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A federal magistrate on Friday excoriated the government for refusing to turn over its investigative file in the death of a Virginia man shot by U.S. Park Police. The files are sought by the family of Bijan Ghaisar, who died in 2017 after he was shot by Park Police officers multiple times at the conclusion of a stop-and-go chase on the George Washington Parkway. Ghaisar’s family is suing the government and the officers who shot Ghaisar. At a hearing Friday, U.S. Magistrate Ivan Davis said the government had no right to withhold the file from the Ghaisar family’s lawyers. He ordered the government to turn over the entire file by next Friday. Government lawyers said they have been delayed in turning over the file because the material in the file is sensitive and voluminous. Judge Davis, though, was unsympathetic. “You’re required to produce, period,” Davis said. “You do not decide unilaterally for yourself” whether material should be turned over.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: A woman who plays the French Horn in the Royal Canadian Navy took top honors in Key West’s 58th annual Conch Shell Blowing Contest on Saturday. Alliszon Zaichkowski of Victoria, British Columbia, won the women’s title performing excerpts from several melodies including composer Igor Stravinsky’s “The Firebird” and Queen’s “Bohemian Rhapsody.” She’s such a fan of the quirky “instrument” that she had a large conch shell tattooed on her arm. “I like to think of the conch shell as my travel horn because I can’t bring my French horn everywhere, and you also don’t want to be playing a French horn at the beach,” she said. “So I always just take my conch shell with me, and that’s my vacation instrument.” In the men’s division, Vinnie Marturano of Big Pine Key tooted his way to victory by playing a portion of Aram Khachaturian’s “Sabre Dance.” The fluted, pink-lined conch shell, an enduring symbol of the Florida Keys, has been used as a signaling device in the islands for centuries. Today, native-born residents are known as Conchs, and the Keys island chain is often called the Conch Republic.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Some students at a private school have been suspended indefinitely after a video surfaced showing them conducting an apparent mock lynching of another student with toilet paper in a school bathroom, officials said. Several boys at Cristo Rey Atlanta Jesuit High School were seen on video wrapping toilet paper around their heads and cutting holes for their eyes, news outlets report. Some were also seen wrapping what appears to be a toilet paper noose around another boy’s neck as he appears to pull up on a bathroom stall support beam as if being hanged. Officials at the college preparatory school acknowledged the incident Thursday. They said the act was reprehensible and wouldn’t be tolerated. They also said the students were suspended indefinitely while the school investigates. A school statement didn’t say how many youths were suspended, and the races of those involved weren’t immediately disclosed.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A million trees could be planted in the state each year under a proposed program to increase the number of noninvasive trees. The Legislature is considering backing the tree-planting project started by University of Hawaii geography professor Camilo Mora to offset carbon emissions, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. The Carbon Neutrality Resources initiative is responsible for planting thousands of trees in Hawaii. The most recent project involved 2,000 volunteers planting 11,000 trees in December, Mora said, adding that he hopes to increase to 100,000 this year and plant a million in 2021. The bill would place the state Department of Land and Natural Resources in charge of a program to plant a million native trees statewide each year. It was approved by the Senate on Tuesday and passed its first reading in the House on Thursday.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The FBI is investigating after hackers stole as much as half a million dollars of state payments that were intended to go to contractors. Idaho State Controller Brandon Woolf’s office revealed the theft in a statement late Friday afternoon, saying the hackers posed as state vendors and then changed the vendor’s banking information, diverting the payments into the hackers’ bank accounts. The fraud was first noticed by a controller’s office employee Feb. 26, according to the office. Few details were released about exactly how the thefts occurred, but officials said the hackers were able to change the banking information by “navigating state procedures.” “Regular payments made to those vendors by 20 state agencies were then diverted and stolen,” the release said. “The State has recovered some of the funds to date, however, the total amount of funds diverted is under $550,000.”\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Officials from the city and the NHP Foundation celebrated the opening of a renovated historic housing unit offering affordable single-room occupancy. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Friday that restoration of the Mark Twain on Chicago’s Near North Side will help keep the city affordable. The city teamed up with the NHP Foundation, a nonprofit real estate organization dedicated to preserving and expanding affordable housing, in a $54 million rehabilitation of the building. It created 148 affordable apartment units with private bathrooms and added private kitchenettes. It has all new plumbing and electrical systems, a rooftop deck, a restored vintage facade and nearly 10,000 square feet of retail space on the ground floor. The Chicago Housing Authority will provide rental assistance to the Mark Twain’s occupants. Fifty residents who lived there before the renovation have returned; the rest of the units will be leased to people on the authority’s waiting list.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: The city will start supplying free feminine hygiene products in all city building restrooms, including men’s and gender-neutral restrooms. The decision came after Purdue University’s move to offer an assortment of menstrual care products for free in campus bathrooms. After the City Council approved a similar resolution, Mayor John Dennis said West Lafayette was ready to start stocking feminine products in all restrooms in city facilities, including the $31.5 million Wellness and Aquatic Center scheduled to open in early 2021. City Council members Shannon King and Kathy Parker sponsored the resolution. “The mayor gave us a thumbs up, and he really had our back,” King said. During a pilot project in restrooms at Purdue, the faculty-led University Senate found the building averaged $27 a month to restock menstrual care products used from seven dispensers.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The names of three nominees to fill a vacant state Supreme Court seat have been passed to Gov. Kim Reynolds, who now has 30 days to appoint one of them as the high court’s next justice. The Judicial Nominating Commission on Friday afternoon announced the finalists: Mary Chicchelly, District Court Judge in the Sixth Judicial District out of Cedar Rapids; Matt McDermott, an attorney at Belin McCormick, P.C. in Des Moines; and David May, an Iowa Court of Appeals Judge in Polk City. The commission, composed of eight individuals elected by Iowa lawyers and nine commissioners appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Senate, interviewed 15 applicants Friday to fill the seat that will be left empty upon former acting chief justice David Wiggins’ retirement in the coming weeks. The finalist will be Reynolds’s fourth appointment to the court since taking office in May 2017.\n\nKansas\n\nLawrence: A couple hundred million years ago, an ocean covering Kansas teemed with prehistoric life. Yet for millennia, Kansas has been a dry, sometimes even dusty place. The ocean is long gone, but traces of that long-ago aquatic life were captured for the ages in fossil form. Now, paleontologists from the University of Kansas have an app they hope will help motivate people to go out and find that evidence, reports the Kansas News Service. The Digital Atlas of Ancient Life app was created by a group of paleontologists and researchers led by KU ecology and evolutionary biology professor Bruce Lieberman. The app boasts an extensive database with detailed pictures of fossils common to Kansas. KU owns thousands of fossil specimens, especially trilobites, cephalopods and ancient clams. The app is one way to share all of that information to smartphones around the world. If it motivates people to go out and find some of their own, Lieberman said, all the better.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: The state House overwhelmingly passed its version of a new two-year budget Friday, but some lawmakers said the unwillingness to tap into more revenue sources would shortchange many of the state’s pressing funding needs. The GOP-crafted spending plan drew bipartisan support in clearing the House 86-10. The measure now goes to the Republican-dominated Senate, which will put its imprint on the budget. The differences will likely be ironed out by legislative leaders in a conference committee. The House version changed Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s proposed pay raise for teachers to spread it to other school employees. It boosted school-security funding to hire hundreds of counselors. The House plan also scaled back Beshear’s proposal to add more social workers but offered salary enhancements to hire and retain more of them working in child protective services. The only new revenue source to help support the House spending plan would come from new taxes on vaping and tobacco productions, which would raise nearly $50 million over two years.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLafayette: The opening of an urban park is being delayed because the nonprofit organization behind the project has obtained more money for additional features. Lafayette Central Park Inc. initially hoped to open Moncus Park this spring, but with an extra $5 million in money raised, the organization is planning to open later in the year. Features already completed include a dog park. Features being added this year are an amphitheater and a “family area,” which includes a tree house, splash pad and playground. The nonprofit has received some contributions earlier than expected. For example, plans for the amphitheater were put into motion when Iberia Bank advanced a pledge of $1 million to the park, which wasn’t expected for another three years. With the additional money, the nonprofit and its board had to consider whether to push back the park’s opening date; use sporadic openings of sections; or have construction underway while the park is open.\n\nMaine\n\nBar Harbor: A historical museum that is part of the state’s popular Acadia National Park will be closed to the public this season as it undergoes rehabilitation work. The Islesford Historical Museum has been in the midst of rehab since November 2019. The National Park Service said the work will “allow for the protection and longevity of a historic building and for the safe exhibition of historical objects.” The museum is on the National Register of Historic Places and opened in the summer of 1928. The rehab work will include replacement of the original slate roof. The park service said money for the $1.1 million rehab is coming from entrance passes purchased at Acadia National Park and the service’s repair and rehabilitation funds. The service said the museum is scheduled to reopen during the following season with an exhibit about the Cranberry Isles.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: A comprehensive education measure that will cost billions of dollars over the next decade with the goal of making the state’s K-12 schools among the world’s best was approved by the House of Delegates on Friday night. The House voted 96-41 for the bill, which still needs Senate approval. The legislation, known as the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, is based on the recommendations of a state commission that worked for three years on the proposal. The plan focuses on five policy areas: expanding early childhood education like pre-K; increasing teacher salaries; college and career readiness; aid for struggling schools; and accountability in implementation. The proposal would be phased in over a 10-year period. It would cost an additional $4 billion in fiscal year 2030, with a majority of the cost paid by the state while local governments also contribute.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWestborough: Fish and wildlife officials have started stocking the state’s ponds, lakes and rivers with more than 500,000 trout raised in five hatcheries. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife stocking program began last week with bodies of water on Cape Cod, as well as in southeastern Massachusetts and areas west of Boston. Some of the places stocked with rainbow trout include Spectacle Pond in Sandwich, Lake Cochituate in Natick and Houghton’s Pond in Milton. Other bodies of water will be stocked with brook, brown and tiger trout raised in hatcheries in Sandwich, Palmer, Belchertown, Sunderland and Montague. These fish, coupled with the more than 60,000 stocked last fall, will provide some excellent fishing in the coming months, the agency says. Most of the trout are longer than 12 inches, with more than 600 brown trout and 500 brook trout over 18 inches.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Five people who worked in a wildlife disease lab have been diagnosed with a latent form of tuberculosis, a spokesman said Friday. The Department of Natural Resources’ lab processes thousands of deer heads during the annual hunting season to check for chronic wasting disease and bovine TB. An illness caused by bacteria that attack the lungs, TB can be fatal, although a latent form shows no symptoms, doesn’t make people feel sick and is not contagious, according to federal health experts. It typically involves treatment to prevent full-blown TB. The DNR learned about the infections last year, including three people in June and two later in the summer, spokesman Ed Golder said. He said it was the department’s “working assumption” that the workers got TB from infected deer, “but we can’t say for sure.” The lab is located at Michigan State University.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Overall graduation rates for the state’s high school students have hit a historic high. The state Department of Education released data Thursday that shows a graduation rate of 83.7% for the class of 2019. That’s up half a percentage point from the prior year and up nearly 1.5 points over the past five years. Minnesota Public Radio News reports black and Hispanic students made the biggest gains, with improvements of more than 3 percentage points for Hispanics and more than 2 points for black students. Racial and socioeconomic disparities persist, with graduation rates higher for white students than they are for students of color. The data shows the rate for Native American students fell slightly this year. The rate remains the lowest among Minnesota high school students at just over half.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: State legislators have killed bills that would either ban or regulate kratom, an herbal drug that can be used for pain relief. Kratom is currently unregulated in most parts of the United States but has been outlawed by a few local governments in Mississippi amid concerns that it can be harmful. Kratom is derived from a tree that’s native to Southeast Asia. The U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency says the leaves can be crushed and then smoked, put into capsules, or taken with water or other liquids. The DEA characterizes kratom as one of its “drugs of concern.” The agency says people have used it to relieve muscle strains and as a substitute for opium; the drug has also been used to manage withdrawal symptoms from opioids. Bills to either ban or regulate kratom died Tuesday when committees did not consider them before the first big deadline of the legislative session.\n\nMissouri\n\nClayton: More than 170 firearms seized or recovered by police during an eight-month period last year were purchased from a single St. Louis-area pawn shop, federal authorities said in announcing charges against three men connected to the shop. Carlos Jones, 31; Robert Thornton, 36; and Steven Johnson, 44, were charged Thursday with unlawful transfer of firearm to a convicted felon and making false statements on firearm records. All three men worked at Piazza Jewelry and Pawn in Overland, Missouri, a St. Louis suburb. The federal complaint said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives traced 170 seized and recovered guns to sales at the pawn shop, with 102 of those guns recovered in the city of St. Louis. ATF Special Agent Chad Foreman wrote in an affidavit released Thursday that six of the confiscated guns were used in homicides, four in robberies and 20 in weapons offenses and were found in 36 cases in which a prohibited person was in possession of a firearm.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A landslide was blocking a BNSF Railway freight line in eastern Montana on Friday. The slide happened about 10 p.m. Wednesday about 10 miles west of Miles City, BNSF Railway spokeswoman Maia LaSalle said. Dirt covered about 800 feet of railway that runs along the Yellowstone River. Crews were still working Friday to clear the tracks, but the slide activity had not been stabilized, LaSalle said. Freight traffic was being rerouted around the blockage on Montana Rail Link tracks. The track that is blocked is part of a path that connects trains from North and South Dakota to southern routes through the Powder River region into Wyoming, The Billings Gazette reports. No trains were in the area at the time of the slide, and no injuries have been reported, BNSF said.\n\nNebraska\n\nOgallala: The state game and parks commission will vote March 20 on banning both alcohol possession and consumption at Lake McConaughy and neighboring Lake Ogallala in western Nebraska. The alcohol ban in the state-controlled areas is among several agreements the state worked out with local leaders to avert drastic cuts in access, The North Platte Telegraph reports. The commission had been considering access restrictions following complaints about overcrowding and rowdy behavior last Fourth of July. The proposed changes, which would have taken effect later this year, were meant to address the overcrowding on the lake’s beaches. But the commission delayed action in January after hundreds of people showed up for a hearing on the proposed rules. Most said they wanted more law enforcement and greater attention to checkpoints, not a crackdown to limit access.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Social media comments about protecting bears that were posted by Lake Tahoe activists and referred to a longtime wildlife biologist as a murderer constitute “good faith communications” protected as free speech, the state Supreme Court says. The recent opinion doesn’t end a lawsuit filed in Washoe County District Court in Reno. But it settles a key legal question in the dispute between Carl Lackey, a Nevada Department of Wildlife biologist, and Carolyn Stark, who administers a Facebook page that posts criticism of the state’s bear control tactics. The lawsuit is the latest development in a years­long legal and public relations battle between the agency and a group of activists who oppose state methods for managing bears. In 2018, a judge issued a protective order to keep Stark away from another state biologist who says Stark stalked her in a dispute over the capture of nuisance bears.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu has written to congressional leaders asking for continued funding of the State Opioid Response Grant program, which helped New Hampshire create a new “hub and spoke” caregiver system. The state used its $45.8 million share of funding to set up its Doorway program of nine regional recovery centers. Sununu, in his letter Friday to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said the program served more than 7,300 people in 2019 and provided more than 3,200 clinical evaluations to identify needed services. Of that group, over 2,400 people had opioid-related needs, and more than 5,000 referrals were made to medication-assisted treatment, outpatient, residential and peer recovery services.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nMargate: Residents in a Jersey Shore town that hates its new sand dunes will get a chance to say whether they support building a boardwalk. Margate’s government decided late Thursday to authorize a nonbinding referendum during the November general election asking voters whether they support building a boardwalk in the wealthy town south of Atlantic City. The proposal arose from widespread unhappiness with a beach replenishment project completed in 2017. Mayor Michael Becker said Friday that the town is not committing itself to building one if the vote goes that way. Rather, he said, there needs to be a mechanism for the town’s voters to clearly express their preference, and the commission will then weigh the pros and cons before deciding. Margate had a boardwalk in the early 1900s; it was destroyed by a hurricane in 1944.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMagdalena: The National Radio Astronomy Observatory is canceling group tours of its Very Large Array to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. The observatory said Friday that the visitor center and gift shop will remain open, and self-guided walking tours will continue. But a semi-annual open house, guided tours and special tours for school groups will be put on hold between March 15 and May 31. The move is meant to protect visitors and the workers who keep the facility running, Tony Beasley, the observatory director, said in a news release. “Our first priority is the safety and health of our visitors and our staff, and these cancellations are being done to minimize the risk of exposure to this virus,” Beasley said. Astronomers use the Very Large Array to observe natural radiowaves from distant stars and planets.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Video showing New York City police officers arresting a young black man sparked outrage and elicited questions about the amount of force used to make the arrest in a city where mistrust of police remains high more than five years after Eric Garner’s death from an officer’s chokehold. Fitzroy Gayle, 20, pleads for help in the video, recorded by a woman who then tweeted it, as several officers wrestle him into submission Wednesday evening on a Brooklyn sidewalk. When Gayle asks a lone plainclothes officer why he was being stopped, the officer does not appear to answer before uniformed backup rushes in. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said he was ordering an internal investigation. The man in the video had fled officers who approached him and another man as they were smoking marijuana in a park about 7 p.m., Shea said. The officers were responding to an automated alert to gunshots, Shea said. Both men were later apprehended, but there is no indication they were linked to the gunfire, he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state’s residents are getting more site-specific information this year about the air that they breathe and whether it might make sense to keep inside. The state Division of Air Quality announced last week that daily air-quality forecasts will now be issued for 91 of the state’s 100 counties and two mountain ridge zones. In the past, forecasts have been regional. A website provides real-time air quality index measurements, while next-day and extended forecast products will be posted each afternoon and updated in the morning. Index readings correspond to a color-coded advisory system that describes when the air can be unhealthy for some or many. Last week started what’s considered the ozone season, or when concentrations of the gas can be highest in the air as days get warmer. The division says ozone concentrations have been declining due to emission reductions from power plants, cars and industry.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nFargo: New rules for the state’s presidential caucuses are likely to drive up turnout and could shrink Bernie Sanders’ organizational advantage over Joe Biden when the state’s Democratic voters get their say this week in what has essentially become a two-man race. North Dakota is the smallest prize of the six states holding caucuses or primaries Tuesday, with only 14 pledged delegates at stake. As a result, it hasn’t gotten much attention from either candidate. What’s new for North Dakota voters in 2020 is that the system is more like a primary than a traditional caucus. People are free to vote and leave. Democrats can vote at 14 locations across the state, from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. CST and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. MST. Republicans will have seven polling places open from 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. local time, where voters can express their support for President Donald Trump. And in a boon to rural voters, mail-in ballots will be accepted.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: A tree that appeared overnight during the 1979 U.S. Open to become a part of golf lore has met its end. The Black Hills spruce known as “The Hinkle Tree” was partially uprooted by a gust of wind last week at Inverness Club in Toledo and was cut down. The tree dated to the 79th Open, when a journeyman pro named Lon Hinkle came up with a way to outsmart the course during the first round. Hinkle noticed he could take a shortcut by hitting through a gap of trees near the eighth tee and drive his ball on the adjacent 17th fairway, shaving 75 yards off the dogleg hole. It made for an easy birdie, but U.S. Golf Association officials were not amused. The USGA dispatched the course’s greens chairman to bring in a tree from a nursery and block the shortcut. Overnight, the Black Hill spruce, about 20 feet tall, appeared in the gap. But during the next round, Hinkle and his playing partner, Chi Chi Rodriguez, decided to hit their tee shots over the tree.\n\nOklahoma\n\nTulsa: A man who ran unsuccessfully for the Republican gubernatorial nomination in 2018 has been found guilty of assault and battery for shooting a process server trying to give him legal documents. Jurors on Thursday rejected Christopher Jonathan Barnett’s argument that he shot and wounded the man who came to his Tulsa home in July in self defense. On the stand, Barnett asserted the process server presented a threat to him, though he conceded the man never pointed a weapon at him. Jurors recommended Barnett be sentenced to 32 years in prison and fined $10,000. A judge will sentence Barnett in April. The Tulsa World reports video and audio evidence presented to the jury showed the process server just flashed legal documents at Barnett, who kept his front door closed while they spoke. Defense attorney Jason Lollman said he plans to appeal and believes the sentencing recommendation was too harsh.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state has reached an agreement with private health insurance companies to waive co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles for Oregonians who undergo testing for COVID-19 at a facility that’s within their insurance network, Gov. Kate Brown announced. The agreement also will apply to a vaccine for the virus if one becomes available, she said in a statement Thursday. The state is pursuing the same agreement with self-insured health plans and also seeking clarification from the federal government about exceptions to cost-sharing for Medicare Advantage plans, as well as health savings account-eligible high-deductible health plans, she said. “No one should have to ask if getting a COVID-19 test is something they can afford. I hope this agreement sets a framework that other states can follow nationwide,” Brown said in the statement.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nEphrata: A small family-owned pharmacy chain is closing its five central Pennsylvania stores after a 141-year run. Royer Pharmacy in Lancaster County calls itself one of the oldest continuously operating independent pharmacies in the nation. It’s been operated by two families since a young pharmacist named George Royer bought the business in 1879. Company officials cited the age of the owners and decreasing insurance reimbursements that made it difficult to remain in business. “It’s been a great run,” Royer President Donald Sherman said in a news release. Royer said patient files will be transferred to CVS after the stores close by March 18, and employees would be considered for jobs at the nationwide chain. Royer had locations in Ephrata, Lancaster, Akron and Leola.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state’s highest court has refused to hear a strip club’s appeal of a punishment the city had levied against it over allegations of prostitution. The Rhode Island Supreme Court on Thursday rejected the Wild Zebra’s bid to have its adult entertainment license restored. The court did not explain why it would not consider the appeal. The Providence Board of Licenses heard testimony in January from two detectives who said that while undercover at the Wild Zebra Gentlemen’s Club in May dancers offered to have sex with them or perform sexual acts on them in exchange for money. The club denies the allegations of prostitution. An attorney for the club didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Providence Journal. The Providence board stripped the Wild Zebra of its liquor and adult entertainment licenses. A state regulatory department gave the club its liquor license back while it pursues its appeal, but it has remained closed.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: With spring just around the corner, emergency officials in the state say it’s time to begin preparing for severe weather. Gov. Henry McMaster declared this week South Carolina Severe Weather and Flood Safety week. Emergency officials will work all week with the National Weather Service to give safety and preparation tips for floods, tornadoes and severe storms that became more likely as the weather warms. On Wednesday, there will be a statewide tornado drill as schools and businesses across the state are asked to take shelter under their tornado safety plans and as forecasters test weather radios and other devices programmed to go off when a tornado warning is issued. Emergency officials are also pushing for flood safety. Flash floods after massive rains in October 2015 killed 19 people in South Carolina.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: State wildlife officials have decided to scale back Gov. Kristi Noem’s program that pays bounties for predators that raid migratory birds’ nests. KELO-TV reports the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission voted 6-2 on Friday to extend the program for a second year. But the commission reduced the spending cap from $500,000 to $250,000. It also reduced the size of the bounty from $10 per tail from a raccoon, striped skunk, opossum, red fox or badger to $5 per tail. Bounties will now be paid regardless of whether the predator is shot or trapped; last year bounties applied only if a predator was trapped. The program starts April 1 and runs through July 1. Only South Dakota residents can participate. Chairman Gary Jensen and Mary Anne Boyd were the only two commissioners who voted against continuing the program. Jensen said science doesn’t support the program, and it’s designed to help trappers, whom he says are doing well anyway.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: The Tennessee Valley Authority plans to move toxin-laden coal ash from a retired plant in the city to an off-site landfill, at the cost of roughly $300 million, the federal utility said Friday. TVA is considering six landfills in the South after it decided to move 3.5 million cubic yards of coal ash – the byproduct of burning coal for power – from the old Allen Fossil Plant in south Memphis, rather than keep the material in place. The TVA said it prefers taking the coal ash to an offsite landfill rather than moving it to a processing facility because construction and operation of the facility would delay economic development of the Allen site and lead to issues with air and noise emissions, safety risks and public disruption, the TVA said in an environmental impact report. Removal would cost about $300 million and take about seven to 10 years, TVA spokesman Scott Brooks said.\n\nTexas\n\nSanta Fe: A teenager accused of fatally shooting 10 people at a high school in 2018 was able to buy more than 100 rounds of ammunition online because his age was not verified, according to a lawsuit alleging the website involved broke federal law. Dimitrios Pagourtzis was a 17-year-old junior at the time of the May 2018 shooting at Santa Fe High School. Federal law prohibits minors from purchasing handgun ammunition and bars licensed gun companies from selling handgun or shotgun ammunition to minors or anyone they have reason to believe is under the age of 21. According to an amended lawsuit filed Thursday, Pagourtzis initially ordered 50 rounds of hollow-point handgun ammunition and 105 rounds of 12-gauge shotgun ammunition, the Houston Chronicle reports. Two weeks later, he purchased an additional 35 rounds of shotgun ammunition – both times from the website Luckygunner.com that did not require him to make an account, submit proof of age or set-up a secure two-step authorization, the filing said.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A slimmed-down version of a measure to require warning labels on pornography passed the state Senate on Friday. The proposal would now mandate a one-sentence warning label for online or print material deemed legally obscene, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. A relatively small slice of porn is considered obscene, but that hardcore material has fewer constitutional protections. The label would say that “exposing minors to obscene material may damage or negatively impact minors.” A website could also embed in its metadata the searchable text, “utahobscenitywarning.” The porn industry has objected to the plan, saying it could have constitutional problems and open the floodgates for lawsuits. If it does not appear on a print publication or is not displayed for 15 seconds online, producers could be fined $2,500 for each civil violation.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Three out of about a dozen Vermont towns passed resolutions on Town Meeting Day to become Second Amendment “sanctuary” towns, supporting gun rights and opposing more state and federal gun control laws, organizers said. About a half-dozen towns where the resolution was proposed did not take up the measure on Town Meeting Day on Tuesday because officials did not feel it was appropriate for the setting, said Eric Davis, president of Gun Rights Vermont. Lowell, Eden and Whittingham passed the resolution, he said. The town of Barton rejected the proposal. The voice vote Tuesday was close, Town Clerk Kristin Atwood told the Caledonian Record. Select boards in the towns of Holland and Pittsford adopted the resolution to become sanctuary towns earlier this year. The resolutions are not legally binding.\n\nVirginia\n\nHampton: Three black astronauts joined hundreds of other mourners Saturday at a memorial service for pioneering African American mathematician and NASA researcher Katherine Johnson. Johnson, who calculated rocket trajectories and Earth orbits for NASA’s early space missions and was later portrayed in the 2016 film “Hidden Figures,” about pioneering black female aerospace workers, died Feb. 24 at the age of 101. More than 700 people turned out for Saturday’s memorial service at the Hampton University Convocation Center. “I think about the journey that she’s going on now,” astronaut Leland Melvin said. “We can’t calculate the speed that she’s traveling to get to heaven.” Melvin was joined by fellow astronauts Yvonne Cagle and Mae Jemison, the first black woman in space. Johnson was remembered not just as a pioneering researcher but as a faithful church leader and family matriarch. “Grandma, because of you, our world will forever be unlimited,” grandson Michael Moore said. “And because of you, I have no bounds.”\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: The state has become the 10th to prohibit homicide defendants from claiming a defense based on panic over a victim’s sexual orientation or gender identity. Gov. Jay Inslee signed the measure Thursday. It takes effect in June. Nine other states – California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Nevada, New Jersey New York and Rhode Island – have already banned the use of gay or transgender panic as a legal defense. The Washington state measure is named after Nikki Kuhnhausen, a transgender teen who was killed last year, The Columbian reports. It was approved with bipartisan support in the state House and the Senate, though some lawmakers questioned if the legislation was necessary since a panic defense has never been used in Washington.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Foster parents who adopt children with special needs may soon get more money under a wide-ranging proposal passed Friday by the state Senate to reduce the state’s overburdened foster system. Senators voted unanimously to approve the proposal. It now moves back to the House of Delegates for that chamber to approve the Senate’s amendments. The measure directs state officials to expand a tiered system that would give higher payments to people who take in children with emotional, behavioral or intellectual problems. It sets aside $16.9 million for the payment system. The tiered system would have to be up and running by July 2021. Child-placing agencies would also get $1,000 every time they finalize an adoption.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSpring Green: The school that architect Frank Lloyd Wright started nearly 90 years ago may stay open after all. The board of the School of Architecture at Taliesin announced in January that the school would close in June because the board and the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation, the school’s biggest financial supporter, had failed to come up with a way to keep the school open. The foundation said then that the school lacked a sustainable business model. The Wisconsin State Journal reports the board voted Thursday to keep the school open in light of new funding. The decision to remain open is still subject to approval by the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation. The foundation issued a statement Friday saying it has little information about the new funding sources. Board Chairman Dan Schweiker said new supporters have come forward.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Jackson Hole’s largest elk herd is thriving and appears to have grown slightly over the past year after hunters had a historically tough time finding animals and filling tags. Wyoming Game and Fish Department harvest data for 2019 estimates that 794 hunters who targeted zones roamed by the Jackson Elk Herd found success and filled their freezer, according to the Jackson Hole News & Guide. “That’s about half of what it normally is,” Game and Fish wildlife biologist Aly Courtemanch said. “Usually, there’s more like 1,500 or 1,600 elk harvested, both bulls and cows.” The 30-year average harvest in the Jackson Herd is 2,098 elk, though the kill hasn’t surpassed 2,000 since the early 2000s – when the herd size started shrinking by design. Fall 2019 elk hunts were slow across the board.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/03/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/07/24/hemingway-champ-tribal-powwow-baby-box-salvation-news-around-states/50522975/", "title": "50 States", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Alabama’s unemployment rate dropped to 2.6% in June, marking the third straight month with a record low for the state. The rate, which dropped one-tenth of a percentage point from May, represented 60,388 people without jobs statewide, a record low, according to a statement by Gov. Kay Ivey. More than 2.2 million people were working in the state, an increase of about 5,300 from a month earlier.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy is expected this week to sign legislation to formally recognize tribes in the state. The Alaska Federation of Natives announced the bill signing would take place Thursday. Shannon Mason, a Dunleavy spokesperson, confirmed the timing. The measure, from state Rep. Tiffany Zulkosky, D-Bethel, passed the Legislature in May. Supporters of the bill have called it an overdue step that would create opportunities for the state and tribes to work together. The Alaska Federation of Natives said the measure “does not impact the existing legal status of Alaska Tribes, nor does it change the state’s responsibility or authority. However, it does recognize Alaska’s Indigenous people. This recognition will help unify our tribal governments with the state government.”\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: A judge has dismissed Gov. Doug Ducey’s lawsuit challenging the Biden administration’s demands the state stop sending millions in federal COVID-19 relief money to schools that don’t have mask requirements or that close because of COVID-19 outbreaks. The state filed the lawsuit earlier this year after the U.S. Treasury Department demanded Ducey either restructure the $163 million program to eliminate restrictions it said undermine public health recommendations or face a repayment demand. The Treasury Department also wanted changes to a $10 million program Ducey created that gives private school tuition money to parents if their children’s schools have mask mandates.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Lawmakers took back the authority they gave for the state to distribute about $460 million in remaining federal COVID-19 relief funds to school districts, saying they want schools to use the money for teacher and staff bonuses. The move faced opposition from Democrats who said it was an effort to avoid considering raising teacher salaries while the state sits on a $1.6 billion surplus. It was also criticized by Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who said lawmakers didn’t have authority to take such a step. The Legislative Council voted to rescind the appropriation for the federal funds, and recommended schools use the money for bonuses. The council said the districts’ plans for spending the money will now have to go before a legislative panel. The council recommended districts use the funds to provide $5,000 one-time bonuses to teachers and $2,500 to staff.\n\nCalifornia\n\nJerseydale: A destructive wildfire near Yosemite National Park burned out of control through tinder-dry forest on Sunday and had grown into one of California’s largest blazes of the year, forcing thousands of residents to flee remote mountain communities. About 2,000 firefighters battled the fire, along with aircraft and bulldozers, facing tough conditions that includes steep terrain, sweltering temperatures and low humidity, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire. Crews on the ground protected homes as air tankers dropped retardant on 50-foot flames racing along ridgetops east of the small community of Jerseydale. Light winds blew embers ahead into tree branches “and because it’s so dry, it’s easy for the spot fires to get established and that’s what fuels the growth,” Fouts said. The fire erupted Friday southwest of the park near the town of Midpines in Mariposa County. Officials described “explosive fire behavior” on Saturday as flames made runs through bone-dry vegetation caused by the worst drought in decades. By Sunday the blaze had consumed more than 22 square miles of forest land, with no containment, Cal Fire said. The cause was under investigation. Evacuations were in place for more than 6,000 people living across a several-mile span of the sparsely populated area in the Sierra Nevada foothills, though a handful of residents defied the orders and stayed behind, said Adrienne Freeman with the U.S. Forest Service.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: The West Nile virus was detected in trapped mosquitoes in the southeast and southwest parts of the city, the Larimer County health department said in a news release. As of Tuesday, there are no human cases of West Nile virus, the health department. In humans, West Nile symptoms can range from none to severe (fever, nausea, vomiting, muscle weakness, aches, rash and headaches) and appear three to 14 days after infection, the health department said. One percent of people might develop a serious, neuroinvasive form of the disease, said Dr. Paul Mayer, medical officer with the Larimer County Department of Health and Environment. Larimer County began monitoring for West Nile virus in early June. Monitoring is done through a partnership with the cities in Larimer County, Vector Disease Control International and Colorado State University. The peak West Nile season is generally in July and August.

The legislation, which increases funding for the initiative, raises the MSRP cap for eligible purchased and leased battery electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and fuel cell electric vehicles to $50,000. In turn, state residents who meet certain income requirements can qualify for up to $9,500 in incentives, depending on the type of vehicle. The new law will also usher in the state’s first electric bike voucher program. Dykes said the first public meeting was held this week to gather input on how to design the initiative. Additionally, the state agency has begun crafting a plan for distributing $20 million for electric school buses – spending that’s expected to trigger federal funding, as well. Meanwhile, the state is making up to $4 million available to public and private entities to purchase and install light-duty charting stations. The funding came from a 2018 settlement between the federal Environmental Protection Agency and Volkswagen for violations of the Clean Air Act.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Members of the local Nanticoke Lenni-Lenape tribe gathered with other Indigenous peoples from the region to hold a powwow in the atrium of the Delaware Art Museum. Non-native people were invited to attend and, in some cases, participate in the cultural celebration. They were also encouraged to support local Indigenous artists who came to sell jewelry, shawls, bags and even bows and arrows. “This is not something to exploit,” said Iz Balleto, community engagement specialist at the museum. “We just wanted to build that bridge with the tribes that have been forgotten here in Delaware.” Social powwows are important to Indigenous peoples, Nanticoke Chief Natosha Carmine said. They’re an opportunity to see family and friends, as well as to provide education on their tribe’s history and customs.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington:DC Health said appointments have been made available to 5,500 people on a waiting list for the monkeypox vaccine, WUSA-TV reported. Before that announcement, DC Health said it received 8,300 doses of the JYENNOS vaccine and administered approximately 2,600. “Individuals will have 48 hours to claim their appointment,” DC Health tweeted at 10:14 a.m. Saturday. “Residents who did not receive an appointment invitation (last) week will stay in the system until an appointment becomes available.” According to CDC data last updated on Friday, there are 110 monkeypox cases in D.C., the highest number per capita in the U.S. D.C. makes up about 6% of the monkeypox cases across the United States, averaging about eight new cases a day.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: Jon Auvil defeated 124 other contestants Saturday night to win the annual Ernest Hemingway Look-Alike Contest at Sloppy Joe’s Bar, the Key West establishment where the author was a regular patron during his decadelong residence on the island in the 1930s. The look-a-like contest is a highlight of Key West’s annual Hemingway Days celebration, which ended Sunday. Auvil said he shares Hemingway’s passion for fishing, has written some fiction and would like to do more writing. “Every man wants to write like Hemingway,” said Auvil, who lives in Dade City, Florida, northeast of Tampa. While living in Key West, Hemingway wrote classics, including “For Whom the Bell Tolls” and “To Have and Have Not.”\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Police are investigating a late-night vehicle accident at Ellis Square that injured five people Saturday. A few minutes before 8 p.m., an elderly man accidentally drove his four-door Ford F-150 truck onto the square, police said. About 9 p.m., police arrived at the scene and found five people injured – two adult pedestrians with serious injuries and two juveniles with nonlife-threatening injuries. One person refused emergency services care. The four injured people were transported to Memorial University Medical Center, according to Chatham Emergency Services. Ellis Square is a popular spot for both tourists and residents visiting the restaurants, bars and clubs along City Market and Congress Street.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: An active-duty U.S. Marine accused in the stabbing death of his wife is in custody and facing a second-degree murder charge. The Honolulu Police Department said Saturday that Bryant Tejeda-Castillo was being held on $1 million bail. Police said he was captured shortly after the Wednesday killing of 27-year-old Dana Alotaibi along a freeway. Police said he was taken to the Queen’s Medical Center in Honolulu with what one witness said were several self-inflicted wounds. Alotaibi’s friends said she was pregnant, but police said they are awaiting autopsy results. A police spokesman on Saturday said he didn’t know if Tejeda-Castillo remained at the hospital or had been transferred elsewhere. Tejeda-Castillo was arrested on a warrant of second-degree murder.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state will spend $1 million to fight illegal fentanyl use and resulting overdose deaths, Gov. Brad Little said. The Republican governor said he will likely recommend additional money in his budget that will be considered by lawmakers early next year. But he said urgent action is needed now for the fentanyl problem that law enforcement officials said can spur property crimes, as well as crimes against individuals. The money will be used for testing equipment to increase the ability of police to find fentanyl. It will also be used for a media campaign to alert Idaho residents to the dangers of fentanyl, a cheap but potent synthetic opioid that has been behind a major increase in overdose deaths in the U.S. It has been increasingly cut into other drugs, often without the buyers’ knowledge, leading to overdose deaths. As little as 2 milligrams of fentanyl can be lethal. The drug is 100 times more potent than morphine.\n\nIllinois\n\nNaperville: The National Weather Service confirmed a small tornado touched down in suburban Chicago. Snapped trees and minor damage to roofs in Naperville were reported Saturday, meteorologist Todd Kluber said. The tornado touched down about 5:40 a.m. and was part of thunderstorms that rolled through the Chicago area overnight. Wind gusts reached 58 mph at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport, Kluber said. Multiple gas leaks in a Naperville commercial building also were reported and about 250 utility customers temporarily lost power, the city said in a release. About a dozen roads were blocked by fallen trees or branches. No injuries were reported.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to be in Indianapolis on Monday for the start of the General Assembly’s special session to debate a near-total ban on abortion. Harris’s office confirmed to the Indianapolis Star on Friday the vice president would “meet with state legislators and leaders to discuss the fight to protect reproductive rights” on the first day of the special session in a roundtable discussion. Senate Republicans have proposed banning abortions in the state, except in cases of rape or incest, when the mother’s life is in danger or when the fetus has a fatal anomaly. Should it pass, it would make Indiana home to one of the most restrictive abortion laws in the country. Seven other states ban abortion at zero weeks.\n\nIowa\n\nUrbandale: Hallie Koenigs, a 4-year-old cancer patient from Riceville, was gifted a pink boat in front of the Make-A-Wish Iowa office in Urbandale. Koenigs loves fishing, and goes on a fishing trip every August with her siblings and parents, Allen and Kacie. The project came together with the help of many community members, including a volunteer who traveled to the upper peninsula of Michigan to pick up the boat, Vision Signs, which provided the custom pink vinyl, and Scheels, which provided Hallie with all the fishing gear she would need.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka:The Shawnee County Commission accepted RailWorks Track Services’ $129,000 bid to make repairs and improvements to the Gage Park mini-train tracks, ties and culverts damaged by severe thunderstorms. The money will come from the building maintenance fund. Repairs include railroad ties, spikes, rails, ballasts and soil work.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Gov. Andy Beshear will miss next month’s Fancy Farm picnic for the second straight year. Beshear said in a social media post Friday that he and his wife, first lady Britainy Beshear, will visit Israel in August. The governor said the trip will conflict with the annual political picnic in western Kentucky, which this year falls on Aug. 6. Democrats are expected to be scarce at this year’s picnic, with Republicans dominating most state and federal offices. U.S. Senate candidate Charles Booker is the only Democrat who has committed to attend. Kentucky’s two Republican U.S. senators, Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul, have not yet committed to attending the picnic. Paul is seeking a third term in the U.S. Senate and will face Booker in the fall. The picnic – also known for its barbecue – draws large crowds and is a rite of passage for statewide candidates in Kentucky.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Teachers of English, math, science and social studies are eligible for a $7,500 hiring bonus in the East Baton Rouge Parish school district. The move came as the system continues to struggle to staff schools for the upcoming year. On Thursday, the district reported 233 vacant positions, 110 of which were in the core subject areas, The Advocate reported. “This proposal will give us a competitive edge against neighboring parishes offering similar sign-on bonuses,” Nichola Hall, chief human resources officer, wrote in a memo. Hall said the bonus will go only to teachers hired between May 24 and Aug. 5. To be eligible, in addition to teaching in a core subject, the teachers must have a current teaching license and commit in writing to stay with the school system for three years. The parish School Board on Thursday voted 7-1 in favor of the new hiring bonus. The school system is proposing spending almost $1.1 million for the bonuses, which will cover more than 100 teachers. The funding will come from federal COVID-19 relief money.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: A Maine-based sporting goods chain that once had more than 200 stores on the East Coast is shuttering its remaining 35 stores. Olympia Sports confirmed the stores would close by the end of September and that liquidation sales had begun at all locations. Olympia Sports was founded in 1975 by Edward Manganello, who opened his first store at the Maine Mall in South Portland. By 2013, it had 226 locations from Maine to Virginia, the Portland Press Herald reported. Denver-based running and active lifestyle brand JackRabbit bought the company in 2019. JackRabbit, owned by a private equity firm, was sold in December to North Carolina-based Fleet Feet. An email to Fleet Feet on Saturday was not immediately returned.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Republican Gov. Larry Hogan said he won’t support the GOP gubernatorial nominee, Dan Cox, whom he once again described as a “Q-Anon” whack job.” Hogan blamed the Democratic Governors Association and former President Donald Trump for Cox’s victory in Tuesday’s primary over Kelly Schulz, who was a cabinet secretary in Hogan’s administration. The DGA spent large amounts of money on ads that described Cox as “too conservative for Maryland” and highlighted his connections to Trump – ads that might well have bolstered Cox’s appeal to GOP primary voters. Hogan, who appeared Sunday on ABC’s “This Week” and CNN’s “State of the Union,” said Cox’s victory is “a win for the Democrats” because Cox has no chance of defeating Democratic nominee Wes Moore in November in a state where Democrats have a huge natural advantage. Although Hogan said he won’t vote for Cox, he said he’s unsure if he will vote for Moore.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Massachusetts Democratic U.S. Rep. Seth Moulton is calling for changes in the way the Boston-area public transit system operates after a fire on a train prompted one passenger to jump into a river and others to scramble out of windows. No one was injured Thursday morning when the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority’s inbound Orange Line train caught fire while on a bridge crossing the Mystic River just north of Boston on approach to the Assembly station in Somerville. The fire appears to have been caused by a metal panel on the train’s base that came loose and touched the electrified third rail, the system’s general manager said. Moulton told WCVB-TV on Friday that “it’s a total embarrassment and “we’ve got to change it.” Moulton, a member of the House transportation committee, said he doesn’t want the federal government to have to take over. The 43-year-old train car that caught fire had been inspected less than a month ago, which included an inspection of the panel that came loose, according to the MBTA. After the fire, the same panel on every other in-service Orange Line car was inspected, and no issues were found, the agency said. The investigation is ongoing.\n\nMichigan\n\nGrand Rapids: The practice of fingerprinting people without probable cause or a warrant is unconstitutional, the Michigan Supreme Court said Friday. The court unanimously said Grand Rapids police violated the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable search and seizure. “The fingerprinting of each of the plaintiffs in these cases constituted a physical trespass onto a person’s body, a constitutionally protected area,” Justice Richard Bernstein wrote. The incidents involved two Black teenagers in 2011 and 2012, though the American Civil Liberties Union said photos and fingerprints were taken from thousands of people in Grand Rapids. The city has dropped the practice, but defended fingerprinting as a way to determine someone’s identity when they had no identification. Police also took photos.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Xcel Energy has started gathering public input on its plan to build one of the state’s largest transmission line projects in recent years. The utility company has proposed building a 140-mile power line that would run from Becker in the north to Lyon County to the south. The $500 million line would connect several new renewable energy projects. “The purpose of this line is to unlock renewable energy from a very renewable rich jurisdiction – wind and solar both,” said Michael Lamb, Xcel’s senior vice president for transmission. If the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission approves the project, Lamb estimated it would be completed by 2027 to 2028. The regulatory, engineering and construction process for a large new power line is lengthy. This week, Xcel started contacting landowners, local governments, environmental groups and others impacted by the power line to get their input before determining the line’s final route.\n\nMississippi\n\nBrandon: A park by a central Mississippi reservoir will be named for Bobby Cleveland, a longtime outdoors writer who promoted events there after he retired from journalism. The governing board for the Ross Barnett Reservoir has voted unanimously that Lakeshore Park will become the Bobby Cleveland Park at Lakeshore, the Clarion Ledger reported. “He was a very devoted champion of the reservoir,” general manager John Sigman said of Cleveland. The park is in Rankin County, a few miles northwest of Jackson. Cleveland, 67, died after a traffic accident April 28 as he was leaving the park. His memorial service was held there days later. The Hattiesburg native was well-known in Mississippi for his decades as the outdoors writer for the Clarion Ledger. Cleveland lived near the reservoir and fished in it often. After he left the newspaper in 2012, be became the spokesman for the Pearl River Valley Water Supply District, the state agency that manages the reservoir. Sigman said the request to rename the park was presented by the Barnett Reservoir Foundation, an organization for which Cleveland had been secretary.\n\nMissouri\n\nColumbia: Community members again are urging the City Council to take action on getting the city to use 100% renewable resources for energy production by 2030. The appeal was made last week during a City Council meeting at which the 2022 Columbia Water and Light Renewable Energy Plan report was accepted following a public hearing. A petition with nearly 3,000 signatures was delivered in May to the council requesting it ramp up renewable energy efforts. Among speakers Monday was Carolyn Amparan of the CoMO 100% by 2030 Coalition and the Sierra Club, who helped deliver the petitions in May. “We keep missing the targets,” Amparan said about renewable energy capacity goals by the city. “We shouldn’t just plan to make exactly 15% or 25%.” Other speakers urged the city to negotiate more renewable energy contracts and get out from its coal-powered plant contracts.\n\nMontana\n\nBillings: A federal lawsuit has been filed against the Interior Department and its Bureau of Indian Affairs, saying the U.S. is not complying with its treaty obligation to provide adequate law enforcement services on the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation. The lawsuit filed Tuesday in Billings argued the federal government does not provide enough federal law enforcement officers, drug investigators, missing persons investigators or jail space, even though violent crime has increased on the reservation, The Billings Gazette reported. “Public safety on-reservation is severely compromised due to the lack of meaningful BIA law enforcement presence in our communities,” Northern Cheyenne Tribe President Serena Wetherelt said in a statement. The officers also lack of understanding of tribal and federal law, which leads to suspects not being charged or prosecuted, the lawsuit said. Reports of violent crime on the reservation increased 50% from 2019 to 2020 and does not include crimes that went unreported, the lawsuit said. The Interior Department declined Friday to comment about the lawsuit, spokesperson Tyler Cherry said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State Attorney General Doug Peterson said he will not file criminal charges against fellow Republican and former state lawmaker Mike Groene over photos the ex-lawmaker surreptitiously took of an aide. There is not enough information from the results of a State Patrol investigation to warrant criminal charges against Groene, a spokeswoman for Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson said Thursday. Groene, of North Platte, resigned from office earlier this year after acknowledging he photographed his legislative aide in his office without her knowledge. The former staffer, Kristina Konecko, said in a complaint to the Legislature’s Executive Board she discovered the photos on Groene’s laptop, which he had given her to update. She said some of the photos included close-ups of body parts. Groene, a blunt-spoken, often abrasive Republican who clashed with Democratic colleagues, also ended his candidacy to become a University of Nebraska Regent after the scandal came to light.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: The state posted record job numbers last month that showed several key industries have risen above their pre-pandemic employment levels. The record of 1,452,600 jobs was 3,000 more than the previous peak in February 2020. Nevada added 7,600 jobs last month. The employment numbers were announced Friday by Gov. Steve Sisolak, who said in a statement the state had recovered “all of the jobs that were lost during the COVID pandemic, and doing so in a way that has more Nevadans working in better-paying jobs than before the pandemic.” The Las Vegas Review Journal reported the state’s leisure and hospitality sector, which includes casinos, is still lagging behind at 90.7% of its pre-pandemic peak. But other industries have risen above their previous peaks to pull the rest of the state up. Nevada’s unemployment rate fell to 4.7% but remains one of the worst in the country.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Republican Gov. Chris Sununu signed seven bills into law last week, including a Senate bill designed to require health care facilities to implement and maintain workplace violence prevention programs and establish a health care workplace safety commission, according to his office. Lawmakers began working to create the new requirements after the death of a hospital security guard who was assaulted at work in December 2020. Richard Semo, 64, of Farmington died from injuries sustained in an attack in the parking lot of Frisbie Memorial Hospital in Rochester. The man who attacked him pleaded guilty to negligent homicide in 2021. Sununu held a bill signing Friday outside the hospital. Tim Jones, chief executive officer of Frisbie Memorial Hospital, spoke about Semo. Jones also told the governor that health care workers deal with abuse far too often, and there has been an increase in verbal and physical assaults nationwide during the pandemic, according to the Fosters Daily Democrat. Health facilities that are considered urgent care centers must comply with the new state requirement by July 1, 2024.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Gas prices are continuing their summertime slide with double-digit reductions in New Jersey amid a decline in demand and a drop in oil prices. AAA Mid-Atlantic said the average price of a gallon of regular gas in New Jersey on Friday was $4.51, down 12 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.17 a gallon on average a year ago at this time. The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $4.41, down 16 cents from last week. Drivers were paying $3.15 a gallon on average a year ago at this time. Analysts said “global economic headwinds” are pushing oil prices down and U.S. drivers “are fueling up less despite this being the height of the traditional summer driving season.”\n\nNew Mexico\n\nHobbs: City commissioners took a step toward saving the lives of unwanted newborns at a recent meeting by voting to install a baby box. The vote was spurred by the case of Alexis Avila, who was caught on surveillance camera in early January throwing her infant – who was tied in a plastic bag – into a dumpster behind a retail shopping mall in near-freezing weather. Dumpster divers found the newborn – six hours later, and still alive. Because of that incident, commissioners approved a resolution in support of installing a surrender safety device at Hobbs Fire Station 1, otherwise known as the “Safe Haven Site,” and authorizing the city to seek funding for the installation and maintenance of the device from the state. Commissioners in February had made amendments to the Hobbs Safe Haven for Infants Act, the Hobbs News-Sun reported. Those changes allowed for the surrendering of infants, 90 days or less in age, to be surrendered via a “safety device” or “baby box” without parental fear of criminal prosecution. According to Hobbs Fire Chief Barry Young, the Safe Haven baby box is a much needed asset for Hobbs and surrounding areas.\n\nNew York\n\nRochester:A man accused of attacking GOP gubernatorial candidate Lee Zeldin during a recent campaign rally told investigators he had been drinking that day and didn’t know who the congressman was, authorities said as the man was arrested on a federal assault charge Saturday. David Jakubonis, 43, made an initial court appearance Saturday before a federal magistrate judge in Rochester on a single count of assaulting a member of Congress with a dangerous weapon. The charge carries a potential maximum penalty of 10 years in prison. He was ordered held until a bail hearing in federal court Wednesday. Prosecutors said he should remain detained as a flight risk and is dangerous, according to a court filing. Assistant federal public defender Steven Slawinski, representing Jakubonis, said in an email to The Associated Press he planned to ask the judge to release Jakubonis from custody. Jakubonis was arraigned Friday on a separate state charge of attempted assault in the second degree and was released by a local judge. That prompted criticism from Zeldin and other Republicans who held it up as an example of the need to reform New York’s bail laws, something Zeldin has called upon Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul to toughen.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nKenly: The city’s police force has resigned over what it called a hostile work environment. Police Chief Josh Gibson said he and four other officers turned in their two-week notices late Wednesday afternoon, news outlets reported. Gibson said utilities clerk Christy Jones and assistant town manager Sharon Evans also resigned. WRAL reported the police force usually has eight officers, but only had five on the force when the resignations occurred. Gibson, who had been with the department for 21 years, said officers couldn’t perform their duties because of the environment that was created by town manager Justine Jones, who took the job at the beginning of June. In their resignation letters, the employees cited a “hostile,” “toxic” and stressful work environment. Jones declined comment on the resignations. Kenly, with a population of approximately 2,400, is about 45 miles southeast of Raleigh.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state has renewed its request to throw out a federal lawsuit brought by two Native American tribes that alleged the state’s new legislative map dilutes tribal members’ voting strength. The state said in court papers filed Thursday it denies allegations by the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa and the Spirit Lake Tribe. U.S. District Judge Peter Welte dismissed the state’s argument earlier this month that the tribes lacked the standing to sue. The Republican-controlled Legislature during its special session last fall approved a new map of legislative districts, based on updated census data. The map includes new House subdistricts for the Fort Berthold and Turtle Mountain Indian reservations. Turtle Mountain argued the split House district “packs” tribal members into a single subdistrict on its reservation, while diluting their vote in the nonreservation subdistrict. Spirit Lake alleged the new redistricting map dilutes American Indian voters on and near its reservation. The case could go to trial next year if no resolution is reached, according to court filings.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus:A project to improve electric power capacity is underway on the city’s south side, near the future site of a Google data center. Known as the Parsons Avenue Transmission Project, the endeavor is aimed at improving electrical service for area residents and upcoming development, according to an American Electric Power Outreach Specialist Brian Recker, who added the project will benefit residents and a “future AEP customer” coming to the area, but he would not name the customer. Two substations, one of them new, will be located just north of a $300 million Google data center being built on a portion of the former Hartman Farm, located on the east of South High Street, south of Rathmell Road, west of Parsons Avenue and north of nearby Scioto Downs. It is expected to be completed by the end of 2025 and employ 20 people.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City:Oklahoma County’s $260 million bond package is supposed to help fund a new sheriff’s office in addition to a new jail facility, according to the ballot language and information from county officials, but the sale of the current office is on hold because of contract issues. Financing for the new sheriff’s office came through proceeds from the sale of the current building paired with a portion of the recently passed bond package. District 2 Commissioner Brian Maughan said the project won’t affect the ability to finance the new jail because the county will still be able to shift funds around from its general budget once it is able to apply federal COVID-19 relief funds to other projects.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: Portland State University announced a tuition discount for any student from a federally recognized Native American tribe. Starting this fall, students who are members of the country’s nearly 600 federally recognized tribes across the country will receive in-state tuition, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported. PSU noted in its announcement that it already offers support for students from Indigenous backgrounds including scholarships, programs and student groups through its Native American Student and Community Center. The discounted tuition will be offered starting this fall term to students who can provide their official tribal residency documentation to PSU. The university does not require any other information to be considered for the discount. The difference between in-state and out-of-state tuition is roughly $420 per credit hour or about $19,000 per academic year for students enrolled in 15 credits, according to PSU.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A state trooper has been charged with felony animal cruelty after hitting a loose horse with a patrol vehicle multiple times and pinning it to the pavement, where it was then euthanized, authorities said Friday. Cpl. Michael Perillo was suspended without pay after the charges were filed by the state police internal affairs division, officials announced. His bail was set at $50,000 during his arraignment Friday on two felony counts of aggravated animal cruelty and one count of animal cruelty, a misdemeanor. It is not known whether he has an attorney who can speak on his behalf. A message left Friday for the union that represents troopers, the Pennsylvania State Troopers Association, was not immediately returned. Perillo responded to a call to police Dec. 28 involving a horse on a highway in Chester County, west of Philadelphia. The horse was on the road’s shoulder in Lower Oxford Township and had been struck by a motorist before troopers were sent, authorities said. Perillo drove a vehicle into the horse multiple times, causing it to fall, and then pinned the horse to the road, authorities said. Another trooper then euthanized it. Perillo, who enlisted in the state police in September 2006, is assigned to Troop J in Avondale.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Longtime Democratic U.S. Rep. Jim Langevin is naming two politicians who will be leaders on issues affecting Americans with disabilities as he prepares to retire from Congress. Langevin is holding an event Tuesday in Washington to mark the 32nd anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act, speak about the need for accessible transportation and name two new co-chairs of the House Bipartisan Disabilities Caucus. Langevin led the caucus with Republican co-chair and longtime Alaska congressman Don Young, who died in March. Langevin isn’t seeking a 12th term. Langevin, the first quadriplegic to serve in Congress, worked to create the caucus shortly after he got to Congress in 2001. Caucus members educate their colleagues and staff on issues affecting Americans with disabilities and their families, and work to ensure access to health care, housing, transportation, employment opportunities and disability benefits. Langevin said he is waiting until the event to announce the names.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The U.S. Senate confirmed Adair Ford Boroughs, a former congressional candidate and Columbia lawyer, to become the top federal prosecutor for South Carolina. The Senate approved the nomination by a voice vote of Ford Boroughs on Thursday as the state’s U.S. attorney. After the vote, Ford Boroughs tweeted, “I’m very excited to return to (the) DOJ and to work with an incredible team at the U.S. Attorney’s office.” President Joe Biden nominated Ford Boroughs, 42, for the position in June. Ford Boroughs’ nomination was quickly advanced by a Senate panel on July 14 with just two members – Missouri Republican Josh Hawley and Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn – opposed.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The sister of a St. Louis man who died while hiking in the Badlands of South Dakota said he was camping as part of a trip to celebrate graduating from college and got lost trying to find his way back to his car. The Pennington County Sheriff’s Office tweeted that 22-year-old Maxwell Right collapsed on an unmarked trail in Badlands National Park on Wednesday. He and a friend who was traveling with him had run out of water, according to the tweet. Temperatures in the Badlands had been approaching 100 degrees Fahrenheit during the first half of the week. Right’s sister, Lucille, said the National Park Service told the family that her brother died surrounded by rangers. Authorities have not identified his friend, who the sheriff’s office said was flown to a Rapid City hospital and placed under observation for exposure and dehydration. The sheriff’s office initially said in its tweet that the unmarked trail has been featured in a social media challenge, but later said the men were simply following a trail on a hiking app. Lucille Right said her brother and his friend weren’t taking part in any social media challenge, saying they were on a larger trip to celebrate Maxwell graduating from Missouri S&T and had planned to visit Mt. Rushmore on Wednesday night.\n\nTennessee\n\nChattanooga: Four inmates who escaped from the Silverdale Detention Center have been captured, the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office said. Officers discovered the inmates were missing during a headcount early Saturday in a minimum security housing unit, media outlets reported. The facility was placed on lockdown and officials determined the missing inmates had breached an exterior door and scaled the perimeter barbed wire fence. Two of the inmates, Johnny Bryant and William Atkins, were captured within a few hours at a motel, the sheriff’s office said. Hours after authorities requested the public’s help to locate Justin Lynn Conner and Trevor Lynn Hall, both inmates were taken into custody. Conner was found in Soddy Daisy, Tennessee, and Hall was found in Jackson County, Tennessee. Among the charges that Bryant and Atkins face include resisting arrest and felony escape. Conner faces charges that include possession of drug paraphernalia, possession of methamphetamine for resale/manufacturing, use of stolen plates, theft of property, criminal impersonation, theft of property over $2,500 and misdemeanor evading. Hall faces the following charges: contraband in a penal institution, evading arrest, theft of property and felony escape.\n\nTexas\n\nBig Bend National Park: Authorities said a 75-year-old Houston man died while hiking alone last week at Big Bend National Park. The body of the man was found Thursday about a half-mile from the start of a trail, according to Park Deputy Superintendent David Elkowitz. The man’s name was not immediately released by authorities. Officials were still trying to determine a cause of death but summer heat at the park can be extreme. On Thursday afternoon, temperatures along the trail where the man’s body was found exceeded 104 degrees Fahrenheit. Officials at the national park in west Texas said hikers need to be mindful of the dangers from the extreme heat and they should be prepared to carry and drink one gallon of water per day and should be off desert trails by noon.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George:A wildfire sparked by lightning near the Utah-Nevada border late Thursday grew to nearly 6,000 acres on Friday, driven by winds and dry conditions into Washington County and sending a plume of smoke over much of the surrounding area. The fire was first reported just before 3 p.m. Thursday, about 25 miles southeast of Caliente, Nev. It burned quickly toward the north and the east on Friday, moving into heavier vegetation in the Docs Pass wilderness area, according to the Eastern Nevada Interagency Fire group. No structures or private property were threatened as of late Friday. More than 150 Firefighters were assigned, along with several fire engines, bulldozers and other equipment, with aerial support from multiple heavy air tankers and a helicopter. The fire was 5% contained as of late Friday afternoon.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: A 42-year-old Nevada man pleaded guilty Friday in U.S. District Court in Burlington for his role in helping arrange the kidnapping and murder of a Vermont man stemming from a financial dispute. Aron Lee Ethridge is one of four men who have been charged in the kidnapping of Gregory Davis from his Danville home Jan. 6, 2018. Davis was found shot to death in a snowbank the next day. As part of a plea agreement, prosecutors and Ethridge’s defense attorney agreed to recommend a prison sentence of 27 years or less. The actual sentence, scheduled for December, will be up to the judge. Ethridge could be sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors said Ethridge arranged for Jerry Banks, 34, of Fort Garland, Colorado, to kidnap and then kill Davis. Banks allegedly called Ethridge the day after the kidnapping to inform him that Davis had been successfully kidnapped and killed. Banks has only been charged with kidnapping, but prosecutors alleged he killed Davis. He has pleaded not guilty and is being held pending trial.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Bodycam videos, police reports and other materials connected to the city’s aggressive response to protesters in June 2020 have been made public through the Library of Virginia. The database that went live recently is part of a legal settlement between the city and plaintiffs who said police used excessive force against protesters who gathered at the Robert E. Lee statue two years ago in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Police used tear gas to disperse the crowd ahead of an 8 p.m. curfew. The department later apologized and said the use of tear gas was unwarranted. A few days later, the city’s police chief resigned. Thomas H. Roberts, an attorney for some of the plaintiffs, said the archive will allow the public to judge for themselves how police responded. Members of the public will be able to contribute their own footage of what occurred to the archive.\n\nWashington\n\nSpokane: Authorities on Sunday issued an excessive heat watch for the Pacific Northwest region for coming days as potential record-breaking temperatures were forecast to settle in and linger until next weekend. Temperatures could break daily records in Seattle and other areas by Tuesday, potentially reaching their highest levels since last year’s heat wave that killed hundreds of people across the Pacific Northwest. Highs ranging from 95 to 110 were forecast for inland areas. An excessive heat watch was issued for central and eastern Washington state and the central Idaho Panhandle from Tuesday morning through Friday night.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s Vital Registration Office will be closed for sanitation Monday through Wednesday after staff tested positive for the coronavirus, officials said Friday. The Vital Registration Office is the state’s official repository of birth, death, marriage and divorce records. The state plans to reopen the Charleston office on Thursday, a West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources spokesperson said in a news release. Meanwhile, residents can go to their county clerk’s office to access certified copies of birth, death and marriage certificates, state officials said. Records can also be requested by mail or online.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: State Rep. Janel Brandtjen, R-Menomonee Falls, the leader of the Assembly elections committee, is calling for her colleagues to decertify President Joe Biden’s election victory in 2020, a move that prompted her counterpart in the Senate to call for her removal. Brandtjen, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump earlier this year, said Friday she was joining Republican candidate for governor Tim Ramthun’s push to overturn the last presidential election because “tyranny is at Wisconsin’s door.” Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Burlington has rejected such calls to do so. A spokeswoman for Vos did not answer whether Brandtjen, whom he appointed as chair of the Assembly’s elections committee, should continue to lead the panel. Sen. Kathy Bernier, R-Chippewa Falls, the chair of the Senate’s elections committee, said Brandtjen should be removed or step down from the committee. Bernier said the continued focus on 2020 through such claims hurts voter confidence needlessly.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Most abortions will become illegal in Wyoming on Wednesday after Gov. Mark Gordon gave the go-ahead Friday under a new state law. The law bans abortions except in cases of rape or incest or to protect the mother’s life or health, not including psychological conditions. The Wyoming Legislature approved the ban and Gordon signed it into law in March in anticipation that the U.S. Supreme Court could overturn Roe v. Wade. That happened June 24, kicking off a review by Attorney General Bridget Hill to make sure Wyoming’s law conforms to the Supreme Court ruling. Gordon certified the law to the Secretary of State’s Office after Hill completed her almost four-week review Thursday. “I believe that the decision to regulate abortion is properly left to the states,” Gordon said in a statement. “As a pro-life governor, my focus will continue to be on ensuring we are doing all we can to support Wyoming mothers, children and families.” Wyoming currently allows abortions until a fetus can survive outside its mother’s body, generally around 23 weeks. Wyoming has no abortion clinics but the procedure still occurs in other medical settings, with 98 in the state reported to the Wyoming Department of Health in 2021, up from 91 in 2020. The abortion ban will have an “immediate and devastating” effect on those in Wyoming who can become pregnant, the American Civil Liberties Union said in a statement. Organizers of a planned women’s health and abortion clinic in Casper have said they might contest the state abortion ban in court. An arson attack in May delayed the clinic’s expected mid-June opening.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/12/flying-goats-chile-duel-womens-world-cup-statue-news-around-states/39679669/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Cotton farmers in the state will face threats to their crops this year in the form of a new virus with no known cure. WSFA-TV reports cotton leafroll dwarf virus is a new strain of cotton blue disease. The Alabama Cooperative Extension System says the virus is transmitted by aphids and diminishes blooms and bolls in the upper canopy, resulting in lower yields, mainly in late-planted cotton. The new strain was discovered in Alabama in 2017 but has been observed in Brazil in 2006. It has since been confirmed in Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. The virus reduced cotton yields by nearly 50,000 bales in 2018. Alabama Farmers Federation’s Carla Hornady says symptoms include red leaf veins, cupped leaves and sterility, and it will likely take years to develop new, resistant cotton cultivars.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Legislature failed Wednesday to override budget vetoes by Gov. Mike Dunleavy that will prompt a massive 41% cut of state funding to the University of Alaska and lay waste to other programs the governor deemed unaffordable. More than a third of lawmakers missed the vote – many because of an ongoing dispute about where the Legislature should have met for the special session. Lawmakers needed 45 votes – a three-fourths majority of the 60 members of the state Senate and House – to override the vetoes by Dunleavy, a Republican who took office in December. The effort fell short with a 37-1 vote in Juneau. Only Rep. Tammie Wilson, a North Pole Republican, voted not to override. The special session began Monday, and the Legislature has until midnight Friday to again consider veto overrides.\n\nArizona\n\nSupai: For those hoping to score notoriously hard-to-get permits to visit Havasupai Falls, Beyonce may be making it even more difficult. The singer shot a music video Wednesday at the foot of Havasu Falls, TMZ reports, almost guaranteeing the in-demand destination at the bottom of the Grand Canyon will grow even more popular. According to TMZ, Beyonce, her daughter Blue Ivy and her crew flew in and out by helicopter, spending about five hours at Havasu Falls with the blessing of the Havasupai Tribe, which owns the land. The shoot likely inconvenienced hikers, as Beyonce and her crew were allowed exclusive access to the falls and its turquoise pools. The superstar’s visit emphasized the gap between the haves and have-nots. Campers must cross their fingers each Feb. 1 when permits for the upcoming year are released online. Demand typically overwhelms servers, and very few manage to secure reservations.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A group plans to begin gathering signatures soon to put a proposal to legalize recreational marijuana on the ballot in the state next year. The Drug Policy Education Group on Wednesday submitted a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow licensed dispensaries to sell marijuana for recreational use. Arkansas voters legalized medical marijuana in 2016, and dispensaries began selling it in May. The group also submitted a proposed amendment that would allow people convicted of low-level marijuana offenses to petition courts for relief, including release from incarceration and expungement of their conviction. The group has until July 3, 2020, to gather the needed 89,151 signatures from registered voters to qualify for the November 2020 election ballot. The state Board of Election Commissioners must also review the ballot measure’s wording.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPasadena: A statue capturing Brandi Chastain’s iconic reaction to scoring the U.S. team’s winning goal in the 1999 Women’s World Cup has been unveiled outside the Rose Bowl. Chastain was on hand for the unveiling Wednesday, the 20th anniversary of the historic win, which coincided with celebrations in New York for this year’s World Cup champion team. This year’s team sealed its second consecutive tournament win by beating the Netherlands 2-0 on Sunday. The statue shows Chastain at the moment she dropped to her knees in exultation, clutching the jersey she pulled off after cinching the win over China on a penalty kick in the game played at the Rose Bowl. The moment has been credited as a watershed for invigorating women’s sports.\n\nColorado\n\nWalden: Photos of what appears to be a black-colored wolf captured north of the town this week could be the first credible wolf sighting in the state in four years. Colorado Parks and Wildlife released images of the black animal wearing what appeared to be a radio collar around its neck. The photos were shot by a member of the public near the Colorado State Forest State Park. CPW biologists are working to confirm the sighting, as well as another recent sighting in Grand County. CPW spokesperson Rebecca Ferrell says she’s not sure if the photos were taken on public or private land. The animal is believed to have wandered into the state from Wyoming. Wolves were extirpated from the state in the 1940s mainly because of their depredation of livestock. But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has restored gray wolf populations in Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico and Arizona.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Renowned forensic scientist Henry Lee is defending work he did three decades ago. The state Supreme Court criticized Lee last month when it overturned the convictions of two men for a 1985 murder. The decision came after experts determined that stains on a towel that Lee had testified were consistent with blood were something else. Wendall Hasan has been in prison since 1986 for murder. His lawyers filed court papers Tuesday that he should be freed after more recent tests found no blood on a pair of sneakers Lee testified were bloodstained. Lee responded Thursday at a news conference that his testimony in that case was accurate, as was his testimony in two other cases. Lee says the blood sample likely was used up during his earlier testing.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: David Bromberg, a master of stringed-instrument Americana, says a deal to sell his massive collection of historic violins to the Library of Congress has fallen through. The local singer-songwriter and session musician has compiled a collection of 263 historic American violins over the years and, at 73, was hoping to sell it intact for $1.7 million as his retirement plan. Now he fears the collection will have to be broken up and sold separately. The Library of Congress announced in 2016 that it would buy the collection Bromberg spent 50 years curating. It even set up a center for their study. It would’ve been among the library’s largest instrument collections. Bromberg says library officials told him they now have other priorities.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The D.C. Council is considering legislation that would allow minors to run small-scale businesses such as lemonade stands without having to get a business license or permit. WTOP-FM reports Councilman Brandon Todd on Tuesday introduced the Lemonade Stand Amendment Act of 2019, which was co-sponsored by all the other members. The bill would allow minors to operate small businesses as long as the businesses are open for no more than 100 days and are reasonably distanced from licensed commercial businesses. Todd said harassment against entrepreneurial minors has become too common. As various states consider and enact similar legislation, Country Time Lemonade has also gotten into the mix and started a “Legal-Ade” to help pay for fines and permits.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: There’s a baby boom at Zoo Miami. The zoo announced on Facebook that six babies were born within a seven-day period to six different mothers. All of the new additions are female. The baby boom started July 2 with the birth of an addax. On July 5, a Grevy’s zebra was born, followed July 7 by a newborn Arabian oryx. The next day, another Grevy’s zebra and two giant elands were born. And the boom is continuing with another giant eland and a giraffe expected any day. Zoo officials say the addax was the 67th born at Zoo Miami. There are fewer than 100 of the African desert antelopes left in the Sahara, which makes the addax a critically endangered species.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge has ordered state election officials to allow computer experts and lawyers to review the databases used to create ballots and count votes. The ruling came Tuesday in the lawsuit filed by election integrity advocates and voters that challenges Georgia’s election system and seeks statewide use of hand-marked paper ballots. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg gave the state until Friday to turn over electronic copies of the databases to the plaintiffs’ lawyers and computer experts. The plaintiffs’ experts had said inspection of the databases was necessary to begin to evaluate security vulnerabilities and flaws. Lawyers for the state had argued disclosure of sensitive information in the databases could jeopardize the security of the election system. Totenberg wrote that they provided no evidence of that.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Construction on a giant telescope will start again next week after lengthy court battles and passionate protests from those who say building it on the island state’s tallest mountain will desecrate land sacred to some Native Hawaiians. State officials announced Wednesday that the road to the top of Mauna Kea mountain on the Big Island will be closed starting Monday as equipment is delivered. Scientists revere the mountain for its summit above the clouds that provides a clear view of the sky with very little air and light pollution. Astronomers say it will allow them to reach back 13 billion years to answer fundamental questions about the advent of the universe. The Thirty Meter Telescope project got approval to move forward last month. While it was the final legal step, opponents vowed to keep fighting and even get arrested if necessary to stop construction.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials say the city is installing facial recognition technology at its city halls to keep “banned people” out of the government buildings. Mayor David Bieter’s spokesman Mike Journee says the city will spend $52,000 to install the technology at Boise City Hall and City Hall West in an effort to identify people who enter either building in violation of legal no-contact orders. No one is currently banned from City Hall. Journee says the technology will likely be in use by the end of 2019. At least two U.S. cities have banned facial recognition technology over concerns that that the real-time surveillance technology could be misused or that it could violate civil rights. Journee says the facial data collected by Boise’s system will not be stored or connected to any police database or criminal records.\n\nIllinois\n\nDuQuoin: Country rock band Confederate Railroad has been barred from performing at a state fair because of its use of the Confederate flag, setting off a firestorm by southern Illinois fans who believe they’re under Chicago liberals’ thumb of political correctness. The band was scheduled to appear Aug. 27 at the DuQuoin State Fair , but Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration canceled the appearance last week. “This administration’s guiding principle is that the state of Illinois will not use state resources to promote symbols of racism,” Pritzker spokeswoman Emily Bittner said. The logo for the Grammy-nominated band, known for acoustic ballads such as “Jesus and Mama” as well as its raucous anthem “Trashy Women,” features a steam engine from which waves dual Confederate Navy Jacks, whose stars and bars are the most widely recognized symbol of the Confederacy.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Local Twitter has been abuzz with Purdue Boilermakers expressing pride over the feature of a powder blue Purdue University sweatshirt in the newest season of Netflix’s “Stranger Things.” Erika Austin, manager of trademarks and licensing for Purdue, says she was as surprised as everyone else to see the shout-out. The Purdue Trademarks and Licensing department is working with its licensing agency and the Purdue Team Store to produce and sell a replica of the shirt, with the possibility it could eventually be sold in other retail locations, she says. Set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, “Stranger Things” gives no indication as to where in the state it’s located. A limestone quarry in the first season led some Hoosiers to believe it could be in the southern portion of the state; season two includes a geographical reference to west-central Tippecanoe; and the feature of Purdue gear helps anchor the idea of it being a northern town.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Department of Human Services says it has agreed to pay an additional $386 million to two insurance companies that will provide Medicaid services for the 2020 fiscal year. The 8.6% increase announced Wednesday will include $115 million in additional state funding, with the federal government paying for the remaining portion. The $5 billion Medicaid program serves about 600,000 poor and disabled people. DHS says the rates include changes made by the Legislature, which account for about 2% of the increase. Last year the agency approved a $344 million increase over the previous year. The state privatized the Medicaid program in 2016, with then-Gov. Terry Branstad promising cost savings and improved care. Democrats say neither goal has been accomplished.\n\nKansas\n\nMulvane: Some drivers got a surprise windfall when a malfunctioning toll machine spat out coins instead of accepting money near a casino. The Wichita Eagle reports Kansas Turnpike Authority spokeswoman Rachel Bell says the agency learned Tuesday morning about the problem with the machine at the Mulvane exit. The agency inadvertently divulged details about the mishap when it sent a text alert to its public subscribers. The note said there was “NO WAY” to know the exact dollar amount that was taken. KTA says the message was meant to be internal but made it out into the public realm after someone newly responsible for disseminating messages sent it to the wrong group of subscribers. Bell wasn’t immediately sure how many customers used the machine while it was being generous.\n\nKentucky\n\nClermont: Louisville Gas and Electric Co. wants to build a natural gas pipeline to feed the growing energy needs of Bullitt County, but some area property owners – including Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest – are pushing back. LG&E is preparing to go to court in an attempt to take control of the land it wants through eminent domain. Bernheim’s executive director, Mark Wourms, says the nonprofit won’t accept that without a fight because the pipeline would cut through an area that’s home to endangered Indiana bats and two species of extremely rare snails. “It’s just insane to intentionally impact rare animal habitats,” he said. “Is it an uphill battle? Sure it is ... and we think it’s better for Kentucky if we don’t (stop fighting).” The Bernheim Forest covers more than 16,000 acres about 25 miles south of downtown Louisville.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: The State Fair of Louisiana has announced the theme for this year’s event. The Times reports the 113th State Fair will be known as “Gumbo of Fun” and be held Oct.24 through Nov.10 in Shreveport. Since 1906, the State Fair of Louisiana has been a tradition for many families, drawing an average of 425,000 people through the gates annually. In addition to carnival rides, it offers food vendors and live music. Authorities say the event has a $24 million economic impact on Shreveport’s economy and creates more than 300 temporary jobs during the season.\n\nMaine\n\nRaymond: A summer camp has brought together dozens of children suffering from a rare disease. Camp Sunshine says only about 1,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with Diamond-Blackfan Anemia, and 59 families affected by the disease are at the camp in Maine. The camp, on the shore of Sebago Lake, says it’s the largest gathering worldwide of families who are dealing with the disease, which affects bone marrow and reduces red blood cells. Officials say 4-year-old Noah Dowie of Australia traveled the farthest in hopes of finding support from other families and getting help from clinicians and researchers. The camp brings together families of children with life-threatening illnesses. It has helped more than 50,000 individuals from all 50 states and 27 countries.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Federal Aviation Administration is going to reconsider its position challenging the state over new flight patterns and the noise they bring residents near Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. The FAA filed a motion Tuesday to hold Maryland’s case in abeyance while it reconsiders. In September, the FAA wrote a letter to the state declining to respond to a petition asking for more review of the flight patterns. Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh says he’s hopeful the FAA will undertake a thorough review of the facts and ultimately lead to changes in flight paths. Gov. Larry Hogan says his administration remains committed to restoring the quality of life for residents who live around the state’s airports.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Health officials say the mosquito-borne West Nile virus has officially returned to the state. The Department of Public Health announced Thursday that West Nile was detected in mosquitoes collected in Boston last week – the first positive sample of the year. No human cases have been reported so far. A year ago there were 49 confirmed human cases of West Nile, the most ever reported in a single year in Massachusetts. State Epidemiologist Catherine Brown says the risk for human infection generally peaks in August. As always, health officials are advising people to protect themselves from mosquito-borne illnesses such as West Nile and Eastern Equine Encephalitis by using mosquito repellent, draining standing water near their homes and repairing any tears in window screens.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Water levels in parts of the Great Lakes system hit record highs last month and are only expected to keep climbing, prompting concern from state officials for waterfront communities already flooded. Lake Superior, Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario set record-high monthly mean water levels in June, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reported this week. Lake Michigan-Huron was less than an inch short of its June record. The situation has prompted emergency response measures from the local and state levels as communities deal with the consequences of simply having too much water. Overflowing lakes have flooded lakefront properties, eroded shoreline and erased beaches, say officials with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. High waves, strong currents and hidden debris create hazards for recreational boaters and swimmers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State taxpayers helped foot the bill when Jimmy Fallon broadcast “The Tonight Show” from Minneapolis as part of last year’s Super Bowl festivities. Minnesota Public Radio News obtained information via public records request that shows the state paid the show $267,000 through a rebate program. The state’s Snowbate program is aimed at luring productions and fostering local industry talent. Talk shows are ineligible to participate in the program. But the NBC show was reclassified as a “variety show” to fit the confines of state law. The records show that Michael Tabor, a member of the program’s advisory committee, said giving away state funds to Fallon’s show “isn’t responsible.” He said NBC was set to be in Minnesota anyway because it was shooting the Super Bowl.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A new Mississippi Writers Trail marker honoring novelist and poet Margaret Walker was unveiled this week at Jackson State University, where she was an English professor from 1949 to 1979 and was also known as Margaret Walker Alexander. In 1942, she became the first African American woman to win the Yale Prize, for her poetry collection “For My People.” One of her best known novels, “Jubilee,” was published in 1966 and tells of a biracial woman born into slavery in the American South. Walker was born in 1915 in Birmingham, Alabama, and her family moved to New Orleans when she was 10. She earned degrees from Northwestern University and the University of Iowa. Jackson State’s Margaret Walker Center is dedicated to the interpretation of black culture. She died in 1998.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The locally based brewery that makes Kraftig beer, which is operated by an heir to the family that founded Anheuser-Busch, is going out of business. The William K. Busch Brewing Co. announced the decision Wednesday, citing market demand. Billy Busch said in a statement that he hopes eventually to return to the brewery business. The company says Kraftig will continue to be available in stores while supplies last, which is expected to be through September. The brewery began operation in 2011 in Brentwood, a St. Louis suburb. Busch is a son of August “Gussie” Busch Jr., the longtime leader of Anheuser-Busch credited with building the St. Louis brewer into the dominant force of the beer market. Anheuser-Busch was sold to Belgian brewer InBev in 2008.\n\nMontana\n\nWhitefish: The Under the Big Sky music and arts festival is coming to Big Mountain Ranch this weekend. The concert will be held Saturday and Sunday from noon to 11 p.m. Featured artists include Nathaniel Rateliff and The Night Sweats, Band of Horses, The Lil Smokies and Mike Murray. A Montana-based singer-songwriter from Kalispell, Murray typically plays as a solo or duo act, but for Under the Big Sky Festival, he will be performing with a full band. Tickets for the festival are still on sale online. Two-day last-call tickets are $129.00 plus a $28.81 fee. Two-day VIP last-call tickets are $275.00 plus a $37.83 fee. More information is available online.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State corrections officials are exploring options to combat the delivery by drone of drugs and other contraband to inmates. The Lincoln Journal Star reports that the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services is asking companies what they can do to detect unmanned aircraft. Laura Strimple, chief of staff to the department’s director, says officials are considering proposals made by six companies in February. No details have been provided about how much a drone detection system would cost, but the department told the companies that funding would come from its budget or a grant. The department began looking into drone detection after an inmate found a crashed drone in February at the Lincoln Correctional Center. The craft was carrying two bags containing marijuana, tobacco and rolling papers.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., called for U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry’s resignation Wednesday after the department acknowledged multiple shipments of low-level radioactive waste to a site north of Las Vegas may have been mislabeled and out of compliance with safety regulations for years. The department had announced earlier that shipments of the waste from Tennessee to Nevada have been suspended while it investigates whether the materials were “potentially mischaracterized” as the wrong category of low-level waste. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals. Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette also has ordered a departmentwide assessment of its “procedures and practices for packaging and shipping all radioactive waste types,” according to a memo.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBretton Woods: It seems bears enjoy a good view just like any other visitor to the White Mountains. A photo snapped by an employee at the Omni Mount Washington Resort shows a black bear holding onto a rail on the veranda and looking out. The snapshot was taken about 5 a.m. a couple of weeks ago; Sam Geesaman says he had only wanted to get a photo of the sunrise. Instead, he caught the bear as it climbed stairs in search of a trash can. The bear moved on after Gessaman loudly clapped and stomped. New Hampshire routinely has reports of bears finding their way into homes, campgrounds and even apartment complexes. Last year, food shortages were blamed for a sharp increase in bear-human conflicts and the highest numbers of bear killings since 2014.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold: A high-stakes trial about beach access at the Jersey shore has stalled after the judge in the case made clear, in often colorful terms, that she was less than impressed with arguments made by both sides. With quips and lacerating observations during a hearing Wednesday, Superior Court Judge Lisa Thornton at one point told one of the attorneys, “Don’t get your underwear in a bunch,” and she said another’s responses amounted to “dancing” around the question. The American Littoral Society, a coastal environmental group, is suing the borough of Deal, trying to nullify an ordinance it passed in December that would vacate the end of an oceanfront street in return for a $1 million payment from a nearby landowner who wants the property as part of a development proposal.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The long-simmering battle between the state and its neighbor to the north over which one grows the best chile is heating up. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham went on the offensive Wednesday after Colorado Gov. Jared Polis proclaimed on Twitter that hot peppers from Pueblo were the best and would be stocked across a four-state region by a well-known grocery store chain. Polis went on to say stores in Lujan Grisham’s state would be supplied with inferior New Mexico chile. Lujan Grisham fired back, saying New Mexico chile is “the greatest in the world,” and she’s ready for a chile duel. Researchers at New Mexico State University have explained that soil conditions, warmer temperatures, the right amount of water and a longer growing season result in the unique flavor of the state’s chile.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Dozens of plaintiffs have filed a class-action lawsuit in state Supreme Court arguing a newly enacted law that ended the religious exemption for vaccinations violates their religious beliefs. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday, comes just weeks after a contentious vote by lawmakers approving the end of religious exemptions for vaccinations in the state. The bill was immediately signed into law by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. More than 1,000 cases of measles have been confirmed nationwide since October, most of which have been in New York – particularly in New York City and Rockland County, home to large Orthodox Jewish communities where some are opposed to vaccines. More than 266 cases of measles were reported in Rockland County as of last month. The suit was filed by Orange County attorney Michael Sussman and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a fierce critic of vaccinations.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: There might soon be one more way for the public to view the majesty of Mount Pisgah, one of Western North Carolina’s most beloved natural landmarks. A new state park is nearly a done deal after a bipartisan, unanimous vote by the state House this week passed the bill authorizing the park. The bill to create Pisgah View State Park out of some 1,600 acres of Pisgah View Ranch land in Buncombe and Haywood counties, with a picture-perfect view of Mount Pisgah, was also unanimously passed by the state Senate on June 24. It was introduced by Sen. Chuck Edwards, R-Henderson, in April to authorize the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to add Pisgah View State Park to the State Parks System. Rep. Brian Turner, D-Buncombe, sponsored the bill in the House.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s pardon advisory board on Wednesday unanimously backed a policy change that will allow people with low-level marijuana convictions to apply for pardons and have their records wiped clean if they don’t commit another crime for five years. Republican Gov. Doug Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both support the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities that have been trying to fix problems that such past convictions have caused for people trying to find jobs and housing. North Dakota’s change doesn’t go as far as some others that automatically dismissed or pardoned convictions. Instead, people applying for pardons would have to fill out an online form on the corrections department’s website. The deadline for the first round of applications is Aug. 10. It costs nothing to apply.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: Heavy rains that inundated the Great Lakes region this spring will fuel another massive algae bloom across parts of western Lake Erie later this summer, researchers said Thursday. Scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expect this year’s bloom to rank among the top five since it began measuring their severity in 2002, according to their annual algae forecast for the lake. What’s not known is how toxic it might be or whether it will pose a threat for cities like Toledo and Cleveland that draw their drinking water from the lake. Lake Erie, the shallowest and warmest of the Great Lakes, has been hit particularly hard by algae blooms over the past decade. Five years ago a toxic bloom caused a two-day shutdown of drinking water in Toledo.\n\nOklahoma\n\nGuthrie: Police say they found a rattlesnake, a canister of radioactive powdered uranium and an open bottle of Kentucky Deluxe whiskey during a traffic stop of a vehicle that had been reported stolen. The traffic stop happened June 26 in Guthrie, about 30 miles north of Oklahoma City. Guthrie police Sgt. Anthony Gibbs told Oklahoma City TV station KFOR that police don’t know why the uranium was in the vehicle or how it was obtained, though uranium ore can be bought on Amazon. Gibbs says police also found a gun in the console and a terrarium in the backseat containing a pet timber rattlesnake. Gibbs says the driver, Stephen Jennings, was charged with possession of a stolen vehicle, transporting an open container of liquor and driving with a suspended license. Jennings remains jailed in Logan County.\n\nOregon\n\nRoseburg: Federal officials have formally declared a disaster in Douglas, Linn and four other Oregon counties for severe storms that hit the area in April. KATU-TV reports the disaster declaration signed Tuesday comes in response to the severe storms, flooding, landslides and mudslides April 6 through April 21 in Oregon’s Curry, Douglas, Grant, Linn, Umatilla and Wheeler counties. State officials say the storms caused more than $8 million in damage and killed one person in Douglas County. It’s the second disaster declaration for Douglas and Curry counties in 2019. In May, the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared that February storms that toppled trees and closed highways in Douglas, Curry, Lane and Coos counties qualified as a disaster.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state attorney general’s office launched an effort Thursday to improve the use of firearms databases so that law enforcement can better track guns used in crimes and, ultimately, clamp down on gun violence. The move comes amid a surge in such violence in Philadelphia. The city’s rate of homicides this year is about the same as it was in 2018, when Philadelphia recorded 349 of them, the most since 2007. Speaking at a news conference in Erie, Attorney General Josh Shapiro said he wants police departments to enter serial numbers from every gun used in a crime or seized by police into a law-enforcement database so that its original seller can be identified and the information shared with other departments. “Because this information is not shared, we actually have no idea how many crime guns were recovered in Pennsylvania last year, and that makes us all less safe,” he said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The governor has signed a bill to deregulate the business of African-style hair braiding. The legislation signed by Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo defines natural hair braiding and exempts braiders from the state’s requirement for hairdressers and cosmeticians to be licensed, effective immediately. Democratic Rep. Anastasia Williams, of Providence, has been working to exempt hair braiders from licensing requirements for several years. She says their techniques are passed down from generation to generation and don’t require formal training. Williams also says forcing braiders to meet the same licensing requirements as cosmetologists is an injustice, and the new law allows entrepreneurs, including many low-income women, to make a living.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: For the second time in two years, the state has moved its death row inmates to a new prison. State Corrections Department Director Bryan Stirling says the 37 inmates awaiting execution were taken Thursday morning from Kirkland Correctional Intuition to Broad River Correctional Intuition about a half-mile away. Stirling says prison officials studied death rows in Virginia and North Carolina to address concerns about treatment from a 2017 federal lawsuit by 16 inmates. The new death row will allow inmates to eat meals with each other, worship together and have jobs. Previously, death row inmates were in solitary confinement even during the hour they got outside their cells. Death row was moved from Lieber Correctional Intuition near Charleston to Kirkland Correctional Intuition in 2017.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The South Dakota School of Mines & Technology will work with the Air Force Civil Engineer Center at the Ellsworth base on environmental stewardship goals. The school’s experts in ecology, hydrology, environmental engineering and other disciplines will help the Air Force clean up contaminated sites, reduce or prevent future pollution, and comply with environmental rules and law at its installations. Mines President Jim Rankin says the partnership boosts top-tier science and engineering research and education at the school while supporting the Department of Defense efforts on environmental challenges.\n\nTennessee\n\nMurfreesboro: Country singer Chris Young’s alma mater is honoring him by naming a new live music venue after him on campus. Middle Tennessee State University plans to open the Chris Young Cafe sometime in the fall semester. University President Sidney McPhee said at an event Tuesday at the Country Music Association headquarters that Young has donated $50,000 for the 3,200-square-foot facility’s renovations. The stand-alone building will host teaching and practice for student performers and technicians in the day, and at night it will become a performance venue for musicians, radio broadcasters, comedians and other entertainers. Young has funded an annual scholarship for recording industry students at the university since in 2016 and has donated the school a selection of his touring audio equipment.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A county battered by Hurricane Harvey has earmarked $60 million to speed up flood protection projects in 105 damaged subdivisions outside mapped flood plains. The Houston Chronicle reports the Harris County Commissioners Court earmarked the funds Tuesday to help the Harris County Flood Control District complete the work in four years, not 5 1/ 2 years. The effort is part of 230 projects in the $2.5 billion flood bond program approved by voters last August – a year after Harvey. County Engineer John Blount says commissioners are spending local funds to design projects, rather than waiting on matching federal funds that will instead be used for construction. Harris County risks losing $37 million that might not be reimbursed.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Brigham Young University has updated its honor code process following widespread student criticism that it lacks transparency and compassion. University officials announced the changes Wednesday that include following an “innocent until proven guilty” policy and allowing someone to accompany students in honor code meetings. Honor code office director Kevin Utt said the chances are meant to reduce anxiety and misunderstanding among students. The Utah university is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and mandates students follow a code that prohibits premarital sex; the consumption of alcohol, coffee and tea; and beards and piercings, among other rules, to comply with the church’s health code. Students began an informal campaign earlier this year to reduce honor code punishments that ban activities common at other colleges.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state wants to increase the number of electric vehicles by more than 16 times by 2025. About 3,100 plug-in vehicles are currently registered in Vermont. The 2025 goal is 50,000. The push for electric vehicles is part of the state’s long-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for about 45% of Vermont’s emissions. Republican Gov. Phil Scott says the current state budget contains $1.1 million to help low- and moderate-income Vermonters purchase or lease all-electric vehicles. Starting this month, at least half of the vehicles purchased for the state fleet must be plug-in electric. In two years that figure will increase to 75%. The current state transportation fund also contains money to increase the number of electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State transportation officials are asking the public for ideas on how to improve a heavily trafficked highway. Officials said Wednesday that the first round of public comments on a study to improve the Interstate 95 corridor will end Aug. 21. Officials are looking to identify key problems areas along I-95, which runs for 179 miles in Virginia, from Alexandria to the North Carolina border. State lawmakers have directed transportation officials to also study potential financing options for improving the highway. A similar directive recently led lawmakers to approve a regional fuel tax hike to pay for improvements to Interstate 81 in the western part of the state. Some lawmakers initially supported adding tolls to the highway. The public can submit comments at VA95Corridor.org.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympic National Park: For the second straight summer, mountain goats are flying. This week officials began rounding up the sure-footed but nonnative mammals from remote parts of the park, where humans introduced them in the 1920s, to relocate them to the Cascade Mountains, where they do belong. Animal capture specialists called “gunners” and “muggers” sedate the animals with darts or capture them in nets, blindfold them, pad their horns and fly them – on slings dangling from a helicopter – to a staging area. There, they’re looked over by veterinarians and outfitted with tracking collars before being trucked to the Cascades and once again flown by helicopter, this time into their new alpine habitats. Officials captured 17 Monday and Tuesday, including a kid about 6 weeks old, which got a ride on a mugger’s lap inside the helicopter instead of hanging beneath it.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHolden: State wildlife officials are hoping to bring back the bobwhite quail. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the birds disappeared from the state in the late 1970s thanks to a combination of habitat destruction and two very harsh winters. Now wildlife officials say they are a good candidate for reintroduction at the Tomblin Wildlife Management Area, a 32,000-acre tract of former surface-mined land in Logan and Mingo counties that was acquired by the state Division of Natural Resources in 2015. The agency reintroduced elk to the area in 2016. Now it is working to make a suitable habitat for quail. The earliest the birds could arrive would be next spring. Even then, they will be kept off limits to hunters until a self-sustaining population is established.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A man would receive $7.5 million from the city, under a resolution before the Common Council, after he was wrongly imprisoned for 24 years based on what he says was bogus bite-mark evidence. Robert Lee Stinson agreed to settle his claims against the city and one of its former police detectives for an initial payment of $3.5 million in August and $4 million in January. The settlement was reached during a jury trial over Stinson’s claims that detectives and dentists conspired to frame him in his neighbor’s homicide using the bite-mark evidence. Stinson was convicted in 1985 of killing Ione Cychosz of Milwaukee. He was freed in 2009 after the Wisconsin Innocence Project found experts who rejected the dentists’ conclusions that a bite mark on the victim was left by Stinson.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: After more than three years and $300 million, the Capitol is back open for business. State leaders cut a red ribbon in front of the 132-year-old building Wednesday. The ceremony capped a massive renovation to the sandstone landmark and nearby facilities including the Herschler Building, a state office complex. Afterward the building was opened up for people to take a look around inside. Gov. Mark Gordon told a crowd of a couple thousand that it’s good to be back in the Capitol, which he calls the “heartbeat of Wyoming.” Several state agencies and the offices of Wyoming’s top elected officials moved into temporary offices elsewhere in the city while the work took place. State lawmakers met for four legislative sessions in a rented office building in Cheyenne.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/12"}]}

We then see mutations appear that improve that binding ability.\"\n\nWill there be a summer surge in COVID cases due to 'FLiRT' variants?\n\nPekosz said a summer surge is certainly possible, and that the FLiRT variants would be high on his list of viruses that could cause another wave of infections in the U.S.\n\n\"That said, our definition of a wave has changed; while we still see case rates rise and fall throughout the year, we see much lower numbers of cases of hospitalizations or deaths than we saw in the first couple years of the pandemic,\" Pekosz said in the article.\n\nPekosz also noted that while the waves are becoming smaller, they are still impacting our susceptible populations: the elderly, people who are immunocompromised, and those with other secondary medical conditions.\n\nSymptoms of COVID 'FLiRT' variant\n\nAccording to the CDC, there are \"no current indicators\" that KP.2 would cause more severe illness than other strains.

But only 17% of the population has an updated booster shot, according to the CDC.\n\nMost Americans got their last shot more than a year ago, which means that when they catch COVID-19, the immunity they got from it will have faded. They won't get as sick as a person who'd never been vaccinated or exposed to the virus at all, but they will get sicker than if they'd had a recent shot, experts say.\n\nImmune protection typically fades over time, which is why people can catch a cold year after year. Plus most viruses, like the one that causes COVID-19, mutate over time, so the body isn't prepared for precisely the one that arrives the year after an infection or shot.\n\nThe current COVID-19 vaccine doesn't prevent all infections. But a vaccine almost certainly reduces the severity of illness, experts say, along with the risk for long COVID, in which symptoms linger for months or years after the initial infection is gone.\n\nWhat are long COVID symptoms?\n\nIn a study funded by the National Institutes of Health, researchers identified symptoms that are the most distinctive to long COVID, including: fatigue, especially after exercise; brain fog; dizziness; gastrointestinal symptoms; heart palpitations; issues with sexual desire or capacity; loss of smell or taste; thirst; chronic cough; chest pain; and abnormal movements.\n\nLong COVID study:Study identifies symptoms that distinguish long COVID\n\nCOVID isolation in 2024:Do I have to stay home if I have COVID?

I'm Taylor Wilson, and today is Thursday, May 9th, 2024. This is The Excerpt.\n\n♦\n\nToday, zombie colleges are popping up online, plus the latest on ceasefire negotiations in Cairo, and we learn about rage rituals.\n\n♦\n\nClosed colleges are rising from the dead online. I spoke with USA TODAY Investigative Education Reporter Chris Quintana, to learn more about zombie colleges. Chris, thanks for hopping on.\n\nChris Quintana:\n\nThank you so much for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Chris, fascinating story here. Tell us about these zombie colleges whose names have been resurrected on the web.\n\nChris Quintana:\n\nThis one was really unusual because it first started with a tip about Stratford University. That was a university that closed back in 2022, and I know that because I wrote about it when it closed. And so already there were alarm bells going off when these former Stratford University students reached out to me and said, \"Hey, it looks like our university's open still.\" As I started to poke around a little bit and that university's website, I found this collection of other closed universities that now have active websites.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah, and Chris, what's the motive or the presumed motive behind creating these fake websites?\n\nChris Quintana:\n\nIt's a little hard to say without speaking to the operators, we did try to get in touch with them through a variety of means, but we were unsuccessful there. But when you look at the application forms themselves, you can kind of intuit or maybe glean what some of the motives might be. First of all, they had been asking for a $75 application fee as part of the application process. So that's a potential motive. I talked with a counterfeit website expert who suggested that the collection of personal information could be motive for identity theft, but it's really hard to tell, and there may be other motives at play here. The Federal Trade Commission has previously busted a counterfeit websites or recruiting students to colleges and universities. And so there are a couple of options here, and I wish we could be more clear about what's going on, but that's part of the mystery.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nDo we have any sense of how these schools or websites are connected or any sense who's behind all this?\n\nChris Quintana:\n\nI mean, the connections between the colleges are really fascinating and sometimes more obvious than others. So a couple of them claim to be accredited by the same fictional accreditors, or at least accreditors that aren't recognized by the US Federal Government. But there's also more obvious signs, right? Like there's replicated language for a law program between Stratford University and Jones International University. We see similar questions in the application forms themselves, and so once you spend a little bit more time with these sites, you start to also notice similar color elements or other motifs that appear across all nine.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYou applied to one closed school. This was a really interesting part of the story, Chris, what did you discover in this process?\n\nChris Quintana:\n\nYeah, we wanted to know how this process was working and not being able to find any real people at Stratford University, we thought we should just apply and see what happens there. I got a response to my application within a few minutes and they gave me a boilerplate response saying, \"You'll hear back from us in three weeks.\" Cut to three weeks, I get an email saying that I was accepted, but it's coming from an entirely different college altogether called Vanguard College. So I responded, \"Hey, what's up with Vanguard College?\" I don't hear anything back.\n\nA little while later I get a response from the Stratford University domain saying, \"Hey, check your email. You've been accepted.\" I again, asked my same question about Vanguard College and I didn't get any response. But I should rewind a little bit and say that when I got that initial acceptance email from Vanguard College, we learned a little bit more about maybe the motive behind this whole thing. They told me that it would cost about $2,500 a month for the next 12 months to earn my degree. So that timeline's a little accelerated when you think about a standard four-year bachelor's degree.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo how successful have regulators been at fighting back against these and what challenges exist here?\n\nChris Quintana:\n\nPart of the challenge here is these universities have closed, and the way that American copyright law works is you need an active business to sue on its behalf. And because these are closed, it raises the question of who can actually sue on the behalf of a closed university if there aren't foundations or other entities attached to it. The other challenge is just figuring out who is behind these applications. Law enforcement can get that info, but it's not available publicly necessarily. In North Carolina, for example, there's King's College in Charlotte. The past president had raised this complaint and said that he tried to reach out to law enforcement to get it addressed. The attorney general's office told us that they were continuing to investigate, but that website's still up, so it's hard to say.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAnd finally, what tips can you give folks for spotting some of these zombie colleges online?\n\nChris Quintana:\n\nOne trick I like is to always check their address on Google Maps. You can usually see if it's an active university from there. I also always try to implore people to check the URL. You can tell it's a legitimate institution if it has a .edu, because these days that domain ending is pretty much reserved for only accredited colleges. And those are colleges that can receive federal financial aid, and there's a variety of quality checks in place as part of that too.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nAll right. Chris Quintana is an investigative education reporter with USA TODAY. Great work on this story. Really interesting time. Thanks, Chris.\n\nChris Quintana:\n\nThanks so much for having me.\n\n♦\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nPresident Joe Biden vowed publicly for the first time to withhold weapons from Israel if its forces make a major invasion of Rafah. He told CNN yesterday, quote, \"I made it clear that if they go into Rafah, I'm not supplying the weapons,\" unquote. Biden also acknowledged that US weapons provided to Israel have killed civilians in Gaza. Israel, continued tank and aerial strikes on Southern Gaza after moving in via the Rafah border crossing earlier this week. Meanwhile, ceasefire talks continue in Cairo. Hamas said late yesterday that it would not make any more concessions to Israel in the talks. On Monday, Israel declared that a truce proposal approved by Hamas was unacceptable. The US though said Tuesday that Hamas had revised its ceasefire proposal, a revision that could overcome an impasse.\n\n♦\n\nA new set of COVID-19 variants nicknamed FLiRT, that's F-L-I-R-T, has been detected in wastewater surveillance according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and for prevention. From April 14th through April 27th, the variant labeled KP.2 made up about 25% of the cases in the United States according to the CDC. That makes it the new dominant variant in the country, overtaking JN.1. Megan L. Ranney, Dean of the Yale School of Public Health told WebMD that FLiRT has some concerning features like changes in the spike protein, which play a role in helping the virus colonize the body and make people sick. According to the CDC, less than a quarter of American adults reported having received an updated 2023, '24 COVID vaccine since September of last year.\n\n♦\n\nSome women are paying big money to scream and smash sticks in the woods. I spoke with USA TODAY Wellness Reporter Charles Trepany, to learn more about rage rituals. Charles, thanks for hopping on.\n\nCharles Trepany:\n\nThanks for having me.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nSo Charles, let's just start here. What exactly is a rage ritual?\n\nCharles Trepany:\n\nSo I honestly think about it as similar to a rage room, which if you're not familiar, people pay money. It'll go into a room, wear a helmet and everything and smash things. Rage rituals are held in the woods. They involve gathering large sticks and branches. As you do that, you sort of conjure to your mind people who have wronged you, circumstances in your life that have hurt you, that you feel haven't been fair, that have caused anger, and you gather this to mind. And then after some deep breaths, you basically just go to town screaming and smashing the ground with these sticks, letting out all of your anger. One person I spoke to whose done rage rituals said that she was taught to scream and swing these branches for either 20 minutes or until you literally can't move your arms anymore. The idea of it is basically to release any anger that you've been holding on in your body, because in society, we have very few outlets to sort of helpfully and safely express their anger.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah, interesting stuff. So what do folks who have gone through these rituals say about their experiences?\n\nCharles Trepany:\n\nOne person I interviewed, her name is Kimberly, she's a cybersecurity engineer. She said it was life-changing and she's done it three times, and that each time has been very, very different. She does it in a group of women and that people have different experiences. Some jump right into the screaming really easily. Others I guess, need more time to kind of warm up and get used to the idea. What was interesting to me was that her first rage ritual she did shortly after her divorce, and she expected anger, that to be the thing that she would really release during this rage ritual, anger at her ex-husband. And what actually came up for her really surprised her was this really deep grief and sadness. She witnessed the death of a friend when she was a teenager, and she never realized that she was still holding onto that grief that she never expressed it. And so the rage ritual gave her an opportunity to let this out.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nYeah. So what do mental health professionals say about this practice?\n\nCharles Trepany:\n\nI interviewed a therapist about this. She wasn't opposed to the idea, she's all for letting go of anger, letting go of negative emotions in healthy ways. She said there's lots of different ways to do this, and you don't have to go into the woods and scream and swing sticks to let go of your anger, and that it doesn't always have to be so intense. There's people who will best release anger through activating strategies like boxing, hitting a punching bag, screaming into a pillow. And then there's people that might let go of their anger more gently through soothing strategies like going for a walk, listening to calm music, taking deep breaths, letting things go in that way.\n\nAlso, rage rituals can be a little bit expensive. The ones that I looked into were part of larger retreat experiences, so you're not just getting the rage ritual. But one rage ritual leader, it costs about $222, she said a ticket for a whole day experience and includes a rage ritual. So the therapist was saying that you have to keep your budget in mind because if you spend all your money on a rage ritual, that may leave you feeling more stressed and upset afterward than you would've before. But it's sort of whatever healthfully and safely gets you to feel better.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nWe've talked a lot about women taking part in these specifically. Why do rage rituals especially resonate with women?\n\nCharles Trepany:\n\nThat was something that really stood out to me when I was looking at this on social media. I saw a TikTok video of a rage ritual, and all of the top comments were from women saying how moving it was, how powerful it was, how they started crying watching this. And one of the rage ritual leaders, Mia Banducci told me that her rage rituals are often sought out specifically by women. And I talked to her about this and she was saying that there are certain expectations for men and women in society in terms of handling emotions. She said on the flip side, men often are told to repress their sadness, repress their vulnerability, and so it can be really healthy for men to cry and let that out. On the other side, women she said, are often taught to not get angry, not be confrontational, not be combative, and so it's good for them to scream and let out their anger.\n\nTaylor Wilson:\n\nCharles Trepany covers wellness for USA TODAY.

The introduction of the new rules, which allow people testing positive to return to public life if they are not showing symptoms, makes California the second state to break from CDC guidelines and do away with specific isolation times, following behind Oregon, which made such changes back in May.\n\nIn California's order, issued on Jan. 9, the changes were attributed to the reduced impact of COVID compared to past years, the availability of treatment and the changing expectations to keep people most at-risk safe while posing minimal disruptions to the public.\n\nFact check:CDC data shows levels of COVID-19 in wastewater, not water supply\n\nOregon and California limit quarantine\n\nOregon and California are the first states to depart from the guidelines put forth by the CDC, which still recommends at least five days of isolation after first testing positive for COVID or experiencing symptoms.\n\nInstead, Oregonians and Californians are no longer asked to isolate for a specified period after contracting COVID. Those who experience symptoms can return to work or school after just 24 hours of being fever-free, so long as symptoms are \"mild and improving.\" Those who experience no apparent symptoms are no longer required to isolate at all, according to the state policies.\n\nHowever, both states still suggest taking precautions if you have been infected, even if you don't have to stay home anymore. It is still advised that you avoid contact with high-risk people and mask when around others for 10 days after testing positive or becoming sick.\n\n“We are now at a different point in time with reduced impacts from COVID-19 compared to prior years due to broad immunity from vaccination and/or natural infection, and readily available treatments available for infected people,” Director of the California Department of Public Health Dr. Tomás Aragón said in the state order.\n\n“Our policies and priorities for intervention are now focused on protecting those most at risk for serious illness while reducing social disruption that is disproportionate to recommendations for prevention of other endemic respiratory viral infections.​”\n\nWhat does the CDC recommend?\n\nThe CDC guidelines still advise isolation with or without symptoms, regardless of vaccination status.\n\nAccording to the guidelines, anyone who suspects they may have COVID-19 should begin isolating, even if they have not yet tested. Once testing positive, it is advised that you isolate for five days, as you are most likely to be contagious during that time.\n\nIf you test positive without symptoms but develop symptoms during the 10 days following, the isolation clock restarts. If at the end of the five days you are fever-free for 24 hours without the assistance of medication and your symptoms have improved, you may end isolation. However, if you are still experiencing symptoms with no improvement, you should wait until you are fever-free for 24 hours and/or your symptoms are improving.\n\nPeople who experience more serious symptoms of shortness of breath or difficulty breathing should isolate for an additional five days, making the total quarantine time 10 days. People who had a severe illness that resulted in hospitalization or who are immunocompromised should consult their doctor about treatment plans and isolate for at least 10 days as well.\n\nIs COVID surging again?:Surging COVID-19 cases detected in wastewater: Could it signal a new wave?\n\nDuring isolation periods, the CDC suggests you:", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2024/02/16/what-is-chlormequat-chemical-pesticide-cheerios-quaker-oats/72627355007/", "title": "Chlormequat found in Cheerios, oat foods, per new study: What is it?", "text": "Four out of five Americans likely have a lesser-known pesticide in their bodies thanks to the consumption of certain foods, according to a new study.\n\nPublished in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology on Thursday, the study found that 80% of tested Americans had the chemical chlormequat in their systems, a plant regulating agent that is currently not approved for use on edible crops in the U.S.\n\nImported foods treated with chlormequat are allowed to enter the country, however. According to a brief published alongside the study by the advocacy organization Environmental Working Group (EWG), the findings \"ring alarm bells,\" as the chemical is thought to be harmful and was found in common oat and wheat-based products, including Cheerios and Quaker Oats.\n\nHere's what to know about the findings.\n\nWhat is chlormequat?\n\nChlormequat chloride is a pesticide used as a plant growth regulator. The agricultural chemical works by decreasing stem height. This prevents crops from bending over, which can make harvesting more difficult. It is most commonly used on wheat, oats and barley, per the EWG.\n\nChlormequat is not approved for use on edible plants in the U.S. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) decided in 2018 to allow the importation of foods treated with the chemical. It is approved for use on food crops, mostly grains, in the European Union, the United Kingdom and Canada.\n\nWhat did the study say?\n\nListeria outbreak:Salad kit from Bristol Farms now included in listeria-related recalls as outbreak grows\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology, found that chlormequat was detected in 77 of 96, or 80%, of Americans tested for chlormequat.\n\nResearchers used urine samples collected from three geographical regions between 2017 and 2023 to test for the presence and concentration of chlormequat in the bodies of the participants. The study found not only that 4 out of 5 Americans have the pesticide in their system, but that the concentration has increased compared to prior years.\n\nThe study also found the chemical in 92% of oat-based foods purchased and tested in May 2023, including Quaker Oats and Cheerios.\n\nWhat products were found to contain chlormequat?\n\nResearchers found the presence of chlormequat in both traditional and organic oat and wheat-based foods.\n\nResearchers tested conventional oat-based products purchased in June and August 2022 and May 2023. Of both sets, chlormequat was detected in 92% of the tested products. Organic oat-based products had a lower detection rate of 12.5%.\n\nA sample of conventional wheat-based products tested in February 2023 also found that 22% had traces of chlormequat.\n\nThe study authors tested several individual items from a variety of brands for the presence of chlormequat. The chemical was found in several General Mills products, including Cheerios; Quakers Food products including oatmeal, granola bars and Old Fashioned Oats; and some generic store-brand granola and cereals, including Walmart and Target.\n\nMollie Wulff, a spokesperson for General Mills, told USA TODAY in a statement: \"All our products adhere to all regulatory requirements. Food safety is always our top priority at General Mills, and we take care to ensure our food is prepared and packaged in the safest way possible.\"\n\nPepsiCo, which owns Quaker Foods, did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nWhat are the effects of chlormequat?\n\nScientists don't know the exact impact of chlormequat on the human body, as testing has been focused on animals thus far.\n\nSome prior studies have found that chlormequat is linked to infertility, disrupted fetal growth, delayed puberty and disruptions to the metabolic system. However, these studies were performed on mice and rats and have not been conducted on or translated to humans.\n\nEWG said that studies on the pesticide are ongoing but argued, \"Although these studies focus only on the chemical’s potential effects on animals, they raise questions about whether it could also harm humans. \"\n\nThe EWG also noted a 2023 proposal by the EPA to allow the use of chlormequat on barley, oat, triticale and wheat grown in the U.S. for the first time following chlormequat manufacturer Taminco's application to do so in 2019. EWG has said they oppose the plan.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/ud/2018/08/24/man-arrested-georgetown-rape-university-delaware-baseball-pitcher/1089021002/", "title": "Ex-Delaware baseball pitcher Clay Conaway arrested in ...", "text": "Clay Conaway, the 22-year-old suspect jailed after a sexual assault in Georgetown, was a pitcher on the University of Delaware baseball team.\n\nBackground:Clay Conaway arrested on rape charges in Georgetown\n\nDelaware State Police arrested Conaway on Wednesday and charged him with felony first-degree rape following the assault of a 20-year-old woman in her home at 6:30 p.m. Monday.\n\nThe woman identified Conaway.

Tan, chief of New Castle County's Emergency Medical Services.\n\nThe building will be built on the property that housed the American Legion Post 25 building on the 300 block of 6th Street in Odessa. The American Legion leased the building from the county. The building and radio tower on the four-acre property will be demolished, Tan said.\n\nThe 12,000-square-foot facility will have space for six emergency vehicles. The new facility will also have space for training and meetings. It will also be able host an emergency coordination center when a storm cuts off road access to the southern part of the county, Tan said.\n\nEmergency medical response is conducted on a tiered system in New Castle County. Volunteer fire services and other private entities provide basic life support transporting patients to an emergency room.\n\nCounty paramedics are stationed at nine locations throughout the county. They are trained in advanced life support techniques like intravenous fluid therapy, administering drugs and airway support. They are dispatched when there is a serious medical emergency or trauma, Tan said.\n\nThe county currently has one paramedic unit on call 24-hours below the C&D Canal. That unit includes two paramedics typically working together on a shift. They are current based at a former police substation in Middletown. Giving those paramedics a sufficient facility to work out of is the immediate need the new building will fill, Tan said.\n\n\"(The Middletown station) is the last facility that does not have shelter for vehicles. The problem you have is maintaining temperature control with equipment and medication. People are also required to check the equipment when they report to duty and they are doing that in all types of weather,\" Tan said.\n\nIt will also give space to grow the ranks in the southern part of the county, Tan said. When there are two emergencies that require paramedic attention in the area, paramedics in some cases must be dispatched from the Glasgow station, Tan said.\n\n\"The reality is that if the unit down there is committed to a transport and particularly if it is one that is tied up going to Christiana or (Alfred I. duPont Hospital Children's Hospital), the issue is how do we respond to another call,\" Tan said.\n\nCouncilman Bill Bell, who represents a large portion of southern New Castle County, said these situations have become more common.\n\n\"It has become more of a routine type practice,\" Bell said. \"Because of the growth and development there has been a greater demand on our emergency services.\"\n\nThe two southern County Council districts have nearly 10,000 unbuilt, but approved housing units comprising 70 percent of the county's approved future housing stock – the vast majority is south of the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal.\n\nTan said his office is plans to add a second unit to the southern area during most busy half of the day. That effort is currently hindered by vacancies in ranks of paramedics.\n\n\"It is a need to replace a facility that doesn't adequately serve the service while at the same time leaving room for growth as this is the most rapidly growing area in the county,\" Tan said.\n\nThe project will cost between $2 and $3 million, depending on how construction bids come in over the next few months. Tan said the goal is to have the new station operational by the end of next year.\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

He pointed to a March 2015 review that shows Crossroads improved its level of compliance as a state contractor. Barbieri also said Crossroads built its business with credibility in the communities it serves – not merely through state referrals of patients.\n\n“Our market drove our revenue, not the state,” Barbieri said. “I don’t think they have given me anything, to tell the truth. I think we have had to argue, fight and push to get what we get. That’s not wrong. If we agree all the time, I think something’s not right. I hope our providers in the adult system fight with me.”\n\nBut his history as a state contractor and legislator has some questioning whether Barbieri was able to use his influence as a political insider to advance his business and personal interest.\n\n“There is a clear appearance of impropriety here,” said John Flaherty, president of the Delaware Coalition for Open Government. “Having a legislator owning a company that’s generating all kinds of appropriations doesn’t look good.”\n\nFlaherty also questioned Barbieri’s hiring into his new state job. “You shouldn't use your legislative position to slide into a job in the public sector,” he said.\n\nSome of Barbieri’s former colleagues in the Delaware House of Representatives also are questioning the lawmaker’s record. Rep. John Kowalko, a Newark Democrat, called Barbieri’s contracts and his company’s relationship with state officials a “serious cause for concern.”\n\n“I do have concerns about any process where a legislator has a state-funded operation that they either own or have a significant interest in,” Kowalko said. “I have a concern on behalf of my taxpayers, and about the appearance of a serious conflict of interest.”\n\nLast Tuesday, six Republicans who served under Barbieri on the House Health Committee sent a letter to Gov. Jack Markell, saying they did not know he had a health-related contracting business with the state, and the Republicans questioned that arrangement.\n\nThe six Republicans said they learned of Barbieri’s state contracting business from reading The News Journal.\n\nState reviews Crossroads contract after arrest\n\nState freezes referrals after counselor's rape arrest\n\nBarbieri has reported his ownership of Crossroads on annual financial filings with the Delaware ethics office, the Public Integrity Commission. But the lawmakers expressed concerns he wasn’t transparent enough during legislative discussions.\n\n“Until today, none of us was aware of this state contract or his ownership of Crossroads. This raises serious concerns about proper disclosures during the deliberations of our committee on legislation that did or could have directly affected the nature of his contract with the state,” said the letter, which was signed Tuesday by Republican Reps. Joe Miro, Mike Ramone, Ruth Briggs King, Timothy Dukes, Kevin Hensley and Lyndon Yearick.\n\nDocumentation not reviewed before hire\n\nCrossroads came under significant scrutiny this month after one of its counselors was arrested, accused of raping a 16-year-old patient. Counselor Rebecca Adams, 30, is the daughter of Alberta Crowley, Barbieri’s longtime business partner and president of Crossroads, who said Saturday she had completed her purchase of the firm. Adams faces 12 counts of fourth-degree rape.\n\nCrossroads’ contract is under internal review at the Delaware Department of Services for Children Youth and Their Families. Adams, meanwhile, remains on home confinement awaiting a court hearing. She is accused of having an illegal sexual relationship with the patient from June through August of this year.\n\nAdams’ case is separate from the rape allegation mentioned in the July 2011 monitoring report, prepared by DSCYF. That report says a client of Crossroads made the allegation against another peer in the program, but Crossroads provided “no documentation of proper follow up, support, or intervention provided to the client.”\n\n“No incident report was completed,” according to the audit.\n\nThe incident stems from a documentation issue, Crowley said. But the allegation was reported to police – and the client had access to counseling services, she said.\n\n“We did some retraining after this and had our clinical supervisor continue to work with therapists regarding documentation,” Crowley said.\n\nRita Landgraf, the secretary of the Department of Health and Social Services, who hired Barbieri this summer, acknowledges that she interviewed no one else for the substance abuse job, and accepted no applications. Nor did she consult with the Department of Services for Children Youth and Their Families, where Barbieri was a contractor, before his hiring.\n\nLandgraf also did not review documentation of his time as a state contractor, which would have shown that his company ranked last among contractors seeking adolescent substance abuse treatment business in 2012.\n\n“I did not review documents. I don’t review documents,” said Landgraf, who made the appointment under her executive authority. “In any industry you are going to sometimes have competency issues.”\n\nIn an interview with The News Journal, Landgraf passionately defended her hiring of the former lawmaker, saying he was not given preference for political reasons.\n\n“I have 16 months left to combat an addiction epidemic. That’s what I’m working on,” Landgraf said. “All hands on deck. If people want to help me with that, help me. If people want to be critical of that, shame on you. I hired a highly qualified individual.”\n\nSusan Cycyk, director of the Division of Prevention and Behavioral Health, the section of DSCYF that oversees Crossroads’ contract, said she would not characterize the department’s relationship with Crossroads as good or bad. Cycyk said, “It’s true [Crossroads] was ranked lower than” other bidders on state work.\n\n“But they weren’t disqualified,” Cycyk said. And the clinic's ability for providing “intensive outpatient” services led to increased billings to the state.\n\nIn an interview with The News Journal, Barbieri rejected claims that he used political influence to either increase his business as a state contractor or obtain his division director job.\n\nBarbieri and Crowley admit to longstanding disagreements with DSCYF over treatment for adolescent patients facing substance abuse problems, especially clients in Wilmington.\n\nCrowley contends that the state’s suspension of referrals is not directly related to the arrest of her daughter, but retaliation for her well-known criticism of the department.\n\n“I believe this is motivated by ‘opportunity’ given my longstanding, vocal complaint about their refusal to provide appropriate services to the quite disenfranchised population we deal with,” Crowley said. “My concerns have been well documented along with the obvious history of retaliatory behavior by DSCYF.”\n\nCrowley provided dozens of emails between herself and officials at DSCYF that document a poor relationship between Crossroads and officials at their contracting state agency dating to 2011. In an email this January, Crowley accused top department officials of attempting to steer business away from Crossroads during discussions with a patient’s family.\n\n“Going to the client’s home and reiterating the misinformation to the family does not make it any more true; in fact it shows the intent is to move a client away from Crossroads regardless of the fact that mother and child are requesting Crossroads,” Crowley wrote.\n\nIn May 2014, Crowley expressed frustration that DSCYF was denying payment for substance abuse clients who need treatment.\n\n“So, is the new approach going to be to just deny deeper end services to everyone? Because, I could be saved a good bit of time and hassle by not even referring them,” Crowley wrote in a message to Yeatman.\n\nDrug and alcohol counselor charged with rape of teen\n\nCrowley took her concerns to Gov. Jack Markell and lawmakers, saying that DSCYF was unjustly denying services for adolescents with a serious need for substance abuse services. In an email also signed by Dr. Mandell Much, director of clinical services for Aquila of Delaware, Crowley said that the Division of Prevention and Behavior Health Services “has become the sole barrier to treatment access for Delaware youth.”\n\nOfficials at DSCYF refuted Crowley’s claims, saying its suspension of referrals comes amid a criminal investigation and has nothing to do with prior disagreements over Crowley’s criticism of the department.\n\n“It's our responsibility to hold our providers accountable to assure that our children achieve quality services,” said Cycyk, director of the Division of Prevention and Behavioral Health Services. “That's our job.”\n\n“Our job all the time, regardless of whether there's a criminal investigation, is hold our providers accountable and work along with them to assure quality services for our children,” Cycyk said. “We have a serious event that has occurred at this particular provider's location and we want to do a full contract compliance review.”\n\n‘Client focused and client centered’\n\nBarbieri, 66, has a wealth of experience in the substance abuse field, two decades experience as a state contractor and staunch defenders in his professional community. He has worked in counseling since 1972, when he worked inside the Philadelphia court system.\n\nIn 1977, he was hired as executive director of a youth counseling center in Reading, Pennsylvania, and later served as program manager of addiction services for the Valley Force Medical Center in Norristown, Pennsylvania.\n\nBefore founding Crossroads in 1991, Barbieri worked in Washington, D.C., as vice president of operations for Recovery Centers of America. He has run Crossroads as the company’s president, chief executive officer and sole owner since June 1991.\n\nCrossroads is one of several treatment centers contracting with the Department of Services for Children Youth and their Families to provide partial day and full-day treatment and counseling services for adolescents facing substance abuse problems, some of them addicted to heroin.\n\n“Mike has devoted his entire life to this kind of work,” said David Humes, a director of Attack Addiction who lost his son, Greg, to a heroin overdose in 2012. “People like him are the guys who are really the impressive ones, to make a career out of doing things to help other people.”\n\nCarla Markell, the wife of the governor, consulted with Barbieri among others during a review of Delaware’s substance abuse treatment services last year. She called Barbieri “highly qualified” for the Delaware substance abuse position, “in terms of his knowledge and wherewithal.”\n\nLynn Fahey, chief executive of Brandywine Counseling and Community Services, a competitor of Crossroads, said she is optimistic about Barbieri leading Delaware’s substance abuse division. “The things that I’ve always heard about Mike is really that he was always very concerned about compliance and the quality of care. He was always very client-focused and client-centered,” Fahey said. “I’m more in a wait-and-see pattern.”\n\nLandgraf said Barbieri’s knowledge of the political system also will help him make positive changes with just months left in Markell’s tenure as governor, which ends in January 2017.\n\nLikewise, Barbieri said his hiring was not political, and should not be viewed as a former lawmaker capitalizing on his influence in the political system. The former lawmaker said he doesn’t need the money, and took the substance abuse division director job to help steer policy around Delaware’s addiction crisis.\n\n“I’m too old to be dealing with this crap,” Barbieri said. “Bottom line. I should be retiring. I’m doing this because I believe in it. Whether you believe it or not, it doesn’t really present a tremendous financial gain on my part. I’m doing it because it’s an exciting opportunity.”\n\nBarbieri believes “personality” differences may have led to Crossroads’ poor record in the 2012 bidding process.\n\n“Personalities sometimes do influence narrative,” Barbieri said. “We identified some of these things and took more aggressive action to respond to that. You saw what happened in the most recent report. It was much better.”\n\nContact Jonathan Starkey at (302) 983-6756, on Twitter @jwstarkey or at jstarkey@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/09/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/11/06/tom-gordon-again-faces-trouble-closest-ally/75311390/", "title": "New Castle County Executive Tom Gordon again faces trouble from ...", "text": "Xerxes Wilson\n\nThe News Journal\n\nNew Castle County Executive Tom Gordon fired his top deputy, David Grimaldi, a contentious figure in local government.\n\nGrimaldi is the second county chief administrative officer to leave the position in a cloud of controversy.\n\nGordon and Grimaldi disagree on what prompted the termination.\n\nFirst it was Sherry Freebery, the New Castle County chief administrative officer whose role at the center of a federal corruption investigation a decade ago entangled County Executive Tom Gordon in a nearly career-wrecking controversy.\n\nNow it’s David Grimaldi, who helped orchestrate Gordon’s political comeback, only to be fired from the same position Freebery held over allegations last week he used his high-power job to try to get out of a traffic citation.\n\nGrimaldi, appointed by Gordon in 2012 from the private sector, contends he was terminated for criticizing the county executive and is now considering running against his former boss in 2016.\n\nOn the heels of the Grimaldi dismissal, Gordon has appointed Deputy Chief Administrative Officer Sam Guy, an outspoken and sometimes controversial figure, to temporarily lead the department until a permanent official is named. The job functions as the top manager in county government, overseeing 18 departments.\n\nFor Gordon, who spent decades rising through the ranks of the New Castle County Police Department to become one of the most powerful figures in Delaware, his surprise dismissal of Grimaldi and stunning turn of events over the last week is the latest highly visible example of a key member of his inner circle becoming a liability – and a possible threat to his political future.\n\nWith a history of surrounding himself with larger-than-life and sometimes divisive figures, Gordon, a Democrat, again finds himself in the middle of a quickly evolving scandal involving his second-in-command and defending who he places his trust in.\n\n\"You have the right to pick your lieutenants and commanders through your appointed positions,” said Councilwoman Lisa Diller, who also has clashed with administration officials on various issues and is calling for the Delaware Attorney General’s Office to investigate the traffic stop tied to Grimaldi’s dismissal. “If you make those decisions wisely, you have a very, very good, well-working government. If you make those decisions poorly, you are going to be putting out fires with these people.”\n\nGordon's top aide David Grimaldi fired\n\nAttacks become norm in New Castle County government\n\nGordon’s detractors point out the parallels between his two former chief administrative officers and their controversies. The federal corruption case involving Freebery was partially built on testimony and clandestine recordings by those close to Gordon. Grimaldi, who like Gordon has a reputation for holding grudges, has produced recorded phone calls and is hinting there is more insider information to come.\n\n“I think he tends to put his faith in the wrong people when it comes to the No. 2 position,” said County Councilman George Smiley, the Gordon administration’s most vocal critic on the 13-member council. “I think he is too trusting … He lets them operate without enough oversight. They both thought they were above rules and guidelines and superior to all the people they dealt with.”\n\nGordon disagrees, and said the public will judge him on his current accomplishments, not allegations of wrongdoing from the past.\n\n“There was nothing wrong then and there was nothing wrong now,” Gordon said.\n\nCharacterizing his judgment by looking at two people, he said, is an unfair distraction.\n\n“I picked a whole lot of people in this government. There were some good ones and mediocre ones,” Gordon said. “I’m going to be evaluated on the things I have done in the past three years. If someone wants to argue on the policy, we can.”\n\nIn his office near New Castle Airport, Gordon still keeps inches-thick binders filled with photos of libraries, celebrations and other projects from his first two terms as executive, from 1997 to 2002.\n\nHe was elected to the position after eight years as New Castle County police chief. As executive, moved to consolidate government and successfully lobbied the state to share a larger percentage of the state's real estate transfer tax paid on property sales. He gave raises to county employees, built parks and libraries, and rode a real-estate boom, increasing county spending more than 45 percent during his term.\n\nThen scandal struck.\n\nA 47-page racketeering and fraud indictment in 2004 resulted from a two-year federal investigation that accused Freebery of accepting $2.3 million from county landowner Lisa Dean Moseley, a du Pont heiress, in exchange for county approvals for a clubhouse for the Fieldstone Golf Club.\n\nFreebery had been the top official in the county Police Department when Gordon named her chief administrative officer.\n\nThe indictment included claims of using county employees for personal projects, running government as a political machine and that the county settled a sexual harassment lawsuit to avoid public disclosure that included intimate relations between Gordon and Freebery. Gordon has denied having a romantic relationship with Freebery.\n\nThe prosecution was partially built on secretly taped conversations and testimony from employees.\n\nUltimately, the prosecution unraveled with all felony charges against Gordon dropped. In 2007, he pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of not keeping adequate tax records for two employees. Gordon was defeated by Chris Coons when he sought the county executive seat again in 2008.\n\n\"I don’t know if anybody could survive that kind of scrutiny,\" Gordon said in an interview last week. \"It all got dropped and it was a $20 million witch hunt.\"\n\nFreebery, who did not respond to interview requests for this story, ultimately pleaded guilty to a felony for lying on a bank loan. Before Grimaldi was fired, he and Gordon said they still on occasion speak to Freebery about policy and government history describing her as \"brilliant\" in policy matters.\n\n‘Like a father to me’\n\nA Queens, New York, native, Grimaldi came to Delaware to run the real estate arm of Minmetals Inc., which trades iron and steel products, after working as a financial adviser for Morgan Stanley on Wall Street from 2005 to 2009.\n\nGordon was president of the Police Athletic League of Delaware board of directors when he brought Grimaldi in to address various financial problems they faced. Grimaldi at the time was president of the Firestone Hotel Group, which owns the Crowne Plaza Hotel, formerly a Holiday Inn, on Naamans Road.\n\nThe two had similar personalities. Both were confident and driven.\n\n\"He was like a father to me,\" Grimaldi said Friday. \"I loved the guy.\"\n\nIn 2012, Gordon asked Grimaldi to lead his campaign for county executive against incumbent Paul Clark. The job, Grimaldi’s first foray in politics, was to piece together Gordon's return to the executive position.\n\nAfter Gordon won, there were discussions about Grimaldi taking on a leadership role in the new government. He was 34.\n\n\"I saw real potential in finances,\" Gordon recalled. \"He asked for the position. I wasn’t going to give him chief administrative officer, but he asked for it and I said I would give him a chance.\"\n\nGordon said Grimaldi’s financial prowess was evident in helping close a projected deficit in the county's most recent operating budget, leading to a surplus at the end of the year.\n\nBut with that expertise came controversy.\n\nDuring his first year in office, Grimaldi was involved in a fight at Pastabilities restaurant in Wilmington and called New Castle County Police Chief Elmer Setting, who responded even though the business is in the city police department’s jurisdiction.\n\nIn 2013, he got into an argument with an 84-year-old volunteer at the Rockwood Museum and Park, who questioned why Grimaldi was in an upstairs room that was off limits. The woman accused him of bullying her and quit her post.\n\nSome said those problems were a sign of Grimaldi's inexperience.\n\n\"I certainly think Mr. Grimaldi didn't have the seasoning that some people might have had moving into that position. I mean, it is a big job,\" said Diller, the councilwoman.\n\nAmong some council members, Grimaldi developed a reputation for taking political questions personally. That was evidenced in his campaign to discredit county Auditor Bob Wasserbach over a controversial audit of county investment policies.\n\nGrimaldi drafted plans to transfer $92 million from county government's reserve accounts to UBS, a global financial services firm. Questions of the legitimacy of the transfer was the subject of the audit, and Grimaldi has spoken of how the audit was a personal insult making his life \"hell\" for more than a year.\n\nGrimaldi led a campaign accusing Wasserbach of inappropriately using the county email system and accessed Wasserbach's emails to discredit an audit of the First State Animal Center and Society for the Protection of Animals. The News Journal covered the conflict earlier this year.\n\nAt the time, Wasserbach said Grimaldi was bent on \"assassinating\" his character.\n\n\"That was (Grimaldi's) demeanor. He was above everyone else,\" Smiley said. \"He thought himself to be the county executive, (chief administrative officer) and the (chief financial officer) all rolled into one.\"\n\nGrimaldi, in an interview Friday, defended how the audit was handled.\n\n“I was attacked over a year for doing the right thing,” Grimaldi said. “Our financial statements were incorrect. He had egg on his face because I was the one that found it.”\n\nCouncilwoman Janet Kilpatrick speculated Grimaldi’s sometimes-rough tact was the result of his previous work experience.\n\n\"I just think that Mr. Grimaldi has been in the business sector. When you are working in business, things happen more quickly than they do in government,” said Kilpatrick, adding that her relationship with Grimaldi has improved after sparring over the executive office having access to email files of County Council members. “I think people who move from business to government need a patience factor to succeed.”\n\nA traffic stop ignites controversy\n\nCounty Councilman Penrose Hollins, who worked with both Freebery and Grimaldi, disagreed that there are strong parallels between the two. Hollins said it doesn’t reflect on Gordon. Unlike Freebery, nobody was recently calling for Grimaldi to step down.\n\n\"The first time around, people were calling for the resignation of the chief administrative officer and it did not happen. Nobody was asking for that now,” he said.\n\nBut looking back, Gordon said Grimaldi's trouble with people and his influence did cause inter-office fighting and was the foundation for his dismissal. He declined to cite specific examples, but said a traffic stop two days before his firing was the final straw leading to his termination.\n\nGrimaldi was stopped by Elsmere police Oct. 27 after an officer ran his plates and found his license had been suspended for failing to pay a ticket for driving 83 mph in a 55 mph zone in Maryland last year.\n\nIn a police dashboard camera video and accompanying audio obtained by The News Journal, Grimaldi is heard telling the officer, “You know your mayor works for me,” referring to Elsmere Mayor Steve Burg, an executive assistant for the county who Gordon appointed in 2012.\n\nGrimaldi called Burg during the traffic stop, but the two-term mayor did not answer. Gordon said the comment and call to Burg were clearly intended to influence the outcome of the stop.\n\nGrimaldi, whose most recent annual salary was $139,000, said he was only calling Burg to ask for a ride as the officer had barred him from driving after being issued the citation. He also posted an online audio recording in which Burg offers to \"yank\" the ticket. Grimaldi declined the offer.\n\nThe Elsmere Town Council on Thursday asked for an independent investigation into the situation.\n\nGrimaldi disputes that the ticket was the reason behind the firing. Instead, he said he was dismissed because he accused Gordon of allowing nepotism within county government and was critical of how hostile workplace complaints filed in the county Risk Management Department were being handled. Grimaldi said the manager of the department, Cheryl McDonaugh, has too much influence over Gordon.\n\nMcDonaugh has denied that complaints exist. The News Journal has filed a Freedom of Information Act request seeking any documents.\n\nGrimaldi said Gordon is repeating the mistakes of his previous administration.\n\n“This is spiraling out of control,\" he said. \"He is doing the same things he did in his last administration and people are not going to stand for it.\"\n\nGrimaldi accuses Gordon of unfairly portraying the circumstances surrounding his termination.\n\n“The guy has lied to the public about the reason I was fired. It was so outrageous that I got a traffic stop and said who I was. His employee is on the record offering to yank a ticket. That is corruption. Thousands of people have heard it. He is still there, no problem,” he said.\n\nSaid Grimaldi: “Things have been deteriorating seriously with ethical issues, which not only concern me but will be a grave concern to the public.\"\n\nCouncil members said that given the secrecy behind inner-office politics in the executive branch, it's unlikely the full story will emerge soon.\n\n\"I don't think it really matters what the truth is about exactly why (he was fired). I think the question is: Are those accusations that Mr. Grimaldi made about the hostile work environment true?\" Diller said.\n\nThough they disagree on what led to his dismissal, Gordon confirmed he fired Grimaldi in a phone conversation that ended with \"(Expletive) you, David. You are fired.\"\n\nHe said he regrets how it ended.\n\n\"It was a point where I probably shouldn’t have said (that). I still like the guy. He can be hardheaded,\" he said.\n\nGrimaldi said he doesn't regret anything he's said about Gordon, but does feel let down by his former boss.\n\n\"I ran this guy's campaign when people would not stand next to him to take a photograph. I was there fighting for him to vindicate him. We have had a hell of a run together,\" Grimaldi said. \"The fact is, he is what everybody warned me he is.\"\n\nElection battle may be shaping up\n\nRegardless of the circumstances of the termination, the firing has turned Grimaldi into a potential roadblock to Gordon breezing to re-election. The Democratic primary is in September.\n\nThe morning after the firing, Grimaldi told The News Journal he is considering a campaign. He also hijacked Gordon's public Facebook profile with 3,000 followers, changing its title to his name with a new web address that ended with \"DavidGrimaldi2016.\" Gordon has since taken back operation of the page.\n\nOn Friday, Grimaldi said a candidacy has not been ruled out.\n\nGrimaldi, now 37, said he has played a key role in the development of a new stock exchange in Wilmington and efforts to ensure DuPont Co. spin-off the Chemours Co. keeps its headquarters in downtown Wilmington – both of which could become campaign issues to challenge Gordon.\n\n\"Tom Gordon the brand was me. It wasn't him,\" Grimaldi said.\n\nGordon had been considered a possible candidate for governor, challenging Democrat U.S. Rep. John Carney, who entered the race earlier this year. But Gordon now says he is focused on running for another county term.\n\n\"We have been doing a lot. We are active on all fronts for providing the best public safety in the state of Delaware,\" Gordon said, pointing to his pledge to not raise taxes and hold surpluses level while overseeing high-profile projects like a new Route 9 library and the introduction of a stock exchange in Wilmington. \"My plan is to run for re-election.\"\n\nGrimaldi said he ran Gordon's polling both in the county and statewide and that his former boss is weak.\n\n\n\n\"He wanted to run for governor, but his poll numbers were in the toilet,\" Grimaldi said. \"He wants to run for county executive, but I think he is vulnerable.\"\n\nPolitical observers and would-be candidates had previously written off the idea of Gordon facing a challenger this year.\n\n\"I didn't see anybody who was even interested in challenging him,\" said Clark, who Gordon defeated in a democratic primary leading to his most recent election.\n\nClark said he also hasn't given much thought to another run, partially because of Gordon's momentum as incumbent. Grimaldi's threats change the outlook, he said.\n\n\n\n\"People who are that close know a lot about each other and it will depend on what Mr. Grimaldi knows and can prove,\" Clark said. \"It is a messy, terrible divorce. If it got to the point where Gordon was not as viable a candidate, I would consider (running).\"\n\nMark Blake, vice president of the Greater Hockessin Area Development Association, said Grimaldi is a game-changer. Blake, a Republican, was defeated by Gordon in the most recent general election.\n\n\"I think it was a forgone conclusion that Tom was going to run for an unprecedented fourth term and it would have been a slam dunk,” he said. “I have no doubts in my mind. With the things he has done in the first few years, he set himself up. Now, I think it is questionable.”\n\nBlake said he has not ruled out running.\n\nGordon said he would not comment on Grimaldi's threat to run.\n\n\"I’m not going to respond to you with that. Anybody has the right to run for anything,\" Gordon said. \"This is November, you have to wait until we get closer to a real race before I start boasting or pumping my chest.\"\n\nSome also doubt Grimaldi, a New Yorker who has only been in the Delaware public eye as Gordon's aide, has the base to mount such a challenge. They note Grimaldi can be seen as complicit in anything he might air to damage his former boss.\n\n\"Anybody can challenge but I don't think he could put a significant challenge together. He has no base. He is considered an out-of-stater,\" Smiley said. \"If there are skeletons that have accumulated over the past few years in county government, Grimaldi is probably behind the creation of most of them.\"\n\nCouncilman Jea Street argued Gordon's hiring judgment isn't bad on average.\n\n\"He has 20 cabinet people to pick (in an administration). If you are limited to one situation that becomes contentious, you are doing pretty well.\"\n\nStreet noted Grimaldi was working on important initiatives like keeping the Chemours Co. in downtown Wilmington. He said Gordon needs to move fast to name a permanent replacement.\n\nGuy, the interim chief administrative officer, said he plans to keep moving forward. Guy is a former Wilmington City Council member and attorney who the state Supreme Court in 2001 suspended from practicing law for seven months. The action was because of “failure to provide competent representation on behalf of two clients” and “making a false statement about a member of the judiciary,\" according to the court decision.\n\n\"(Gordon) is a hands-on executive. There is no major balls that are going to be dropped because they can’t be picked up,\" Guy said.\n\nGrimaldi disagrees, especially regarding his role in the Chemours and stock exchange discussions.\n\n“We were right on the cusp of major economic development deals where I was the point of contact of the stock exchange and the deal to keep Chemours in Wilmington. There are thousands of jobs hanging in the balance,” Grimaldi said. “I don’t believe he has anybody in his administration that can fill that void.”\n\nGrimaldi’s attorney, David Finger, said his client is owed a severance and money for unused vacation. He is also looking at whether his termination would violate any laws dealing with employer retaliation for whistleblowers.\n\nNow out of a job, Grimaldi said he previously didn't see himself as someone who would run for office.\n\n“I never wanted to do this. This is not something I intended to do. I did get into public service for the right reason,” Grimaldi said. “I enjoy public service and feel some responsibility for the things that have gone on in the past year and I want to correct them.”\n\nGordon said Grimaldi may have been judged too harshly. He said he doesn’t regret hiring him.\n\n\"I saw this young man. I knew some of the issues, but I thought he was bright enough to give a chance,\" Gordon said. \"I don’t think David Grimaldi was a failure. I still think he has qualities.”\n\nContact Xerxes Wilson at (302) 324-2787 or xwilson@delawareonline.com.

It is adjacent to a planned shopping center that will be known Huber's Crossing. The property is between Del. 1 on the east and U.S. 13 to the west as well as Pole Bridge Road to the north and Bayview Road to the south.\n\nThe station will be next to an Odessa Fire Company station on the north side of the property, Bell said.\n\nCouncilman Bill Powers, who also represents the county below the canal, said the land is in the ideal place because of quick access to nearby major highways.\n\nThe county has $4.2 million set aside for the study and construction of a southern EMS station. The station's design still needs to be finalized and bid so the total cost is unclear.\n\nLawrence E. Tan, chief of New Castle County's Emergency Medical Services, said the design will parallel those created when Odessa was being considered t for the station.\n\nThat station was to be a 12,000-square-foot facility with space for six emergency vehicles.

Nearby residents were being told to stay in their homes. All traffic was stopped on the bridge at the tail end of the busy Thanksgiving weekend.\n\nDavid Irwin, chairman of the New Castle County Local Emergency Planning Committee, said the response was exactly right and mirrored what they had just trained for.\n\nHolloway Terrace Fire Co. was the lead decision-maker on scene. They were ultimately responsible for making the call to shut down the nearby highway and bridge with close coordination and support from Croda, state and county officials and the Delaware River and Bay Authority, which owns the bridge.\n\nWhile some people complained of breathing issues and eye irritation, those on scene and with knowledge of the response said everything went according to plan.\n\nIn the days after the release, Croda said the culprit was a failed gasket. But other questions remain.\n\nNeither Croda nor DNREC officials have said how much gas leaked. And many have questions about why more people were not alerted, why the area was not evacuated and just how much danger they may have been in.\n\n'We need to know the details': Croda neighbors have ‘right to know’ extent of gas leak\n\nMany of those answers are in the emergency plans, which should be available to the public.\n\nA federal community right-to-know law called the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act requires emergency management plans and other data be accessible to the public.\n\nBut the fear of that information getting into the hands of terrorists has made some emergency plan-related documents difficult to access — if they can be accessed at all —- since 9/11, Irwin said.\n\nThe News Journal has been requesting access to those documents, specifically in regard to Croda, since the leak. County and state officials have either denied those requests or have yet to make them available.\n\n\"Whatever laws they’re using to justify the secrecy of this particular incident at Croda, certainly the spirit of openness and transparency needs to be paramount here,\" said John Flaherty of the Delaware Coalition for Open Government. \"In this case, we're not even looking at the answers. We're looking at the supporting documentation that they have been inspected and are operating in the public's interest.\"\n\nFederal officials immediately granted a request to review one document at the federal reading room in Philadelphia, but it shed little light on the specifics of what happens in case of an emergency at Croda.\n\n\"As far as we were concerned, we proved once again that pre-planning, tabletop exercises and ongoing training provides maximum safety to the community, to the site and to the environment,\" Irwin said, adding that no one was injured that night.\n\nIrwin said that late August drill was the first exercise done regarding the manufactured ethylene oxide with Croda, an international specialty chemical manufacturing company.\n\nInternationally, ethylene oxide is used as a fumigant and fungicide, to make ethylene glycol for antifreeze, to sterilize medical equipment and other consumer goods, and as a chemical intermediate, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nAt Croda, ethylene oxide is used in the company’s products. They use it to make liquids that combine mixtures that otherwise would separate, like face creams and cosmetics.\n\nIn 2015, Croda gained state approval to manufacture the chemical onsite instead of shipping it by train from Texas, reducing the risk of issues along the way.\n\nEthylene oxide is a widely used chemical, but is also extremely flammable and explosive when exposed to an ignition source. It reacts easily with other chemicals, is a known carcinogen and can cause serious respiratory problems when inhaled even for a short period of time.\n\nThe last serious incident involving the chemical occurred more than a decade ago at a sterilization plant in California, when it only took about 50 pounds of the gas to cause extensive structural damage and injure four people.\n\nThis year, Croda started manufacturing its own ethylene oxide by using corn-based bio-ethanol instead of petroleum-based hydrocarbons.\n\nFor now, Croda will not be manufacturing any ethylene oxide at the plant, said Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary Shawn Garvin.\n\nThat process will not restart until company and state officials are confident it can be done safely.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nThe most dangerous times at chemical manufacturing plants are usually when operations are starting or stopping, said Dr. Marc Levin, a clinical professor of energy production at Washington State University.\n\n\"Those are the nonroutine kind of operations,\" he said. \"There is risk associated with everything we do. It's about managing that risk, and it's fairly complex.\"\n\nAs Croda began a new operation at a decades-old facility along the Delaware River, an incorrect gasket installed during construction failed, leading to a leak of ethylene oxide.\n\n\"Unfortunately those things do happen,\" said Levin, who previously worked in private industry for refining operations, safety, and fire and explosion analysis for building siting. \"You try to make sure they're checked before-hand. Clearly this one slipped through. And you can't see gaskets once they're installed.\"\n\nBut unless nearby residents were checking documents posted on DNREC's online environmental navigator, they likely would not have known a process approved three years ago had just begun, said New Castle Councilman Jea Street about his constituents.\n\nThe Atlas Point facility has been the site of manufacturing operations for more than 75 years, before the Delaware Memorial Bridge was even built.\n\nThe nearly 180-acre site is also used by Fuji Film to manufacture ink and colorants mainly for ink-jet printers. That process takes place on a different part of the site.\n\nWas the emergency alert effective?\n\nIf the released chemical had met a spark and led to a fire or explosion, would people have been prepared? It depends on who you ask.\n\n\"I would say yes,\" said A.J. Schall Jr., director of the Delaware Emergency Management Agency. \"Is everything going to go according to plan without any speed bumps? I can't say that. It depends on what hand you're dealt.\"\n\nNew Castle County emergency management officials said they used a database of registered numbers and landlines to notify at-risk residents in the neighborhoods of Collins Park, Swanwyck, Buttonwood, Castle Hills and along Lukens Drive to stay inside, county's spokesman Jason Miller said.\n\nOf the 3,760 alerts, only 1,050 connected, Miller said.\n\n\"It's one of those things where cell phones have hurt us,\" said Schall. People who no longer have landlines and have not voluntarily signed up for Delaware's Code RED system would not have gotten those calls.\n\nLisa Lerch, who lives in Castle Hills and works across the street from Croda, learned about the leak on the news.\n\nLerch said working and living by the Cherry Lane chemical plant is a concern, she's adding gas masks to her home emergency kit.\n\n\"At work, it's a dead-end street,\" she said. \"You really can't get out if there is an emergency and someone's blocking it.\"\n\nDave Carpenter, the county's emergency management coordinator, said he believes enough was done to alert the public.\n\nThe county opted not to send messages to specific cell towers and alert all nearby cell phones.\n\nRob Snyder, deputy chief of Holloway Terrace Fire Company and the person in charge of the scene at the leak, said he asked the county to notify nearby residents with a reverse 9-1-1 call. He said, though, that he didn't know a cell phone alert could be sent.\n\nStreet, the councilman, said the notification was \"insufficient\" and having the plant so close to communities is \"an undue and unfair burden.\"\n\nIf people don't know what happens at the plant, and have not signed up with DEMA's notification system, they would likely be in the dark in the face of a chemical leak.\n\nNewly elected state representative Melissa Minor-Brown said she is urging Croda to be more transparent with the community. She and others attended a quarterly Community Advisory Committee meeting with Croda on Wednesday night.\n\nThat meeting is closed to the public and by invitation only, according to company spokeswoman Cara Eaton.\n\nMinor-Brown said Croda detailed the events of that Sunday evening and answered some concerns that were brought up.\n\n\"They have to publicly address the community,\" Minor-Brown said. \"Because people are afraid.\"\n\nHow to sign up for emergency notifications\n\nDelawareans have to create an account and sign up for emergency alerts online at dema.delaware.gov/services/DENS.shtml.\n\nWhat happened?\n\nNearly two weeks later, officials have not said how much ethylene oxide escaped into the atmosphere. State and company officials said that information will not be released until an investigation is complete.\n\n\"Things aren't always as they appear,\" Levin said. \"You have to check out various possible notions of what took place and verify everything.\"\n\nAfter discovering the leak, Croda notified local fire and police. Firefighters and state Hazmat experts used water to dissipate the chemical. Breaking up a vapor cloud can reduce the risk of fire or explosion if the gas meets an ignition source, experts told The News Journal.\n\nCroda officials, the commanding fire company and Hazmat experts decided the bridge should be closed to traffic. Delaware's Emergency Management Agency and county emergency officials were on standby if needed.\n\n\"During the incident, the facility was shut down safely and securely, containing the release,\" Eaton said in a press release the day after the leak. \"Independent monitoring during and after the incident has confirmed that there was no point at which there was an unsafe level of ethylene oxide in the air outside the facility perimeter.\"\n\nDNREC's Garvin had previously told The News Journal that state monitoring systems detected elevated levels of ethylene oxide. Some people nearby complained of nausea, headaches and other respiratory ailments, conditions that generally only appear when the chemical is encountered at relatively high concentrations.\n\nDelaware Memorial Bridge: Gas leak prompted fears of car fires, chemical exposure\n\nThe Delaware River and Bay Authority estimated that shutting down the bridge cost more than $120,000. The agency is deciding whether to seek compensation from Croda, Jim Salmon of DRBA said.\n\nLevin said his experience investigating similar incidents tells him it could take weeks or months to determine what went wrong and how much gas escaped.\n\nThe report of a bad gasket raises other questions, Levin said. Was it the wrong size? Wrong material? How did it get there? Are there problems elsewhere?\n\n\"You don't take anything for granted when you have a failure of any piece of equipment,\" Levin said. \"You look at everything and don't assume it was one certain thing or not. But I'm glad it was a gasket as opposed to an equipment failure. That would, generally, tell me that the release rate was lower than it could have been.\"\n\nContact reporter Maddy Lauria at (302) 345-0608, mlauria@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @MaddyinMilford.

The levels of the perfluorinated chemicals, better known as C8, found in wells near those locations rise far above the threshold recommended by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for short-term human exposure to the contaminants.\n\nContamination was detected in five wells near New Castle County Airport exposing more than 4,700 area residents over a two-year period to the chemical.\n\nHigh levels of the toxic chemicals have been linked to several illnesses including testicular and kidney cancers. However, since Delaware's PFOA and PFOS contamination was only discovered in 2014, it will not be clear for some time how the contamination is impacting residents' health.\n\n\"People don't cancer get at a rapid rate,\" said Alan Ducatman, chair of the community medicine department at West Virginia University's medical school. \"You have to start following a lot of people over time.\"\n\nEPA testing conducted in July 2014 found three wells in the City of New Castle had PFOA levels of 0.13 ppb, 0.094 ppb and 0.44 ppb and PFOS levels of 0.91 ppb, 0.82 ppb and 2.3 ppb. In Dover, tests revealed that a localized area of the Air Force Base had PFOS levels of 270 ppb and PFOA levels of 20 ppb.\n\nThe EPA Provisional Health Advisory for the chemicals said the maximum levels humans can safely be exposed to in drinking water is 0.2 ppb for PFOS and 0.4 ppb for PFOA.\n\nSTORY: Dover air base being reviewed for water contamination\n\nSTORY: New Castle caps chemical-fouled water wells\n\nAlong the Ohio River near Parkersburg is some of the world's worst PFOA contamination. The levels of PFOA discovered in that region's water districts is lower than levels reported at the Air Force Base. Little Hocking, Ohio, for example had a PFOA level of 3.30 ppb, according to a 2005 EPA report. Another water system in Lubeck, Ohio, had PFOA levels of 3.20 ppb.\n\nC8 has been linked to thyroid disease, high cholesterol, liver damage, testicular and kidney cancers and pregnancy-induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia.\n\nThe most recent data from the Delaware Department of Health and Human Services shows kidney cancer rates in Kent and New Castle counties, home to the two airfields, exceed the national average of 15.5 cases per 100,000 residents. Kent County has the state's highest incident of kidney cancer at 20.3 cases per 100,000 and New Castle County's kidney cancer rate is 16.4 cases per 100,000 residents. Sussex County where no PFOAs or PFOSs have been discovered, had a cancer rate of 14.7 cases per 100,000.\n\n\"PFOA attaches itself to the liver, followed by the blood, followed by the kidney,\" said Ducatman. \"It hits what we call our nuclear receptors.\"\n\nAmong all forms of cancer, Delaware's mortality rate between 2007 and 2011 was 184.2 cases 100,000, 6 percent higher than the national average of 173.8 cases per 100,000.\n\n\"Within DHSS we pay attention to health studies and what results we have in our database that might be relevant,\" said Ed Hallock, head of DHSS' Office of Drinking Water. No studies have yet linked Delaware's cancer rates to C8 contamination. \"Hopefully, we can't tie it back to the water.\"\n\nScientists say that just about everyone one Earth has traces of C8 in their bloodstream.\n\nDelaware isn't the only state battling PFOA issues. Three governors — New York's Andrew Cuomo, Vermont's Peter Shumlin and New Hampshire's Maggie Hassan — jointly authored a letter to EPA Administer Gina McCarthy. All three are dealing with PFOA-related compounds in public drinking water supplies.\n\n\"It is clear that PFOA contamination is not a state or regional problem — it's a national problem that requires federal guidelines and a consistent, science-based approach,\" the letter stated.\n\nJust across the Delaware River in Salem, New Jersey, sits Chambers Works, a former DuPont facility where Teflon was invented in 1938 and produced for many years. Chambers Works was transferred to Chemours as part of that company's spin off from DuPont last July and stopped Teflon production there.\n\nA group of Salem County residents filed a 2009 class-action lawsuit against DuPont claiming PFOA use at the plant tainted local drinking water. DuPont settled the case in 2011 for $8.3 million and admitted no wrongdoing. The company said at the time that settlement funds would be used to give members of the class-action suit the option of receiving a water filtration system or receiving the cash equivalent.\n\nIn 2007, a New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection report found PFOA levels in one Salem County well as high as 0.19 ppb. Of the 28 Salem County wells tested for the report, four came back with no traces of PFOA and nine were detected to have levels too low to quantify.\n\nDuPont has taken steps to eliminate the contamination around the Chambers Works plant, phasing out its use of PFOA at the site and around the world in 2013. The Environmental Working Group, which tracks PFOA contamination by state and county, said no PFOAs have been detected in Salem County as of 2015.\n\nSTORY: Chemical detection shuts public supply well\n\nSTORY: Toxic water found below Air Guard base\n\nChemours spokeswoman Janet Smith said the company routinely monitors the groundwater near Chambers Works to ensure \"protection and regulatory compliance.\" She said the company works closely with the EPA and state regulatory agencies to ensure it is following environmental guidelines. Chemours has never made or used PFOA since its launch last year.\n\nIf PFOAs from Chambers Works leaked into the Delaware River it would not impact the state's drinking water because there is no water system in Delaware that takes water directly from the river, Hallock said.\n\nThe culprit in Delaware, according to EPA studies, appears to be firefighting foam. Aqueous Film-Forming Foam, or AFFF, became popular with the military and some civilian fire departments for its ability to smother fires from combustible liquids such as jet fuel and petroleum.\n\nAFFF contains PFOS and another formulation of the foam purchased by the Department of Defense contains compounds that can break down into PFOA.\n\n3M manufactured PFOS-based AFFFs, but began to phase out using the toxic substance in its foam in 2002. Today, most firefighting foams contain neither PFOS nor PFOA in their original form, but can still break down into PFOA.\n\nAn EPA fact sheet on C8, released in December 2015, directly links the chemicals to the firefighting foam at Dover Air Force Base. A July 2014 fact sheet regarding the PFOA and PFOS levels around New Castle County Airport, however, does not provide a cause. State and local officials said they understand the New Castle PFOA and PFOS levels are related to foam used at the airport.\n\n\"We have heard it is firefighting foam, but the investigation hasn't been concluded by the EPA,\" said Pamela A. Patone, general manager for the Municipal Services Commission for the city of New Castle. \"I can't comment on what the EPA will do.\"\n\nThe Delaware Air National Guard stationed at New Castle County Airport still has AFFF on base, but has not used it since 2009, according to National Guard spokesman, Lt. Col. Len Gratteri.\n\nGratteri said the Air Guard is assisting with groundwater analysis and collaborating with the EPA and DNREC to determine possible sources of contamination.\n\nIn New Castle, city officials installed a carbon granulated water filtration system near the Airport in November to serve its 2,200 customers. The system is similar to the ones installed at the six water districts near Parkersburg that were impacted by PFOA contamination.\n\nPatone said the contaminated wells were shut down after the toxic chemicals were discovered, but have reopened since the filters were put in place. While the wells were shut down, the city bought water from Artesian Water Supply. The filter and water purchases have cost the city of New Castle $1.2 million.\n\nThe city regularly samples water from those wells.\n\n\"The only way to truly gauge the effectiveness of the treatment system is to test our water before it goes through the carbon filtration system and test if after it has been treated,\" said Jay Guyer, water supervisor for the city's Municipal Services Commission.\n\nGuyer said the system removes PFOA and PFOS after treatment, but prior to filtration chemical levels remain higher than the EPA's recommended guidelines.\n\n\"It hasn't gone down,\" Patone said of the water's PFOA and PFOS levels prior to filtration.\n\nQuestions about how much longer PFOA and PFOS will remain in the wells linger. The chemicals do not degrade in water. According to data from the EPA, the half-life of POFA and PFOS in water is 92 years and 41 years, respectively.\n\n\"Is the contamination slowing going away?\" Patone asked. \"These are questions we've asked as part of the thought process to be prepared in the future, but we don't have the answers to that.\"\n\nArtesian Water Co. shut two commercial wells in New Castle in June 2014 after PFOS was detected. Combined, the two wells serve 2,500 customers.\n\nOne of the wells, located in the Jefferson Farms neighborhood, returned online several months ago after the utility company spent roughly $1 million to install a carbon filtration system. The latest testing of untreated water at Jefferson Farms revealed PFOS levels ranging from .10 ppb to .59 ppb.\n\nThe subdivision, Wilmington Manor, has not been sampled since January of 2014 when it went offline. Joseph A. DiNunnzio, Artesian's senior vice president, said the last reading showed PFOS levels ranging from .93 to 1.8.\n\nA second well in Wilmington Manor remains out of service. DiNunnzio said the well will go back online once a filter is installed. He expects the filtration system to be installed within the next year or so.\n\n\"Because it is not a large water supply, there is not a sense of urgency,\" he said.\n\nThe carbon filter's cost has been passed on to Artesian's customers, an amount DiNunnzio estimates to be a couple of pennies a month for each customer. Once the responsible party is conclusively identified, he said, Artesian will pursue efforts to be reimbursed for expenses related to the filter.\n\n\"We are really interested in the EPA finishing the work to identify the responsible party or parties so they can pay to treat or remove the substance they placed into our supply,\" he said. \"It is a cost that should not be borne by our customers.\"\n\nDiNunnzio said he agreed with those in the state pointing at the National Guard's use of firefighting foam.\n\n\"I consider the National Guard the prime suspect, but it is important that the EPA conducts the proper analysis and review,\" he said. \"You don't want to call someone guilty until you have the evidence to prove it.\"\n\nThe Department of Defense this month announced it will test 665 military installations nationwide where fire or crash training using AFFF occurred, including Dover Air Force Base. Established in 1941, the base is home to the 436th Airlift Wing and the 512th Airlift Wing and the busiest air freight terminal in the Department of Defense. A force of about 11,100 is stationed there.\n\nDover City Manager Scott Koenig said the EPA tested the city's public water systems in December 2014 and, again, in July 2015. He said the testing did not discover any PFOA or PFOS in the drinking supply.\n\nThe Air Force Base uses its own water systems and does not feed into or take water from the city's public water utilities.\n\nDover Air Force Base transitioned to an AFFF product that does not contain PFOS prior to 2012, according to base spokesman, Master Sargent Jeremy Larlee. He said all firefighting foams used at the base are in compliance with EPA guidelines for these products.\n\nLarlee said the Air Force is currently working with EPA and state regulators to investigate contamination at Dover Air Force Base. In addition, the Air Force is investigating installations where PFOS and PFOA may have been released to assess the potential for human exposure and, if necessary, take action to protect human health, according to Larlee.\n\nRatsep said PFOA and PFOS exposure is limited to the areas surrounding the two airports.\n\n\"There has not been any other areas in the state that we've found as a potential source,\" he said.\n\nContact Jeff Mordock at (302) 324-2786, on Twitter @JeffMordockTNJ or jmordock@delawareonline.com.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/08/29/nuisance-property-in-new-castle-becomes-new-home-for-foster-youth/70651475007/", "title": "Nuisance property in New Castle becomes new home for foster youth", "text": "An estimated 22% of foster children experience homelessness within one year of leaving the foster care system. The lack of stable housing poses numerous obstacles for these young individuals, including difficulties in finding employment, accessing healthcare and obtaining an education. However, there is hope on the horizon for four young women.\n\nThanks to the effective coordination of resources by New Castle County's Vacant Spaces to Livable Places program at the county, state, and federal levels, these women will soon have a secure and safe home.\n\nUnveiled in a ceremony attended by state and county representatives, a custom-built four-bedroom, two-bath house in Minquadale will be called home by young women who've aged out of foster care. The residence will be owned and managed by Duffy's Hope, a nonprofit that has provided after-school and summer youth programs to Wilmington-area children and their families for 25 years.\n\nHowever, not long ago, the property was hardly desirable. The transformation of this home begins with blight and neglect in the New Castle County community of Minquadale.\n\nMinquadale is a sliver of a neighborhood sandwiched between Route 13 outside of Wilmington and I-295 as it branches to New Jersey. Residents actively keep up with issues in the neighborhood, and the abandoned property on Delmar Street was a cause for alarm. The lot full of high grass and weeds was a breeding ground for parasites and varmin, and the structure's roof had caved in. Minquadale Civic Association representatives brought neighbors' concerns to the attention of county officials.\n\nDuring the ceremony, County Executive Matt Meyer said after listening to civic association leaders, he learned that the property was \"something the neighborhood was embarrassed about.\" Meyer said that the county responded to residents' concerns through code enforcement. However, despite repeated citations for violating county codes and laws, the property owner took no action.\n\nBALLIN' WITH CELEBRITIES:Duffy's Hope charity basketball game brings Jimmie Allen and other stars to Wilmington\n\nEventually, the county was able to take control of the property and put it up for auction at a sheriff's sale. But with its extensive structural damage, no one bid on it. Due to its continuing cost to taxpayers, it was placed in New Castle County's Vacant Spaces to Livable Places program.\n\nCounty program addresses blight, financial drain\n\nPrior to the pandemic, New Castle County had a growing problem with vacant and neglected properties like the one in Minquadale. These types of properties were found to attract nuisance and criminal activity, drain public resources and depress property values. In addition, they imposed a financial burden on the public in terms of reduced funding for schools, fire, police, and paramedic services and increased code enforcement costs.\n\nTo address these concerns, New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer initiated the Vacant Spaces to Livable Places program to develop and rehabilitate vacant lots and blighted properties.\n\nCounty officials said since the program was launched in 2017, more than 700 homes and vacant lots have been transformed into affordable housing. As a result, the program reduced the number of vacant properties in the county by 53%, while generating $3.4 million in back taxes, fees, and fines and returning more than $1.7 million to New Castle County school districts.\n\nTouting its success the county noted the Vacant Spaces to Livable Places program was recognized with a national award at the 2023 National Association of Counties for its effectiveness in redeveloping property for productive use.\n\nA transitional home for young women in need of support\n\nAccording to Delaware's Division of Services for Children, Youth and Their Families, at any given time, there are more than 500 children in Delaware who are in need of foster families. Ideally, these children will be reunited with their parents or extended family once the circumstances that led to the foster placement have been resolved. When this goal is not achieved, children remain in the foster care system until age 18.\n\nAt age 18, former foster children must begin to build their adult lives. Many do not have families who can provide the necessary support most young adults need to explore options.\n\nCompared to the general population, young people who are emancipated from the foster care system are at a higher risk of experiencing homelessness, not completing their education, being arrested, and struggling with emotional and mental health issues, including a reported prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder similar to that of many U.S. war veterans. Additionally, 7 out of 10 young women experience pregnancy before age 21, while 82% of males report having been arrested by age 21.\n\nApproximately 100 youths age out of Delaware’s foster care system every year.\n\nThe nonprofit Duffy's Hope aims to give four young women a chance to beat the odds. \"We're going to bring them in, and they might be hopeless, but we're going to make them hopeful,\" said Allen \"Duffy\" Samuels, founder and executive director of Duffy's Hope.\n\nThe county knocked down the old dilapidated structure on the lot, leaving space for the new 1,512-square-foot modular unit featuring four bedrooms, two full baths and a back deck overlooking a spacious yard. The organization still has to complete the settlement process before they will officially be the legal owners of the property. However, the expectation is that the former foster youth will move in by the end of September, Samuels said.\n\nThe program at the Minquadale residence will offer comprehensive support services including educational opportunities, job training, career counseling and mental health therapy to assist the recently emancipated women as they navigate their transition into adulthood. Case managers and therapists will have an office in the home to work out of when visiting, but they will not live at the location.\n\n\"We want these kids living independently,\" Samuels explained.\n\nMost federal programs that offer transitional care typically end when the individual ages to 21 years old. However, certain states, such as Delaware, have chosen to extend transitional services until age 23. Samuels said the young women ages 18 to 21 who will live at the Duffy's Hope home can stay at the home until age 24.\n\nIn addition to Duffy's Hope, there are six other organizations throughout Delaware providing independent living services to youth in foster care.\n\nContact reporter Anitra Johnson at ajohnson@delawareonline.com.

Williams welcoming the ride-hailing service Uber to Wilmington has irked taxi drivers, who say taxpayer money shouldn’t be used to publicize a business that is undercutting them.\n\n“The people that used to ride with us, they do not ride with us,” said Anthony Eber, owner of New Castle-based Family Taxi Co., which operates in Wilmington.\n\nThe city Office of Economic Development is spending $8,000 under a one-month contract for four billboards with the message “Wilmington proudly welcomes UBER” and a picture of Williams. The billboards also include a website address where residents can apply to become a driver for the service.\n\nThe billboards are on West Lea Boulevard near North Market Street, Lancaster Avenue near DuPont Street, Augustine Road near West 18th Street, and South Walnut Street near the Amtrak station.\n\nUber uses a smartphone app to connect drivers and customers who need rides and pay by credit card.\n\nOfficials for Uber and the state Division of Motor Vehicles last month reached an agreement to write guidelines for private car providers to operate legally in Delaware. Previously, Delaware regulations were unclear about whether the service was allowed, and drivers operated in a gray area. Uber drivers often were seen around the Amtrak station in downtown Wilmington.\n\nWilliams met with Uber officials last year and advocated for the company to enter the Wilmington market, over the objection of cab drivers who said the service is an unfair competition.\n\n“It’s an open market,” Williams told The News Journal in November. “If the cabbies are doing a good job, I don’t think they should worry about competition. That’s the way I feel about it.”\n\nWilliams did not respond to an interview request for this story, but his spokeswoman, Alexandra Coppadge, in an email said the billboards deliver a message the city wants to send.\n\n“Uber provides a safe and convenient new transportation option for the city of Wilmington, but more importantly, it provides the livability of our city by making it easier for people to move around and get from place to place,” she said. “As Uber is a new, innovative business, the city is looking to welcome and attract more businesses of that nature.”\n\nUnder the state agreement, drivers for ride-share services must undergo a background check, have minimum insurance and can’t pick up fares from outside train stations and other areas.\n\nDelaware requires taxi cab operators to pay about $5,000 in fees and taxes annually and undergo inspections twice a year. The state has 64 registered cab companies.\n\nHamid Messari, who owns Emerald Cab Co. in Newark, said cabs are more reliable and safer than Uber cars because the service is regulated more stringently. Messari said he and other cab company owners are considering unionizing to fight the expansion.\n\n“At least then, our voice will be listened to,” Messari said.\n\nUber also operates in neighboring Pennsylvania, New Jersey and parts of Maryland. The company, launched in 2009, operates in 52 countries and has been the subject of ongoing regulatory and legal issues, including a government probe into whether it violates labor laws. A class action lawsuit in San Francisco also seeks to reimburse 160,000 California drivers for mileage and tips.\n\nStatistics about the exact number of registered Uber users in Delaware were not immediately available. Company spokesman Taylor Bennett in an email said it has “hundreds of driver partners in the state.”\n\nBennett said Uber officials “appreciate Mayor Williams for ensuring Wilmington residents are aware of not only the safe and reliable rides available through Uber, but also of the greater economic opportunity to earn an income.”\n\nWilmington Economic Development Director Jeff Flynn said it is the first time the city has done a billboard campaign for a new company establishing itself in the city. The money is from the department advertising fund, which mostly is used to publicize events.\n\nCoppadge said they decided to pay for the Uber ads because the company is unique compared to other businesses coming to the city, in that community members can immediately start earning money. The web address on the billboard lets residents get more information about signing up to drive for the company. The city consulted with Uber about the design, she said.\n\n“You’d be surprised how many people don’t know that Uber is here,” Coppadge said. “Not just for the opportunity to use the service but to start earning an income.”\n\nEber said he already gets calls frequently from people asking for his rate and hanging up without requesting service. He said he thinks they are comparing his price to Uber. Cab prices are more expensive, he said, because of the cost of state regulations placed on the companies, and questions the motivation of Williams to sponsor ads for a competitor.\n\n“He is trying to create a big problem,” Eber said.\n\nThe ads will be in place through Aug. 31.\n\nCoppadge said city officials believe that Uber service will not impact the bottom line for cab companies because taxis primarily service the Wilmington Amtrak station and hotels, while Uber cars will service homes and locations where cabs are not normally spotted.\n\n“I think it is important to recognize that this, like any other business, there is competition,” Coppadge said.\n\nContact Jenna Pizzi at jpizzi@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2837.
