Read below the photo gallery for a recap of all the picks and the highlights.\n\nIndiana Fever select Caitlin Clark with No. 1 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nNEW YORK — Caitlin Clark, the prolific shooting guard from Iowa who set the NCAA all-time scoring mark and ushered in a newfound popularity for women’s basketball that reaped records for attendance and television viewership, was selected No. 1 overall in the WNBA Draft by the Indiana Fever on Monday night.\n\nClark joins a Fever team with 2023 WNBA Rookie of the Year Aliyah Boston. The Fever finished 13-27 last season and missed the postseason in each of the past seven seasons. Now, the Fever already are seeing action at sportsbooks as being one of the few betting favorites to win the championship.\n\nThe 22-year-old native of West Des Moines, Iowa, electrified crowds wherever she played this season because of her shooting range, regularly hitting logo 3-pointers with ease, and her playmaking ability, routinely setting up teammates for easy scores.\n\nClark led the Hawkeyes to a second consecutive national championship game appearance, where they lost to South Carolina. While doing so, she led the nation in eight offensive categories, including scoring 31.6 points per game, 3-point makes and 3-point attempts. She also ranked second in assists per game while averaging 7.4 rebounds. She finished her career with 3,951 points, and a record 548 3-point makes.\n\nShe leaves Iowa with an impressive individual trophy haul, winning the AP Player of the Year award, Wooden Award, and Naismith Award twice each.\n\nThe anticipation of Clark coming into the league is virtually unmatched, with teams changing venues for Fever games and selling out tickets in anticipation of her playing in their cities. The Connecticut Sun, which open their season against the Fever at home, sold nearly 800 tickets within 24 hours of the schedule being released. The Las Vegas Aces, the two-time defending champions, moved their July 2 home game against Indiana from the 12,000-seat Michelob Ultra Arena to T-Mobile Arena, which has a capacity of 20,000.\n\nEven the WNBA Draft, which was open to fans for the first time in eight years, sold out its 1,000 ticket allotment at the Brooklyn Academy of Music within 15 minutes of going on sale. — Scooby Axson\n\nCaitlin Clark shares her thoughts after being drafted No. 1 overall\n\nCaitlin Clark spoke at length after be selected by the Indiana Fever with the No. 1 overall pick in Monday night's draft. Read what college basketball's all-time leading scorer said after she was drafted in this Q&A here.\n\nLos Angeles Sparks select Cameron Brink with No. 2 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nCameron Brink is headed to Los Angeles as the newest addition to the Sparks. Brink, a 6-4 forward from Stanford, was selected as the No. 2 pick in Monday night's draft.\n\nBrink, who won the 2021 national championship with the Cardinal, was named the Pac-12 Player of the Year after dominating on both ends of the court all season. Besides her prowess on the hardwood, Brink, known for her physical play and signature blond braids, has a solid NIL portfolio and family ties to NBA star Stephen Curry. Cameron Brink averaged 17.4 points and 11.9 rebounds per game this season with Stanford. Her boards average ranks third in the country. She also led the nation with 3.74 blocks per outing. — Victoria Hernandez\n\nChicago Sky select Kamilla Cardoso with No. 3 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nKamilla Cardoso, a 6-7 center from Brazil who led South Carolina to the 2024 NCAA championship, was taken by the Chicago Sky with the No. 3 pick in Monday's draft.\n\nCardoso's stock is higher after a strong run in the NCAA Tournament, including 15 points, 17 rebounds, and three blocks in the national championship game. She earned tournament Most Outstanding Player honors after South Carolina's run to another title. She's a force on the defensive end and is improving on offense as a post scorer.\n\nCardoso will be coached in Chicago by another Hall of Fame point guard in Teresa Weatherspoon after Dawn Staley coached her in South Carolina.\n\n\"It means the most to me and that I’m in good hands,\" Cardoso said. — Ayrton Ostly\n\nLos Angeles Sparks select Rickea Jackson with No. 4 pick in the 2024 WNBA draft\n\nRickea Jackson, a 6-2 forward who starred at Tennessee, joined No. 2 pick Cameron Brink in Los Angeles when she was selected by the Sparks with the No. 4 pick.\n\nHer size will help her make an immediate impact for the Sparks, a team looking to get back to the top of the league (and back to the playoffs). Per ESPN, Jackson was one of only five SEC players to average 20 points and five rebounds per game over multiple seasons. Her versatility will be huge as she moves on to the pros, and her explosive first step will help her get to the rim pretty much anytime she wants. She has a thin frame but is stronger than she looks, which allows her to finish through contact. I expect both her and Brink to play a ton of minutes (though it's worth pointing out that Brink will have to learn how to play without fouling).\n\n“I’m honored, honestly,\" Jackson said after being drafted. \"I feel like what Cam and I bring is foundational. I feel like we’re willing to put in the work, we’re willing to do whatever as rookies.” — Lindsay Schnell\n\nDallas Wings select Jacy Sheldon with No. 5 pick in the WNBA draft\n\nJacy Sheldon, a 5-10 All American guard out of Ohio State, is heading to Dallas after the Wings drafted her with the No. 5 pick in Monday's draft.\n\nSheldon is one of the top guards in this draft not named Caitlin Clark. She's a plus defender and three-point shooter that could help on both ends immediately. She averaged 17.8 points, 3.2 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.9 steals per game in her final season with the Buckeyes. — Ayrton Ostly\n\nWashington Mystics select Aaliyah Edwards with No. 6 pick in the 2024 WNBA draft\n\nAaliyah Edwards, a 6-3 forward who helped lead UConn back to the Final Four this season, was taken by the Washington Mystics with the No. 6 pick.\n\nEdwards, a two-time All American, could have an immediate impact. She's a very good defender and improving as a post scorer and jump shooter. She averaged 17.6 points, 9.2 rebounds, 2.1 assists, 1.7 steals and 1 block per game in the 2023-24 season. — Ayrton Ostly\n\nChicago Sky select Angel Reese with No. 7 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nAngel Reese is headed from the Bayou to the Windy City after being drafted by the Chicago Sky with the No. 7 pick in the WNBA draft. Reese will team with Kamilla Cardoso, whom the Sky selected with the No. 3 overall pick.\n\n\"She's a great player and I'm a great player,\" Cardoso said after learning the news. \"Nobody's gonna get more rebounds than us.\"\n\nReese, who led the Lady Tigers to last year's NCAA title and was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, was a first-team All-American this season, averaging 18.6 points and 13.4 rebounds per game. She averaged 20.9 points and 14.4 rebounds in for the Tigers over her last two seasons and would likely continue as a walking double-double in the WNBA.\n\n\"My first time playing Kamilla was on one of the biggest stages of my life, which was when she played for Hamilton Heights and I played for St. Frances in high school and we battled,\" Reese said after she was drafted. \"Now, being able to be teammates is gonna be amazing.\n\n\"I actually talked to her earlier, was congratulating her. I know she just came off an amazing run, an amazing college career. I’m looking forward to playing with her in practice and in games, just bouncing off of each other, so I’m excited for this. — Steve Gardner and Ayrton Ostly\n\nMinnesota Lynx select Alissa Pili with No. 8 pick in the 2024 WNBA draft\n\nAlissa Pili will join the Minnesota Lynx after being taken with the No. 8 pick in Monday's draft.\n\nRebecca Lobo said it best: Alissa Pili is an intriguing, unique talent. The No. 8 pick who will head to Minnesota, Pili is wildly efficient. Though she's undersized at 6-foot-2, she's extremely strong and crafty around the bucket, able to score on players who are (considerably) bigger than her. Need proof of just how good she is? She scored 37 points (37!) on South Carolina -- yes that's the national champion Gamecocks, who were the top defensive team in the country this season. — Lindsay Schnell\n\nDallas Wings select Carla Leite with No. 9 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nCarla Leite, a 5-9 guard from France, was taken by the Dallas Wings with the No. 9 pick in Monday's draft. She will join Jacy Sheldon, who the Wings took with the No. 5 pick.\n\nConnecticut Sun select Leila Lacan with No. 10 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nLeila Lacan, a 5-11 guard from France, was taken by the Connecticut Sun with the No. 10 pick in Monday's draft. Lacan was the second consecutive French player taken in the first round after the Dallas Wings took Carla Leite at No. 9.\n\nNew York Liberty select Marquesha Davis with No. 11 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nMarquesha Davis, a 6-0 guard who played at Ole Miss, will make Brooklyn her new home after the New York Liberty selected her with the No. 11 pick in Monday's draft.\n\nThe McGegee, Arkansas, native averaged 14 points, 4.7 rebounds, 1.2 assists and 1.5 steals per game as a senior. She also shot 44.7% from the floor and 23.9% from 3. — Rachel G. Bowers\n\nAtlanta Dream select Nyadiew Puoch with No. 12 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nAustralian players have had a lot of success in the WNBA over the years, and now a new player is headed to the league.\n\nNyadiew Pouch was taken by the Atlanta Dream with the final pick of the first round. Another top international player in this draft, the 6-foot-3 forward is a very good rim protector and is improving her jumper and playmaking on the offensive end. — Ayrton Ostly\n\nAngel Reese looking forward to playing in Chicago for T-Spoon\n\nAngel Reese looked like a star ready to take over the league as she strolled on the orange carpet, posing for photographs before the WNBA draft in a sparkly black dress, befitting her self-proclaimed moniker \"Bayou Barbie.\"\n\nThe Chicago Sky drafted the LSU star with No. 7 pick in the WNBA draft. Reese says she lives by the motto, “Every day the sun don’t shine, that’s why I love tomorrow.\"\n\nBefore the draft, Reese said it didn’t matter to her where she got drafted, what was more important was going into the right fit and a chance to showcase her skills, which included 61 double-doubles in the last two seasons.\n\nThe Sky is coached by Hall of Famer Teresa Weatherspoon, who was coached by LSU coach Kim Mulkey when she was an assistant at Louisiana Tech.\n\n\"Knowing the conversations were so good, she felt like a mother to me. Being able to be a black woman as a head coach,\" Reese said. \"I just knew everything they were bringing to the table. I'm super excited for this move and looking forward to getting to Chicago.\" — Scooby Axson\n\nChicago Sky select Brynna Maxwell with the No. 13 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Gonzaga\n\nMazwell averaged 12.9 points and 3.2 rebounds for the Bulldogs while shooting 43.7% from the field.\n\nSeattle Storm select Nika Mühl with No. 14 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, UConn\n\nMühl improved her stock by holding strong against Clark in the Final Four, showcasing her defensive prowess. She's a good jump shooter as well and led a talented UConn offense in assists per game (6.5). — Ayrton Ostly\n\nIndiana Fever select Celeste Taylor with No. 15 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Ohio State\n\nTaylor averaged 10.1 points, 4.1 rebounds, 3.4 assists and 2.5 steals per game over 32 contests this season. — Rachel G. Bowers\n\nLas Vegas Aces select Dyaisha Fair with No. 16 pick in WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Syracuse\n\nFair became the third all-time leading scorer in women's college basketball history after surpassing Kelsey Mitchell (3,402, Ohio State) and Jackie Stiles (3,393, Mississippi State) in late March. She averaged 22.0 points, 4.7 rebounds, 3.5 assists and 2.2 steals per game in the regular season this year. Fair has knocked down 107 3-pointers this season, trailing only Clark (173), and was named to the 2024 All-ACC First Team. — Cydney Henderson\n\nNew York Liberty select Esmery Martinez with No. 17 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Arizona\n\nMartinez averaged 10.4 point and 8.3 rebounds and shot 46.4% from the field for the Wildcats.\n\nLas Vegas Aces select Kate Martin with No. 18 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Iowa\n\nMartin averaged 7.8 points, 4.6 rebounds and three assists while shooting 46.4% from the field while teaming with Caitlin Clark on the Hawkeyes.\n\nConnecticut Sun select Taiyanna Jackson with No. 19 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nCenter, Kansas\n\nJackson averaged 12.4 points and 10. 4 rebounds, while shooting 62% from the field for the Jayhawks\n\nAtlanta Dream select Isobel Borlase with No. 20 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Australia\n\nBorlase plays for the Adelaide Lightning in Australia's Women's National Basketball League\n\nWashington Mystics select Kaylynne Truong with No. 21 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Gonzaga\n\nTruong averaged 9.4 points, 3.9 assists and 2.1 rebounds for the Bulldogs.\n\nConnecticut Sun select Helena Pueyo with No. 22 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Arizona\n\nThe Spanish native averaged 9.7 points, 3.7 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 3.2 steals for the Wildcats in 2023-24.\n\nNew York Liberty select Jessika Carter with No. 23 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nCenter, Mississippi State\n\nCarter averaged 11.5 points, 7.4 rebounds and shot 54.2% from the field for the Bulldogs. She's a reliable shot blocker on defense and a solid scorer on offense. She'd provide depth immediately. — Ayrton Ostly\n\nLas Vegas Aces select Elizabeth Kitley with No. 24 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nCenter, Virginia Tech\n\nKitley did not play in the NCAA Tournament after suffering an ACL tear in Virginia Tech's regular-season finale. Kitley, a 6-6 grad student from Summerfield, North Carolina, led Virginia Tech to the program’s first Final Four last season. She was again having an All-America campaign in 2023-24 averaging 22.8 points, 11.4 rebounds and 2.1 blocks before her injury. — Eddie Timanus\n\nPhoenix Mercury select Charisma Osborne with No. 25 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, UCLA\n\nSeattle Storm select Mackenzie Holmes with No. 26 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nForward, Indiana\n\nIndiana Fever select Leilani Correa with No. 27 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Florida\n\nLos Angeles Sparks select Mackenzie Forbes with No. 28 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nForward, Southern California\n\nPhoenix Mercury select Jaz Shelley with No. 29 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Nebraska\n\nWashington Mystics select Nastja Claessens with No. 30 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Belgium\n\nMinnesota Lynx select Kiki Jefferson with No. 31 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Louisville\n\nAtlanta Dream select Matilde Villa with No. 32 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Italy\n\nDallas Wings select Ashley Owusu with No. 33 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Penn State\n\nConnecticut Sun select Abbey Hsu with No. 34 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nGuard, Columbia\n\nNew York Liberty select Kaitlyn Davis with No. 35 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nForward, Southern California\n\nLas Vegas Aces select Angel Jackson with No. 36 pick in 2024 WNBA draft\n\nCenter, Jackson State\n\nJackson became the second HBCU player to be drafted in the last 20 years, joining Meshya Williams-Holliday, who was selected by the Indiana Fever in the third round of the 2022 WNBA draft.\n\nHow Angel Reese will fit in with the Chicago Sky. It all starts with rebounding\n\nAngel Reese is brash, bold and, in college at least, one of the best ballers in the country.\n\nBut how does her game translate to the WNBA?\n\nMonday night, Reese was selected by the Chicago Sky with the No. 7 overall pick, joining SEC rival Kamilla Cardoso from South Carolina, who the Sky took No. 3 overall, and Gonzaga sharpshooter Brynna Maxwell, who they drafted at No. 13 overall.\n\nReese is an intriguing pro prospect. She’s a tremendous athlete with a great motor, a gifted rebounder who reads the ball off the glass extremely well. At LSU this season, she averaged 18.6 points and 13.4 rebounds per game, one of just a handful of players in women’s college basketball to average a double-double.\n\nBut one important thing to note about all those double-doubles: Reese rebounds a lot of her own misses, something that likely won’t be available to her in the WNBA because other forwards will grab the board first — including her teammates.\n\nReach Lindsay Schnell's full analysis here.\n\nWNBA commissioner sidesteps question on All-Star Game in Arizona – an anti-abortion state\n\nFor a league so outspoken about women’s rights, it might surprise people to learn that the WNBA will hold the 2024 All-Star Game in Phoenix.\n\nJust last week, the Arizona Supreme Court voted to enforce a near-total abortion ban that dates to 1864, a decision that does not reflect the values of one of the nation's most progressive professional sports leagues.\n\nWNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert did not answer a question about if the league discussed moving the 2024 All-Star Game during her pre-draft remarks to media Monday night. The game is scheduled for July 20 and was announced in March. — Lindsay Schnell and Nancy Armour\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWhat makes Caitlin Clark so good?\n\nWe asked some hoops legends for their thoughts on the generational talent. Steph Curry, Maya Moore, Kelsey Mitchell and others broke down her game, explaining what makes her so special.\n\nWhat's the most important thing Caitlin Clark will bring to her new WNBA team? She explains.\n\nCaitlin Clark is well-known for her incredible shooting – go watch videos of those logo threes – but the likely No. 1 overall pick, says scoring may not be the biggest thing she brings to the WNBA.\n\n\"I think the biggest thing is my passing,\" Clark said during a conversation with LaChina Robinson, Carolyn Peck and Chiney Ogwumike during ESPN's pre-draft show. \"I think that's kind of what people overlooked sometimes in college. People just love the scoring so much, and don't get me wrong, I love shooting the ball, but I think that's the biggest thing. And obviously being surrounded by so much talent no matter where I end up – the league is loaded with so many people – I think (passing) is something I always had a knack for.\n\n\"I grew up playing soccer and understanding angles and seeing the game before it even happens. And I think once I get playing with my teammates, they'll be able to read me too and read my eyes. I love playing with good post players. I love playing with good guards and wings. And that's what this league is all about.\"\n\nMore teams coming to WNBA, but how soon?\n\nWNBA expansion is on everyone’s mind, including WNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert's.\n\nDuring her pre-draft availability Monday evening Engelbert said “our plan and goal is to get to 16 teams in the next few years” — but she wouldn’t give a specific timeline.\n\nLate in 2023, it was reported that Portland would be the 14th team and begin play in 2025, the same season the Bay Area team is slated to begin play. But then Portland fell apart as an immediate expansion city for a variety of reasons, meaning the league will play with just 13 teams in 2025.\n\nOther cities are in discussions with the league to bring a WNBA team to their neighborhood, including Philadelphia, Nashville, Denver, Toronto and others (Portland is also still in consideration).\n\n“By 2028 I feel pretty confident we’ll be at 16 teams,” Engelbert said.\n\nShe added that there are no details to share yet on the expansion draft that will be necessary before the 2025 season, but said it’s likely to take place in December of this year.\n\nWomen's basketball is rising, but issues like travel still exist for WNBA\n\nWNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert can't stop gushing about the rise of the game, which is more popular than ever before. And she's convinced it's only going to get better. \"Women’s basketball is not a fad, Engelbert said. \"We’ve been steadily building this momentum for years, and we're ready for what's next.\"\n\nAll that being said, the W still will not charter planes for every trip, a major issue across the league that players have been outspoken about for years. The league does provide charters for the entirety of the playoffs and all back-to-back games – there are numerous back-to-backs this season because the schedule is tightly compressed with the 2024 Summer Olympics break – but for regular season games, it sounds like it'll continue to be commercial flights for many of the world's best athletes.\n\nTickets to watch WNBA draft in person sold out FAST\n\nThis is the first year since 2016 that the WNBA Draft has had fans in attendance, which is interesting. Commissioner Cathy Engelbert said tickets sold out in less than 30 minutes, which is par for the course where Caitlin Clark is concerned. Engelbert has called the rise of women's basketball over the last year \"a transformational moment in sports.\"\n\nWill Caitlin Clark play in 2024 Paris Olympics?\n\nCaitlin Clark has a fan in Sarah Hirshland, the head of the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee.\n\nClark has played on USA Basketball’s youth teams — she has three gold medals and was MVP of the 2019 FIBA U19 World Cup — and was added to the Olympic pool last month. She was unable to attend the national team’s most recent training camp because it occurred during the Final Four but called the invitation “a tremendous honor.”\n\nThere are no more training camps scheduled before the USOPC’s July 7 deadline to submit the U.S. Olympic team. That doesn’t mean Clark is out of the running for Paris, however.\n\nThough rare, Clark making the Olympic team right out of college would not be unprecedented. Both Diana Taurasi (2004) and Breanna Stewart (2016) did.\n\nWNBA draft prospects visit Empire State Building\n\nThe biggest prospects in the 2024 WNBA draft arrived in New York City for their big moment Monday night but not before a visit to one of the city's most iconic landmarks.\n\nThe players visited the Empire State Building in Manhattan early Monday before heading over to Brooklyn for the night's festivities, where the 12 WNBA teams will select their newest additions at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.\n\nCaitlin Clark and Kamilla Cardoso, who faced off in the NCAA women's basketball championship game earlier this month, lit the Empire State Building in orange — the signature color of the league.\n\nNext stop for Caitlin Clark is WNBA. What kind of player will she be for Indiana Fever?\n\nCaitlin Clark has been called the greatest of all time (by Iowa fans), overrated (by most other Big Ten fans), “an alien,” (by Diana Taurasi), a generational talent (by Dawn Staley and Kim Mulkey) and just about every other superlative you can imagine.\n\nBut what do any of those descriptors mean when it comes to how her game will translate to the WNBA?\n\nClark, who scored 30 points in her final college game, an 87-75 loss to South Carolina in the national championship, is expected to be taken No. 1 by the Indiana Fever tonight at the 2024 WNBA draft in Brooklyn. But what can basketball fans reasonably expect from Clark in her first professional season? USA TODAY’s Lindsay Schnell breaks it all down.\n\nChiney Ogwumike calls Cameron Brink 'best two-way player in this draft'\n\nIt’s been 10 years since Chiney Ogwumike, an All-American in her time at Stanford, went No. 1 to the Connecticut Sun. Now a forward with the Los Angeles Sparks, Ogwumike on Monday afternoon called fellow Cardinal standout Cameron Brink — who’s expected to be drafted No. 2 overall by the Sparks — the “best two-way player in this draft.”\n\nBrink, who earlier this month was named the national defensive player of the year, averaged 17.4 points and 11.9 rebounds per game her senior season. She’s a shot-blocking sensation — when she can stay out of foul trouble. Earlier Monday, Brink was added to the USA Basketball 3x3 pool for the upcoming Paris Olympics.\n\nCatch more of Ogwumike breaking down Brink and soon-to-be No. 1 pick Caitlin Clark’s games here.\n\n2024 WNBA mock draft: Caitlin Clark, Cameron Brink at top of draft boards\n\nMonday's WNBA draft is arguably the most anticipated since the 2013 draft when Brittney Griner went No. 1 overall to the Phoenix Mercury, Elena Delle Donne was selected second by the Chicago Sky, and the Tulsa Shock (now Dallas Wings) used the third pick to take Skylar Diggins.\n\nIowa guard Caitlin Clark, who led her team to a second consecutive national championship game appearance, leaves school as the NCAA's all-time leading scorer and a two-time national player of the year.\n\nHer mere presence in the WNBA is expected to bring new excitement to a league that has had trouble getting eyeballs for the majority of its 28-season existence. But for most of these draft picks cracking a roster, even as a first-round selection, can be a tough task as there are only 144 roster spots available over the 12-team league.

Because of the excitement and interest surrounding women's sports, Williams said \"it's an overly safe bet\" for her to invest.\n\n“I absolutely would be (interested). With the right market, I would definitely be super-interested in that,” she said.\n\nWNBA draft prospect Alissa Pili among Polynesian players lifting women's basketball\n\nTo fully understand and appreciate the pride Utah women’s basketball standout Alissa Pili feels for her Polynesian heritage, one needs only to look at her right leg.\n\nTattooed there, in prominent display from ankle to hip, is a spiral of Polynesian tribal symbols. In ancient times, ink like that — especially full sleeves — was typically associated with warriors. But because the senior, who is Samoan and Alaska Native (Inupiaq), also values femininity, she asked her tattoo artist to add flowers, too\n\nThat’s also a fitting description for Pili, a top prospect in the 2024 WNBA draft, and a likely first-round pick. Read Lindsay Schnell's full story on Pili and how Polynesian women's basketball players are taking pride in sharing heritage while growing game.\n\nWhat is the 2024 WNBA draft order?\n\nFIRST ROUND\n\nUPDATE: The WNBA announced Sunday afternoon that the Chicago Sky and Minnesota Lynx swapped first-round picks, which is reflected below.\n\nIndiana Fever Los Angeles Sparks Chicago Sky (from Phoenix Mercury) Los Angeles Sparks (from Seattle Storm) Dallas Wings (from Chicago Sky) Washington Mystics Chicago Sky (from Atlanta Dream, via Los Angeles Sparks) Minnesota Lynx Dallas Wings Connecticut Sun New York Liberty Atlanta Dream (from Las Vegas Aces via Los Angeles Sparks)\n\nSECOND ROUND\n\nChicago Sky (from Phoenix Mercury) Seattle Storm Indiana Fever Las Vegas Aces (from Los Angeles Sparks) New York Liberty (from Chicago Sky) Las Vegas Aces (from Washington Mystics) Connecticut Sun (from Minnesota Lynx) Atlanta Dream Washington Mystics (from Dallas Wings) Connecticut Sun New York Liberty Las Vegas Aces\n\nTHIRD ROUND\n\nPhoenix Mercury Seattle Storm Indiana Fever Los Angeles Sparks Phoenix Mercury (from Chicago Sky) Washington Mystics Minnesota Lynx Atlanta Dream Dallas Wings Connecticut Sun New York Liberty Las Vegas Aces\n\nWho will be the No. 1 pick of the WNBA draft?\n\nThere is no likely about it. The Indiana Fever are expected to select Caitlin Clark with the top pick in the 2024 WNBA draft on Monday.\n\nOpposing teams are already marketing their games against the Fever and Clark, and in the case of the Las Vegas Aces, moving a home game against Indiana to a bigger venue.\n\nWho has first pick in WNBA draft?\n\nThe Indiana Fever earned the No. 1 overall pick in the 2024 WNBA draft after winning the draft lottery on Dec. 10, 2023.\n\nThis marks the second consecutive year that the Fever has the first pick. Indiana selected former South Carolina star Aliyah Boston with the No. 1 pick in 2023. Boston went on to win WNBA Rookie of the Year honors last year.\n\nWhat players are at the WNBA draft?\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2024 women's NCAA Tournament, where a record 18.7 million people tuned into the NCAA championship game to see the South Carolina Gamecocks and Kamilla Cardoso defeat the Iowa Hawkeyes and Caitlin Clark, fans can now turn the page to the 2024 WNBA draft to witness both stars turn pro.\n\nClark and Cardoso headline 15 prospects invited to the 2024 WNBA draft, which will be held Monday, April 15 (starting at 7:30 p.m. ET) at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York.\n\nAnd the lineup is stacked.\n\nThe 2024 WNBA draft prospect class includes Clark, the NCAA's all-time leading scorer; Cardoso, who was named the 2024 NCAA Tournament's most outstanding player after leading the undefeated Gamecocks to a national championship; Syracuse's Dyaisha Fair, who has the third-most points in NCAA women’s history; and LSU's Angel Reese, who led the Tigers to a national title in 2023 as that year's most outstanding player.\n\nHow many rounds is the WNBA draft?\n\nThe WNBA draft consists of three rounds with 12 picks in each round.\n\nHow is the WNBA draft order determined?\n\nThe order is determined by last year's standings with the teams with the worst records picking first and the top teams picking last. The exceptions are the first four picks of the first round, which were determined by the draft lottery, and any picks that are traded. Draft picks can be traded until the order is locked in at 5 p.m. ET on April 14 (the day before the draft).\n\nCaitlin Clark is best thing to happen to WNBA. Why are some players so frosty toward her?\n\nAs the most promising day in the history of the WNBA arrives, the American cultural spotlight shines brighter than it ever has on a female athlete in a team sport, and on the possibility she brings to lift basketball and all women’s sports to a place they have never been.\n\nBut the glare of that bright and sometimes harsh light hasn’t fixed on the magical Caitlin Clark alone. Over the past couple of weeks, it has focused on the players who have come before her, some of whom strangely appear to be having trouble accepting and dealing with her fame, even as they will benefit greatly from it.\n\nAs Clark was leading Iowa to its second consecutive NCAA final, this one a loss to undefeated national champion South Carolina, and delivering massive TV ratings that for the first time ever beat the men, some of the biggest names in her sport were talking about her. Of course they were. How could they not? Everyone wanted to know what they thought about this generational talent, this household name, this college record-breaker — superstars like Diana Taurasi and Breanna Stewart in particular. Read Christine Brennan’s full column.\n\nWhat's next for Caitlin Clark? Her college career is over, but Iowa star has busy months ahead\n\nWhat’s next for CC? Caitlin Clark’s brilliant, record-breaking collegiate career came to an end when Iowa and two-time national player of the year fell in the national championship game for the second consecutive year as South Carolina capped a perfect season.\n\nClark, a logo shooting supernova who captured the hearts and eyes of millions over the past couple seasons while re-writing the scoring record books, will go down as one of the most transcendent stars in all of sports, at all of 22 years old. In a state with a deep history of hoops known for producing stellar women's basketball players, Clark stands above the rest.\n\nSo what’s next for the Des Moines native? Plenty. And it’s going to be a whirlwind few weeks.\n\nCaitlin Clark joins 'Weekend Update' desk during surprise 'Saturday Night Live' appearance\n\nWomen's basketball superstar Caitlin Clark made a surprise appearance on this week's \"Saturday Night Live\" during the show's \"Weekend Update\" segment.\n\nClark, who will likely be the top pick in Monday's WNBA draft that is being held in New York, popped by Studio 8H and joined the \"Weekend Update\" desk with anchors Michael Che and Colin Jost.\n\nThe NCAA's all-time leading scorer showed up after Che made a joke about Iowa retiring Clark's jersey. Che then read some more jokes that Clark \"wrote.\"\n\nAfter the humorous exchange, Clark delivered a heartfelt message about her basketball future after Che wished her success in her upcoming rookie season in the WNBA. — Jace Evans", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/college/louisville/2022/04/15/indiana-fever-louisvilles-emily-engstler-wants-to-earn-wnba-spot/7320421001/", "title": "'This isn't college anymore': Emily Engstler joins WNBA team that cut ...", "text": "After being selected fourth overall by the Indiana Fever during Monday's WNBA Draft, former Louisville basketball forward Emily Engstler understood her place on the team was all but guaranteed.\n\n\"I think one of the hardest things about getting drafted in women's basketball is understanding that if you were first round or second round, it doesn't give you a spot,\" Engstler said during her Fever introductory Zoom conference on Thursday. \"You still have to work and try out for your teams, but coming to Indiana as they're building leaves us a lot of room to grow.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/2024/04/11/2024-wnba-mock-draft-caitlin-clark-angel-reese/73294218007/", "title": "2024 WNBA mock draft: Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese, top pick ...", "text": "After some of the most-watched basketball games in recent history, women's basketball is at the forefront of the sports world once again. The 2024 WNBA Draft will see some of the biggest names from the tournament like Caitlin Clark, Cameron Brink, Angel Reese, and Kamilla Cardoso continue their basketball careers at the professional level.\n\nBut where will some of the biggest young stars of the sport end up? There's plenty of intrigue ahead of the WNBA Draft on Monday night. ESPN's Michael Voepel, The Athletic's Sabreena Merchant, Bleacher Report's Joseph Zucker, and CBS Sports' Jack Maloney updated their predictions after the tournament and ahead of Monday night's draft.\n\nHere's where they expect future stars will play this season:\n\n2024 WNBA Draft:Caitlin Clark, Angel Reese, Cameron Brink headline invitees\n\n'Reality is coming':Mercury feed into Diana Taurasi-Caitlin Clark rivalry, other WNBA teams prepare for Clark\n\n2024 WNBA Draft predictions roundup\n\nESPN: Caitlin Clark, guard, Iowa\n\nThe Athletic: Caitlin Clark, guard, Iowa\n\nBleacher Report: Caitlin Clark, guard, Iowa\n\nCBS Sports: Caitlin Clark, guard, Iowa\n\nA very easy consensus here. Clark's one of the best college basketball players of all time and is the choice for Indiana. Her presence alone has drastically changed Indiana's reach; 36 of the Fever's 40 games this season will be nationally televised, up from just one last year.\n\nIndiana took Aliyah Boston No. 1 overall last season. The two should work well together and continue Indiana's upward trajectory after a 13-win 2023 campaign.\n\nMerchant: \"She’s the leading scorer in college basketball history, a dead-eye shooter from deep range and an outstanding passer who finds teammates on the break or at surprising angles in the half court. She will be an immediate value add as a distributor and spacer with enormous upside as an individual scorer and shot creator.\"\n\n'There will never be another':Iowa will retire Caitlin Clark's No. 22 jersey\n\nESPN: Cameron Brink, forward, Stanford\n\nThe Athletic: Cameron Brink, forward, Stanford\n\nBleacher Report: Cameron Brink, forward, Stanford\n\nCBS Sports: Cameron Brink, forward, Stanford\n\nThe consensus continues at the second overall pick for Los Angeles. The Sparks are in a full rebuild mode after losing Nneka Ogwumike in free agency and trading Jordin Canada. Brink won the Naismith Defensive Player of the Year award this season as well as the Lisa Leslie Award given annually to the best center in women's college basketball. Her foul rate is a slight concern but her defensive prowess is undeniable against all positions.\n\nMerchant: \"She is still an outstanding defensive player who covers ground well, can stay with guards or bigs, and prevents shots from being taken in addition to contesting them. Her shooting form suggests she’ll be able to play out on the perimeter because her frame is best suited to playing power forward.\"\n\nESPN: Kamilla Cardoso, center, South Carolina\n\nBleacher Report: Rickea Jackson, forward, Tennessee\n\nCBS Sports: Kamilla Cardoso, center, South Carolina\n\nThe consensus trend ends at No. 3 overall. Chicago's in full rebuild mode after its first losing season since 2018.\n\nCardoso's stock is higher after a strong run in the NCAA Tournament, including 15 points, 17 rebounds, and three blocks in the national championship game. She earned tournament Most Outstanding Player honors after South Carolina's run to another title. She's a force on the defensive end and is improving on offense as a post scorer.\n\nBy contrast, Jackson's one of the top scorers in the draft after averaging 20.2 points per game in the toughest conference in women's college basketball. She's a great finisher at the rim and has a strong mid-range game. When she's not scoring, she's comfortable handling the ball and making plays for teammates.\n\nVoepel: \"We saw how effective she can be when she gets the ball in scoring position and how much she can control the boards. This is going to be a challenging season of change and new faces in Chicago, so the Sky would need patience with Cardoso, just like with the rest of the team.\"\n\nMerchant: \"[Jackson] is an unstoppable shot creator against the best athletes and dropped 33 and 10 in her final collegiate game against NC State. She is physically ready to play in the WNBA and will be able to score right away, even if she still has some work to do providing value off the ball.\"\n\n4. Los Angeles Sparks (from Seattle)\n\nESPN: Rickea Jackson, forward, Tennessee\n\nThe Athletic: Kamilla Cordoso, center, South Carolina\n\nBleacher Report: Kamilla Cordoso, center, South Carolina\n\nCBS Sports: Rickea Jackson, forward, Tennessee\n\nThe predictions at No. 3 switch at No. 4 overall. With Brink already in Los Angeles, experts have the Sparks going in two different directions. If Jackson's available, she'd offer a complement on the offensive end for Brink's standout presence on defense. If Cordoso's the pick, she can team up with Brink for one of the best young defensive tandems in the league while developing more on offense.\n\nVoepel: \"Jackson was Tennessee's star the past two seasons and could be a boost to the Sparks with her scoring ability. She made a career-high 22 3-pointers this season, which is a good sign for her continued progress as she enters the WNBA. She also should be a top-notch defensive player for Los Angeles coach Curt Miller.\"\n\nZucker: \"The WNBA is catching up to the NBA in terms of how traditional centers are viewed and utilized. Conventional bigs nonetheless still have their uses, especially when they're as good at protecting the paint as Cardoso is.\"\n\nNCAA Tournament winners, losers:Kamilla Cardoso, Tessa Johnson shine; refs disappoint\n\nBleacher Report: Jacy Sheldon, guard, Ohio State\n\nCBS Sports: Jacy Sheldon, guard, Ohio State\n\nA near-consensus at No. 5 for Dallas. The Wings won 22 games for the first time since 2008 before losing to eventual champion Las Vegas in the playoffs. But they could use help in the backcourt and three-point shooting. They finished last in the WNBA in three-point percentage in 2023 (31.7%). Sheldon could help in both of those areas as the best guard not named Caitlin Clark in this draft. Dallas is stocked with frontcourt players but Edwards is arguably the best player available at No. 5.\n\nVoepel: \"If Edwards is still available, the Wings don't seem likely to bypass her. Some of the strengths of Edwards' game were on display in the Final Four semifinal loss to Iowa, as were things she needs to work on. But she has the look of a pro post player.\"\n\nMerchant: \"Sheldon will be allowed to play aggressively on the perimeter, knowing that the trees (Teaira McCowan, Kalani Brown and Natasha Howard) are waiting behind her inside. She isn’t a natural lead guard, but Dallas still needs a two-way guard who can play next to Arike Ogunbowale, and Sheldon is big enough to make that backcourt defensively viable.\"\n\nESPN: Jacy Sheldon, guard, Ohio State\n\nThe Athletic: Aaliyah Edwards, forward, UConn\n\nBleacher Report: Aaliyah Edwards, forward, UConn\n\nCBS Sports: Aaliyah Edwards, forward, UConn\n\nAgain, experts flip between two prospects in consecutive selections. Washington's in arguably the toughest spot of any team this offseason. The Mystics lost Natasha Cloud in free agency and Elena Delle Donne is stepping away from basketball indefinitely. Washington could be a candidate to trade up to No. 5 and secure Edwards or wait for her at No. 6. Either way, she would be an immediate impact starter. She's a very good defender and improving as a post scorer and jump shooter. Sheldon would have a similar impact if available at No. 6.\n\nVoepel: \"If the Mystics go with a guard, Sheldon could be the one to help with the franchise's rebuilding period. She has a ton of energy and a hard-nosed commitment to defense. Plus, she averaged 17.8 PPG this season.\"\n\nMaloney: \"You can quibble with the lack of range on her jumper, but there's really nothing Edwards does poorly. She's versatile, efficient, athletic and works hard. If the Mystics can get her at No. 6, that would be a huge win for them following a chaotic offseason.\"\n\nESPN: Isobel Borlase, guard, Australia\n\nThe Athletic: Angel Reese, forward, LSU\n\nBleacher Report: Nyadiew Pouch, forward, Australia\n\nCBS Sports: Angel Reese, forward, LSU\n\nA mix of predictions for the Lynx at No. 7. Minnesota rebounded from an 0-6 start to make the playoffs and enjoyed an All-WNBA season from Napheesa Collier. The Lynx aren't in dire need of star power or help on either end of the floor.\n\nBorlase thrives in transition and is an efficient scorer, shooting 59.6% in the Australian WNBL last season. At 19 years old, she's also one of the younger prospects. Reese is one of the top defenders in the draft and could complement Collier without needing to deliver on the offensive end. She'd also be the latest LSU product to head north and play for the Lynx. Pouch is another defensive standout who is developing her offensive game.\n\nVoepel: \"The 19-year-old appears to have a bright future ahead and already has played professionally with the Adelaide Lightning in the WNBL this season in Australia. Even if the Lynx don't know for sure if she will play in the WNBA this season, Minnesota might want to add Borlase for 2025 and beyond.\"\n\nMerchant: \"The Lynx were one of the worst rebounding teams in the league in 2023, and if there is one thing Reese brings to the table, it’s the ability to rebound. Minnesota would be an interesting fit for Reese because the Lynx have a lot of perimeter creation and bigs who can operate away from the basket, leaving some room in the middle for Reese to work.\"\n\n'Committed to addressing issues':WNBA announces partnership with Opill, a first of its kind birth control pill\n\n8. Chicago Sky (from Atlanta via Los Angeles)\n\nESPN: Angel Reese, forward, LSU\n\nThe Athletic: Nyadiew Pouch, forward, Australia\n\nBleacher Report: Leïla Lacan, guard, Angers (France)\n\nCBS Sports: Nyadiew Pouch, forward, Australia\n\nWith Chicago in rebuild mode, the Sky could likely just take the best player available, especially considering they owe Dallas a first-round pick swap next year. Reese could be a defensive complement to the Sky's selections at No. 3. Pouch may take more time to develop but there's little rush in Chicago right now. Lacan, another international player, could take time to develop as well. Right now, she's a plus defender and playmaking combo guard on offense.\n\nVoepel: \"Rebounding is [Reese's] top strength, and it's a big one. How Reese's offensive game translates to the next level is the question. Even though she and Cardoso were rivals -- not friendly ones -- in the SEC, might they be rookie teammates for the rebuilding Sky?\"\n\nMerchant: \"Puoch is an elite defender at multiple positions and is already playing against WNBA athletes in the WNBL. She needs help refining her jumper and offensive decision-making, but that’s why Chicago hired a GM with a player development track record in Jeff Pagliocca.\"\n\n9. Dallas Wings\n\nThe Athletic: Carla Leite, guard, Tarbes (France)\n\nBleacher Report: Isobel Borlase, guard, Australia\n\nCBS Sports: Isobel Borlase, guard, Australia\n\nThere's some agreement here with more guard help projected at No. 9. Dallas' roster is so full they may only be able to keep one first-round pick on for 2024. Leite, at 19 years old, is already a standout playmaker with impressive athleticism. But she needs to improve her jump shot and action off-ball on offense and defense. She could be a draft-and-stash selection. Pili's an impressive scorer from all levels of the court and excelled especially at catch-and-shoot three point shots (46.7% this season).\n\nMerchant: \"Dallas can add to its backcourt with one of the great young guards in Europe. At 19 years old, Leite is already a high-level scorer who is tough to stop on her way to the rim. She is crafty at drawing fouls and shoots well on free throws. Even if she can’t come over this season, Leite is worth waiting for.\"\n\nMaloney: \"If [the Wings] don't trade No. 5, they certainly could look to move this pick. In the event they keep it, looking at a draft-and-stash option makes the most sense. Borlase is an option in that case. She's a big guard and coming off another productive season in the WNBL.\"\n\nThe Athletic: Alissa Pili, forward, Utah\n\nBleacher Report: Angel Reese, forward, LSU\n\nCBS Sports: Alissa Pili, forward, Utah\n\nConnecticut set a franchise record with 27 wins in 2023 behind All-WNBA First Team forward Alyssa Thomas. As such, the Sun don't have many needs outside of three-point shooting. Connecticut finished ninth in the league at 20 attempts per game.\n\nPili would be an immediate help with that thanks to her stellar shooting totals from Utah. Similarly, Fair's one of the top scorers in women's college basketball history and shot a career-high 37.7% from deep last season for Syracuse. Reese would be a best player available pick here and someone to complement Thomas on defense.\n\nVoepel: \"Fair averaged 22.2 PPG in her five-season career, first at Buffalo and then Syracuse. She held her own in the ACC, despite her small stature. That said, it's a matter of if the Sun see her all-around skills as good enough, along with her ability to shoot.\"\n\nMaloney: \"Connecticut desperately needs some shooting help, and one player who could fill that role is Pili. There are real questions about how she'll fare in the pros as an undersized forward, but there's no debate about her shot.\"\n\nBleacher Report: Alissa Pili, forward, Utah\n\nCBS Sports: Charisma Osborne, guard, UCLA\n\nNew York won a franchise-record 32 games and made the WNBA Finals last season behind MVP Breanna Stewart. All five starters from last year return for 2024 but the Liberty's bench could use some help as well as perimeter defense.\n\nThough she stands 5-foot-9, Osborne is a standout perimeter defender and playmaker with lots of athleticism. She would need to improve her shot, especially from outside, but has promising shooting form that could lend itself to growth. Mühl improved her stock by holding strong against Clark in the Final Four, showcasing her defensive prowess. She's a good jump shooter as well but wouldn't be relied upon to shoulder much of a load on the offensive end in New York. Pili would offer another shooter around Stewart and Sabrina Ionescu.\n\nMerchant: \"The Liberty need to shore up their backcourt defensively, and Mühl is already comfortable taking on the toughest assignments. She’s also an excellent passer and can hit spot-ups; she shot 42.6 percent on catch-and-shoot jumpers her senior season. UConn was 15.2 points per 100 possessions better offensively with Mühl on the court in 2023-24, and that’s the lesser part of her game.\"\n\nMaloney: \"Though Osborne was not at her best in the Bruins' final two games of the tournament, she is still likely a first-round pick thanks to her all-around game and defensive aptitude. The Liberty's most obvious area of weakness last season was perimeter defense, and Osborne can help in that department.\"\n\n12. Atlanta Dream (from Las Vegas via Los Angeles)\n\nThe Athletic: Charisma Osborne, guard, UCLA\n\nBleacher Report: Charisma Osborne, guard, UCLA\n\nCBS Sports: Nika Mühl, guard, UConn\n\nAtlanta made the playoffs for the first time in five years last season and offseason additions Jordin Canada and Tina Charles put this squad in good shape ahead of 2024. The biggest need at this point is depth, especially at point guard and in the frontcourt in general, as well as three-point shooting.\n\nCarter is a two-time All-SEC second team player who averaged 14.9 points and 9.9 rebounds in her final season with the Bulldogs. She's a reliable shot blocker on defense and a solid scorer on offense. She'd provide depth immediately for the Dream. Osborne and Mühl would both improve guard depth and defense.\n\nVoepel: \"The Dream might have some room for depth at center, and Carter finished her Bulldog career as a second-team All-SEC player. She had her best overall season with averages of 14.9 PPG and 9.9 rebounds.\"\n\nMaloney: \"The Dream have plenty of versatile players who can handle the ball and initiate offense, but offseason acquisition Jordin Canada is the only true point guard on the roster. It never hurts to have a back-up at that position, and the Dream could look to Muhl, who has been running the show for UConn for years.\"\n\nWhen is the 2024 WNBA Draft?\n\nDate: Monday, April 15\n\nMonday, April 15 Time: 7:30 p.m. ET\n\n7:30 p.m. ET Cable: ESPN\n\nESPN Streaming: ESPN+\n\n2024 WNBA Draft order\n\nFirst Round\n\nIndiana Fever Los Angeles Sparks Chicago Sky (from Phoenix) Los Angeles Sparks (from Seattle) Dallas Wings (from Chicago) Washington Mystics Minnesota Lynx Chicago Sky (from Atlanta, via Los Angeles) Dallas Wings Connecticut Sun New York Liberty Atlanta Dream (from Las Vegas, via Los Angeles)\n\nSecond Round\n\nChicago Sky (from Phoenix) Seattle Storm Indiana Fever Las Vegas Aces (from Los Angeles) New York Liberty (from Chicago) Las Vegas Aces (from Washington) Connecticut Sun (from Minnesota) Atlanta Dream Washington Mystics (from Dallas) Connecticut Sun New York Liberty Las Vegas Aces\n\nThird Round", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/2024/04/09/wnba-draft-2024-date-time-tv-live-stream/73265792007/", "title": "How to watch 2024 WNBA draft where Caitlin Clark is expected to ...", "text": "Caitlin Clark will officially enter the pro ranks on Monday at the 2024 WNBA draft.\n\nAfter she waived her fifth year of eligibility, the Iowa phenom is widely expected to be the No. 1 overall pick by the Indiana Fever.

The question was not if Clark needed a championship to be the GOAT, the greatest of all time. No, the question was much broader and easier to answer: was Clark “one of the greats?”\n\nThere can be dozens of those, as many as you want, the more the merrier. One would certainly think the person who has scored the most points in NCAA Division I basketball history, male or female — that’s Clark — would be one of them.\n\nNot for Stewart.\n\n“Yeah, she does (need a championship),” Stewart said coolly, without hesitation. “I think so. Because then you’re gonna look 10 years back and you’re gonna see all the records she’s broken, and the points and stuff like that, but anybody knows your goal when you play college basketball is to win a national championship. So you need one.”\n\nNeedless to say, that created some news, and not in a good way for the 29-year-old Stewart. Her answer was downright strange, as if she didn’t want to acknowledge that this young woman, more than seven years her junior, was changing everything about how the nation looks at her sport. Stewart instead chose to keep her steely focus on her UConn roots, where she was fortunate to play on a roster full of future WNBA players to be able to win those four titles. Clark, it should be noted, played on a roster full of future non-WNBA players, other than herself, and somehow took Iowa to two consecutive NCAA finals.\n\nOf course it’s Stewart’s right to say what she said, and brutal honesty is always notable. But I was intrigued, so, for the past week, I tried to find out what was going on. I asked Stewart’s agent, Lindsay Colas, several times if I could speak to Stewart, with no luck. Finally, at Colas’ suggestion, I texted two questions for her to send to Stewart, who Colas said was out of the country.\n\nMy questions:\n\n1. Knowing the incredible college records and unprecedented historic impact Caitlin Clark has had on women’s basketball, do you regret your comment about her having to win a title to be “one of the greats?\" It wasn’t to be the GOAT. It was “one of the greats,” which could encompass dozens of people. Even hundreds.\n\n2. Had you gone to Syracuse or another school like that, like an Iowa, rather than UConn with so many future WNBA players as teammates, would you have been able to take that team to two consecutive NCAA finals?\n\nStewart’s reply came in a text message back to me from Colas Thursday night:\n\n“Caitlin is a star and we are excited to have her in the WNBA. She is unquestionably great for what she has accomplished on and off the court.”\n\nStewart’s fellow former UConn superstar Diana Taurasi, who at 41 is nearly 20 years older than the 22-year-old Clark, also joined in the chorus of less-than-flattering comments about Clark.\n\nOn her ESPN telecast with fellow UConn icon Sue Bird, the question was asked who they would take with the first pick in the draft if they were building a WNBA team: Clark or UConn’s Paige Bueckers, who isn’t even going to be in the draft this year.\n\nAfter Bird picked Clark — “the fan energy behind Caitlin is going to be a game-changer for a WNBA franchise” — it was Taurasi’s turn, and she was vintage Taurasi, brusque and unyielding:\n\n“I’m taking Paige, next question.”\n\nBird followed up.\n\n“So you get the No. 1 pick this year, you would take Paige over Caitlin?”\n\n“Absolutely.”\n\nThere was another Taurasi moment on ESPN after Iowa defeated UConn in their national semifinal. Asked about rookies like Clark and South Carolina’s Kamilla Cardoso coming into the league, Taurasi relished giving them a proverbial swift kick to the shins.\n\n“Reality is coming,” she said. “There’s levels to this thing and that’s just life, we all went through it. … You look superhuman playing against 18-year-olds, but you’re going to come with some grown women that have been playing professional basketball for a long time.”\n\nThose who know Taurasi say this is who she is, tough and brash, a force to be reckoned with always. The problem for Taurasi, if she even cares about this, is all the new eyeballs being brought to the game for the first time by Clark. The millions of new women’s basketball fans don’t necessarily know much about Taurasi, but they certainly are getting an introduction now.\n\nThrough Colas, who also is Taurasi’s agent, I asked for a comment from Taurasi or even a lead on locating a positive or praiseworthy quote or soundbite from Taurasi about Clark over the Final Four weekend.\n\nI never heard back.\n\nFor her part, be it at the Final Four or throughout her young career, Clark has unfailingly praised the women who have come before her, thanking them for being role models and heroes for girls and women like her. In her excellent and funny \"Saturday Night Live\" appearance over the weekend, she did it again. My guess is Clark will be praising and thanking her predecessors, and helping and encouraging those who follow her, for the rest of her life.\n\nThe U.S. Olympic team situation\n\nWith their Final Four comments, Stewart and Taurasi opened such a revealing window into how they think about Clark, a mindset that could come into play in a very public way should Clark become one of their Olympic teammates this summer.\n\nThe call for Clark to be put on the U.S. team, already a no-brainer to me in ways big and small, is growing. As three-time WNBA MVP and four-time Olympic gold medalist Lisa Leslie told ESPN, “She better be on the Olympic team. We should not leave the country without her. She’s a bona fide baller. There’s no doubt she’s already one of the best players in the world.”\n\nNonetheless, the undercurrent is real and has opened some eyes in the U.S. Olympic movement. If Clark doesn’t make the Olympic team, there will undoubtedly be some serious questions to be asked about what role all of this —Animosity? Jealousy? — played in that decision.\n\nWomen's sports still have catching up to do\n\nThe national conversation this has triggered is fascinating. As some have said, this is exactly the way the old guard treats rookies in men’s sports, so why not in women’s? Isn’t this a sign that women’s sports have grown to the point where older players can mistreat younger players, as if that is some sort of goal or measure of advancement?\n\nWell, anyone who thinks men’s and women’s sports are now at the same place in our society obviously is paying absolutely no attention to the gaping differences to this day in the money, sponsorships, coverage and attention between men’s and women’s sports. Today is the greatest day in women’s sports — until tomorrow. But women’s sports still have so much catching up to do, which makes any resentment toward the greatest thing to come along in a long time (and maybe ever) even worse.\n\nSome good-natured ribbing? Of course. But please point out anything about Stewart’s or Taurasi’s Final Four comments that was remotely good-natured.\n\nWNBA teams already preparing for Caitlin Clark's presence\n\nHowever, no matter how frosty Stewart and Taurasi want to play it, WNBA teams know it’s Clark who now is their biggest draw, their meal ticket. Earlier this month, the Las Vegas Aces moved their July 2 home game against Indiana from a 12,000-seat arena to a 20,000-seat venue — and Clark hasn’t even been drafted yet by the Fever.\n\nAnother interesting development occurred on social media the other day when the Phoenix Mercury, Taurasi’s team, posted a promotion for its June 30 home game with Indiana showing Taurasi and another player, in silhouette because the draft hasn’t happened yet, wearing No. 22.\n\n“The GOAT vs. THE ROOK,” it read.\n\nTaurasi might not like it, but even her own team realizes that to promote her, it absolutely needs Caitlin Clark.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/wnba/2023/04/08/wnba-draft-time-tv-streaming-first-round-order-players-watch/11602895002/", "title": "WNBA draft 2023: Time, TV, streaming, first-round order, key players", "text": "Following an exciting and record-setting women's college basketball season, which culminated in the most watched NCAA women's championship game in history, it's time to turn our attention to the pros.

Dallas Wings (from Chicago Sky)\n\n12. Minnesota Lynx (from Las Vegas Aces)\n\nWho are some key players to watch in the WNBA draft?\n\nThe only sure thing about the 2023 WNBA draft is that South Carolina forward-center Aliyah Boston, the consensus national player of the year last season, will be taken with the No. 1 overall pick. The only other near certainty is that plenty of Boston's teammates will also be selected Monday night.\n\nFour other Gamecocks, who along with Boston won the 2022 national championship and helped South Carolina reach its third consecutive Final Four this month, have declared for the draft — F Laeticia Amihere, G Brea Beal, G Zia Cooke and F Victaria Saxton — and one or more could join Boston as first-round selections. Add in G Kierra Fletcher, who played for South Carolina in the 2022-23 season as a graduate student after four years at Georgia Tech, and the 2023 draft could be a monumental one for the Gamecocks.\n\nBut there will be plenty of other great athletes for the 12 teams to choose from. Among the other players to watch:\n\n► G Diamond Miller: One of the most pro-ready players, she led Maryland to the Elite Eight after averaging 19.7 and 6.4 rebounds in her senior season.\n\n► F Madison Siegrist: The nation's leading scorer with 29.2 points per game led Villanova to the Sweet 16 for the first time in 20 years.\n\n► G Haley Jones: The versatile guard is an excellent passer and rebounder and won a national championship with Stanford in 2021.\n\n► G Jordan Horston: One of only two Tennessee players all time to finish with at least 1,000 points, 700 rebounds and 400 assists for the Lady Vols.\n\n► C Stephanie Soares: Tore her ACL just 13 games into Iowa State's 2022-23 season — her only one with the Cyclones after four years in the NAIA — but is a monster in the paint.\n\n► F/G Ashley Joens: A three-time Cheryl Miller Award winner as the nation's best small forward, the Big 12 Player of the Year finished as Iowa State all-time leading scorer.\n\n► G/F Lou Lopez Sénéchal: UConn's second-leading scorer and best three-point shooter this season became a primetime player on a team decimated by injuries.\n\n► G Alexis Morris: The fifth-year senior, who averaged 15.4 points in 2022-23 and 24 ppg in the Final Four, led LSU to its first national championship.\n\n► G Taylor Mikesell: A deadly three-point shooter, Ohio State's leading scorer in 2022-23 led the Buckeyes to their first Elite Eight in 30 years.\n\nWho won't be in the WNBA draft?\n\nIf you are looking for some of the stars that made a big splash in the NCAA Tournament — like Iowa's Caitlin Clark or LSU's Angel Reese — you'll have to wait at least one more year, if not two.\n\nClark, Reese, Virginia Tech's Georgia Amoore, Louisville's Hailey Van Lith, Stanford's Cameron Brink and Connecticut's Paige Bueckers were all juniors academically and have at least one more year of eligibility — if not two, if they decide to take advantage of the extra year the NCAA granted in 2021 because of COVID. Bueckers, technically, could have as much as three years of eligibility remaining since she missed her entire junior season after tearing the ACL in her left knee.\n\nThree seniors who saw their stock rise in the NCAA Tournament did opt to take advantage of the extra COVID year and return to college for a fifth year. Virginia Tech center Elizabeth Kitley, a second-team AP All-American and the ACC Player of the Year, led the Hokies to their first ever Final Four and hopes to duplicate that feat; Ohio State guard Jacy Sheldon will be back in Columbus next year after leading the Buckeyes to the Elite Eight; and guard Charisma Osborne returns to UCLA after leading the Bruins in scoring and rebounding in 2022-23 and a berth in the Sweet 16.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaw/2024/02/29/2024-wnba-draft-order/72795993007/", "title": "2024 WNBA Draft: Indiana Fever own top pick in Caitlin Clark-led class", "text": "One of college basketball's biggest stars, Caitlin Clark, announced Thursday that she's entering the WNBA Draft this year.

Greene points to the rise in popularity in women's sports along with NIL rules that let companies fully license trading cards of college players.\n\n\"(Clark) lifted the profile of women's college basketball so much to a wider audience,\" Greene said. \"In the last two to three years, the WNBA's profile has grown so much more. And, now it's going to get another shot of adrenalin with her coming in.\"\n\nHow much for the most expensive Caitlin Clark cards\n\nThis past week, sellers were offering more than 5,400 Caitlin Clark items on eBay – everything from expensive trading cards to signed jerseys and basketballs. Among them were seven trading cards, most of them autographed, listed for more than $10,000. That included a $20,000 autographed card commemorating her record-breaking 3,528th point.\n\nOne Clark card with perfect printing and autograph, below, sold in January on PWCC Marketplace for $78,000. That's $2,000 more than her base pay will be in the WNBA. It's also thousands more than the previous high for a women's basketball card: $11,500 for a Sabrina Ionescu card.\n\nMore collectors getting their Caitlin Clark cards graded\n\nPSA says it's seen a surge of interest in collectors getting their Caitlin Clark cards graded.\n\n\"The grading element really helps set the market and adds value to collectibles,\" Greene said. Collectors pay companies such as PSA to rate the quality of the card and preserve it in plastic. What PSA evaluators look for:\n\n◾ Quality of the card: Evaluators look at the condition of the corners, the surface, the centering and the edges\n\n◾ Authenticity: Has the card been counterfeited? Greene said that's more often a concern with \"vintage\" cards rather than those manufactured and released in the last five to 10 years.\n\nThe Caitlin Clark cards collectors have graded most frequently\n\nThe number of Clark's cards that collectors have graded in the past year pales in comparison to other sports unicorns such as the NBA's Victor Wembanyama or MLB's Shohei Ohtani. Still, the number of Clark's cards getting graded has grown exponentially with her stardom.\n\nFuture of women's sports card collecting\n\nWhile Caitlin Clark has grabbed America's attention these past few months, her ascent can also be viewed as a yet another step for women's sports.\n\n\"Women's basketball is having a moment, but don't sleep on women's soccer either. Our professional leagues are incredible,\" Fauci said, who hosted LSU basketball standout Angel Reese at the National Sports Collectors Convention last year. Reese is expected to be a top draft pick Monday night.\n\n\"People are going to be discovering players who they didn't know existed because of what Caitlin Clark is going to do,\" Fauci said. \"She's getting more Indiana Fever games on national television, and people are going to ... discover more players to collect.\"\n\nGreene echoes Fauci's excitement about Clark's future in the WNBA:\n\n\"I'm really interested in the next six to 10 months to see what the popularity of WNBA trading cards looks like. Because I have every reason to believe that with Caitlin Clark being included in those products, the popularity –compared to where it's been the last two to three years: it's going to go through the roof.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/14"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaw/2016/04/05/for-2nd-straight-year-player-declares-early-for-wnba-draft/82665846/", "title": "For 2nd straight year, player declares early for WNBA draft", "text": "AP\n\nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — For years, women's college basketball players never really entertained the idea of leaving early to turn professional.\n\nBut for the second straight season at least one player is entering the WNBA draft rather than staying in school. Michigan State's Aerial Powers made the announcement Monday a year after Jewell Loyd and Amanda Zahui B. did it. Powers is expected to be taken in the first round.\n\n\"This was not an easy decision to make, but I want to thank Coach (Suzy) Merchant and all the coaches and support staff, my family and all of my teammates. I have enjoyed every second of being a Spartan,\" Powers said. \"Now I look forward to the next chapter of my basketball career.\"\n\nWashington's Kelsey Plum and Baylor's Nina Davis were two other high profile players who could have chosen to go pro, but both decided to stay in school as Monday's deadline came and went.\n\nIt's easy to understand why they stayed since the money just isn't there yet for pros in the women's game. The top four picks in the WNBA draft make just over $50,000 and they sign non-negotiable, three-year deals. Getting a degree and enjoying the college experience has tended to be much more valuable to young stars. There is money overseas, but it's rare when players fresh out of college can make a lot of money quickly playing in Europe or Asia.\n\nPart of the reason for UConn's dominance over the past 20 years has been the fact that players don't leave early. Imagine how good Kentucky's men's basketball team could have been if all those players who left early for the NBA had stayed.\n\n\"When you have really good players and they stay for all four years it's that much more difficult to beat them,\" UConn coach Geno Auriemma said.\n\nEven if Diana Taurasi or Maya Moore or Breanna Stewart had wanted to leave after their freshman year, they couldn't. The WNBA has strict rules about who can be drafted early, including a requirement that the player reach the age of 22 during the calendar year of the draft. That applied to Powers, who missed the 2012-13 season after tearing her Achilles tendon during her freshman year.\n\nUConn star Morgan Tuck, who could return for a fifth season after missing most of her sophomore season with an injury, said she would announce her plans after the national championship game Tuesday night. The WNBA allows players in the title game 24 hours to decide once the game ends.\n\nTuck was asked about it on the stage and paused without answering the question. Stewart jumped in and said: \"It's a secret.\"\n\nIf Tuck does decide to enter the draft, that would make four players in the past two years to leave early.\n\nNew WNBA President Lisa Borders doesn't see this as a trend — yet.\n\n\"Trends take more than a year or two to really develop,\" she said. \"Let's revisit this again a few years down the road and then see where we stand.\"\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver, who watched UConn beat Syracuse 82-51 on Tuesday night, said he doesn't see it becoming common, as it is in the men's game.\n\n\"My preference in the NBA is that these young men spend more time in college,\" he said. \"It's a little different when you are talking about some of these women who are a little bit older when they are coming out.\"\n\nLoyd, who was the league's rookie of the year last season, was happy with her decision.\n\n\"It was the best thing for me to do,\" she said in February at the USA Basketball training camp. \"I don't regret my choice at all.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/04/05"}]}

We do this first by failing, learning, acknowledging, hearing and empathizing… And I will continue, tirelessly, to do just that.”\n\nThe statement represents her most significant response to criticisms she has used a “blaccent” throughout her career: from her early hit NSFW parody rap song “My Vag” to her more recent acting roles in the big-budget films “Crazy Rich Asians” and “Ocean’s Eight.”\n\nThe issue is broadly part of the ever-evolving debate around cultural appropriation, or the act of adopting customs from another culture without the proper level of respect or acknowledgment.\n\nAwkwafina, 33, has achieved critical and mainstream success in recent years. She won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Motion Picture for the 2019 film “The Farewell” and last year joined the Marvel Universe with her role in “Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.”\n\nYet during press for Shang-Chi last year, she struggled to answer a question from Reuters about her “blaccent.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Awkwafina is the new voice of the NYC subway (January, 2020) 01:00 - Source: CNN Business\n\nWhat her full statement says\n\nIn her 351-word statement Saturday – her first tweet in more than two years – Awkwafina noted the injustices Black Americans face, as well as the use of African American Vernacular English (AAVE) in different contexts, including on social media and in music.\n\n“There is a sociopolitical context to everything, especially the historical context of the African American community in this country,” she wrote. “It is a group that is disproportionately affected by institutionalized policies and law enforcement policies – all the while having historically and routinely seen their culture stolen, exploited and appropriated by the *dominant* culture for monetary gain without acknowledgment nor respect for where those roots come from, the pioneers of its beginnings and the artists that perfected and mastered the craft.\n\n“It is a problem we still see today – though some may pass it off as a convoluted mixture of the ‘internet TikTok slang generation’ that liberally uses AAVE, to add that hip hop – a genre of music that is ubiquitous and beloved across the country – has now anchored itself as a mainstream genre in music history.\n\n“And in life, linguistic acculturation, immigrant acculturation, and the inevitable passage of globalized internet slang all play a factor in the fine line between offense and pop culture.\n\n“But as a non-black POC (person of color), I stand by the fact that I will always listen and work tirelessly to understand the history and context of AAVE, what is deemed appropriate or backwards toward the progress of ANY and EVERY marginalized group. But I must emphasize: To mock, belittle, or to be unkind in any way possible at the expense of others is: Simply. Not. My. Nature. It never has, and it never was.”\n\nIn two follow-up tweets, Awkwafina said she planned to retire from Twitter and offered a vague apology.\n\n“I apologize if I ever fell short, in anything I did. You’re in my heart always,” she wrote.\n\n“To Clarify: I am retiring from the ingrown toenail that is Twitter. Not retiring from anything else, even if I wanted to, and I didn’t drunkenly hit someone with a shoehorn and now escaping as a fugitive.

But some researchers believe the Crispr technology, which allows scientists to edit DNA “far more easily than was previously possible”, will eventually “revolutionise the prevention and treatment of diseases and conditions including cancer”, added the paper.\n\nThe jailed scientist was released from prison in April 2022, and in November launched his own laboratory in Beijing, predicting an imminent “golden decade for gene therapies”. He is scheduled to give talks and visits at a number of acclaimed universities, including a scheduled visit to Oxford University next month to discuss the use of Crispr gene-editing technology in reproductive medicine.\n\n1. Pro: may prevent disease\n\nSince many diseases are caused by a single genetic mutation, those in favour ask why we shouldn’t edit the DNA of an embryo or the sperm and egg to remove the mutation entirely. “In effect this would remove a fault from humanity forever,” said Science editor Tom Whipple in The Times. John Harris, a bioethicist at the University of Manchester told the MIT Technology Review: “The human genome is not perfect. It’s ethically imperative to positively support this technology.”\n\n2. Con: open to misuse\n\nThere is the possibility that people will use gene-editing technology for “enhancements”, rather than fighting disease, American TV host John Oliver said on his show Last Week Tonight, in 2018. “The more control people have over the ability to design their children, the bigger the moral questions that raises - up to and including, who decides what constitutes a genetic problem that needs to be ‘fixed’?”\n\n3. Pro: encourages regulation\n\nThose in favour argue that these scientific advances can be regulated to avert potential doomsday scenarios. “I still think you can try to regulate the technology,” Arthur Caplan, founding head of the Division of Bioethics at New York University, told USA Today. “It would be nice if we had an international group; set out some rules. It would be great if the scientific community - with religious and ethics and legal leaders - would set up some rules for how to operate. It would be nice if journal editors would say, ‘We’re not publishing anything unless these rules are followed.’”\n\nIn the aftermath of Jiankui’s gene-editing experiment, much has changed, said Professor Robin Lovell-Badge, the organiser of the Third International Summit on Human Genome Editing which is due to be held at the Francis Crick Institute next month. “We will be discussing what has happened to the three children whose physiology he may have altered by genome editing,” Lovell-Badge told The Guardian. “We will also have presentations about the changes that have occurred in China in terms of the law and the ethics governing gene editing. There have clearly been quite substantial changes – for the good.”\n\n4. Con: many unknowns\n\nDoctors say that just because we can change a gene does not mean we know what that change will do. “Most diseases are not caused by a single gene but many. Changing lots of genes could have lots of effects elsewhere,” reports The Times.\n\nWhile most scientists and medical ethicists believe gene editing may one day be able to improve the lives of someone with a life-altering disease, they “recoil in horror at the concept of editing the genome of a human embryo” as changes to genes can be passed down through generations of human beings, said Phys.org.\n\n“We do not know enough about human biology to make genetic engineering changes on behalf of the unborn,” said Dr John Leonard, president and CEO of Intellia Therapeutics, who said that almost all conditions which could benefit from gene editing could also be treated or prevented in another way. He also raised issues of consent, noting that the unborn cannot “agree to have these procedures done to them.”\n\n5. Pro: babies could help humanity\n\nIn the US, a poll found that 83% of people thought genetic modification to make a baby more intelligent would be “taking medical advances too far”, according to MIT Technology Review, published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. However, proponents of genetic engineering argue that a higher IQ is exactly what we should be considering. Nick Bostrom, an Oxford philosopher best known for his work on the risks of artificial intelligence, wrote in a 2013 paper that even a small number of “super-enhanced” individuals could “change the world through their creativity and discoveries, and through innovations that everyone else would use”.\n\n6. Con: only for the rich\n\nAny ethical debate “will also naturally run against practicalities like funding”, says The Independent. Many patients are subject already to a postcode lottery in accessing fertility treatment based on their local NHS funding, and “gene editing could initially be out of reach for all but the richest”, adds the newspaper. Acknowledging this problem, panel chair Professor Yeung said that if funding inequalities “were to exacerbate social injustice, in our view that would not be an ethical approach”.", "authors": ["Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Harriet Marsden", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Staff", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/955320/tony-blair-controversial-knight", "title": "Tony Blair: a controversial knight | The Week", "text": "“Tony Blair still has the ability to surprise me,” said John Rentoul in The Independent. Given his “anti-establishment cast of mind”, I never thought he’d accept a knighthood. Yet on 1 January, 14 years after leaving Downing Street, the former Labour leader was appointed as Knight Companion of the Most Noble Order of the Garter. Sir Tony described it as an “immense honour”, but his critics are up in arms: more than half a million people have signed a petition calling for the award to be rescinded.\n\nLittle wonder, said Andrew Pierce in the Daily Mail. While this award is generally extended to every former PM, Blair is not worthy of it. His achievements in office – the Good Friday Agreement, independence for the Bank of England, civil partnerships – are far outweighed by the damage he caused.\n\nHe politicised the civil service by diverting power to “party political apparatchiks”; he unleashed an immigration free-for-all in a “bid to reshape the electorate” to Labour’s advantage. Worst of all, he took the UK into Iraq on “a false prospectus” – launching a war in which hundreds of thousands died, and which sent the region into a spiral of violence. Since leaving No. 10, he has further damaged his reputation by advising foreign despots and scheming to overturn the Brexit referendum.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

But that’s not enough for his “haters”: he must also be a “mass murderer”, the “monster who introduced lying to the noble vocation of politics”. The Right can’t forgive him for trouncing them; the Left can’t forgive him for allying with “the most dogged enemy of socialism: the voters”.\n\nNeither side can admit that Blair was not just a good PM but a “great” one. He turned Labour’s noble aims into action: the minimum wage, tax credits, free nursery care, more doctors, more teachers. He stood by the US over Iraq for good reasons, aware of the political cost. His decade in office left Britain “fairer, smarter, healthier, more modern and more at ease with itself”. Of course Blair deserves a knighthood.

They are about the right to kill.\"\n\nThe UK's anti-euthanasia Care Not Killing alliance said that the law is also in place to protect the vulnerable \"from being pressured into ending their lives\".\n\nMaking her case against any law change, Ilora Finlay, a crossbench peer and palliative care physician, told the parliamentary inquiry that legalising euthanasia in Britain could result in between 5,800 and 58,000 assisted deaths a year, based on extrapolated data from countries where it is already legal. \"Such demand would divert an already stretched workforce of NHS clinicians,\" she said.\n\nPro: ending 'mercy killings'\n\nAccording to Dignity in Dying , 44% of people would break the law and help a loved one to die, risking 14 years in prison.\n\nIn 2022 the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said it was considering revising its stance on so-called mercy killings so that defendants are less likely to face criminal charges.\n\n\"We are not decriminalising any offence,\" Max Hill, director of public prosecutions and head of the CPS, told the i news site, but in offences \"born solely out of compassion\", justice can sometimes \"be achieved by not prosecuting\".\n\nCampaigners claim that UK police are also increasingly turning a blind eye to people travelling to other countries to assist loved ones to end their life.\n\nCon: 'slippery slope'\n\nOpponents argue that normalising euthanasia would be a move towards legalised murder.\n\nThis \"slippery slope is real\", said James Mildred of Care (Christian Action Research and Education), which campaigns against assisted suicide. In a 2018 article in The Economist , Mildred cited \"a steady increase year on year in the number of people being killed or helped to commit suicide by their doctors\" in countries that have legalised assisted suicide, as the rules are loosened over time.\n\n\"Critics say this is happening in Canada,\" said New Scientist , \"with the criteria for assisted dying having expanded once already and a further change planned for next year.\" Canada, which introduced Medical Assistance in Dying, or MAID, in 2016, has seen the number of people choosing to end their life rise steadily ever since, with MAID deaths comprising 4.1% of all deaths in 2022.\n\nPro: shifting opinion\n\nThere has been a significant shift in recent years among both the public and professional medical opinion regarding assisted dying for people with a terminal illness.\n\nPolling for The Guardian last August found 65% of people in the UK believe it should become legal for a doctor to assist an adult of sound mind with less than six months to live to voluntarily end their own life, subject to High Court confirmation.\n\nDignity in Dying claims this number is even higher, and also that 54% of GPs are supportive or neutral to a law change on assisted dying.\n\nCon: religious concerns\n\nMany religious people, especially Catholics, believe that life is the ultimate gift and that taking that away is usurping power that belongs to God only.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}, {"url": "https://theweek.co.uk/news/defence/104574/nato-vs-russia-who-would-win", "title": "Nato vs. Russia: who would win? | The Week", "text": "Since Vladimir Putin launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, Nato has scrambled to present a united front against Russian aggression.\n\nIts member states have plied Kyiv with weapons and punished Russia with the most severe economic sanctions ever imposed on a major economy.

Finland had said it had \"no choice but to end decades of neutrality\" in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSweden, which is still \" sat in the Nato waiting room \" until Hungary and Turkey drop their opposition to its accession, has committed to sending \"ground combat units\" to Nato operations along the Russian border, said Newsweek 's diplomatic correspondent David Brennan.\n\nPrime Minister Ulf Kristersson said this week that Stockholm would not wait for ratification of its membership bid to send troops to Latvia on Nato's eastern frontier . \"Sweden and its neighbours are living in the direct shadow of Russia's war of aggression,\" he said.\n\nUS President Joe Biden warned in December that Russia would attack a Nato country even if it defeated Ukraine, potentially triggering World War Three . Pleading with Republicans in Congress not to block emergency funding for Ukraine, Biden said that Putin would \"not stop there\", and that it would result in American troops fighting Russia.\n\nPutin dismissed the remarks \"as complete nonsense\", reported Reuters . The president told Rossiya state television that Russia had \"no reason, no interest – no geopolitical interest, neither economic, political nor military – to fight with Nato countries\".\n\nBut since New Year's Eve the Kremlin has intensified its bombardment of Ukraine, launching one of the most brutal attacks since the war began. Nato forces were scrambled more than 300 times in response to encroachment by Russian military aircraft into its airspace over the Baltic Sea, the alliance said in a statement .\n\nNato’s capability\n\nA mutual assistance clause sits at the heart of the security alliance, which was formed in 1949 with the aim of countering the risk of a Soviet attack on allied territory. Article 5 of Nato's Washington Treaty says that an attack on one ally is considered an attack on all member states – which presents an obstacle for Ukraine's membership while it remains at war with Russia.\n\nA Nato pledge asks members to spend 2% of gross domestic product on defence. Though less than a third of members meet this target, Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has said it is \"increasingly considered a floor, not a ceiling\".\n\nNato's biggest player, the US, spends more on defence than the next 10 spenders in the world combined. Its total in 2022 was about $877 billion, according to Trading Economics – nearly 40% of the total military spending worldwide that year. The UK sits in sixth place, with spending of £68.5 billion.\n\nThe US boasts a powerful arsenal and a huge amount of manpower. According to World Population Review figures, it has 1.39 million active troops, beaten only by India and China. As of last March, Nato had about 5.8 million active military personnel, Statista data indicated.\n\nA coalition of Nato countries has purchased 1,000 Patriot missiles to replenish \"dwindling Western stockpiles\", The Daily Telegraph reported this week. Stoltenberg hailed the “timely announcement\" that would \"bolster the alliance’s security\".\n\nRussia’s capability\n\nDespite Russian forces' well-publicised struggles, their overall military capability is considerable. The country went from the fifth largest defence spender in the world in 2021 to the third in 2022 (behind the US and China), with a jump of more than £20 billion.\n\nIt has 1.33 million active military personnel, according to Statista, but only about 4,182 military aircraft compared with Nato's combined 20,633, and 598 military ships compared to Nato's 2,151.\n\n\"Russia's ground combat vehicle capacity is more competitive,\" said Statista. However, \"the combined nuclear arsenal of the United States, United Kingdom, and France amounted to 5,943 nuclear warheads, compared with Russia's 5,977.\"\n\nMany experts believe the country's military effectiveness was dented by the disbanding of the Wagner Group after its abortive mutiny last year. It could take Russia \"up to 10 years to restore its military capabilities to their former strength\", the UK Ministry of Defence intelligence update reported in December. A \"staggering increase\" of average daily casualties is \"indicative of weakened Russian military forces\", said Business Insider , and a transition towards a \"lower-quality, high-quantity mass army\".\n\nRussia's \"blundering army\" could not beat Ukraine's 2nd XI, said The Guardian 's foreign affairs commentator, Simon Tisdall, last summer – \"even when sober and with the wind behind it\".\n\nNato vs. Russia\n\nFor Putin, a Russia-Nato conflict would be \"political and military suicide\", said Tisdall. But Russian journalist and military analyst Pavel Felgenhauer told DW that open warfare often comes down to far more than the inventories that each side can call upon.\n\n\"It's like predicting the result of a soccer match: yes, basically, Brazil should beat America in soccer, but I have seen Americans beat Brazil in South Africa,\" said Felgenhauer. \"You never know the result until the game is played.\"", "authors": ["Harriet Marsden", "The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Elliott Goat", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2019/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/russia/955863/who-are-russia-allies-ukraine-crisis", "title": "Who are Russia's allies in Putin's war against Ukraine? | The Week", "text": "Russia's foreign minister Sergey Lavrov visited Beijing this week, highlighting the increasingly close ties between the world's two leading authoritarian regimes.\n\nMinisters from both countries were due to \"discuss the situation in Ukraine and the Asia-Pacific region, issues of bilateral cooperation and interaction in the international arena,\" said Tass, the Russian state news agency, quoting Moscow's foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova.\n\nIt comes as Russia looks to secure closer ties with a number of allies from the Middle East to Africa to Eastern Europe.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

China is not a creator or party to the Ukraine crisis, and we have not and will not do anything to profit from it,\" Mao said.\n\nChina has \"sought to present itself as neutral in the Russia-Ukraine war\", said Newsweek, while \"indirectly aiding the Kremlin through economic support\" in the face of Western sanctions and pressure from the US. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has repeatedly emphasised strategic cooperation with Russia as part of a \"no-limits\" partnership that last year delivered a record $240 billion in bilateral trade.\n\nIran\n\nThere are \"many reasons why Russia and Iran are not formal allies\", wrote Nikita Smagin for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace think tank. \"Their rulers don't trust one another; they compete with each other on energy markets; and Iran's revolutionary Shiite ideology sits uneasily with Russia’s conservatism.\" But \"when it comes to military matters, they are drawing ever closer, united in their opposition to the United States\".\n\nIn February, Iran provided Russia with a large number of powerful surface-to-surface ballistic missiles, \"deepening the military cooperation between the two US-sanctioned countries\", said Reuters.\n\nIran's hardline clerical rulers have \"steadily sought to deepen ties with Russia and China\", said the news agency, \"betting that would help Tehran to resist US sanctions and to end its political isolation\".\n\n\"The war in Gaza has also had a significant impact on Iran's thinking,\" said Emil Avdaliani, a professor of international relations at European University in Georgia, on Stimson. With tensions rising between the US and Iran-backed proxies across the Middle East, the two countries are \"nearly on the same page when it comes to navigating different regional conflicts, from Ukraine to Syria and Afghanistan\", said TRT World.\n\nThe recent arms deal fits into \"a broader level of cooperation\", said Avdaliani, signified by the December 2023 free-trade agreement between Tehran and the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union.\n\nSouth Africa\n\n\"For years, the relationship between South Africa and Russia has baffled pundits and governments in the West,\" said Al Jazeera. The two countries share \"no cultural or linguistic ties\", or \"major trading\" arrangements, yet South Africa – \"like many other\" countries on the African continent – has not condemned Moscow's war against Ukraine.\n\nThis has been reflected in a \"flurry of high-profile visits\" by South African and Russian officials since the war in Ukraine began. And despite its insistence on neutrality, last year South Africa hosted ships, sailors and soldiers from Russia and China for joint military exercises.\n\nThe roots of the relationship date back to the struggle against apartheid, when Moscow helped finance and train the African National Congress (ANC) in exile when most of the world was happy to do business with white supremacists.\n\nThe \"show of support from South Africa, the most developed economy and an influential voice on the African continent, has provided crucial backing for Russia as its invasion of Ukraine has made it a pariah elsewhere\", said The New York Times.\n\nBelarus\n\nBelarus is regarded as a strong ally of Moscow and is \"increasingly\" doing Putin's \"bidding, socially, militarily and economically\", said The New York Times.\n\nRussia used Belarus territory as a \"springboard\" to send its troops into Ukraine on February 24 2022, said the AP news agency, and \"has maintained its military bases and weapons there, although Belarusian troops have not taken part in the war\".\n\nMost worryingly for the West, Aleksander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, has allowed Moscow to station nuclear arms within its borders, as well as fitting its bombers with nuclear weapons. In January, the Belarus defence minister said the country would put forth a new military doctrine that for the first time provides for the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nThe Russian president has led his country into “diplomatic isolation” since the invasion of Ukraine began, which was reflected by the gathering’s “far lower” turnout than previous occasions, said CNN.\n\n“For Moscow, this year’s summit was a relic of better times,” said Vadim Zaytsev at Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Russia’s “economic ties with Africa have frayed” and countries across the continent are facing severe food shortages as a result of Putin’s exit from the Black Sea grain deal last month.\n\nBut attitudes towards Russia “vary” across the continent, said CNN, and Moscow still has some vocal allies in Africa and other corners of the world.\n\nSouth Africa\n\n“For years, the relationship between South Africa and Russia has baffled pundits and governments in the West,” said Al Jazeera. The two countries share “no cultural or linguistic ties”, or “major trading” arrangements, yet South Africa – “like many other” countries on the African continent – has not condemned Moscow’s war against Ukraine.\n\nThere has been a “flurry of high-profile visits” between South African and Russian officials this year, “even as South Africa insists” on neutrality. But Putin has said he will not attend the BRICS economic summit in Johannesburg in late August, a decision that has relieved President Cyril Ramaphosa of the responsibility of deciding whether or not to arrest Russia’s leader in accordance with an International Criminal Court (ICC) indictment.\n\nAs a member of the ICC, South African authorities would have been bound to arrest Putin when he set foot in their country – a move that Ramaphosa said Russia had warned would be taken as “a declaration of war”.\n\nIn May, South Africa denied an allegation by Washington’s ambassador to the county that armaments had been loaded on to a ship in Cape Town that was heading for Russia. It is possible Ramaphosa’s government “really had no idea” that South African arms were being sent to Moscow, said the Financial Times – but they may have known “full well”.\n\nIran\n\nWashington claimed in December that Iran was Russia’s “top military backer”, reported the BBC. Speaking a day after Ukraine accused Tehran of supplying Russia with “kamikaze” drones used in deadly attacks, John Kirby, the US National Security Council spokesman, said he had seen reports that the two countries were considering joint production of lethal drones.\n\nTehran has denied supplying military support to Moscow, “though it admits it sold Moscow drones before the war started”, said The Wall Street Journal. Ukraine claims that Russia used “more than 1,000 Iranian drones in scores of attacks over the past year”, putting “a strain on the country’s air defence systems”.\n\nEmil Avdaliani, a professor of international relations, said in The Moscow Times in June that relations between Russia and Iran had “entered a new era of mutual cooperation”, and that the two countries’ interests – “whether military, economic or geopolitical” – had “aligned to an extent not seen for many decades”.\n\nChina\n\nIn February, the US said it was “very concerned” that China could be considering sending lethal arms to aid Russia’s war efforts in Ukraine after a “fraught” meeting between the two nations’ top diplomats.\n\nSpeaking to NBC News, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the US had information indicating that China was “strongly considering providing lethal assistance to Russia”.\n\nIn what Brent Sadler, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and a retired Navy captain, told The Wall Street Journal was “a historical first”, 11 Russian and Chinese ships “steamed close to the Aleutian Islands” off the coast of Alaska last week. “Given the context of the war in Ukraine and tensions around Taiwan, this move is highly provocative,” said Sadler.\n\nChina “has not explicitly condemned Moscow over the invasion”, noted Al Jazeera. But according to Western and Chinese officials, President Xi Jinping “personally warned” Putin against using nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the Financial Times reported last month, suggesting “Beijing harbours concerns about Russia’s war even as it offers tacit backing”.\n\nBelarus\n\nBelarus is regarded as a strong ally of Moscow – and is “increasingly” doing Putin’s “bidding, socially, militarily and economically”, said The New York Times (NYT).\n\nAleksander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, has allowed Moscow to keep nuclear arms within its borders, “as well as outfitting its bombers with nuclear weapons”. It signals “an important step” towards “Russia’s absorption of Belarus, a longtime goal of Mr. Putin”.\n\nBelarus may be a “virtual dependent of Russia”, said the NYT, but Lukashenko “is emerging with more power in the aftermath” of the Wagner Group’s uprising, said Jennifer Mathers, senior lecturer in international politics, in The Conversation last month. He is “playing a tactical game”, she said.\n\nBelarus’s interventions in Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin’s “mutiny episode show that he does not necessarily operate in lockstep with Moscow”.\n\nMali\n\nIn February, the Mali government said it had no need to justify working with Moscow on strengthening its military capabilities and importing oil and wheat, following a visit from Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov. Putin has promised to provide free grain shipments to the West African country following the collapse of the Black Sea deal last month.\n\nMali’s support for Moscow “highlights Russia’s growing influence in Africa”, said the Economist Intelligence Unit. In May, Burkina Faso’s interim president, Ibrahim Traore, described Russia as “a key strategic ally”, reported TVP World.\n\nWagner “exercises influence in the Central African Republic, Mali and Burkina Faso”, said Politico, offering its military “services” and helping to “prop up anti-Western governments in exchange for access to natural resources”.\n\nTraore denied that the Wagner Group had been his country’s armed forces in their ongoing conflict with Islamist groups. French troops were asked to leave Burkina Faso in February and Traore confirmed that Russia is now “a major supplier of military equipment and would remain so”, TVP World said.", "authors": ["The Week Uk", "Last Updated", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Elliott Goat", "Harriet Marsden", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/02/24"}]}

We value diverse perspectives, are open to new ideas and respect intellectual freedom. So it should come as no surprise that the thought of banning a book would make us riled.\n\nWhat happens when a book is challenged in school boards and public libraries? Titles can be removed from school curriculums or library shelves. Most public schools and libraries have boards made up of elected officials or members appointed by elected officials. It is by the power of these officials that a book can go from challenged to banned in a school district or public library. Even if it happens only once, it is one time too many.\n\nSure, there is the argument that we can bypass places such as public libraries and purchase a book. But that is true only for those with the financial resources to do that. For many, particularly children and young adults, school and public libraries are the only means to access literature.\n\nWith that in mind, USA TODAY staff looked at challenged and banned books and chose those that are meaningful to them.

Johnson\n\nWe’re failing young queer readers, specifically Black and young people of color, if a book like activist George M. Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” stays on banned-book lists. Published in 2020, this memoir-manifesto follows the author’s journey of growing up a queer Black person and is an indispensable piece of literature for high school readers. Johnson explores their childhood, adolescence and college years while revisiting traumatic and transformative experiences and weaves in important statistics about the LGBTQ community. Johnson candidly – and some might think, explicitly – explores their sexuality and unpacks their experiences with sexual assault in a way that’s necessary for readers to heal. The American Library Association listed the book No. 3 on its list of the 10 most-challenged books of 2021. Both a primer for teens looking to be allies to the LGBTQ community and a YA book meant to make young queer readers feel seen, Johnson’s “All Boys Aren’t Blue” is a force to be reckoned with. – Pamela Avila\n\n'Gender Queer' by Maia Kobabe\n\nWhy do we tell teens to shave their legs if we resent having been told to ourselves? This question, among so many others, has been haunting me since I read “Gender Queer,” Maia Kobabe’s autobiographical graphic novel that explores the author's experience coming out as nonbinary and asexual. Through the novel, Kobabe vividly unravels small personal moments common to so many young people, exploring the discomfort inherent in everyday experiences like routine Pap smears. Kobabe raises a lot of excellent questions about the social mores of gender and the avidity with which society feels compelled to assign gender even though it is unique to individuals. Reading “Gender Queer” for the first time was like experiencing a jolt of adrenaline. It’s a book about Kobabe’s journey, but it allowed me to reframe mine, offering me the space to excavate my past and challenge my own self-concept. “Gender Queer” encourages growth and self-acceptance, and its removal from libraries is a huge disservice to teens. – Madison Durham\n\n'The Hate U Give' by Angie Thomas\n\nOne of the most challenged books in the country is this award-winning, bestselling middle-grade novel. Since the book’s release in 2017, it has been no stranger to controversy. The book’s critics say there’s too much sex and profanity. Some said it breeds contempt for police. The crux of the story, however, is systemic racism. Sixteen-year-old Starr Carter loses her best friend, Khalil, after he is shot and killed by a police officer. It’s a familiar story: Khalil, a Black kid, was unarmed when the white officer shot him. Khalil’s death becomes national news. Protests ensue. And a narrative forms, painting Khalil as a troublemaker and drug lord. Starr is caught between two worlds: her poor neighborhood and the rich prep school she attends. It’s the same story many Black children have lived. After Khalil’s death, Starr finds her voice of activism and pride in her Black identity. The banning of Thomas’ book is another reminder many people are uncomfortable with the message of the Black Lives Matter movement. – Tracee Herbaugh\n\n‘Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda’ by Becky Albertalli\n\nSixteen-year-old Simon Spier has a crush on an anonymous gay classmate who goes by the name Blue online, and with whom he has been exchanging increasingly flirtatious emails. One problem: Neither knows the other’s real identity. Another problem: Simon is still closeted. But when a nosey classmate finds Simon’s emails and threatens to out him, cautious Simon needs to step outside his comfort zone before he’s pushed out. What’s so welcome about Albertalli’s tale of high school high jinks, secret crushes and fraught friend-group dynamics is how ordinary and familiar it is. This sweet and funny high school story is light on trauma and big on laughs, and a balm to queer readers who want to see themselves reflected in happy coming-out stories. (It also has a rather good film adaptation, “Love, Simon,” starring Nick Robinson and Jennifer Garner.) – Barbara VanDenburgh\n\n'Kafka on the Shore' by Haruki Murakami\n\nThis is one of the most hauntingly, mind-bendingly beautiful books I've ever read. The surreal novel weaves two parallel plots that meld music and metaphysics, time and fate, and loss and alienation as it follows the young Kafka Tamura, who is fleeing an Oedipal curse, and Satoru Nakata, an old man with a knack for talking to cats. \"Kafka on the Shore\" is an imaginative literary puzzle sure to challenge students and their conceptions of what a novel could, or should, be. Chock-full of surreal happenings, nothing is clearly defined in this book. Murakami leaves the story open-ended for readers, giving them space to decide what to draw from it – a level of freedom they may not often be afforded when dissecting more “classic” novels typically included in curriculums. In a setting where students are often instructed to find \"the right answer,\" \"Kafka on the Shore\" is a breath of fresh air that can stretch their imaginations. – Christine Fernando\n\n'Twilight' by Stephenie Meyer\n\nWhen I was 13 years old, I snuck into my sister’s room and grabbed a copy of \"Twilight.\" It was just before the \"Breaking Dawn – Part 1\" movie release, and \"Twilight\" fever had hit my school. The story of Bella, Edward, vampires and forbidden love features all the hallmarks of coming-of-age literature and introduced me to themes I hadn’t seen in media yet. \"Twilight\" brought me together with my peers to talk about reading, giving me new worlds to explore and new friends to talk about them with. Banning \"Twilight\" severely limits the opportunity for students to take reading into their own hands and enjoy a coming-of-age story full of fantasy and imagination. – Chris Panella\n\n'I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter' by Erika L. Sanchez\n\nFor young women struggling with mental health struggles, the loss of a loved one, the loss of innocence and outdated expectations that often come with growing up in a Latino household, Sanchez’s 2017 YA novel “I Am Not Your Perfect Mexican Daughter” can be a lifeline. In August, Madison County Schools in Mississippi removed 10 books from general library circulation, including Sanchez’s. High school is a tough time, and young people in particular pick up a book to escape reality or to make sense of the changing world around them – reading makes them feel safe enough to express how they’re feeling. And making a book like Sanchez’s inaccessible hinders the representation young Latino readers need. – Avila\n\n'The Odyssey' by Homer\n\nOdysseus’ 10-year journey after the Trojan War back home to Ithaca to his wife, Penelope, and son, Telemachus, has a lot going on – a lot dark going on. Witches, slavery, tricks, betrayal, Cyclopses, grim and gory deaths, cannibal giants, varied monsters, murderous guests and mass slaughter all feature in the epic (in the original sense) tale from the eighth century BCE. It’s a wild ride with bad role models, and there couldn’t be a more classic example of the Books by Dead White Men vein of literature. That being said: “The Odyssey,” both the book itself and the themes it explores, are so deeply woven into the fabric of our modern culture that the name itself is a genre. Knowing \"The Odyssey\" is like getting a peek into the source code of innumerable (truly) works of literature spanning 28 centuries, giving any reader a deeper, more nuanced understanding of not just countless works of art but of culture itself. (And as it happens, it’s a fantastic, gripping story that’s a joy to read in its own right.) – Jennifer Ernst Beaudry\n\n'Speak' by Laurie Halse Anderson\n\nIt's funny that \"Speak\" is so challenged, considering I was in high school when I read it. Apparently, it \"exposes children to immorality\" – reasoning you don't know whether to laugh or cry at. Adults who think teenagers aren't already exposed to everything probably don't remember what it was like being a teenager. Sexual assault, unhappy families and the nuances of high school life are real-world issues that teens are already aware of. Kids need books that start difficult conversations, that demonstrate the importance of using your voice and having someone who listens, that show you can rise above adversity. \"Speak\" is beautiful in its spare prose and simplicity. Many can relate to, and laugh with, Melinda's dry humor and cynical voice. It's a necessary story that gives permission to students whose voices are silenced to take up space – and speak. – Nusrat Sultana\n\n'Nineteen Minutes' by Jodi Picoult\n\nI was in eighth grade when the Columbine shooting happened, back when the concept of a school shooting was new. Children and teens today live in a very different reality, with active shooter drills and school shootings as part of their everyday life and consciousness. Parents have challenged this book because of its depictions of a school shooting; the bullying and romantic partner violence that led up to it; and the trauma and suicides that came after. Children are bullied. Teenagers are in abusive relationships. They get pregnant and grapple with decisions about abortion. Adolescents struggle to define their sexuality. Young people contemplate suicide and kill themselves. Banning books about these topics doesn’t make them cease to exist. The story, so beautifully told, touches on all of these topics because these are the traumas teens battle, some of which have directly contributed to violence in schools. If we’re unwilling to let young people read about, think about, process and dissect the very traumas they experience all around them, how can ever hope to solve these problems? – Katie Wedell\n\n'Blubber' by Judy Blume\n\nI read “Blubber” in fifth grade, and it's the most pivotal book of my youth. The book’s main character is a young fifth grader, Jill, who joins the more popular kids in the class to ostracize Linda, a girl nicknamed Blubber because of her size. The main reason the book has been banned is because nothing happens to Jill and her fellow bullies. That is precisely why I needed this book. In the fifth grade, I was Linda. “Blubber” was inspired by an incident in the author’s daughter’s own fifth grade class, and what Blume saw was not the exception but often the rule. In real life, bullies often get away with their behavior. While the similarity between myself and Blubber stung, it also provided solace. I was not alone. This was not something that happened only to me. Others knew how I felt. And that meant everything. It is always satisfying to read stories with happy endings, but it is just as important to read ones that don’t. Because in life, there are bullies and unresolved endings, and that is something that every fifth grader should know. – Mary Cadden\n\n'Lord of the Flies' by William Golding\n\nGolding uses preteen boys to show readers how a group of people will mistreat those they simply don’t like and even beat a child to death out of fear arising from a conspiracy theory. The use of boys as main characters may make it easier for some to understand the forces that can erode a society, or may make readers feel alarmed about the “end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart.” Either way, this book can prompt young readers think deeply about governance and societal leadership in a way that will inform them throughout their lives. – Erin Mansfield\n\n'Of Mice and Men' by John Steinbeck\n\n\"Of Mice and Men\" revolves around the friendship between two migrant workers during the Great Depression. I remember reading the book for my high school English class and thinking about loneliness as well as companionship. The two protagonists are brought together by a shared dream of purchasing land that's eventually shattered by the predatory social environment for migrant workers at that time. With this book, school-age readers have the opportunity to examine the conflict between reality and the American dream, in addition to human friendships. – Rayna Song\n\n'A Light in the Attic' by Shel Silverstein\n\nSilverstein’s collections of poetic nonsense was a classic on our living room bookshelf. His fantastical black-and-white sketches begged a wild imagination and a healthy sense of humor. They posed impossible scenarios, built as much for wordplay as they were for plot. \"A Light in the Attic\" has been banned in some schools over claims it promotes disrespect and violence. To argue this is to argue that children are unable to understand hyperbole. I am a deep believer that adolescent minds should be taken seriously, that they always understand more than we think and that they grow best when we overestimate them. The greatest children’s authors know this. I want the next generation to learn just as I did from Silverstein the joy of twisting words in different ways, of laughing at themselves, and of finding poetry and humor in everyday life. – Anna Kaufman\n\n'Eleanor & Park' by Rainbow Rowell\n\nRowell’s novel captures what it means to be a misfit teenage girl in a world that wants to cast you aside. As a teenager, this book made me feel seen as it keys into the nuances of being an outcast while coming into your own. This book has been banned for coarse language and sexuality, but it covers difficult topics such as racism, domestic abuse and body image that are enlightening for teen and adult readers alike. With high school years being a turbulent time for many, \"Eleanor & Park\" provides a much-needed perspective on surviving your teenage years in the face of adversity. – Samantha Mangino\n\n'Two Boys Kissing' by David Levithan\n\nI revisited “Two Boys Kissing” almost 10 years after first reading it, and – in the best possible way – it was more of a gut-punch than I'd recalled. The narration by a Greek chorus of men who died of AIDS is an emotional reminder of the strong bonds of chosen family. This book feels especially timely as progress on LGBTQ rights faces renewed political backlash and as monkeypox spreads mainly through our community. Reading “Two Boys Kissing” today shows how much has changed in the past decade while highlighting what work there still is to be done – and what we may be in danger of losing if we become complacent about our progress. The young characters remind us what is at stake and who most needs to hear these stories and feel a community’s love today. – Zach Wichter\n\n'Something Happened in Our Town: A Child’s Story About Racial Injustice' by Marianne Celano, Marietta Collins, Ann Hazzard\n\nAs this book follows a Black family and a white family discussing the police shooting of a Black man, its first page reads, “the grown-ups didn’t think the kids knew about it.” Amid nationwide conversations about race, many parents assume children are in the dark or unable to have meaningful discussions about racism. But children hear the murmurings and have questions. Shutting those down means lost opportunities for learning. A growing body of research shows children begin to notice race years before adults want to talk about it with them. Delaying these conversations and ignoring the realities of racism could make children more susceptible to racist beliefs. After all, it’s the adult’s responsibility to help children make sense of their social world. “Something Happened” approaches these conversations with care and includes child-friendly discussion guides curated by child psychologists to help encourage vital parent-child conversations about race. – Fernando\n\n'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' by Stephen Chbosky\n\nEvery person I’ve spoken to who read “The Perks of Being a Wallflower” when they were in high school remembers it as a teenagehood-defining book. Chbosky writes beautifully and timelessly from the mind of high school freshman Charlie, an introvert who gets taken under the wing of a group of upperclassmen and learns the value of letting others into his life. Some of the content throughout can be intense or inappropriate for younger readers – topics include alcohol, drugs, sex, abortion, mental health struggles, suicide and sexual abuse. But these are all things high schoolers can and often do experience, and blocking them from a story that explores them in a thoughtful, empathetic way doesn’t do anyone any good. More, it holds teenage readers back from discovering a story that may guide them through a tumultuous period. Years later, I count myself one of the lucky many to have found this story when I did. – Hannah Yasharoff\n\n'I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings' by Maya Angelou\n\nAngelou’s beautifully written autobiographical novel touches on two important and painful subjects that often get it banned from schools: rape and racism. While they may not be the most comfortable topics, they’re still as prevalent in 2022 as they were in 1969, when the book was published. It features some graphic depictions, but the sad truth is these topics are not new to many young adults, and reading about Angelou’s healing journey is instrumental in letting them know they’re not alone. Simply banning a book that depicts rape and racism doesn’t shield readers from facing them in their lives; it just removes another resource that may help them move forward. – Kate Ellsworth\n\n'The House on Mango Street' by Sandra Cisneros\n\nThere are some novels that read like poetry, and \"The House on Mango Street\" is on that list. Cisneros uses short vignettes to show key moments in the life of Esperanza, a 12-year-old Latina girl growing up in Chicago, poised in the awkward time between childhood and adolescence. The writing is truly lovely, and the use of vignettes creates a feeling of being inside someone’s memories. Through Esperanza, Cisneros creates a portrait of a community, both the love and support as well as the restrictive and painful aspects. The latter includes moments of domestic and sexual abuse, and as Esperanza ages within the novel, her understanding and descriptions of those situations become more explicit, although never graphic. It is easy to understand why the book has won multiple awards, as Cisneros plays with narrative form and storytelling, and questions what it means to belong in a fascinating and wonderful way. – Rebecca Viser\n\n'Maus' by Art Spiegelman\n\nSpiegelman's semi-autobiographical novel about his parents' experiences in Auschwitz and his family's subsequent lifelong traumas is a masterpiece of Holocaust literature and should be essential to all school-age readers. Though \"Maus\" is not a children's book, its graphic medium and depiction of Jews and Germans as mice and cats makes the topic more approachable for younger readers still trying to get their heads around the unfathomable historical horror. The only way to avoid a second Holocaust is to teach the first. –VanDenburgh\n\n'Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry' by Mildred D. Taylor\n\nAmerican public school reading curriculum is heavily white. I can attest to that with my own experience: In my 12 years as a student in American public schools, I was assigned only one novel by an African American writer, and that was Taylor’s Newbery Medal-winning story of the Logan family, sharecroppers in rural Mississippi whose love for one another helps them survive the cruelties of the Jim Crow South. I grew up a pretty privileged white kid with no personal experience of racism, and I can keenly recall how hot I burned with the unfairness of it reading “Roll of Thunder” for the first time in the second grade. If we want to create more anti-racists, we need to assign more diverse books in schools, and “Roll of Thunder” is still a great place for young readers to start. – VanDenburgh\n\n'Animal Farm' by George Orwell\n\nI first read it in middle school in Phoenix, only a few years after my family had escaped communist Vietnam in 1975. I checked it out of my school library because of the title and was ready for enchanted spiders and pigs like in “Charlotte's Web” by E.B. White. Instead, in Orwell’s attack on the Soviet Union, I recognized all too well what my family was hearing from relatives who hadn’t been able to flee the fall of Saigon. Daily indoctrination classes, South Vietnamese officers sent to reeducation camps and their homes confiscated and given to communist officers. Those who could still afford radios risked imprisonment to listen to Voice of America because you couldn’t believe the state-run media. Orwell wrote “Animal Farm” because he wanted to tell the story of the Russian Revolution in a way anyone could understand. And children everywhere need to. – Thuan Le Elston\n\n'Beyond Magenta: Transgender Teens Speak Out' by Susan Kuklin\n\nA 2019 study revealed that about 3% of American teens (ages 13 to 17) identify as transgender or gender-nonconforming. In this book, Kuklin interviews six trans teens about their childhoods, their coming-out experiences and where they are today. It brings hope to trans teens that there is a future for them, and it provides a clear look into their minds for loved ones to truly understand their points of view. Despite this book receiving many awards, it was in the top 10 Most Challenged Books lists for 2015 and 2019 for “its effect on any young people who would read it.” To the contrary, this book provides a unique perspective on gender and sexuality to help teens learn about themselves from other people their age. I believe this book does a great service to the young LGBTQ community. – Melissa Rorech\n\n'The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian' by Sherman Alexie\n\nI first read the story of Junior as he leaves his school on the Spokane Indian Reservation in Washington for an all-white school during Banned Books Week in middle school. As Junior struggles to find his place in a school where the only other Indian is the mascot, he grapples with generational poverty and discrimination. While I cannot fully understand Junior’s experience, I, as a person of color at an extremely white school, saw myself in his battle to explore identity in an environment that seeks to erase it. While the classroom offered a whitewashed, sanitized reality of Native Americans’ experiences, this book offered me a glimpse into the systemic oppression Native communities have faced since colonization. It shows tribes as part of the current fabric of our nation rather than merely part of history. And it examines a dimension of diversity that’s often forgotten: disability. In the hands of a trusted teacher who can guide students through difficult conversations, this story has the power to push readers into uncomfortable but important spaces and allow students whose experiences are often ignored in classrooms to be seen – all through the lens of an uproariously funny teen. – Fernando\n\n'Goosebumps' (series), by R.L. Stine\n\nIt’s fun to be scared. Granted, in controlled environments – movie theaters, haunted houses, or between the covers of a book. Or in the case of Stine’s beloved horror series, dozens of books starring a bevy of spooky frights: werewolves, ghosts, haunted Halloween masks and even an evil ventriloquist's dummy. These books have long been challenged in school libraries for being too scary, but those who object clearly don’t remember what it was like to be a kid with a vivid imagination. In a world so full of real horrors, the pretend ones offer escape and catharsis. Besides, if my generation could survive the “Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark” illustrations, what possible danger could a few “Goosebumps” books be? – VanDenburgh\n\n'Bridge to Terabithia' by Katherine Paterson\n\nFarm boy Jess Aarons and imaginative, bright-eyed new girl Leslie Burke become friends and create Terabithia, a fantasy kingdom in the woods. Inspired bythe magic they brought to that wooded glade, I once made my own Terabithia in a circle of tall trees in my backyard while playing outside with my friends. But (spoiler alert) after Leslie fell to her death when the rope they used to swing to Terabithia snapped, I was shocked. I didn’t know then that Leslie’s death and Jess’ experience of it would feel much like how my own loss would feel in the many years to come – random and senseless. Seeing Jess in the aftermath of Leslie’s death prepared many of us for what loss would feel like, the unsparing pendulum swinging between the good days and the bad. Their story also taught me the power of joyful imagination and creativity, that people are complicated (even the bullies) and that, despite the devastating reality of death, there is hope for life after loss. – Fernando\n\n'Brave New World' by Aldous Huxley\n\nFew classic sci-fi novels bear a more direct resemblance to modern times than \"Brave New World.\" Huxley explores a future in which the government’s obsessive need for economic growth creates an endless consumerist cycle and a society divided into a rigid caste system that separates people by jobs, intelligence and appearance. The world is painted as a utopia but only because its citizens are kept complacent by entertainment and mood-altering drugs. They believe they receive everything they want, but their places in society have been carefully curated by the government (and cloning technology). There’s no room to be an individual in Huxley’s futuristic England, and anyone who tries is punished. Consumerism. Prejudice. Happiness above truth. These are all things we continue to grapple with as a modern, global society. It’s as if Huxley traveled through time to 2021 before writing his novel. – Joanna Nelius\n\n'Are You There God? It's Me, Margaret' by Judy Blume\n\n“Why would anyone want to ban ‘Are You There God’?” my sixth grade daughter asked. “It’s my favorite book.” Grace is 11, the same age I was when I read Blume’s classic novel – only it was too new to be called a “classic” back then – about preteen girls grappling with puberty (breasts and periods, anyone?), religion and sexuality. As with Grace today, it was my favorite book then. I found comfort and familiarity in Margaret, her friends and her conversations with God. Their world was my world, and Blume paints an unvarnished picture of what life is like for maturing girls. Those frank discussions of sensitive topics – often challenging for tweens and adults alike – are why girls love the book and adults challenge it. And why this mom is thrilled that it’s still one sixth graders reach for and cherish, a generation later. – Kristen DelGuzzi\n\n'The Catcher in the Rye' by J.D. Salinger\n\nTwenty years ago, a school board member in small-town South Carolina checked out Salinger's work from the high school libraries in his district. He planned to pay for the copies instead of returning them, he told the local newspaper. He didn't want students to read the “filthy, filthy\" book and said the protagonist, Holden Caulfield, was a poor role model. He already had tried once to ban it. His second attempt failed as well – though it wasn’t part of any curriculum. When I agreed to write about \"The Catcher in the Rye\" as part of this year’s Banned Book Week, I had no idea that the most infamous protest against it happened at my high school. Or that it played out when I was a sophomore, only a few years younger than the fictional Caulfield, in the throws of the kind of angst and ennui that defined Salinger’s prose. I didn’t read it until my mid-20s. Afterward, I realized I’d missed the moment. My rebellious years were behind me and I’d forgotten how isolating they could be. How much I could have used a book like that at the time. Finally, learning why it had been kept from me has reignited some of that disquiet. It’s not lost on me that old men who think they know best and stand in the way of students reading great literature are exactly the sort of people Caulfield railed against. So let me now be the proverbial catcher for the next generation: Kids, read it all. Especially the ones The Man tells you not to. – Cara Kelly\n\n'Persepolis' by Marjane Satrapi\n\nWhen I first read “Persepolis” in college, I was immediately enchanted with the punk rock protagonist of the graphic memoir. I never lived through the Islamic Revolution in Iran, but to see Satrapi depict how the revolution disrupted people, families and communities has always stuck with me. I’m very much a supporter of women and girls who like to talk back, as Beyonce once sang, and who challenge the status quo. I’m not sure how anyone can read “Persepolis” and not be touched by how loving Satrapi’s family is even when they fear for her safety. Satrapi showed us what life was like as a young, rebellious woman growing up in Iran during the 1980s. For those who found a way to survive, they lived life as best they could. And like so many other young women coming of age, Satrapi had sex (gasp!) and cursed and used drugs. Experimenting is what young people do. It’s an insult to her vulnerability that some have tried to ban her book. – Mabinty Quarshie\n\n'The Glass Castle' by Jeannette Walls\n\nI first read \"The Glass Castle\" on assignment as a rookie reporter in my college town. The memoir had been selected by the university and county library as a summer book. It was an appropriate choice for two institutions little more than 100 miles from Welch, West Virginia, the closest thing the author has to a hometown. Many of the issues Walls faced as a kid are endemic to the area: poverty, substance abuse, violence. She tackled them head-on – so much so that her detailed descriptions have been used as fodder to ban the book from school curriculums. That shortsightedness misses how masterfully Walls infuses the truth about her problematic childhood with a sense of pride and perseverance. As a reporter in the Appalachian mountains, I knew kids there and across America were suffering the same social ills (and still do, made worse by the opioid epidemic, COVID-19 and financial downturns). Walls' writing tells them that they shouldn’t be ashamed of their circumstances and the decisions of adults around them, and that they don’t have to carry the stigma of poverty or abuse. I can think of few more meaningful messages. Save, maybe, the one she inscribed in my copy: “Just tell the truth!” – Kelly\n\n'The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time' by Mark Haddon\n\nThis was among the first books I read with a neurodiverse character at its core. Instead of letting Christopher sit on the periphery, Haddon brings the reader into Christopher’s perception of the world by writing the text in ways that make it more representative of his lived experience. The novel directly shows how Christopher perceives things, including how signs at a busy airport become overwhelming walls of text. This allows Haddon to bring into question whether what most people think of as “normal” is actually better. Christopher’s world is more compassionate and empathetic toward animals, including his pet rat, Toby, and the dog whose mysterious death he sets out to solve. Aside from being a phenomenal bildungsroman, the novel stands the test of time. I read it first as a teenager, and again in my senior year of college. Both times I walked away feeling as though I’d learned more than you’d think a fictional book could ever teach. – Lindsey Vickers\n\n'The Things They Carried' by Tim O'Brien\n\nThe Vietnam War may have started more than 60 years ago, but that doesn't make the war stories of \"The Things They Carried\" any less relevant for young readers today. It's not an easy read – but that's the point. Learning about the day-to-day struggles soldiers have to endure is not supposed to be easy. It's supposed to be uncomfortable. It's supposed to be vulgar, explicit, and confusing because that's exactly what soldiers face. The novel provides an unfiltered view of war that vastly contrasted the way people felt about World War II. It represents a pivotal point in history and mirrors the public sentiment of the ’70s when people stopped romanticizing war and started critically examining why we go to war and how it affects those who fight. This book presents a much-needed glimpse into the real lives of soldiers, and while it may not be a feel-good read, it’s a necessary one. – Ellsworth\n\n'The Golden Compass' by Philip Pullman\n\nThe same reason as to why “The Golden Compass” was banned is the reason it should be a must-read. The novel is often described as the antithesis of “The Chronicles of Narnia,” which is known for its Christian allegories, because of its supposed message of atheism. Pullman’s first book in \"His Dark Materials\" fantasy trilogy pushes the boundaries with young characters seeing through the lies of organized religion (in this case the Magisterium) and eventually killing “God” himself. Regardless of the readers’ religion, it’s important for children to learn to question any and all institutions. Through a more contemporary lens, readers will surely appreciate Pullman’s themes even if they don’t agree with his conclusions. – Josh Rivera\n\n'Beloved' by Toni Morrison\n\nMotherhood in the U.S. has never been easy. We are a nation that reveres motherhood without providing the resources moms need to thrive. Just look at how many mothers suffered during the coronavirus pandemic. Now imagine the trauma of being an enslaved Black mother who doesn’t even control her own body, much less her children's. “Beloved” shows us the impossible choices Black mothers were forced to make during slavery. Who could blame Sethe, the protagonist, for doing anything to prevent her children from being enslaved – even to the point of death? I certainly can’t. Slavery has never been pretty, and it never will be. There are moments of incredible pain and violence inflicted upon Black men and women in “Beloved.” We can’t look away from these horrors because a few people refuse to accept that racism was a fundamental part of U.S. history. Holding up the nation’s sins to our faces was a heroic choice Morrison made in her writing. And we were all the better for it. – Quarshie\n\n'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee\n\nWhen the school board in Biloxi, Mississippi, argued \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" should be kept out of the classroom in 2017 because it makes people \"uncomfortable,” they actually nailed the best reason to keep it on the shelves. Everything in the book is uncomfortable, and not because it accurately describes overt racism in sometimes noxious language. It’s uncomfortable because it holds up a mirror to our present: the ease with which neighbors will embrace lies and willingly fall in with a mob; a legal system working overtime to send a Black man to prison; how fear informs our uninformed view of the mentally ill; and the brutal dividing line between the poor and the privileged. This is a provocative book, not a perfect one. But the shortcomings of 1930s race, society and language it depicts which so distress critics – and made the Biloxi school board so uncomfortable – are not failings of the author’s words. They are the continued failings of our world. Now is not the time to look away. – Patricia Beall\n\n'The God of Small Things' by Arundhati Roy\n\nWinner of the Man Booker Prize, \"The God of Small Things\" focuses on twins and their family in Kerala, India. Roy explores how her characters’ lives – both past and present – are shaped by their social, political, religious and environmental surroundings. She provides readers with an insightful look into India’s colonial history, discriminatory caste system and the rise of the Communist Party in the nation in the late ’60s while challenging notions of forbidden love to present a complex portrait of an era and its societal consequences years later. It's an important read for students to understand the legacy of colonialism and the devastating impacts of discrimination. – Grace Hauck\n\n'The Outsiders' by S.E. Hinton\n\nWhen Johnny Cade implores Ponyboy Curtis to “stay gold,” it’s more than a wish from a dying friend. It’s a prayer of sorts to be carried throughout life, an adage to turn to when we need to offer encouragement or uplift ourselves. That line, taken from Robert Frost’s poem “Nothing Gold Can Stay,” is the moral centerpiece of Hinton’s “The Outsiders” and its study of innocence lost. Pitting the blue-collar “Greasers” against the wealthy “Socs” is a frequently employed trope, but the melancholy that pervades Hinton’s debut novel (which she wrote in high school!) resonates beyond a seemingly simplistic setup of contrasting socioeconomic status. Some find the murder in the book – Johnny and Ponyboy get jumped by the Socs and Johnny knifes one in self-defense – unsuitable for teen readers. But when Johnny later tries to rescue some schoolchildren from a burning church (and dies from his injuries), the point is made. Golden is eternal. – Melissa Ruggieri\n\n'The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn' by Mark Twain\n\nBecause of needed context, I wouldn’t read it before “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.” But “Tom” was a fling; “Huck” still holds my hand when I write. I can’t remember when I first read them, but English is my second language, and both helped me learn not only how English has changed but also how America has changed. When I met Huck, I heard only the boy’s voice and saw only what he understood. Upon rereading and realizing what Jim had been saying all along, I entered another universe through the eyes of a Black enslaved man, ripped from his family and fighting through his fear to survive. I never forgot how Twain gave depth to such different voices in “Huck.” He helped me write and rewrite my own novel. Keep “Huck,” for its teaching mechanics as well as its wise heart. – Elston\n\n'50 Shades of Grey' by E.L. James\n\nIn a time in which we consider ourselves forward thinkers, it is shocking to still consider any conversation revolving around sex taboo. \"50 Shades\" is one of the most well-known and controversial erotica novels, but there are a vast number of authors trying to broach the subject, many worrying their writing is good only behind closed doors. In writing \"50 Shades,\" James gives those writers a voice – those that have been waiting for the right moment to share their deepest, darkest desires with the world. It is necessary to normalize thoughts about sex and not slap tape across our lips to keep from expressing our tastes in the bedroom. – Nishka Dhawan\n\n'The Color Purple' by Alice Walker\n\nThe world would be a poorer place without Walker’s “The Color Purple.” Taking inspiration from her literary foremother Zora Neale Hurston, Walker centers on Southern Black women, who are all too often misrepresented in American culture. I was a little girl when I first picked up “The Color Purple” but it would take until I was an adult to fully comprehend the courage it took for Celie to let go of all the oppressive teachings she internalized and find her own freedom. Oftentimes, what people call “controversial” in literature is simply an author refusing to ignore the truth. Walker gave a gift to Black women and everyone else with “The Color Purple.” Celie’s relationship with Shug Avery may be a relationship that makes some people uncomfortable. But for Black LGBTQ people, it’s a necessary and affirming literary coupling. Don’t we all deserve to see our lives and truths reflected in the literature we read? – Quarshie\n\n'The Giver' by Lois Lowry\n\nA must-read dystopian novel for any teen, I first read this book in middle school, and then I reread it in high school and college. The main character, a tween named Jonas, is given the important role as ‘Receiver of Memory,’ where he is supposed to retain the beautiful and dark moments others in his community can't see. He can see color in a black-and-white world as well as the environment, animals, human emotions and past experiences. The book sheds light on the importance of freedom and living life as one chooses to, but the message goes deeper than that. Valuing our relationships with our friends, family, and colleagues in the real world is a gift. Oftentimes, we lose sight of what makes our life beautiful, even though it is right in front of us. And those lessons are conveyed elegantly in this book, from start to finish. Life is spontaneous and crazy, and there shouldn’t be someone telling us how to live our life when we have the ability to carve our own destiny. Banning this book would be a loss for children, not a gain – Sudiksha Kochi\n\n'A Separate Peace' by John Knowles\n\nI first read Knowles’ 1959 novel “A Separate Peace” at 14 as a closeted gay teenager. I next read “A Separate Peace” at 29 as an out gay adult. I provide this context because it absolutely shaped the way I read the story about wealthy teens at a New England boarding school at the start of World War II, and understood the relationship between Gene and Finny – one of platonic love bordering on romantic, one of pride bordering on envy and one of playing around bordering on violence. As clarified in David Levithan's afterword included in my edition, Knowles did not intend on homoeroticism between the characters. But Levithan gets to the heart of how I felt: “Knowles did not write about two boys who know they are gay or have conscious gay feelings, but he certainly created a compelling resonance for boys who do.” Thank you, Knowles, either way. – David Oliver\n\n'The Bluest Eye' by Toni Morrison\n\nSetting aside every major literary award bestowed upon her, Morrison’s oeuvre is too important to American literature to ever be cast aside or banned. I was a teenager the first time I read “The Bluest Eye,” too young to truly grasp the horror of what Morrison was writing about. Now, as a dark-skinned Black woman rereading it, I understand the suffering that Pecola Breedlove was subjected to. Little Black girls deserve literature that doesn’t shy away from the pain that white supremacy and patriarchy inflicts upon them. If we can’t read and contemplate the horrors that are inflicted upon our children, how will we ever make the world a better place? Yes, “The Bluest Eye” takes an unflinchingly look at sexual violence and incest. But in a nation still reeling from the #MeToo movement, we cannot afford to look away. Black women, like Native American women, are at a disproportionate risk for sexual violence. The literature written about African American women shouldn’t ignore these horrifying statistics either. – Quarshie\n\n'The Handmaid\\'s Tale' by Margaret Atwood\n\nAtwood said she didn’t include any events in the book that hadn’t already happened in history or any technology not already available. “No imaginary gizmos, no imaginary laws, no imaginary atrocities,” she wrote in The New York Times in 2017. The result is a book about a theocratic dictatorship that takes over the United States after climate change and declining birth rates threaten to cripple the nation’s economy. Fertile women are reproductive slaves, forced to bear children for the elite. In the 1980s, when it was published, the book read as a response to the political rise of Christian fundamentalists, the bombing of abortion clinics and the control of those behind the Iron Curtain. As we sit in 2021 with climate change threatening our coastlines and crops, a rising threat of nationalism and attempts to chip away at the hard-fought rights of women, minorities and the LGBTQ community, the plot seems evermore an apt prediction. What could be more important now than a book that explores the dangers of totalitarianism as we watch democracy challenged on the very steps of Congress? A book that explores the power of women as the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements push the next wave of feminism forward? A book with dire warnings about what can happen when resources get scarce, as drought and wildfires have become the new norm for a swath of our country? Because of its plausibility, \"The Handmaid’s Tale\" is timeless and relevant. It was a necessary book in the 1980s, and it's still a necessary book in 2021. – Wedell\n\n'1984' by George Orwell\n\nI read \"1984,\" one of the most thought-provoking and interesting dystopian books I have come across, back in high school when it was assigned reading for my English class. There is simply no other book that can show readers what it would be like to live in a society where the freedom to think and make choices for oneself is not allowed. The book sheds light on why it is important for people to express themselves and make choices, and why freedom of expression is important in society. Another important theme that struck my attention was misinformation and disinformation being spread by the ruling party. As an early career reporter, I strive to make sure the public knows the truth and the facts. This book is a must-read for any high schooler because it teaches lessons you wouldn’t get from any other book – Kochi\n\n'The Hunger Games' (series), by Suzanne Collins\n\nI fell down the \"Hunger Games\" rabbit hole during the pandemic. What started as something to pass time turned into a deep dive into Collins' post-apocalyptic world of Panem, a society deeply divided by wealth disparity, where the elite are more concerned with pageantry than basic human rights. I couldn’t help but notice some striking parallels between the dystopia and our pandemic-riddled nation. The rich got richer. The poor got poorer. And although we don’t send a boy and girl from each district to their televised demise, the constant loop of the trauma of Black and brown bodies being killed by police felt similar in the summer of 2020. The tale may have beenoutrageously dystopian when Collins published her first installment in 2008, but it is not as outrageous in the lens of 2021. Some Twitter users even compared the 2021 Met Gala in New York to a lavish party in District 1 as many communities grapple with the lasting effects of COVID-19. That’s exactly why this book shouldn’t be banned. – Cydney Henderson\n\n'A Wrinkle in Time' by Madeleine L’Engle\n\nThe first time I read “A Wrinkle in Time,” I was even younger than the sci-fi classic’s 13-year-old heroine, Margaret (Meg) Murray. At the time, I didn’t know how much I needed a heroine like her in my life. As I’ve reread the book (and read it to my own kids) many years later, I’ve sent up a brief word of thanks that I was introduced to Meg. She is thrust into impossible peril with unfathomable stakes, and she overcomes it. Resentfully, even angrily, she saves her family, not despite her flaws but because of them. A wild, strange, sprawling tale, “A Wrinkle in Time” let me know, just as it has for generations of young readers, that there’s immense power in being yourself; that the galaxy is weird, wide and wonderful; that love is the answer no matter the question; and that you can be terrified and do brave things anyway – in fact, you must. – Beaudry\n\n'Born a Crime' by Trevor Noah\n\nNoah’s 2016 memoir, \"Born A Crime,\" is at its core a love letter to his mother, whose romantic relationship with a Swiss man was a punishable offense in South Africa’s apartheid state. She rears Trevor through apartheid and its chaotic collapse, and eventually through her own abusive relationship with his stepfather by a mix of tough love, gallows humor and religion. Yet \"Born A Crime\" forces the reader – particularly American-born consumers – to look critically into corners where we too easily looked away. Certainly, apartheid was touched on in our history or government classes. Too often, though, its abstract presentation – brutal colonization, minority rule, a worthy martyr named Nelson Mandela – never encouraged us to get too close, lest we recognize our own pathologies. \"Born A Crime\" is breezy and sweet and often hilarious, a dubious target for censure, it would seem. Yet it does not equivocate in recounting a brutal chapter of history. – Gabe Lacques\n\n'Harry Potter' (series) by J.K. Rowling\n\nIt's a shame that Rowling tarnished her own legacy in recent years by attacking transgender people – for fans, her hate speech felt like a betrayal of the very values her books espoused. \"The Harry Potter\" novels have been frequently challenged by religious groups for supposedly promoting witchcraft. But snatching these books out of the hands of children because of that supernatural bogeyman would be doing them an awful disservice. The series taught a generation of readers about empathy, friendship and courage in the face of political danger – themes that Rowling would do well to apply to her own recent comments. Harry Potter is a powerful example of fiction's ability to make us more thoughtful and discerning people, and for that, it should not be banned. The books should continue to be shared and obsessed over, as they've been by readers of all ages for the past two decades. – Jason Lalljee", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/09/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/09/16/fact-check-steve-jobs-last-words-werent-commentary-wealth/5781676002/", "title": "Fact check: Steve Jobs' last words weren't a commentary on wealth", "text": "Katie Landeck\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe claim: Steve Jobs' last words were a commentary on wealth\n\nSteve Jobs’ last words were about his admiration of his family, not a critique of wealth, as a viral post claims.\n\nA post that has been circulating in different forms since 2015 claims the Apple founder and billionaire died disillusioned with his wealth.\n\n“In other eyes, my life is the essence of success, but aside from work, I have a little joy.

At first, she thought the message may be a scam.\n\n“My father texted me on messenger and he told me, ‘You know, I’ve been looking for my daughter for 51 years,’” Highsmith told KTVT.\n\nMelissa Highsmith, right, sits with her mother Alta Apantenco.

When the woman arrived to pick up the baby, she said, Apantenco’s roommate was looking after the child.

Here are a few things", "text": "Alia E. Dastagir\n\nUSA TODAY\n\nThe U.S. government once asked women what they wanted. It was 1977, and the eyes of the nation turned to Houston as an estimated 20,000 people — Gloria Steinem and Coretta Scott King, Democrats and Republicans, lesbians and straight women, those who were born in America and some who were not — gathered for the only federally-funded women’s rights conference of its kind in U.S. history.\n\n\"We promise to accept nothing less than justice for every woman,\" Maya Angelou told the exuberant attendees in a poem she composed for the occasion.\n\nThe National Women’s Conference called for ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, which would explicitly ban discrimination based on sex. The women asked for affordable childcare, equal pay for equal work and that the federal government fund abortions for women who could not afford the procedure. They stressed the importance of national healthcare. They called for an end to discriminatory rape laws. They demanded the nation stop deporting immigrant mothers of American-born children.\n\nIn 2017, the government didn't ask women what they wanted, but hundreds of thousands of them spoke up anyway. They poured into the nation's capital for the Women's March on Washington, flooding the streets to articulate many of the same demands as those women in Houston 40 years ago — and to insist that what rights had been granted remain protected. They called again for the Equal Rights Amendment to be included in the Constitution. They emphasized again the need for \"affordable childcare,\" \"equal pay\" and \"access to safe, legal, affordable abortion and birth control.\" They said women have a right to live \"free of all forms of violence against our bodies\" and that \"it is our moral duty to keep families together.\"\n\nWhile the demands were echoes of 1977, the mood was different in 2017, tinged with trepidation over the election of President Trump, whose treatment of women raised eyebrows before and during the campaign, and led some Republicans to denounce him. Ultimately, enough voters decided they either did not believe the sexual assault accusations against Trump, or they did not care.\n\n“The power of men to decide what the world is going to look like, what counts and what doesn't, hasn't really been terribly disrupted in a generation,” said feminist legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw.\n\nWomen have made undeniable advances — from American boardrooms and courts of law, to universities and sports arenas — but disparities remain, especially in poor or rural areas and in communities of color.\n\nThough feminism seems pervasive — democratized by the Internet and popularized (and commodified) by high-profile women such as Beyoncé and Ivanka Trump — women’s rights remain in flux depending on who's in power. Women's rights are expanding in some states — New York in 2016 enacted 12-weeks of paid family leave — and rolling back in others — Ohio recently banned abortions at 20 weeks, which violates the viability threshold set by the Supreme Court in Roe v. Wade. Ohio's law does not include exceptions for rape or incest.\n\n“There is a lot of work to be done before culture and policy can align toward progress,” said Vicki Shabo, vice president of the National Partnership for Women & Families, a non-partisan advocacy group.\n\nAs Women’s History Month kicks off, here's a look at where a number of women’s issues stand:\n\nHealth: From gains to wait-and-see\n\nAcknowledging women's roles as primary caregivers, the 1977 conference named national health care as one of its federal priorities. In 2010, President Obama signed the Affordable Care Act, expanding coverage to millions of women, forbidding the denial of coverage based on gender and guaranteeing access to birth control, maternity care and breastfeeding supplies. The National Partnership for Women & Families called the ACA \"the greatest advance for women’s health in a generation.\" Trump and Republicans in Congress vow to repeal and replace it.\n\nSexual and domestic violence: Still too common\n\nThere is more awareness and condemnation of violence against women than ever before, yet statistics still paint a grim picture. One in 3 women have been a victim of some form of physical violence by an intimate partner, according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, and one in six American women will be the victim of an attempted or completed rape, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. The Department of Justice reports that rates are even higher for transgender and bisexual women.\n\nIt is unclear how the Trump administration will enforce existing federal legislation to protect survivors: During her confirmation hearing, Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos avoided directly answering whether she will uphold Title IX's federal guidance instructing colleges to combat campus sexual assault, and U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions did not support the most recent authorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which he is responsible for enforcing.\n\n\"The point of feminism is you shouldn't have to be a man to be treated with equal respect,\" Crenshaw said. \"You shouldn't have to be a man to be able to walk down the street without worrying about being sexually abused.\"\n\nPaid family leave and childcare: Behind other countries\n\nThe United States is an outlier among developed countries when it comes to paid family and medical leave, which allows people time off to care for a newborn, help a sick family member or recover from a serious illness. The Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) provides up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave, but according to the National Partnership for Women & Families fewer than 40% of workers qualify for it. Some employers offer paid family leave, but the group says it covers only 14% workers. California, New Jersey and Rhode Island have implemented paid family leave laws and New York and the District of Columbia are in the process of enacting them.\n\nIn Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress Tuesday night, the president said: \"My administration wants to work with members in both parties to make childcare accessible and affordable, to help ensure new parents have paid family leave, to invest in women's health.\"\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump introduced a plan for paid maternity leave, championed by his daughter Ivanka, which proposed the federal government guarantee six weeks of paid maternity to some birth mothers. Democrats said only offering leave for mothers, not fathers, stresses the notion that raising children is women's work. Republicans expressed concern about costs and the burden on businesses.\n\nSome studies, however, suggest leave policies are good for business, because they lead to happier employees and less turnover. Family leave also has significant positive effects on young children's health, fathers' involvement and breastfeeding rates, studies show.\n\nThe U.S. also does not offer universal pre-K, though research shows paying for early childhood development leads to lower rates of high school dropouts, criminal activity, teen pregnancy, drug and alcohol abuse and other health problems, all of which create a burden on society — and taxpayers.\n\n\"When you raise a law-abiding studious child you are producing economic value,\" Ann Crittenden, author of The Price of Motherhood, said in urging taxpayers to look at the long game.\n\nAbortion was legal then and now. But ...\n\nFollowing the 2010 elections, more anti-abortion politicians seized power in state legislatures, leading to a proliferation of abortion restrictions across the country. State laws like Arkansas' 48-hour waiting period create significant hurdles for rural and poor women, advocates say. There are only three licensed abortion providers in Arkansas, according to the state's department of health. A limited number of clinics means a woman may have to travel long distances to access the procedure, and a waiting period means she incurs two days of transportation and lodging costs compounded by two days of missed wages, as well as two days of possible childcare (according to the Guttmacher Institute, nearly 60% of women obtaining an abortion are already mothers). Planned Parenthood says an in-clinic abortion can cost up to $1,500 in the first trimester.\n\nThe president and vice president are against abortion, and advocates of abortion rights view Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, as a threat.\n\n“It's not a settled issue in the U.S.,\" said Carol Sanger, author of the forthcoming, About Abortion: Terminating Pregnancy in the 21st Century. With a few more appointments, she said, it is possible Roe v. Wade could be overturned.\n\n'Equal pay for equal work'\n\nThe wage gap is narrowing, but has barely budged in the last decade, according to the non-profit Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR). Overall, women earn 80 cents for every dollar earned by men, according to the National Partnership for Women & Families, with black women earning 63 cents and Latinas earning 54 cents. Critics argue these figures do not reflect factors such as occupation or experience. One can't, they say, compare the salary of a female teacher to that of a male lawyer. But economists say even when those controls are present, a wage gap persists. Female doctors, for example, are paid about $20,000 less a year than male doctors.\n\n\"The majority of the current earnings gap comes from within occupation differences in earnings, rather than from between occupation differences,\" Claudia Goldin, a Harvard University labor economist, wrote in a 2014 paper.\n\nThe Equal Pay Act forbids sex-based wage discrimination, but women's rights advocates say it's poorly enforced.\n\nThe wage gap is worse for women with children, who face a steep \"mommy tax.\" Motherhood is tied to a 4% decrease in earnings per child, while fatherhood is tied to a 6% increase, according to a 2014 study by UMass Amherst sociology professor Michelle Budig, and the penalty for mothers is worse for low-income women who can least afford to pay it.\n\nWomen are also less likely to ask for high compensation and studies show they are penalized more than men for trying to negotiate.\n\nAt the Conservative Political Action Conference last week, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway noted a time she struggled to define her worth during her career. Years ago, she said was asked her speaking fee for an event that would feature herself and a male speaker. \"I froze because I knew no matter what I said in return to the question of 'what is your speaking fee, what are you worth, what is your value to do this,' no matter what I said I was going to undercut myself. I was going to be that self-denying girl who grew up in that house of all women, a giver not a taker ... It's not his fault if I undercut my value,\" Conway said. What she decided to do was to say: \"I'll have what he's having,\" requesting the same rate as the male speaker.\n\nCritics of equal pay interventions often frame the debate around women's personal choices, while equal pay advocates say it should focus on how the structure of American work does not align with the realities of American life. According to the Pew Research Center, women make up nearly half the workforce, and are breadwinners in 40% of households with children, yet they are more likely than men to make compromises when the needs of children and family members collide with work, which they say negatively impacts their careers.\n\n\"There are long-standing beliefs that there are separate worlds and responsibilities for women. Women are different and so they make these choices and some part of this inequality is simply the product of choices women make,\" Crenshaw said. \"You can't blame all of the inequality women face on difference. It's not difference, it's a matter of power — who gets to decide what a worker is, who gets to decide what the implications of reproduction are, in whose vision is a worker basically somebody who has no childcare responsibilities?\"\n\nPolitical representation: At this rate, women will reach parity in 100 years\n\nThe number of women in politics is increasing — sluggishly. Women are 51% of the population, but make up 19% of Congress and only a quarter of state legislatures. Women are on course to reach parity with men by 2117, according to IWPR. Research shows women have different legislative priorities than men, and are more likely to introduce bills addressing the needs of women and children. Jennifer Lawless, author of Women on the Run: Gender, Media, and Political Campaigns in a Polarized Era, said the chief reason for unequal political participation is that women, perceiving bias, are less likely to run than men. When they do, she said, they are elected at the same rates.\n\nFrom a voter perspective, the IWPR said more women are turning out to the polls, but many states are passing measures that make it harder to vote, including reducing polling sites and enacting strict voter ID laws, which disproportionately affect vulnerable communities. Fewer polling places mean longer lines, a burden on less advantaged voters who tend to have less flexibility with work and childcare arrangements.\n\n“My right to vote as an upper-class white woman with multiple college degrees is not in jeopardy,\" said Nancy Young, a political historian at the University of Houston, \"but what about a working class African American woman or Hispanic woman?”\n\nWomen are not a monolith\n\nThe 1977 women’s conference formed with bipartisan support, but in the decades since, women's issues have grown increasingly politicized. Marjorie Spruill, author of Divided We Stand: The Battle Over Women’s Rights and Family Values That Polarized American Politics, said a major factor was the rise of a potent conservative women’s movement, led by activist Phyllis Schlafly, which denounced the feminist agenda and successfully mobilized to defeat the Equal Rights Amendment. The conference “made people really line up on extreme sides,” Spruill said. While feminists debated at the Houston Civic Center, conservatives held a dueling Pro-Life, Pro-Family Rally at the city's Astro Arena.\n\nIn 2017, a conservative view of feminism acknowledges gender inequality, to varying degrees, but does not share progressives' ideas to combat it. Sabrina Schaeffer, executive director of the conservative Independent Women's Forum (Kellyanne Conway has a seat on the board), said addressing inequity is important, but top-down mandates may not be necessary or economical. She said the Republican party must rethink its approach to women's issues to attract new voters, but she rejects the Democratic narrative that she argues turn women into victims and ignores that some disparities are caused by the choices individual men and women make.\n\n\"Gender is not the whole story,\" Schaeffer said.\n\nAmerican women share common struggles, but differ greatly in their experiences, which is why \"women's rights\" remain so divisive and why its tent is so broad. Karla Holloway, a professor of English and Law at Duke University who focuses on African American cultural studies, said conversations that fixate on the achievements of Hillary Clinton come at the expense of mothers working minimum wage jobs to keep their families above the federal poverty line. As some women become more visible, others disappear.\n\n\"Women who are elevated are still vulnerable,\" she said. \"Women who have been erased are drowning.\"\n\nAlia Dastagir writes about media and culture for USA TODAY.

Yet he couldn't wrap his head around what his informant was describing.\n\nIt was November 1992, and the man was talking about a visit to a home in Reeds Spring, Missouri. He said he'd been forced at gunpoint to use methamphetamine manufactured there. But something was off. The informant didn't mention beakers, flasks, Bunsen burners — none of the complex glassware Cornille was taught were part of meth labs.\n\nInstead, the informant reported an unusual scene: Black trash bags stuffed with empty boxes of cold medicine. A mason jar full of kerosene, with something resembling a hockey puck settled at the bottom. Starter fluid. And a cookie sheet in the oven, with a yellowish cake on it.\n\nCornille, like other DEA agents, had made meth himself, under controlled circumstances, as part of his official duties. It was standard practice; the agency knew it meant he'd have more credibility when he asked a court for a search warrant or filled out a probable cause statement recommending criminal charges. It was important that prosecutors see him and other agents as experts on the manufacturing of illegal drugs.\n\nAs Cornille sat down to request a warrant for the Reeds Spring home, he couldn't be that authoritative. He needed another source, someone who could credibly link common household items with the production of meth, a highly-addictive substance known for its energy boost. He called a chemist working for the DEA in Chicago.\n\n“I still remember what he said, because I wrote it down word for word,\" Cornille recalled in a recent interview. \"He said, ‘There’s a basis for such a formula in literature, but it’s not been seen in the United States.\"\n\nIt's been nearly 25 years since the investigation, but that's not the only comment that remains lodged in Cornille's memory.\n\nAt some point, as the informant was describing the unusual lab in Reeds Spring, Cornille asked him if the meth was any good. If the answer was no, he figured, the situation might not be that big a deal. Low-quality stuff was unlikely to spread.\n\nThe informant, however, had five words for him:\n\n\"Best dope I ever had.\"\n\nThree months later, in Springfield, Cornille sat across from a recently-arrested 49-year-old man.\n\nWith a voice recorder rolling, Cornille introduced himself for the record, then moved on to his guest.\n\n“With me today is Mr. Bob Paillet,” Cornille said, according to a transcript. “Mr. Paillet has agreed to talk to me and explain to me different methods of manufacturing methamphetamine. One using the sodium metal and anhydrous ammonia and then a couple others.”\n\nCornille told Paillet — pronounced “Pie-ay” — that he wanted \"just to sit down and talk to you about those different methods.\"\n\n\"How you discovered them, and so forth,” Cornille said.\n\nPaillet began by saying he'd always been interested in chemistry and physics and that he'd \"just played around with my chemistry set.\" Then he got detailed. He talked about molecules, replacement reactions and acetic acid, about catalysts, synthesis and hydroxyl groups. Scientific terms flowed with minimal prompting.\n\nAbout halfway through the conversation, Paillet made a remark that fell somewhere between a suggestion and a prediction.\n\n“You’re gonna have to send all your agents back to school and learn chemistry … There’s people out there that are going to great lengths to avoid getting caught,” he said.\n\nCornille responded. “Well, see I went to school to learn how to manufacture methamphetamine and to …”\n\nPaillet cut him off.\n\n“All the old ways,” he said.\n\nCornille joined the DEA in 1985 after serving on the local police force in Washington D.C. He spent the remainder of the decade in the nation's capital, fighting the crack epidemic. In 1990, he was transferred to southwest Missouri. At that point, Cornille recalls now, meth ranked about third on the agency's local priority list. Cocaine and marijuana were much more prevalent.\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1990s, however, the number of meth labs seized by the authorities drastically increased, first in Missouri, and gradually in other communities around the country. Before the decade was out, as the public and the media sought answers as to how the drug shifted from a problem to a crisis — how it grew powerful enough to ravage entire communities — law enforcement would point to Paillet by name.\n\n\"He brought it to life for this area,\" Springfield police Cpl. Dan Schrader told the News-Leader in 1998.\n\nPaillet essentially converted the process of producing meth from a complex formula — one that required the so-called \"cook\" to have a chemistry background — to a simple recipe that could be followed by the masses. DEA and court records indicate Paillet taught his method to others, who in turn taught it within their own respective circles. The man behind the unusual meth lab in Reeds Spring learned the method from one of Paillet's friends, Cornille said.\n\nPaillet wasn't a drug lord; he didn't control a network of associates. In fact, he did the opposite, spawning a generation of cooks by unintentionally democratizing an illegal industry. One textbook released in 2014 called Paillet \"arguably the Johnny Appleseed for the spread of local meth production throughout the Midwest.\" Journalist Frank Owen, in his own book released in 2007, wrote that Paillet “effectively decentralized the local meth trade … broadening the appeal of the drug.\"\n\nIn other words, Bob Paillet reinvented meth.\n\nHow did he do it? The story he told law enforcement revolves around the Springfield campus of Missouri State University, which at the time was known as Southwest Missouri State.\n\n“Bob claims he went to SMS’ library, and in a research manual he found this method of converting pseudoephedrine to methamphetamine using sodium metal as one of the catalysts,\" Cornille said. \"He claimed that at the top of the page was a swastika.”\n\nThus the moniker: The new process was the \"Nazi method.\" The new stuff, \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“I really believe that his method, here in Springfield, was the bounce to get meth spread throughout the rest of Missouri and the United States,\" said Nick Console, who ran the DEA's Springfield office from the mid-1990s through the early 2000s.\n\nDespite Paillet's pioneering role in an American drug epidemic, relatively little has been known about him. In the later years of his life, he appears to have avoided public scrutiny, as well as further trouble with the law. He died in Texas, age 72, on Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nPaillet's death and the passage of time have obscured some details. Other key elements — like his recipe's alleged connection to the Third Reich — have taken on the characteristics of urban legend.\n\nCourt documents obtained by the News-Leader shed light on his arrest and the early spread of the Nazi method. Interviews with family members and a key associate, none of whom have previously spoken publicly, paint a picture of a man with an obsession who left public officials scrambling to respond for years.\n\nThe probable cause statement used to charge Paillet, written by Cornille, traces his arrival on law enforcement's radar to Jan. 24, 1993 — just over a week before he was arrested.\n\nThat day, the Polk County Sheriff’s Office arrested two Springfield residents, Christopher Fricks and Kimberly Lee Duncan, for possession of a controlled substance and possession of a short-barreled shotgun.\n\nIt's not clear from court documents how or why Paillet's name came up as the two were taken into custody. What is clear is that they told deputies of two places where Paillet stored materials he used to make meth.\n\nThe first was a room in a house Fricks was renting in Joplin. Authorities searched it on Jan. 28. The second was a property near the small town of Morrisville, where Paillet previously lived. One of his ex-wives allowed law enforcement on the property on Feb. 1. Both tips were substantiated.\n\nThen, on Feb. 2, a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper and Polk County deputies headed to Paillet's apartment on West 3rd Street in Battlefield. Paillet wasn't home, but his current wife was, and she began speaking to the men. She mentioned her husband would sometimes disappear for up to three weeks at a time, telling her he was working in Kansas City.\n\nMidway through the conversation, Paillet drove up in a tan 1983 Chevy Cavalier. He walked inside, and set an unzipped black duffel bag on the floor. The grip of a pistol stuck out from the top, and the trooper quickly moved to secure the gun. It was loaded: Nineteen rounds, one in the chamber. Paillet said he'd traded for it.\n\nThe trooper and the deputies asked Paillet to talk outside. He said sure.\n\nThey walked out and the officers read Paillet his Miranda rights. According to court documents, Paillet “stated he was glad to see them and glad that it was over.”\n\nThen he began to talk.\n\nStanding outside his Battlefield, Missouri, home with a state trooper and several sheriff's deputies, Bob Paillet gave the men consent to search his vehicle.\n\nHe knew why they were there. Before they could open the door of his Chevy Cavalier, he told them what they'd find: methamphetamine, inside a small white pill bottle in the trunk. Once the drugs were retrieved, Paillet led the officers back inside and pointed out the two sawed-off shotguns under a bed.\n\nThe same day — Feb. 2, 1993 — the trooper and the Polk County deputies drove Paillet to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's regional headquarters on Kearney Street. There they were joined by John Cornille, a Drug Enforcement Administration agent based in Springfield.\n\nAuthorities found a note in Paillet's pocket, with a chemical formula written out. They also found two receipts, from trips to Walmart.\n\nShortly before dusk, after speaking with investigators, Paillet led the men to Room 431 of the American Inn Hotel in northeast Springfield, where he showed them the meth-making materials he had stashed there. Then they all drove across town to a storage facility in Battlefield, where he kept a second stash.\n\nThe News-Leader reported the bust two days later, with the headline \"Police nail 'Nazi Dope' laboratory in Battlefield.\" The authorities said chemical disposal workers wearing special suits and protective gloves spent about three hours clearing the storage unit. They estimated disposing of the chemicals would cost the federal government $35,000.\n\nThe story noted that, nationwide, the number of meth lab busts had declined in recent years. But it also quoted the head of a local drug task force, with a premonition that would turn out to be spot on.\n\n“This Nazi dope is definitely new to this area, and it could be the first in the U.S.,” said Steve Whitney, also the sheriff in nearby Christian County. “I still think we may see this more and more.”\n\nAlthough credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of producing meth — and opening the door to an era of amateur meth labs across the Midwest — Paillet himself has remained something of a mystery.\n\nNews stories and a handful of books published in the decades since his 1993 arrest have presented scant detail: He moved from California to Missouri in the 1980s and, upon finding meth was more expensive than he was used to out west, set out to make it himself. He researched chemistry at the library at Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was arrested. He moved to Texas.\n\nThat narrative covers just a portion of his life.\n\nBorn on March 4, 1943, Robert Paillet was 72 when he died Jan. 1, 2016.\n\nHe left behind two daughters. In an email to the News-Leader, the oldest offered a theme for his biography:\n\n\"My father is a classic case of what PTSD does to a brilliant mind.\"\n\nSpeed. Crank. Dope. Ice. Zip. The poor man's cocaine.\n\nWhatever you call it, meth is a stimulant that affects the central nervous system.\n\nIt's odorless, typically white and can be found in powder and crystal forms. In the United States, it has for decades been a schedule II substance, which means it has some very limited accepted medical uses — for conditions like attention deficit disorder and obesity, under the trade name Desoxyn — but also a high potential for abuse, as well as psychological or physical dependence.\n\nOne of the things that sets meth apart from other illegal substances is its means of production.\n\n\"Unlike other major drugs of abuse, methamphetamine is a synthetic drug, and as such, is manufactured in a laboratory,\" the DEA wrote in a 2016 report. \"Methamphetamine does not rely on a plant as its main source and is not affected by drought, flooding, growth cycles, or other natural elements that affect production. Instead, methamphetamine production relies on the ability of traffickers to obtain precursors and other essential chemicals.\"\n\nMeth is most commonly smoked, snorted or injected. Its use causes an increase in energy and alertness and a decrease in appetite. Meth also produces an intense euphoric rush, and can make users hypersexual. Cornille said the high from crack cocaine lasts for a matter for minutes. With meth, the high lasts for hours.\n\nMeth can cause increased heart rate and blood pressure, tremors and convulsions and — particularly with repeated use — depression and motor and cognitive failure. Users also tend to not sleep for extended periods, which leads to additional detrimental effects.\n\nBob Paillet's death certificate lists his birthplace as San Diego. His oldest daughter, now 48, said her father was actually born on Canada's Vancouver Island, although his parents had previously lived in California.\n\nLisa Paillet — who spoke to the News-Leader on the condition that her real first name not be used — said Bob's father, Francis \"Fred\" Paillet, was a Vermont native and worked as a carpenter and master gardener. His mother, Quebec native Louise Marie Paillet, was a maid and cook.\n\nThe family moved to Fort Smith, Arkansas, when Bob was in junior high, then to the small town of Exeter, Missouri, about 60 miles southwest of Springfield, several years later. After graduating from Exeter High School in 1961, Bob enlisted in the Navy and was sent to California's Bay Area. He was taking forestry classes at the University of California-Berkeley when, in 1964, he was deployed to Vietnam on the aircraft carrier USS Ranger.\n\nLisa said her father returned to the United States with \"debilitating migraines and a jaundiced view of the world,\" after a commanding officer \"rode one of his crew members so hard\" that he committed suicide. She believes Bob had post-traumatic stress disorder, although he was never formally diagnosed. For the most part, Lisa said, her father avoided talking about his time at war.\n\nUpon his return home in 1965, Bob Paillet married Lisa’s mother, whom he met in Berkeley prior to his deployment. They briefly lived in Oakland before embarking on a year-long trip around the United States, ultimately ending in Kansas City. Over the next five years, Bob and his wife bounced back and forth between there and the Bay Area. Bob never returned to college.\n\nLisa was born in California in 1968. She said her father had an assortment of jobs over the years. Sometimes he flipped houses, or built new ones. He liked to purchase and restore antique cars, a lifelong passion of his, for resale. He wasn't always self-employed, however. When Lisa was born, he worked as a lineman for the phone company.\n\nAround 1970, the family of three was living in Kansas City, where Bob worked for a fiberglass company. One day, he saw a friend and co-worker get electrocuted. It's a moment that \"damaged\" her father, Lisa said.\n\nThe family moved back to California, where Bob reconnected with a friend who was using meth. At some point, Lisa said, the friend got hold of a bad batch and became sick.\n\n\"So my father went to the Berkeley public library and the university library and started researching chemistry books,\" Lisa said.\n\nWhy chemistry books? Bob \"wanted him to have clean drugs.\"\n\n\"That’s my father’s logic,\" she said. \"Not get him off the drugs — but make them better.”\n\nWithin a few years, Lisa said, Bob became \"really flaky and moody.\" Around 1973, at Bob's request, Lisa's mother gave her husband a year to travel and find himself. He took two. When Bob came back, the couple divorced.\n\n\"After that, I saw him off and on for camping trips, hiking, or things like roller skating,\" Lisa said. \"It was a good compromise. I got to see him when he was in the mood to play. If he was not, he was not around. This basic relationship carried us through life.\"\n\nThe extent to which Bob used or produced meth in the ensuing years is unclear. Sometime during the two-year break, Lisa said, Bob met the woman who would become his second wife. His youngest daughter, Gena Paillet, was born in the Springfield area in 1978.\n\n\"I can remember I grew up terrified of him, because he would be one happy person one minute and literally in a second go to this terrifying person,\" Gena said.\n\nBy the time he was arrested with methamphetamine in the trunk of his car in 1993, Bob Paillet was on his third marriage.\n\nHe had fathered two children, born 10 years apart, in different states, to different women. The lives of his daughters, to this day, have had relatively little overlap.\n\nBoth women, however, have memories of living with their father on a plot of rural land along Highway JJ, not far from Morrisville, Missouri. The town of about 400 is 25 miles north of Springfield.\n\nThe remote venue in the anonymous rolling hills of the Ozarks appears to have been one place where Paillet refined the work that would later turn the meth trade on its head.\n\nGena Paillet, Bob's youngest daughter, lived there in the mid-1980s. She and her father had recently moved back to Missouri from California. Her mother, Bob's second wife, stayed behind in the Golden State for a year to work. Gena and her father lived in a modified school bus while Bob began building a house.\n\nIt was a simple setting. The bathroom for a time was an outhouse. But the property gave Gena, who says she grew up fearing her father, what she calls \"some of the best memories of my life.\" There were dense woods to explore, and the property abutted the Little Sac River.\n\n“We’d go swimming in that all the time and catch crawdads, things like that,\" Gena said. \"I’ve thought about going back to that property.\"\n\nWithin a couple years, however, Bob and his second wife separated. Gena said her father was unfaithful and verbally abusive. She and her mother went to live in Morrisville.\n\nNot long after, in 1987, Bob's oldest daughter, a product of his first marriage, arrived at the property.\n\nLisa Paillet — the first name is a pseudonym — grew up in California, where she was born in 1968. She saw her father only occasionally, but at times felt his presence even when he wasn't around. In high school, Lisa said, adults would sometimes show up and \"imply that they knew my father and were supposed to watch out for me.”\n\nLisa came to live with her father as she prepared to attend Southwest Missouri State University in Springfield. He was footing the bill.\n\nThree decades later, Lisa remembers the property as a place where her father experimented. Bob never said exactly what he was doing, and Lisa sensed it might be best if she didn't exactly know. She recalls helping her father hook together motors and going on shopping trips to Walmart to buy cold medicine.\n\n\"He would buy tons of that stuff, and he said it was easy for him to break down to get the chemicals he wanted,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob coached Lisa not to give her name to people. If somebody came looking for her father, she was supposed to deny that she knew him. Instead of guard dogs, the property near Morrisville had guard geese. The animals tend to raise a racket when they're disturbed.\n\n\"If you heard the geese and it was dark outside, you hit the lights and you hit the floor,” Lisa said.\n\nThere is some overlap in Lisa and Gena's memories. Both recall a room on the property where they weren't supposed to go. Gena distinctly remembers hiding behind a tree one day, on a weekend visit sometime after her parents separated, and watching her father go inside.\n\n\"I just remember seeing this one huge table ... with beakers and pots and things smoking and, you know, tubes going from one to the other,\" she said. \"I didn’t know what it was, but I knew he was up to something. And by his behavior becoming much more erratic, we knew something was wrong. We just didn’t know what.”\n\nBy the 1980s, the U.S. meth trade — both manufacturing and distribution — was largely run by outlaw motorcycle gangs. In some places, it was the Hell's Angels. In Texas, it was the Bandidos.\n\nNick Console, a Louisiana native now living in Ash Grove, joined the DEA in 1983, and was soon working out of the agency's Houston office.\n\nIn an interview, Console said that meth labs back then were primarily located in out-of-the-way, rural areas, so the rotten egg smell produced during a cook wouldn't give the operation away. They were full of glassware, not unlike a scene from the hit TV series \"Breaking Bad.\" The labs churned out batches of the drug measured in pounds.\n\nBusts by the authorities would sometimes lead to shoot-outs. At times, cleaning up a lab consisted of dumping the chemicals in the nearest ditch, Console said. The Environmental Protection Agency had yet to sound the alarm. Nobody thought to wear a respirator.\n\n“These labs, they were out in west Texas, they might be out in the boonies in an old mobile home, but everything in that mobile home was a lab,\" Console said.\n\nMeth was big business for the bikers, and it required a specialized workforce, he said. The gangs employed their own chemists, who generally used what is known as the P2P method, in reference to its incorporation of phenylacetone, a chemical often used for industrial cleaning or photo processing purposes.\n\nBack then, Console said, “you had to be a chemist to make meth.”\n\nThe meth trade's biker era bled into southwest Missouri. In 1987, Glennon Paul Sweet, a local member of the Hell's Angels-affiliated Galloping Goose motorcycle club, gunned down Highway Patrol Trooper Russell Harper during a routine traffic stop just outside Springfield. It was later determined Sweet, who was ultimately put to death, was transporting meth.\n\nThe wooded hollows of southern Missouri once attracted moonshiners. By the late 1980s, the region's rural nature and sparse law enforcement presence were seen as ideal for making meth. DEA officials reported that manufacturers were buying or leasing farmhouses and converting them into P2P labs. Still, they were few and far between; Cornille said agents typically came across a couple of labs per year.\n\nAfter being transferred from Houston, Console worked for the DEA overseas in Turkey, then in San Francisco. In the fall of 1994, about a year and a half after Paillet's arrest, he arrived in Springfield as the DEA's new resident agent in charge.\n\n“When I got here, it was the beginning of the spike in meth labs,\" he said.\n\nLisa Paillet doesn't believe her father was ever in a motorcycle gang. But Bob definitely associated with some shady types.\n\n\"I know that when I was in circles of people that I would consider very bad people, he was known in California,” she said.\n\nLisa also said her father \"would have hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash sometimes, and then he would have nothing.\"\n\nEither way, Paillet had no prior criminal record when, in January 1993, he became a person of interest to law enforcement agencies in southwest Missouri. The authorities had encountered a new type of meth lab — using what became known as the \"Nazi method\" — in the town of Reeds Spring just a couple months earlier.\n\nIn DEA records reviewed by the News-Leader, Paillet said he was the one who discovered the new process, but never specifically stated when that happened. Evidence suggests, however, that it was years before his arrest.\n\nThe Reeds Spring lab wasn't the first of its kind. A Nazi method-style lab was found in 1988 in a trailer park in Vacaville, California, according to a 1990 article in the Journal of Forensic Sciences. Authorities later came to believe Paillet was behind the lab — a conclusion that appears supported by his numerous connections to the state.\n\nThe Nazi method starts with the compound pseudoephedrine, which, chemically speaking, is one oxygen atom removed from methamphetamine. Pseudoephedrine is the active ingredient in cold medicines sold under brand names such as Sudafed.\n\nHere’s how a former DEA chemist described the ensuing process:\n\nTo make meth, the manufacturer pulverizes the pseudoephedrine pills in a coffee grinder, creating a fine powder that is placed in a coffee filter. Methyl alcohol, in the form of something like windshield washer fluid, is poured over it, and then evaporated out.\n\nThe cook then adds ether, anhydrous ammonia - a compound commonly used by farmers as fertilizer – and sodium metal or lithium metal, which can be stripped from commercial batteries. That produces a liquid called meth oil.\n\nMore ether is added, and the solution is put through another coffee filter. A bubbler is then used to convert rock salt and other material to hydrogen chloride gas, which converts the meth oil into a white powder. Meth.\n\nThe Nazi method is also sometimes referred to as the Birch method because it builds upon the Birch reduction, a reaction first reported in 1944 by the Australian chemist Arthur Birch.\n\nThe significance of the Nazi method was how simple it was. When DEA agent John Cornille gave talks to community members, he'd compare it to baking a cake.\n\n“Bob made meth a recipe anyone could follow,” he said.\n\nThe Nazi method produced small amounts of the drug, not the big batches typically cooked up in rural \"superlabs.\" But unlike previous manufacturing methods, Nazi dope didn't require an open heat source. It involved fewer steps, and took less time.\n\n\"From start to finish, you could probably do it in an hour,\" Cornille said.\n\nAdditionally, the chemicals involved were legal, and often easy to obtain. It takes hundreds of pseudoephedrine pills to make a half ounce of meth. But purchasing cold medicine in vast quantities didn't raise eyebrows in the early 1990s.\n\n\"At that time, if someone came in and bought 10 boxes of pseudoephedrine, Walgreens was happy,\" Cornille said.\n\nBob Paillet ordered a pecan waffle with extra butter and a glass of milk, then settled into the booth at a north Springfield Waffle House. He was wearing a wire.\n\nAfter being arrested on Feb. 2, 1993, the Springfield-area resident told the authorities that he'd taught his new recipe for methamphetamine — the so-called \"Nazi method\" — to a friend. Now, less than 24 hours later, Paillet, 49, was killing time reading the newspaper, waiting for that man to arrive. Drug Enforcement Administration agent John Cornille and a Missouri State Highway Patrol trooper were listening from a van parked nearby.\n\n\"Hey, late as usual,\" Paillet said as Mike Poplawski, 34, arrived.\n\nA transcript of the conversation that took place over breakfast — obtained from the DEA under the Freedom of Information Act — is heavily redacted, with Poplawski's comments completely blacked out.\n\nBy the time they parted ways, however, Poplawski had given Paillet 279 milligrams of meth, according to court documents. The wire caught everything.\n\nThe next day, Cornille and the trooper showed up at Poplawski's home on South Newton Street.\n\nPoplawski was cooperative. He invited the officers in, and, when told there was an ongoing investigation that involved him, admitted that he cooked meth, according to court documents. He showed the trooper a baggie of the drug inside his wallet, and then took them to another apartment where he stored lab equipment and precursor chemicals.\n\nLater, at the DEA office, Poplawski confirmed he'd been taught by Paillet how to make meth using the Nazi method.\n\nIn a recent interview, Poplawski, now 59, said he first met Paillet in 1979.\n\nRollerskating was the thing to do back then, and \"we were both hotdoggers,\" Poplawski said, using a term for those fond of showing off. The pair — 35 and 21 years old — met at a north Springfield rink. Poplawski said they were among the first in the city to purchase jogger skates, basically tennis shoes with big, brightly-colored wheels.\n\nPoplawski said he believes Paillet might've smoked a little pot back then, and he drank, but he didn't do anything harder. Then Paillet left for California. When he returned, he was into meth. And Poplawski was, too.\n\nHe attempted to describe his relationship with Paillet back then.\n\n\"Friend?\" he said. \"No. Associate. Close associate.\"\n\nIt's unclear from court records when Paillet taught Poplawski the Nazi method. Poplawski declined to clarify the timeline.\n\nPoplawski did state that, sometime in 1992, there'd been what might be called a misunderstanding between the pair. Paillet asked Poplawski to stop giving meth to a mutual friend of theirs. Poplawski complied. The friend complained to Paillet, who by that point had forgotten his earlier directive and became angry at Poplawski. The two stopped talking.\n\nThen six or eight months later, there was a phone call. And a request to meet at the Waffle House along North Kansas Expressway. From Poplawski's perspective, it seemed an effort to repair the rift.\n\nSitting in the living room of his east Springfield home, Poplawski briefly looked over the redacted transcript of the conversation that day. Some of it was small talk, he said. Mostly, Paillet was \"crying about hurting, wanting some speed.\"\n\nIt's been nearly a quarter century since the conversation, and Poplawski doesn't have a single positive thing to say about Paillet.\n\nThe man was chauvinistic, he said. A shorter guy with \"a big man's want for power,\" someone who walked around \"like a bantam rooster.\" A guy who \"hit on every woman that he come across, no matter what.\" And a man whose defining obsession — all speeders have one, Poplawski said — was \"his process,\" the way he made his dope.\n\n\"He experimented on people,\" Poplawski said. \"He’d change the formula a little bit and then give it to junkies he knew’d take it and ask no questions, and then watch their reactions. This is the guy that DEA worked with.\"\n\nAs Poplawski looked at the transcript, he wouldn't even agree with Paillet's remark that he showed up to the Waffle House late.\n\n“I’m more on time than anybody I know,” he said.\n\nThe authorities didn't stop with Poplawski.\n\nShortly after 9 p.m. on July 26, 1993, Cornille and three other law enforcement officers parked their vehicles in rural Webster County, with a barn in sight. They were investigating the latest appearance of Nazi dope. Cornille remembers hearing coyotes howl.\n\n\"Having moved from D.C. to here, it was a bit of a change for me,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, an informant told a Springfield police detective that a man named Frank Wright was planning to cook meth at the barn, which was owned by an associate, Gary Davis. The men would start once the sun went down, the informant said, to take advantage of lower humidity levels. The informant indicated Wright drove a green Dodge van. It was parked by the barn.\n\nInvestigators would later learn that, earlier that afternoon, Davis heard that a friend with a similar vehicle was stopped by the DEA. Davis became nervous and told Wright to \"burn the barn\" if agents showed up.\n\nAround 10 p.m., the van started up. It drove off the property, headed west. Cornille and the others followed and initiated a traffic stop.\n\nWright agreed to a search. The van was clean. But the officers found a cigarette pack with a small amount of meth on Wright himself. They read him his rights.\n\nWright admitted to the authorities that he was planning to cook meth, and said he was placing supplies inside the barn. It was to have been something of a trade, court documents indicate. Davis, in exchange for providing the setting for the cook, was to receive two \"eight balls\" — the term for an eighth of an ounce — and be allowed to assist in production, so as to learn the new method himself.\n\nWright was arrested. The barn, by all accounts, escaped unharmed.\n\nDavis contacted the DEA a week later. He admitted to knowing about plans for the cook and said he'd participated in an earlier one.\n\nWright, in turn, contacted the DEA in mid-August. He said he'd been introduced to meth about 18 months prior when he was at Poplawski's home. Paillet showed up to deliver the drug. Wright said he started doing work on Paillet's vehicle, and his involvement gradually grew, until he was loading and unloading chemicals and driving Paillet around while he distributed meth.\n\nWright told the DEA that Poplawski taught him to make meth. He described it as a somewhat formal process that entailed assisting with three cooks. (Poplawski, in a recent interview, denied ever teaching anyone the Nazi method).\n\nThe hardest ingredient to obtain was sodium metal, Wright told the DEA, so he figured out a way to manufacture it himself, using lye, an electric stove, jumper cables and a 12-volt car battery.\n\nHow did Wright come up with the workaround? Perhaps his time with Paillet influenced him.\n\n\"In late June, 1993, or early July, 1993, Wright did research into the manufacture of sodium metal at Southwest Missouri State University,\" court documents say.\n\nPaillet, Poplawski, Wright and Davis were indicted by a federal grand jury on Oct. 8. 1993, along with two others, Kenneth and Sybil Allen. Court documents say Poplawski sold meth to, and purchased meth from, the couple. The charge against Sybil Allen was later dropped.\n\nNone of them were rich, at least as far as the court knew. Financial affidavits indicate that Poplawski was the only one employed in a traditional sense, bringing home $280 a week. Paillet and the others were listed as self-employed or unemployed, with minimal assets.\n\nThree of the men had a record. Poplawski had been convicted in 1978 of felony robbery in Phelps County. Two others had stealing and drug offenses.\n\nThe men all initially pleaded not guilty and bonded out of jail. Dates were set for jury trials. Behind the scenes, however, negotiations were being made for plea agreements.\n\nBetween mid-December and early January 1994, all five pleaded guilty to conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth. In exchange, additional charges against some of them, for physically manufacturing or possessing the drug, were dropped.\n\nWith Paillet and his co-conspirators rounded up, the authorities could have been excused for thinking they'd nipped the nascent meth-making boom in the bud. But they were soon disappointed. The recipe for Nazi dope was no longer a secret.\n\nThe inaugural class of those involved with \"Nazi dope\" was sentenced in Springfield in the spring of 1994.\n\nThere was Bob Paillet, who told authorities he was the pioneer behind the new meth labs popping up in southwest Missouri; Mike Poplawski, to whom Paillet taught his new method; Frank Wright, who said he learned it from Poplawski; Gary Davis, who arranged to learn it from Wright; and Kenneth Allen, who bought meth from, and sold meth to, Poplawski.\n\nAllen, who tested positive for using drugs while on bond, was sentenced to three years probation.\n\nDavis also used meth while on bond and traveled without permission out of the state. He was sentenced to five years in prison.\n\nPoplawski was sentenced to nearly six years in prison.\n\nIf the sentencing guidelines at the time were followed, Wright would've faced something similar — between six to seven years behind bars. Prosecutors, however, told the judge he provided \"substantial assistance\" in the prosecution of Poplawski. So he was sentenced to about three years in prison, followed by a similar amount of probation.\n\nThen there was Paillet, who received the best deal of them all.\n\nUsing the sentencing guidelines, prosecutors calculated Paillet's \"total offense level\" to be 31. That would correspond with nine to 11 years behind bars. The prosecutors, however, wrote that \"defendant agreed to fully cooperate with the government.\" He was credited with assisting in obtaining the guilty pleas of the others: Poplawski, Allen, Wright and Davis.\n\nAdditionally, the prosecutors wrote that Paillet \"provided significant information concerning the origin of this particular method of making methamphetamine.\"\n\n\"Defendant fully admitted that he first devised this method of making methamphetamine, and it was through him that the method was related to other 'cooks' in the southwest Missouri area,\" they wrote.\n\nPaillet was sentenced to five years of probation. He also attended a drug treatment program. While there, he received a letter from his oldest daughter, living in California.\n\n\"Surprise, Surprise,\" she wrote. \"If I would have known you could do things like that I would have asked for help with my chemistry homework.\"\n\nNearly a quarter century later, Poplawski doesn't understand how Paillet didn't spend a day in prison.\n\n“This was the man that experimented on people, and the DEA worked with him,\" Poplawski said. \"I’m a little burnt about that, still. It still rises my anger a bunch. Not that I was interested in working with them myself, don’t get me wrong, and not that I wasn’t involved, don’t get me wrong there. But I was not the man on top. I was not the man to hit for the heavy sentence.”\n\nPoplawski was implicated when Paillet wore a wire to their meeting at a north Springfield Waffle House. Poplawski told the News-Leader the pair never spoke after that day, except for one comment when they found themselves in the same courtroom.\n\n\"No hard feelings,\" Paillet told the man who had once been his friend. Poplawski, flabbergasted, didn't respond.\n\n\"If I could’ve shot lightning out of my eyes, he’d have been a pile of flesh, a pile of ash, in a heartbeat,\" Poplawski said. \"He just cost me five years. He cost me five years.”\n\nThere's something about calling a drug recipe the \"Nazi method\" that attracts attention.\n\nA few days after Paillet was arrested in February 1993, the News-Leader wrote about the bust. A spokeswoman for the Drug Enforcement Administration was quoted saying that \"people give their drugs all kind of names.\"\n\n\"Just because it was made by German soldiers during World War II and now is called 'Nazi drugs' has no meaning to us,\" the spokeswoman said. \"It's a nothingness. It only means that the producers don't have to use the usual ingredients, that they can make it without the regular methods. It's dangerous, no matter what you call it or how you make it.\"\n\nThere's a problem with the spokeswoman's response — one that's been replicated in many subsequent discussions of the Nazi method. It implied there's a direct link between Paillet's recipe and the Third Reich. But is there? After reviewing the available evidence, the News-Leader found the connection, while compelling, is tenuous.\n\nResearchers have delved into German use of meth during World War II. Temmler, a Berlin-based pharmaceutical company, introduced meth in pill form under the brand name Pervitin in 1938, according to a 2005 report in the news magazine Der Spiegel. By 1940, millions of pills were being shipped to the front lines, resulting \"in a Blitzkrieg fueled by speed.\"\n\nGermany wasn't alone in exploiting new substances with minimal consideration for side effects. The United States and British supplied service members with tablets of Benzedrine, an amphetamine, during the same period. Both were viewed as particularly valuable for pilots, who needed to remain alert on long bombing raids.\n\nThe large-scale manufacture of Pervitin pills in German factories, however, stands in stark contrast to Paillet's method, which resulted in small amounts of a powdered version of the drug. Which raises the question: If the method wasn't the same, how did meth produced in southwest Missouri end up referencing a fascist state?\n\nIn an interview, DEA agent John Cornille said that Paillet told him he learned the Nazi method by researching in the library at what was then Southwest Missouri State University. Cornille said Paillet indicated he came across a book or a document with a swastika on it.\n\nThose two particular claims aren't found in the hundreds of pages of federal court and DEA records reviewed for this story. The DEA records, which were heavily redacted, do include one conversation in which Cornille asked Paillet if he looked \"this stuff up in a book or something.\" The response, however, contradicts the notion that there was one all-important document.\n\n\"OK, I have a lot of books,\" Paillet said. \"I have gone through the library, many libraries and read lots of books, hundreds of 'em. Ah, involving many phrases of chemistry.\"\n\nCornille asked what books \"originally kinda gave you this idea that maybe this thing could work.\"\n\n\"I can’t say that it was any one in particular,\" Paillet responded.\n\nCornille told the News-Leader he believes most of the backstory Paillet gave regarding his discovery. However, he said the DEA tried to determine the exact book that contributed to Paillet's breakthrough, but came up empty-handed.\n\n“I believe he found it in a book at SMS,\" Cornille said. \"But the swastika thing — they looked far and wide.”\n\nThe man who did the searching says it's a little more complicated than that.\n\nTerry Dal Cason retired from a 40-year-career as a forensic chemist with the DEA in 2011. He told the News-Leader that, back in the mid-1990s, his colleagues in the world of meth lab analysis didn't talk vaguely about a cook in southwest Missouri coming across a book or document with a swastika on it, as Cornille does now.\n\nInstead, Dal Cason said, they specifically mentioned a \"Nazi patent.\" Some of his colleagues stated as fact that the cook came across a patent that contained the exact recipe for Nazi dope. But Dal Cason wanted proof.\n\n\"People kept talking about this patent, and I was trying to get a copy of it,\" he said.\n\nDal Cason ended up with two theories. In 1997, he laid them out in an article for a little-known DEA publication called Microgram.\n\nTheory one:\n\nDal Cason wrote that \"one of the earliest groups\" to make Nazi dope compiled packets of documents that included instructions for the method, and hid them away from their lab sites. If the lab was busted, the hidden packets insured they'd still have a written copy of the recipe somewhere, Dal Cason wrote.\n\nWhat does that have to do with the name? \"The top page of the synthesis 'packets' was a photocopy of a drawing from the cover of a video cassette case of the Third Reich propaganda film, 'Triumph des Willens,'\" Dal Cason wrote.\n\n\"Triumph of the Will,\" the English translation of the title, was commissioned by Hitler. The drawing Dal Cason referred to shows an eagle clutching a wreath containing a swastika.\n\nDal Cason wrote in 1997 that \"it is relatively easy to postulate how the seizure of these packets could present an opportunity to misinterpret a relationship between the most recognizable of NAZI symbols and the Li (or Na)/NH3 reduction procedure contained in the packets.\"\n\n\"From this point it is easy to imagine a 'word of mouth' genesis of the 'Nazi patent' myth,\" he wrote.\n\nThe documents and court records reviewed by the News-Leader do note materials seized in connection with the investigation of Paillet and his associates, but don't mention the German propaganda film. Dal Cason told the News-Leader he didn't recall the specific individuals who apparently hid the packets. The footnotes of his Microgram article reference cases filed in federal court in 1996, years after Paillet was arrested and the Nazi dope moniker was first used.\n\nTheory two:\n\nDal Cason also asked a colleague in the United Kingdom to search German patents. Those published from 1932 to 1945 were topped with the \"Imperial Eagle,\" a coat of arms depicting an eagle perched on wreath containing a swastika (similar, but not identical, to imagery on Triumph Des Willens).\n\nLeslie King, head of the Forensic Science Service's Drugs Intelligence Laboratory, wrote Dal Cason in October 1996, and said he failed to find a patent for the technique Paillet used.\n\nThere were, however, patents that were somewhat related. Dal Cason said the packets mentioned in his first theory contained not just a recipe for the Nazi method, but also instructions for another process using methcathinone.\n\nDal Cason said King found a German patent from 1936 which provided techniques for synthesizing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine using methcathinone.\n\n\"The chemical names 'Ephedrinen' and 'Pseudoephedrine' are easily recognized among the German wording of the patent,\" Dal Cason wrote. \"Misinterpretation of the patent's content, combined with a clandestine laboratory having chemicals appropriate for the Li(Na)/NH3 method, might easily lead to the assumption that this process was described in the patent.\"\n\nTo be clear, however, the patent wasn't describing the method Paillet used. And to Dal Cason's knowledge, no one ever found a copy of the German patent in connection with a lab bust — it's something for which Dal Cason had to search.\n\nThe audience for Microgram, where Dal Cason's article appeared, was largely limited to law enforcement. An editor's note attached to the piece read: \"If anyone has hard evidence that a 'NAZI' patent does exist, please contact the Microgram editor.\" Dal Cason never heard from anyone.\n\nPoplawski, for his part, offered a third theory.\n\nIn an interview, he said Paillet \"wasn't smart enough to invent\" the method, and that he must have gotten the recipe from someone else. Poplawski also said he never heard Paillet or any of his associates use the phrases 'Nazi method\" or \"Nazi dope.\"\n\n“The first time we heard it the DEA threw it out there, and we had no idea what they were talking about,” he said.\n\nWhy does all this matter? Words stir emotion. Dan Viets — a defense attorney based in Columbia, Missouri — told the News-Leader that, by the late 1990s, prosecutors were brandishing the Nazi method moniker \"as a weapon\" in front of juries, taking advantage of the average person's extreme dislike of Nazis.\n\nViets considers the term \"obviously prejudicial,\" particularly given the the lack of an established connection between Paillet's method and actual Nazis.\n\n\"The cops liked to say that as many times as they could in a courtroom,\" he said.\n\nThe sentencing of Paillet and his associates didn't stop use of the Nazi method.\n\nInstead, the opposite occurred. The small-scale labs began to proliferate.\n\nAt first, most state and local officials, such as the average rural county sheriff's office, didn't have the training to safely deal with meth labs. Instead, they'd call the DEA. As the 1990s progressed, Cornille says he began feeling like a firefighter, rushing from small blaze to small blaze without time to investigate their causes. Instead of fires, of course, it was meth labs — although the explosions the labs sometimes prompted could end up blurring the distinction.\n\nThe Missouri State Highway Patrol, contacted by the News-Leader this fall, could only find records regarding the number of meth lab incidents in the state annually dating back to 1996. That year, according to the patrol, there were 121 labs found.\n\nThat figure increased to 319 in 1997. Then 480 in 1998. Then 615 in 1999.\n\n\"Once everything got rolling, it spread like wildfire,\" said Nick Console, who led the DEA's Springfield office for about a decade starting in 1994.\n\n(A meth lab doesn't have to be operational when it is discovered to be counted in state or federal tallies of \"meth lab incidents.\" Those tallies generally also count situations when authorities seize materials used to make meth, or find sites where lab waste material has been discarded.)\n\nCornille said he recalls Paillet telling him that he taught five people his method for Nazi dope.\n\n“My initial thought was if we could get those five, we could make an impact,\" Cornille said. \"But it didn’t work. Maybe we didn’t get one or we didn’t get to them fast enough.”\n\nConsole said he spent the mid-to-late 1990s trying to warn DEA leadership in Washington D.C. that what was happening in southwest Missouri was a serious situation, one that could get worse if unchecked. He says the leaders didn't feel a sense of urgency.\n\n\"We’re trying to tell them — it’s not heroin, it’s not cocaine,\" Console said. \"It’s not a major organization, like a biker gang, that’s producing large amounts of methamphetamine. It’s Mr. Smith and Mrs. Smith down here, and the Johnsons over here, making a half ounce. In their eyes, that wasn’t a problem. That was a local problem. It wasn’t a national problem.\"\n\nThe spread of the Nazi method meant that a drug once manufactured in large quantities by \"superlabs\" situated away from populated areas was now being produced on a small scale within towns and cities.\n\nConsole said he can tell stories all day about unusual busts.\n\nThere was the time agents executed a search warrant and noticed bullet holes in the ceiling of a bedroom. When they asked the home's resident why, the man said he knew the agents were monitoring him from his attic, so he shot at them while he laid in bed. The agents hadn't been to the house previously.\n\n“Think about being up without sleep for seven days,\" Console says. \"Think about it. Where would your mind be, where would your body be? So they’d become very paranoid.”\n\nThere was the man in Joplin whose lab exploded, the force of it enough to embed sodium metal in his skin. Sodium metal reacts when it comes in contact with water. When someone went to clean the man's body with a saline solution at the hospital, the sodium metal exploded — the \"pops\" sounding like a miniature fireworks display.\n\nThen there were the deformed chickens. Agents responded to a farm in Christian County where large tanks of anhydrous ammonia were buried in the barn. The stuff wasn't being used as fertilizer.\n\n\"He had chickens with double beaks, he had chickens that were a foot growing out of another foot,\" Console said. \"All the chemicals they were using — they were making meth there for a long time — were being dumped all over the area where the chickens were being raised.\n\nIn 1998, the man credited with pioneering the so-called \"Nazi method\" of methamphetamine production was contacted by a News-Leader reporter.\n\nBob Paillet had moved to Texas from southwest Missouri several years prior, not long after being sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute the drug. He was still on probation.\n\nIt appears to be Paillet's only published interview. He expressed regret to reporter Laura Bauer.\n\n\"I never thought it would spread like this,\" he said. \" ... I don't travel in those circles anymore.\"\n\nIn the years after his arrest, Paillet also wrote several letters to — and once spoke on the phone with — John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated him.\n\n\"I can remember him expressing remorse that he had started 'this mess,' as he referred to it,\" Cornille said.\n\nBy the turn of the new millennium, Nazi dope was no longer a Missouri-specific phenomenon.\n\nIn north Texas, the commander of an 11-county narcotics task force told a magazine in 2001 that the unit came across its first Nazi lab three years prior. By the following summer, the task force was busting one every week.\n\n\"It has exploded on the scene so quick, it's so easy to do, and there are so many people involved in manufacturing it, that it has completely overtaxed our capabilities,\" the commander said.\n\nIn Illinois, a state police representative said in November 2000 that meth labs were \"getting to the epidemic stage.\" He cited the fact that the state was on track to have 400 lab busts by the end of the year. Within four years, Illinois would be logging more than 1,500 labs annually.\n\nIn California, the Modesto Bee reported in 2000 that officials in the Central Valley had encountered eight labs using the Nazi method, and that \"five of them were traced to a man from Missouri who had moved into a trailer park near Fresno and was teaching this method.\"\n\nOfficials in numerous other communities around the country reported a version of the same thing.\n\nNick Console, the former head of Springfield's DEA office, said top agency officials did little to respond to the growth in small-scale labs in the 1990s. By the early 2000s, he said, that began to change, as politicians representing affected communities began putting pressure on the agency.\n\n“It took ‘em a good eight to 10 years,\" Console said. \"And the damage was already done, it’d already spread.”\n\nThe Nazi method didn't just spread cook to cook. Its rise coincided with the early days of the modern internet and anonymous forums like The Hive, where users traded information about illegal substances.\n\n\"There were a number of really good dope sites,\" said Terry Dal Cason, a retired DEA forensic chemist who investigated the origins of the Nazi method moniker.\n\nSince 2002, the DEA has published an annual report called the \"National Drug Threat Assessment,\" which details the prevalence of illegal drugs in the United States.\n\nEach year, the agency asks various state and local law enforcement agencies what they consider the \"greatest drug threat\" in their community. In 2003, 33.1 percent of agencies selected cocaine. Methamphetamine was second, with 31 percent.\n\nThe report stated that meth was widely available in the western and central United States and gradually becoming more available in the eastern United States. It concluded, however, that “despite the rising threat, methamphetamine is not likely to surpass the overall threat posed to the United States by powder cocaine and crack in the near term.”\n\nTwo years later, it did.\n\nThe 2005 report read: \"According to state and local law enforcement agencies, the threat associated with methamphetamine trafficking and abuse has increased sharply since 2002 and now exceeds that of any other drug.\"\n\nTo be clear, the Nazi method wasn't the only way meth consumed in America was produced. In its annual reports, the DEA largely focused on other sources.\n\nFirst, there was the foreign supply; meth was smuggled into the United States from Mexico and, to a much lesser extent, southeast Asia.\n\nThen there were the domestic \"superlabs\" — those capable of producing 10 pounds of meth in a single day. In 2001, federal authorities seized 303 of them, two-thirds of which were located in California. The California labs alone likely produced more meth than all other domestic laboratories combined, the DEA wrote.\n\nThere was regional variation, however. In 2002, the agency wrote that \"local independents account for as much as 80 percent of retail methamphetamine distribution in some areas of the country,” specifically the central United States. The Nazi method was a key process used, but there were also other recipes, like the \"Red-P\" method named for the required red phosphorous.\n\nThe DEA struggled to accurately detail the problem. In 2004, the agency wrote that meth use and distribution in the Midwest was \"very high\" in rural and suburban areas, but \"less so in metropolitan areas, where most drug consequence data are collected.\"\n\n\"Therefore, available drug consequence data for methamphetamine use in the Central States likely under-represents the problem, perhaps significantly,\" the agency wrote.\n\nSmall labs accounted for much of the drug's impact on communities, which was felt in burn units and mental health clinics, courtrooms and cemeteries. While the Nazi method simplified meth production, it didn't make it foolproof. The more labs, and the more cooks, the more opportunities for something to go wrong, and the greater the cost of cleanup.\n\nIn 2003, there were 361 reported fires and explosions at meth lab sites, and 255 law enforcement officers were injured responding, according to the DEA. The agency spent $16.3 million on laboratory cleanup that fiscal year, eight times more than it spent less than a decade earlier.\n\nThat same year, the DEA reported that 893 children were present when meth labs were seized. About two-thirds tested positive for toxic levels of chemicals in their bodies. The agency said \"child neglect and abuse are common within families whose parents or caregivers produce or use methamphetamine.\"\n\n“The devastation and the damage to kids … I understand why Bob had regret,\" Cornille said.\n\nNationwide, meth lab busts peaked in 2004, when there were nearly 24,000 seizures.\n\nAlmost 3,000 of them were in Missouri. Two years earlier, the number of meth lab busts in the state passed those in California — the birthplace of the methamphetamine industry — for the first time. Since then, Missouri has led the nation most years, never dropping below third in annual busts. In some parts of the country, the area code for southwest Missouri, 417, is said to be slang for meth, or a particular type.\n\nCornille and Console both acknowledge that if Paillet hadn't introduced the Nazi method, someone else might have done so a short time later. Just like any legal industry, there is a steady pace of innovation in the world of illegal drugs, typically in response to some government crackdown.\n\nTo combat meth in the early 2000s, laws were implemented requiring medications containing pseudoephedrine to be sold from behind the counter. In 2007, fewer than 7,000 meth labs were seized across the country.\n\nBut makers and users adjusted, developing what became known as \"one-pot\" or \"shake-and-bake\" meth production, in which just a couple of pseudoephedrine pills are mixed in a 2-liter soda bottle for smaller batches. The new method led to another spike — 15,000 national meth lab busts in 2010.\n\nConsole said he views these newer methods as just continued innovation. The Nazi method was the truly critical shift, he said — the one that turned meth consumers into producers.\n\nAfter they were sentenced for conspiring to manufacture and distribute meth, those indicted alongside Paillet struggled to stay on the right side of the law.\n\nKenneth Allen, who was given three years probation, ended up behind bars after he repeatedly tested positive for meth; he was also arrested for driving with a revoked license and failing to support his dependents.\n\nMichael Poplawski, sentenced to nearly six years in prison, later completed community service for patronizing a prostitute in the early 2000s, according to online court records. He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, with intent to distribute, in 2012.\n\nGary Davis, sentenced to five years in prison, briefly escaped in August 1994 from the Kansas facility where he was incarcerated. His sentence was later reduced for aiding in the prosecution of two others, but he ultimately ended up back behind bars. Davis is currently serving time in a federal penitentiary in Texas for, among other things, stealing explosive materials and conspiring to use them to rob a bank, according to a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCourt records indicate that Paillet never violated parole. There is no evidence he got in trouble with the law during the rest of his life.\n\nPaillet found work after he moved to Texas in the mid-1990s. His youngest daughter said he was a CNC programmer, developing the programs that run automated machining equipment. His oldest daughter, however, said Paillet did sales and technical installations for a company.\n\nBy the end of the decade, health problems prompted him to go on disability, and he talked about having dystonia, a neurological disorder characterized by uncontrollable and sometimes painful muscle spasms.\n\nCourt records indicate Paillet divorced his third wife in 2008. He spent the final years of his life living with another woman in a trailer park in Sherman, a city of about 40,000 an hour north of Dallas.\n\nIn 2014, Stephanie Denton, 37, moved into the unit next to Paillet. Within a few months, she and Paillet — now in his early 70s — were drinking coffee together every morning.\n\nDenton was having issues in her relationship, and her son was having legal troubles; Paillet encouraged her to be more positive, she said. From what Denton could tell, her neighbor didn't really have close friends.\n\nPaillet didn't talk about his past very much, Denton said. She knew he was a Vietnam vet — Paillet talked about the war being pointless — and that he'd been involved with drugs to a degree. She said he claimed he'd sold drugs to raise money for a school for disabled kids.\n\nPaillet was more inclined to talk about the government, with a bent more paranoid than partisan. Denton said he repeated a well-known conspiracy theory that claims the Federal Emergency Management Agency plans to imprison citizens in camps after the imposition of martial law. Paillet's minimal online presence included posts about a group advocating for the secession of the state of Texas.\n\nPaillet also had an extensive rock collection and talked and posted online about searching for gold on a claim in Colorado. He appears to have become obsessed with the process, not unlike his days of manufacturing meth.\n\n“He first really started talking about gold mining after he was arrested,\" his oldest daughter Lisa Paillet said. \"One of the things that he was really very interested in doing was separating gold from rock, so not mining in the river, but using chemistry to remove gold from rock without requiring massive amounts of water.\"\n\nLisa said her father's health issues worsened during the final years of his life, and that he appeared to be struggling with dementia at times. In what would end up being her last conversation with her father, he talked about his will.\n\nBob Paillet didn't leave a suicide note.\n\nEarly in the afternoon of Jan. 1, 2016, the 72-year-old drove his red Dodge truck from the mobile home park where he lived in Sherman, Texas, to a nearby hospital. It was a little over a mile. Then, he took a gun — \"he had a lot of guns,\" said his daughter Gena — walked to the front of the vehicle, and shot himself in the head. He died minutes later in the emergency room.\n\nPaillet's family held a memorial service after his death. To the outside world, however, the only acknowledgement of his passing can be found on the website of a Denison, Texas, funeral home. It's not really an obituary, just a name and a pair of dates.\n\nThere's a guest book option on the site. One person — Paillet's second wife, Gena's mother — has left a message: \"We had a lot of happy years together. You will be missed. Your pain is over, ours now begins.\"\n\nOtherwise, there was nothing in the public record acknowledging that the man credited with reinventing methamphetamine production in the U.S. was dead. All in all, it probably turned out about how Paillet would have wanted it.\n\nIn 1998, he spoke briefly with a News-Leader reporter, the only time he was ever quoted in the media. At the time, meth lab busts were drastically increasing across the central United States. Authorities were blaming the phenomenon on the ease of the \"Nazi method,\" and said Paillet pioneered it while living in the Springfield area.\n\nIn that interview, Paillet expressed regret, as well as a wish regarding his future.\n\n\"I hope my name is forgotten or it's put in the back of people's minds,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps Paillet found some measure of peace. In an interview, Gena said that, while growing up, she was not allowed to talk or ask about the concept of a God around her father. In his later years, however, Bob Paillet softened on that view.\n\nIn 2008, he wrote on online message boards that \"I was an atheist, then agnostic, and now I believe that there is a God.\" He also said that he believed in evolution, and expressed a degree of incredulity that there are individuals who do not.\n\n\"He was still a scientific man, but he found his version of God,” Gena said.\n\nGena, 38, came of age in a world that her father helped create.\n\nGrowing up in Morrisville, she \"never really fit in,\" she said, and started drinking at an early age. When Gena and her mother moved to Springfield, she \"immediately just fell in with the wrong crowd.\" She graduated from Springfield's Parkview High School in 1996.\n\n\"A lot of people believe that addiction is genetic,\" Gena said. \"I am my father's daughter, not just in that way, but every way that there is.\"\n\nGena said she used meth for the first time at age 15. Two years later, she met Steven Joseph Brown, the man who would become her husband.\n\n\"He used needles, and he shot me up for the first time with heroin, and it was pretty much over from there,\" she said. \"It was always either that or meth. There was like a two-year period where I probably never slept. It’s been a struggle for me ever since.\"\n\nBrown — who died in February 2016 — was 16 years older than Gena. Prior to meeting her, he gave Gena's father precursor chemicals in exchange for meth, she said. At one point, he was even arrested by John Cornille, the Drug Enforcement Administration agent who investigated Bob.\n\n“My husband kind of ended up learning my dad’s recipe,\" Gena said. \"Not anywhere near as good as my dad.”\n\nGena, who said she grew up fearing her father, first got in trouble for drugs when she was 17. She thought her father was going to kill her. Instead, she said, he \"became my best friend ever, because we understood each other.\"\n\n\"My mom — I love my mom — she’s never done a drug in her life,\" Gena said. \"She’s had maybe one speeding ticket, and I think she even got that dismissed. Really this connection grew between him and me that was just amazing. I could really do no wrong in his eyes.”\n\nGena said that between her late teens and late 2015, she was only \"clean\" for extended periods twice, when she became pregnant. \"But I always went pretty much right back.\"\n\nIn late December 2015, Gena said, she overdosed on heroin. Gena's mother, who she lived with at the time, kicked her out of her house. Gena called her father, who paid for a motel room for a week, and indicated she should come live with him in Texas.\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to go to your parole officer and start getting everything transferred down here and I want you to come back here,' and he said, 'I will get you through this,'\" Gena said.\n\nTwo days later, she got the call that her father was dead.\n\nGena said she traveled to Texas to attend her father's memorial service, but got in a dispute with the woman Bob was living with at the time of his death, and ended up leaving beforehand (Lisa Paillet described her half-sister as \"high as a kite\" at the time). Gena expressed regret that she didn't receive something her father wanted her to have — \"this metal container thing that his very first successful batch of stuff was made in.”\n\nIn August, Gena said she put herself through treatment after returning from Bob's memorial service. She said she had been clean since Jan. 25.\n\n\"It really hurts me that my dad never got to see me get my life together,\" she said.\n\nBy November, however, Gena was back in a three-week rehab program. She attributed the relapse to her depression, and said she \"wasn’t managing it with medication like I should have been.\" In early May, she said she had stayed clean since completing the program.\n\n\"It’s still hard a lot of days,\" Gena said. \"And it’s hard to stay away from the people that kind of want to push it on you.”\n\nLisa Paillet, who asked that her first name be changed for this story, graduated in 1991 from then-Southwest Missouri State University with a degree in theater — which she said her father \"paid for, I’m pretty sure, with drug money.\"\n\nShe returned to California, where she grew up, and gradually drifted away from theater-related work. When her father, then on probation in Texas, found a job that made machining equipment, he paid for her to go to school to get a machinist's certification. She was hired by a company she described as being in the military aerospace research sector, which paid for her to get a bachelor's degree in engineering.\n\n“That’s when our conversations about science really took off, and we would talk for long periods of time,” she said of her father.\n\nRegarding her sister, she said Gena's \"world is very, very different from mine.”\n\n“He and Gena had a very, very different relationship than he and I had ... I think he treated her far more like a child than he ever treated me,\" Lisa said. \"And because he didn’t really raise me, he didn’t have rules for me … I think even though I went down his road a little bit when I was very young, I think my upbringing with my mother definitely was not the same.”\n\nLisa said her father's decision to take his own life wasn't entirely unexpected. Suicide was something he mentioned casually over the years, she said.\n\n\"He knew he was going to commit suicide if he ever got too sick, and I knew it a long time ago,\" Lisa said.\n\nBob Paillet's parents died in the 1980s. They are buried in a cemetery in Exeter, Missouri, where they lived and where Bob spent his high school years.\n\nLisa said her father, who became obsessed with gold mining in the later years of his life, requested his ashes be scattered at his gold claim. However, she's has been unable to find it. When Lisa called Colorado, she was told he didn't have a claim in the state.\n\nThough Paillet appears to have avoided run-ins with the law late in life, the process he pioneered continued to occupy authorities.\n\nSome states responded to the rise in small-scale meth labs by requiring prescriptions for purchase of products containing pseudoephedrine.\n\nMissouri didn't, but over time dozens of communities within the state instituted their own prescription laws. City leaders in Springfield debated doing the same in 2013, but the effort wasn't without controversy.\n\nThat fall, Councilwoman Cindy Rushefsky — a former prosecutor who supported the measure — asked Springfield's police chief to provide monthly reports detailing meth lab activity in the city. She pitched it as a way for council to stay informed on the issue. Councilman Doug Burlison, a libertarian who opposed the prescription requirement, described it as \"an attempt to educate us to have different opinions.\"\n\nThen a funny thing happened. The police chief's monthly reports consistently described fewer and fewer meth labs being found in the city. In July 2014, the prescription bill was tabled indefinitely.\n\nThe situation wasn't unique to Springfield. The number of small meth labs seized in the United States has declined in recent years, from about 15,000 in 2010 to about 4,500 in 2016.\n\nIt's not that the drug has lost its presence in the United States. Last year, when state and local law enforcement agencies were asked to name the greatest drug threat in their area, heroin received the most votes. The agencies that selected it, however, were strongly concentrated in the Great Lakes and northeast regions of the United States. In the western part of the country, more agencies chose meth.\n\nMost of that meth is produced in Mexico and smuggled across the border.\n\nIn a 2016 report, the DEA attributed the decline in domestic labs to the wide availability of high-purity, high-potency meth from Mexico, as well as the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act, a federal law enacted in 2006 which placed restrictions on the meth precursors ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.\n\nNick Console, who spent about a decade as the top DEA official in Springfield, said Paillet's Nazi method may have prompted the cartels to become more involved with production of meth.\n\n\"Why? Because you had a huge addiction problem here in the United States to methamphetamine,\" he said. \"Supply and demand.”\n\nConsole retired to a farm in Ash Grove. John Cornille, the DEA agent most involved with investigating Paillet, still works for the agency.\n\nMike Poplawski — who was taught the Nazi method by Paillet himself — has served his prison sentence. He understands how the statute of limitations works, double jeopardy and all that.\n\nAsk him about the early days of Nazi dope, however, and he chooses his words carefully. He's convinced that saying certain things could get the DEA interested in him again. He says he's been at the same job for 15 years, together with his wife for 25 years.\n\n\"I’ve got grandkids that love me, step-kids that love me, extended family that love me,\" he said. \"You look from the other side — the law enforcement side — I’m a bad man.”\n\nIn an interview in his Springfield home, Poplawski, 59, said the people he considers meth's Nazi dope generation are \"all in jail or dead,\" and that those currently involved with the drug aren't self-starters. He voiced frustration at seeing \"bangers shooting each other, shooting up neighborhoods, doing dope and falling asleep in their cars with the kids in the cars and s---- like that.\"\n\n\"I want to go around with a .22 starter pistol and start capping people,\" he said. \"I can still find the houses. They’re not the same houses. But a speeder can always recognize another speeder.\"\n\nAsked about his own actions, Poplawski said \"if I knew then what I knew now, I would’ve done things different.\"\n\n\"I like to think that I had the ability to make a change,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, he said, \"there's always going to be an addiction.\"\n\n\"The hole’s always there,\" Poplawski said. \"And once it got filled by meth, we had the meth crisis ... Now you’ve got [a] prescription drug crisis and you’ve got [a] heroin crisis hard. Meth’s bad. I don’t think heroin’s an improvement.\"\n\nReached at a federal prison in Texas, Gary Davis — the only other individual indicted alongside Paillet still living — declined to be interviewed without compensation. In a brief email, he did include one comment.\n\n\"Meth is a scourge on society,\" Davis wrote. \"I wish I would have never messed with it.\"\n\nPaillet expressed similar sentiments years before his death.\n\n\"I wish I never started it,\" he told a News-Leader reporter in 1998. \"I would never do it again.\"\n\n\"I caused a lot of trouble with a lot of people.\"\n\nHow we reported this story\n\nReporter Thomas Gounley began working on this story in the wake of Bob Paillet’s death in January 2016.\n\nThe events leading to the arrest of Paillet and his co-conspirators are detailed in federal court records. Additional information regarding Paillet was obtained from the Drug Enforcement Administration through a Freedom of Information Act request.\n\nInterviews with Paillet’s family members and one-time associates, along with current and retired law enforcement personnel, were conducted between August 2016 and May 2017. One of Paillet’s daughters, citing concerns regarding how this story could affect future job prospects, agreed to be interviewed on the condition that her first name be replaced with a pseudonym. Editors agreed to that request.\n\nThe photos of Bob Paillet in this story were provided by his daughters. Booking photos of those indicted alongside Paillet were obtained from the Greene County Archives and Records Center. Center staff said they did not have a booking photo of Paillet himself.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/05/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/04/18/oklahoma-city-bombing-victims-names-and-faces/5929605001/", "title": "Oklahoma City bombing victims: The names and faces", "text": "The Oklahoman\n\nUSAToday Network\n\nThe Oklahoma City bombing committed by Timothy McVeigh killed 168 people.

Zackary had been cared for by workers at the daycare center inside the Murrah building his entire life. \"He was a cute little guy,\" said Hernandez of Zackary. \"You would try to give him a dollar, and he would say 'No, no - give me a quarter.' \"\n\nMore:Oklahoma City bombing survivors share their stories of the aftermath\n\nDana LeAnne Cooper\n\nLike many women of the '90s, Dana Cooper of Moore struggled with her desire to stay at home with her son, Christopher, and her dream of becoming a kindergarten teacher, her husband, Anthony, said. \"She battled with that all the time. Being a student and working, she was afraid Christopher didn't get enough of her time,\" Cooper said, \"but he did. \"\n\nAs the new director of America's Kids daycare center in the federal building, his wife felt great about being able to take her young son to work with her, Cooper said. Cooper said he dropped the two off at the Murrah Building Wednesday morning, planning to return for them that afternoon.\n\nDana Cooper, 24, had planned to fly that day to San Francisco for a daycare conference. However, the Coopers' lives were forever altered when a bomb shattered the federal building. Cooper said he was notified Saturday that his son Christopher, 2, was dead. On Sunday, the family received the news that Dana Cooper also had died in the explosion. The grief for his wife and son could not be borne without help from a higher power, Cooper said. \"I could not imagine how anyone could get through something like this without God. \"\n\nAmerica's Kids owner Melva Nokes said she had known Dana Cooper since she first hired the young woman to work in her Choctaw day-care center. Nokes said even then, as a student at Choctaw High School, the young woman showed signs of promise. \"She would have made an excellent teacher,\" Nokes said. Nokes, with Dana Cooper at the helm, took over operation of the federal building daycare center March 27. Now, just three weeks later, Nokes said it is hard to believe Dana Cooper is gone. She then remembered that cheery voice still on the recording. \"This is exactly like I've lost one of my own children. It hurts that much,\" Nokes said.\n\nAnthony Cooper said his wife was a student at the University of Central Oklahoma, majoring in early childhood education. Dana Cooper was about a year away from graduation, he said. The couple had been married for five years and had talked about expanding their family. Cooper said he and his wife adored Christopher, whose full 1 name was Anthony C. Cooper II. \"He was a very happy child, very vibrant - Mr. Personality,\" Cooper said.\n\nHe said his wife loved all children. \"She was the most beautiful person I ever met. Everything she did, she did for the children,\" Cooper said. Former Rose State College instructor Ruth Ann Ball said she had Dana Cooper in several of her early childhood development classes. She was really happy when she learned the young woman had chosen to go on to a four-year college to complete her studies. \"I was glad because I knew she would contribute to the profession,\" Bell said. \"It's very sad to know that she's not here now. Her face has been on my mind. \"\n\nAnita Fowler, who worked with Dana Cooper several years ago, said the young woman had a maturity beyond her years. \"She's a big loss to child care because she's given very much of herself to the child care community, as much as she could.

Miya Eaves worked at Standard Life, just a few blocks from America's Kids day-care center in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Tylor was just settling into the routine in the center, where he had started a week before the April 19 blast that took his life. \"He was a happy baby,\" Gloria Eaves recalled. \"He was bossy and spoiled because he liked attention. He wanted to be able to see you all the time.\" Tylor was a big, healthy baby, looking older than his 8 months. \"He was just getting into his personality, and he could get anything he wanted from us,\" Gloria Eaves said, adding that like his mother's side of the family, he had beautiful grayish-green eyes.\n\nTevin Garrett\n\nTevin Garrett, 1, was a very happy baby who loved to dance, ride his yellow Lion King bike and slide down his red and blue slide (headfirst).

So Harvey Justes, living on the family farm in East Bernstadt, Ky., immediately thought of his brother, Alvin, when he heard about the April 19 bombing in Oklahoma City. But it wasn't until a month later that he learned that his brother probably was dead. \"It was really a blessing that whole time, not knowing\" that his brother probably had been in the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, Harvey Justes said. Their sister, Violet, had tried unsuccessfully to contact Alvin since the day of the federal building bombing. After a month, she figured it was time to tell the police. Authorities disclosed May 23 that they suspected Alvin Justes, 54, was victim No. 168. \"That's been a big worry, just the wondering,\" Harvey Justes said Monday night upon being informed that a body believed to be his brother's had been recovered. He was a regular customer at the Federal Employees Credit Union, and an employee who survived said she saw Justes moments before the explosion. It was easy to understand why it took so long for him to show up on the \"missing\" list. Justes had no family in Oklahoma City and there were few people who noticed him missing. He lived nearby, traveled by bus and owned no vehicle to be recovered after the blast. Alvin Justes left home for Oklahoma at age 19 - perhaps to satisfy his curiosity about Indians, his brother said - served time in the military during the Vietnam War, then returned to Oklahoma. He had been disabled for several years, the result of breathing in toxic fumes at some point in his work career, Harvey Justes said. He described his brother as a \"loner\" who hadn't returned to Kentucky since their father's funeral in 1982. \"I'm sure I'll miss him,\" Harvey Justes said. \"I hadn't seen him in a long time, but I always knew he was there. \"\n\nValerie Koelsch\n\nValerie Koelsch of Bethany often said she had three families - her God-given family, her church family and her Federal Employees Credit Union family.

The Hurlburts went to Africa as medical missionaries for five years before settling in Oklahoma. They were longtime members of the Metropolitan Baptist Church. \"They were genuinely uncommon people. Some of the things they had going for them was a zest for their relationship with the Lord, music, and they laughed a lot. Those are some of the gifts they left us,\" Palmer said.

Kelly sentenced to 30 years in prison for federal racketeering and ...", "text": "New York CNN —\n\nDisgraced R&B singer R. Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison Wednesday following his conviction last year on federal racketeering and sex trafficking charges stemming from his efforts over years to use his fame to ensnare victims he sexually abused.\n\nProsecutors had asked the judge to sentence Kelly, 55, to more than 25 years behind bars, while his defense attorneys asked for 10 or fewer, saying prosecutors’ request was “tantamount to a life sentence.”\n\nSurvivors of Kelly’s abuse held hands and prayed as US District Court Judge Ann Donnelly began reading his sentence. Kelly – who wore a tan prison uniform, dark-rimmed glasses and a black mask at the hearing in federal court in Brooklyn – showed no emotion.\n\n“You left in your wake a trail of broken lives,” Donnelly told Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly.\n\nIn deciding the sentence, Donnelly said she considered Kelly’s own traumatic childhood, during which his attorneys said he was repeatedly sexually abused by a family member and a landlord.\n\n“It may explain, at least in part, what led to your behavior,” the judge said. “It most surely is not an excuse.”\n\nJovante Cunningham, a former backup singer for Kelly, praised the sentence.\n\n“I started this journey 30 years ago,” Cunningham said outside the court after the hearing. “There wasn’t a day in my life up until this moment that I actually believed that the judicial system would come through for Black and brown girls. I stand here very proud of my judicial system, very proud of my fellow survivors and very pleased with the outcome.”\n\nA jury convicted Kelly last September on nine counts, including one charge of racketeering and eight counts of violations of the Mann Act, a sex trafficking law. Prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York accused Kelly of using his status as a celebrity and a “network of people at his disposal to target girls, boys and young women for his own sexual gratification.”\n\nThe five-week federal trial in Brooklyn included testimony from witnesses who said they were sexually and physically abused by Kelly. The court also heard from people involved with orchestrating the disgraced R&B singer’s 1994 marriage to the late singer Aaliyah when she was just 15 years old and he was an adult after she believed she’d gotten pregnant.\n\nKelly’s attorney, Jennifer Bonjean, said he would not address the court, pointing to the other criminal case faced by Kelly, but said before the sentence was read that her client “rejects that he is this monster.”\n\n“He accepts that he is a flawed individual,” Bonjean said, “but he is not this one-dimensional monster that the government has portrayed and the media has portrayed.”\n\nKelly made his only comment in response to the judge after Bonjean said he wouldn’t speak: “Yes, your honor, that’s my wish.”\n\nBonjean said she advised Kelly not to speak at the sentencing because of pending litigation against him, but added, “he has regrets. And he is sad. Nobody wants to hear what he heard today.”\n\nKelly and the judge are seen in a sketch of the sentencing. Sketch by Christine Cornell\n\n‘No one can undo the harm’\n\nPrior to sentencing, the court heard impact statements from seven of Kelly’s victims, including Jane Doe 2, who testified at trial.\n\n“It’s been 23 years since we knew each other, and you’ve victimized a lot of girls since then,” she said, addressing Kelly. She later added: “Now it’s your turn to have your freedom taken from you.”\n\n“No one can undo the harm that has been done to these victims,” attorney Gloria Allred, who represented three victims who testified, told reporters Wednesday outside court. “But at least it’s time for Mr. Kelly to be accountable.”\n\nDefense attorneys and prosecutors argued Wednesday in court over whether Kelly even could pay a fine. The defense said he is “pretty close to indigent” and could not. Prosecutors disagreed, saying money from the sale of some of his music rights and millions of dollars in royalties held by Sony could cover any fine.\n\nIn the nine months since his conviction, Kelly has replaced his entire legal team with Bonjean and her firm. Bonjean is the attorney who helped Bill Cosby get his sexual assault conviction overturned and also represented Cosby in a civil case he lost this month at trial.\n\n“We were prepared for it,” Bonjean said of the sentence outside the court. “We are now prepared to fight this appeal.”\n\nKelly is being held at a federal detention facility in Brooklyn and is expected to be moved back to Chicago, where he faces another federal trial in August on child pornography and obstruction charges.\n\nBonjean will ask for Kelly to continue to be held at the Brooklyn federal detention center as her team prepares for his upcoming trial, she told CNN on Thursday, adding she is based in New York. CNN has sought comment from the US Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Illinois, the Bureau of Prisons and US Marshals, who would be tasked with moving Kelly.\n\nKelly also has state cases pending in Illinois and Minnesota.\n\nChildhood trauma revealed\n\nIn over 14 hours of interviews with psychiatrist experts, Kelly said his closest relationship growing up was with his mother. His earliest memories were watching his mom perform as a singer in a band called “Six Pack,” and he would often accompany her to McDonald’s where she would drink coffee and they would share a pastry.\n\nKelly had never met his father and described his mother’s death as the most tragic event of his life, saying he would go to McDonald’s frequently to smell the coffee and remember her, according to a letter filed by Renee Sorrentino, a clinical assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.\n\n“To me, the ‘M’ stands for mom. Going to McDonald’s is always being around my mother,” Kelly said.\n\nBut his childhood was also marked by trauma.\n\nKelly saw a childhood sweetheart drown when he was a little boy. And people interviewed by psychiatrist experts say Kelly was repeatedly sexually abused beginning when he was a 6 or 7-year-old boy, his attorney wrote, saying he was abused by his older sister and also a landlord, at times on a “weekly basis.”\n\nSorrentino said in her letter Kelly’s childhood sexual abuse may have contributed to his “hypersexuality,” or difficulty controlling sexual urges, and believes it was a factor in his criminal convictions.\n\nWhile Kelly was convicted of sexual exploitation of a child, Sorrentino refused to diagnose Kelly with pedophilia because he told her his “sexual behavior has never involved prepubescent individuals,” she said.\n\nFaith, another woman who testified at Kelly’s trial, countered that defense argument Wednesday in her victim impact statement, saying her own father had also been sexually abused as a child but “never molested me.”\n\nSupport for the singer\n\nAmong the letters that asked for a shorter sentence for Kelly was one written by Diana Copeland, Kelly’s former assistant who testified as a government witness and said she wrote a letter in support of Kelly because it was the “right thing to do.”\n\n“God doesn’t want us to throw humans away,” Copeland wrote. “If we have the audacity to care for the perpetrators as well as the victims, we can all rise.”\n\nJoycelyn Savage, who was considered a victim of Kelly’s by prosecutors, also remains a supporter.\n\n“Robert and I are deeply in love and it breaks my heart that the government has created a narrative that I’m a victim,” Savage wrote. “I’m a grown woman, and can speak for myself which is why I wanted to provide this letter to the court.”\n\nIn her letter, Savage revealed she is now engaged to Kelly.\n\nProsecutors faced threats\n\nAhead of the sentencing, a Chicago man who had attended Kelly’s trial in Brooklyn was arrested and charged for making threats against the three US attorneys who prosecuted Kelly, a copy of his arrest warrant shows.\n\nChristopher Gunn was arrested Saturday for allegedly posting threats to kill or seriously injure the female prosecutors.\n\nAccording to the arrest warrant, Gunn posted video to his YouTube channel in October, shortly after Kelly was found guilty, that showed an image of the US Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York where the women work. Prosecutors believe a voice narrating the video is Gunn’s, and he says, “That’s where they at. That’s where they work at … We’re going to storm the office,” saying each of the three prosecutors’ names.\n\n“If you ain’t got the stomach for the sh*t we ‘bout to do, I’m asking that you just bail out,” he allegedly said in the video.\n\nProsecutors also analyzed a CashApp account linked to Gunn that shows multiple transactions from February 26, 2021, to June 1 that indicate Gunn “engaged in the sale of firearm ammunition in relation to the Kelly matter,” they said. Transactions included payments for $20 with descriptions saying “30 rounds.. free R kelly.” CNN has reached out to an attorney for Kelly for comment.\n\nProsecutors believe Gunn was planning to attend Kelly’s sentencing on Wednesday after he posted another video saying he had a “spot” for supporters to meet up near the courthouse.\n\nCNN has reached out to an attorney for Gunn, who is expected to have a detention hearing Friday. The session had been scheduled for Wednesday.", "authors": ["Sonia Moghe Dakin Andone", "Sonia Moghe", "Dakin Andone"], "publish_date": "2022/06/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/02/04/big-buzz-mosquito-experiment-savannah-black-distrust-covid-vaccine/4391880001/", "title": "Georgia COVID-19 vaccine rollout: Some wary after mosquito ...", "text": "SAVANNAH, Ga. – Black Americans are more hesitant than white Americans to get the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nThe reasons for that hit close to home in Savannah, Georgia, where a classified military operation in the 1950s dropped hundreds of thousands of mosquitoes – mosquitoes that many believe were infected with disease – on Carver Village.\n\n\"They didn't tell anybody, and it happened,\" said Chatham County Commission Chairman Chester Ellis. \"And so that leaves some apprehension, especially when you have residents of that area who've been there since the '50s. And so my job as neighborhood president, and also as chairman of the County Commission, is to kind of calm the storm down to let them know that this vaccination is not like that.\"\n\nThe Kaiser Family Foundation, which has been tracking attitudes about the vaccine for months, indicates 43% of Black adults in the U.S. are taking a \"wait and see\" approach to the vaccine, according to results of a poll completed Jan. 18. That compares with 26% of white adults in the same poll who said that when an FDA-approved vaccine for COVID-19 was available to them free, they would wait and see how it is working for other people.\n\n'It's not a pretty picture': Why the lack of racial data around COVID vaccines is 'massive barrier' to better distribution\n\nCaution is a rational approach to centuries of structural racism, said Savannah resident and activist Natavia Sanders.\n\n\"This has been the only system of America that American descendants of slaves know, and therefore there are automatic cautions to survival,\" Sanders said. It only makes sense for Blacks to question vaccines and studies, she said, after \"countless times of being the study (subject) for things without their consent or knowledge.\"\n\nThe infamous Tuskegee Study in which hundreds of Black men in Alabama went untreated for syphilis without their informed consent is just one injustice. In Savannah, a secret military program in the Cold War called Operation Big Buzz tested the viability of deploying mosquitoes as a delivery system of disease warfare by dropping thousands of mosquitoes on the Black neighborhood of Carver Village.\n\nCoronavirus Watch newsletter:Sign up for daily updates right in your inbox\n\nOpinion:Why do smokers get the COVID-19 vaccine this early?\n\nWhat was the 'Big Buzz' experiment?\n\nA United Press International newspaper article reported about it when the documents were declassified in 1980.\n\n\"Swarms of mosquitoes, the type notorious for transmitting yellow fever, were released in Georgia and Florida in the 1950s by the Army to see if the insects could be used as biological warfare weapons, documents show,\" the Oct. 29, 1980, article says.\n\n\"However, none of the mosquitoes, specially bred by the Army Chemical Corps, was infected when released in Savannah, Ga., in 1956 and at Avon Park, Fla., in 1956 and 1958, according to declassified documents made available Tuesday,\" the article read.\n\nThe declassified military document is available online. On each page a header of \"Secret\" is crossed out and instead stamped \"Unclassified.\"\n\n\"The Chemical Corps tested the practicality of employing Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to carry a (biological warfare) agent in several ways. In April - November 1956 the Corps ran trials in Savannah, Georgia, by releasing uninfected female mosquitoes in a residential area, and then, with co-operation of people in the neighborhood, estimating how many mosquitoes entered houses and bit people,\" reads the document dated January 1960 and titled \"Summary of Major Events and Problems, United States Army Chemical Corps.\"\n\nThe document goes on to report another deployment of hundreds of thousands of mosquitoes at Avon Park Air Force Base in Florida, summing up the purpose of the experiment:\n\n\"And while these tests were made with uninfected mosquitoes, it is a fairly safe assumption that infected mosquitoes could be spread equally well.\"\n\nOpinion:COVID-19 vaccine rollout needs a shot of equity\n\nBut some Savannah residents, including Ellis, have their doubts about whether the test mosquitoes were infected. He and others investigated the question while applying for historic designation for the neighborhood.\n\n\"And I know some people will say, 'Well, there were mosquitoes, but they weren't infected,'\" he said. \"But they were.\"\n\nEllis recalled the infection as malaria. The Army Chemical Corps document indicates the research centered on yellow fever.\n\nThe secrecy around the project created mistrust in those who found out about it decades after the fact. Sanders wrote about \"Big Buzz\" in connection to a Change.org petition advocating against locating a city maintenance facility in Carver Village last year.\n\nShe's too young to qualify for the vaccine yet but is gathering information for when she is eligible.\n\n\"I'm reading everything and I am taking precautions,\" she said. \"I did talk to a friend recently who just recovered and was in the hospital fighting for his life. And I said, 'Well, are you going to take the vaccine now?' And he explained to me about the antibodies that he said he formed from already having the virus. And his opinion was even though he was eligible for it, he said he was going to wait for a little bit more of study being done. He wants to see (the vaccine) be in existence for at least a year.\"\n\nThe downside of 'wait and see'\n\nThe concern for many with taking a wait-and-see attitude is that the virus is not doing the same.\n\nCOVID-19 has hit the Black community disproportionately hard in Georgia and Chatham County, where Savannah is located.\n\nWhile Black people make up 32.6% of the state's population, they account for 36% of all COVID-19 deaths and make up the majority of deaths in those under 60, according to an analysis of Georgia Department of Public Health data by The Augusta Chronicle earlier this month.\n\nMore:Amid access hurdles, grassroots efforts underway to get COVID-19 vaccine to at-risk people of color\n\nThose data hold true in Chatham County, too. As of Wednesday, 46% of the 298 COVID-19 deaths in Chatham were Black Americans and 51% whites. The county is 41% Black and 48% white, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nOf the 15 COVID-19-related deaths in Chatham residents age 45 or younger, all but two of the patients were Black or Latino.\n\nEllis feels this keenly.\n\n\"If you listen to all of the scientists' and the doctors' reports, statewide, nationwide and countywide, African Americans get infected more, at a higher rate,\" he said. \"African Americans are dying at a higher rate. And so it behooves us to take the vaccine, especially since the new strains coming out across the water now is more infectious, and is much easier to spread.\"\n\nHe got vaccinated with news media present to be an example. And he reminds older Savannahians about the familiar and successful experience of getting the polio vaccine on a sugar cube at school.\n\nOpinion:America's health system betrays Black people like me. But I got the COVID vaccine anyway.\n\n\"We ought to have a higher rate of African Americans having the vaccine,\" he said. \"And there's not an experiment on anybody, because they've given it to everyone. It's just that we are more vulnerable.\"\n\nFor now, he's more concerned about access to the vaccine.\n\n\"Folks in the deprived neighborhoods, they just don't have the transportation to get to the health department,\" he said. \"So that becomes a challenge for them, more than remembering about Big Buzz.\"\n\nThat also seems to be the case with Chatham residents 65 and older who are jamming phone lines to get appointments. Typical is Jewelene Black, an African American who received the vaccine in late January through the St. Joseph's/Candler vaccine clinic.\n\n\"All of my friends, we all had our arms out when they first started talking about the vaccine,\" she said. \"And I know some African Americans may be a little hesitant. But all my friends, we don't have a problem taking it because there have been so many deaths, and especially African Americans, so I think it's really important that we all get this fast.\"\n\nGetting to 'yes'\n\nThe attitudes of younger county residents can be seen in health care workers, who were offered the vaccine first. Many didn't take it, especially early on.\n\nAt St. Joseph's/Candler hospital, the administration has taken a respectful but persistent approach to the health care workers who initially declined the vaccine.\n\n\"If you weren't taking it, we just wanted to know why,\" said Paul Hinchey, president and CEO of St. Joseph's/Candler. \"So we could talk in a respectful manner, and see if we could get through it.\"\n\nWith a work force that includes many women of childbearing age, how the vaccine could affect pregnancy and fertility were often the concern.\n\n\"It's pregnancy, breastfeeding, fertility,\" Hinchey said, listing common vaccine concerns.\n\nThe vaccine wasn't tested on pregnant women, so their concern makes sense to Dr. Stephen Thacker, associate chief medical officer and pediatric infectious disease specialist at Memorial Health. But he would counsel pregnant women toward vaccination because getting COVID-19 late in pregnancy especially can be life-threatening. The CDC includes pregnancy among the conditions that put people with COVID-19 at increased risk of developing severe illness, including an increased risk of death.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s leading infectious disease expert, said last week that about 10,000 pregnant women in the U.S. have been vaccinated since the Food and Drug Administration authorized two vaccines, and so far there have been “no red flags.”\n\nShould pregnant women get the COVID-19 vaccine? Dr. Anthony Fauci sees 'no red flags' in safety data\n\nAt St. Joseph's/Candler, a sense of youthful invulnerability was another factor for some staffers.\n\n\"Some people are young; they just don't think I'll need it,\" Hinchey said.\n\nSt. Joseph's/Candler didn't track vaccine acceptance by race.\n\n\"Because we were going after everyone: white, Black, Hispanic, you know, it didn't matter to us,\" Hinchey said.\n\nBut talking to people individually changed the minds of about two-thirds of the staffers who initially declined the vaccine, Hinchey said.\n\n\"And I would say that's probably a couple of hundred people. And that's a lot. That's great,\" he said.\n\nThe increase will mean more than 70% of St. Joseph's/Candler staff will be vaccinated, a minimum level epidemiologists cite as necessary to achieve herd immunity.\n\n\"This is going to take explanation in a roll-up-your-sleeves-and-talk-to-people way,\" Hinchey said. \"And if you do that, you'll you'll find that many people will say, 'Hmm, OK, I'm going to give it a try.'\"\n\nTammi Brown, who is the Chatham County nurse manager with the health department, said the concern she hears most frequently is the speed with which the vaccine was developed and approved for emergency use.\n\nShe counters that worry with both the scientific and the personal.\n\nFirst she encourages people to look at the data themselves, both on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices website.\n\n\"I encourage them to look at the data, which is what I did,\" she said. \"You know, to make sure that you're making an informed decision.\"\n\nThe data shows the vaccine is safe and effective, Brown said.\n\n\"The vaccine is not live, so it can't give you COVID,\" she said.\n\nLike Ellis, she also leads by example. Brown was among the first people in Georgia to receive the vaccine.\n\n\"And I let them know that I got it,\" she said. \"I encouraged my mother who's 78 years old to get it. And so if I'm going to encourage it for myself and my mother, then obviously, it's something that I trust.\"\n\nFollow reporter Mary Landers on Twitter: @MaryLandersSMN\n\nMore:Helipad at Mar-a-Lago to be demolished after 4-year presidential exception\n\nDigital divide:A year into the pandemic, thousands of students still can't get reliable WiFi for school", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/02/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2024/01/17/princess-kate-abdominal-surgery-privacy/72254103007/", "title": "Kate Middleton surgery: Princess of Wales wants privacy amid rumors", "text": "Princess Kate will be shying away from public duties \"until after Easter\" following a \"planned abdominal surgery, Kensington Palace announced Wednesday.\n\nPrincess Kate asked for privacy amid her recovery. \"She hopes that the public will understand her desire to maintain as much normality for her children as possible; and her wish that her personal medical information remains private.\" Perhaps in a move to help facilitate that privacy, the palace also dropped news that King Charles III was having a procedure right around the same time.\n\nYet almost immediately, many began to speculate the reason for the surgery. Google searches surged for queries such as \"what surgery did Kate Middleton have?\" and \"reasons for abdominal surgery\" as well as for specific procedures and their recovery times.\n\nBut the reality is that no family – famous or otherwise – is immune to health issues of any sort, and everyone deserves privacy when they withhold details. Serious stories often lurk behind silence.\n\n\"Public figures need privacy to cope, heal, and develop a strategy to move forward just like everyone else,\" Amy Morin, psychotherapist, author of \"13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do\" and the host of a podcast, previously told USA TODAY. \"Working through issues privately can give them space to manage their emotions and strategize how to move forward without the distraction of outside opinions.\"\n\nWhat the royal family is saying:Princess Kate hospitalized for abdominal surgery, postpones 2 months of engagements, palace says\n\nMore on King Charles:King Charles III to undergo hospitalization for enlarged prostate, palace says\n\nPrincess Kate, celebrity and medical privacy\n\nThe royals have a long, complicated history with the press. They have denounced the tabloid appetite for details in their personal lives – but have also walked hand-in-hand with the press to promote their royal duties and causes.\n\nIn recent years, Kate and Prince William have mirrored celebrities in sharing news they want to share on their social media profiles and via official royal press releases.\n\n\"Boundaries are essential to lead a healthy life,\" Laura Petiford, a licensed marriage and family therapist, previously told USA TODAY. \"Healthy people respect the boundaries that others establish for themselves.\"\n\nIt's easy to ignore others' boundaries, however, in current times. \"In the age of social media, the general public has become trained to share not only their most private moments, but to also expect others to do the same,\" psychologist Reneé Carr also previously told USA TODAY.\n\nKate has insisted on privacy on the outset – meaning questions about her condition to any fellow royals, including her husband, will come off as intrusive.\n\n\"If they want to keep their crisis private, it's important to respect that,\" Morin adds. \"They may need space to process their feelings without outside opinions. They may also be trying to respect the privacy of a loved one by not sharing details.\"\n\nIn case you missed:Lloyd Austin didn’t want to share his prostate cancer struggle. Many men feel similarly.\n\nWhy celebrities, royals deserve privacy too\n\nThe public often insists they deserve to know all the ins and outs of celebrities lives. But do they really?\n\n\"If we put ourselves in their shoes, we would want to be able to have a private life especially when dealing with sensitive or difficult issues,\" Petiford adds. \"Yes, they have chosen to lead a life that is more in the public eye but they have not forfeited their human need to draw a distinct line between themselves and those who are interested in them.\"\n\nYou'd want the same privacy for yourself during life's cruelest moments, wouldn't you?\n\n\"We need privacy to not only cope with the situation, but to also try to makes sense of what has happened or is happening to us and try to figure out how to move on,\" Carr adds.\n\nMoreover, no one going through a difficult time wants to hear every opinion about their situation, whether you're a celebrity or not.\n\n\"Comments from other people can be upsetting and distracting,\" Morin says. \"During a crisis, it's important to devote your energy to things that matter most. You only have so much time and energy and the last thing you want to do is waste it on combating outside forces that could affect your decision-making.\"\n\nContributing: Naledi Ushe", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/17"}]}

A consent decree with school officials in the east Alabama county, located on the Georgia line, the government and attorneys with the Legal Defense Fund includes construction of a new school and more opportunities for Black students in the county of roughly 35,000 people, officials said. The agreement was announced Friday to end a desegregation order that’s been in place since 1970. It followed a previous, interim agreement reached in 1993. “We are pleased to arrive at a consent decree that addresses the many concerns our clients raised as key to ensuring the effectiveness of the desegregation process in Chambers County,” said GeDá Jones Herbert, an attorney with the Legal Defense Fund. “It was particularly important that Black students in the district are afforded equal and high-quality educational opportunities in safe and modern facilities.” Before the end of the next school year, the district must pick a site to build a new, consolidated high school to replace LaFayette High School, which is heavily Black, and Valley High School, which has a large population of white students.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The state had about 6,700 more jobs last month than a year earlier, but jobs in most sectors had not recovered to pre-pandemic levels, the state labor department reported Friday. There were about 11,800 fewer jobs in April than in April 2019, the year before the pandemic, the department said. The biggest year-over-year gain was in the leisure and hospitality sector, which had about 3,900 more jobs last month than in April 2021. The transportation, trade and utilities sector had about 1,400 more jobs than the prior year, and there were about 500 more jobs in oil and gas. But job numbers in most sectors lag levels reported in April 2019, the department said. The education and health sector had 100 more jobs last month than in April 2019. But there were 1,700 fewer jobs in trade, transportation and utilities, 1,100 fewer in leisure and hospitality, and 2,700 fewer in oil and gas last month than in April 2019. Karinne Wiebold, an economist with the department, said recently that Alaska began seeing year-over-year growth in total employment in April 2021, a year after the “initial employment shock” from the pandemic hit. She said high oil prices could encourage more employment in the oil and gas sector but said it’s unclear if the sector will reach its past highs. She noted that job gains in that sector have so far been slow.\n\nArizona\n\nGlendale: The city has preemptively adopted new rules regulating short-term rental properties before it welcomes a bevy of visitors for the 2023 Super Bowl. Ordinances approved by the Glendale City Council on May 10 amend the city’s codes on short-term rentals and nuisance parties. Owners of homes rented out for brief vacations must now provide contact information to the city in case law enforcement needs to reach them for an emergency or disturbance. Glendale’s ordinance additionally prohibits short-term rental properties from being used for operating as a retail enterprise or an adult-oriented business. Because Glendale currently doesn’t have a registry of short-term rental homes, local leaders say it’s difficult to know how much of a nuisance these properties are creating in the community, 12News reports. “It is possible that officers are responding to noise complaints at short-term rentals and just don’t know they are short-term rentals,” Deputy City Manager Rick St. John said during a council meeting. In another ordinance, Glendale’s police officers have the ability to assess fees to individuals hosting “nuisance parties,” or any social gathering that “constitutes a substantial disturbance of the quiet enjoyment of private or public property.”\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The barrage of television ads and mailers leading up to Tuesday’s primary election makes the most influential Republicans in the state clear. Tom Cotton’s making the case for fellow U.S. Sen. John Boozman, talking up his conservative bona fides while the two-term senator fends off challenges from the right. Donald Trump’s image appears in ads for Boozman and for Sarah Sanders, who served as the ex-president’s White House press secretary and is now running for governor. Sanders, whose endorsement is almost as sought after as Trump’s, is helping make the closing argument for Boozman in a TV ad. But conspicuously missing from the ads and the campaign trail is the state’s top elected Republican, Gov. Asa Hutchinson, who is entering the final stretch of his term with strong approval ratings and a raised national profile. Hutchinson’s advisers say he’s concentrating on helping more Republicans nationally as he looks to the future – which might include a White House bid. Sanders has avoided publicly criticizing Hutchinson, even when her former boss labeled the outgoing governor a “RINO” – Republican in Name Only – for his decision to veto an anti-transgender law. Sanders said she would have signed the measure, which bans gender-confirming treatments for transgender youth.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: New rules about how and when actors can use guns while filming failed to pass the Legislature on Thursday, just months after a gun actor Alec Baldwin was holding went off and killed a cinematographer on a movie set in New Mexico. Democrats in California had filed two bills in response to the tragedy, which killed cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and wounded director Joel Souza. With competing proposals, Democratic state Sen. Anthony Portantino, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee and the author of one of the proposals, said he “strongly urged” entertainment industry groups to “work collaboratively to bring forward a consensus approach.” But no one did. On Thursday, Portantino decided to hold both bills in committee, meaning they are unlikely to pass the Legislature this year. “It’s a powerful and ruthless industry. First the industry killed Halyna. Then they killed the bill that would’ve made people like her safe,” said state Sen. Dave Cortese, a Democrat who authored the other proposal. Cortese’s bill would have banned the use of guns and blank ammunition containing gunpowder or other explosive charges from film sets, with some exceptions. Portantino’s bill would have allowed guns with blank ammunition on set, but only under the supervision of an armorer who has completed a state gun safety course.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A late spring snowstorm dumped several inches in the Denver metro area Saturday and knocked out electricity for about 210,000 customers, officials said. The wet snow weighed down tree branches and sent them toppling onto power lines, the television station KUSA reports. Much more snow fell in mountainous regions of Colorado. By Saturday night, power had been restored to 160,000 customers, but about 50,000 still did not have it back, the Xcel Energy Colorado utility said in a statement. The small Colorado community of Cripple Creek near the base of Pike’s Peak got 20 inches of snow, KUSA reports.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Eligible families can begin applying next month for the new one-year child tax rebate program that’s included in the newly revised state budget, Gov. Ned Lamont announced Thursday. Rebates of up to $250 per child are expected to be issued in late August. The rebates will be provided for up to three children per family. While any Connecticut resident who claimed at least one dependent child under the age of 18 on their 2021 federal income tax return may be eligible for the rebate, the amounts are dictated by income. To receive the maximum amount, the income threshold is $100,000 or less for those single or married filing separately; $169,000 or less for those filing as head of household; and $200,000 for those married filing jointly. Those with higher incomes may be eligible to receive a reduced rebate. The Department of Revenue Services will accept applications from June 1 through July 31. Families can apply online on the DRS website and click on the “2022 CT Child Tax Rebate” icon. DRS is reaching out about the program to more than 300,000 households in the state that may meet the eligibility requirements.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: A report by Amtrak’s inspector general found that the train service’s $41 million purchase of an office building in the city has failed to provide savings that were projected. Amtrak estimated it would save close to $50 million by consolidating operations in the building that it purchased in Wilmington in May 2020. But a report filed May 13 by Amtrak’s Office of Inspector General found those savings haven’t materialized for a variety of reasons. Dispatching and police communications were supposed to be consolidated in the building, but that has not occurred because Amtrak has not yet been able to determine if the building can accommodate a large generator necessary to provide emergency power. In addition, Amtrak has been unable to move forward with a plan to move more than 400 information-technology workers to Wilmington. The report found that so many workers would refuse the transfer that operations would be unacceptably disrupted. Amtrak now estimates it won’t need as much space in the building as originally thought.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A moment of happiness and celebration at the Lincoln Memorial turned into a headache for workers with the National Park Service, WUSA-TV reports. The Lincoln Memorial was temporarily closed to the public Saturday morning after celebrating university graduates reportedly left a mess on the steps of the monument, a National Park Service official said. NPS tweeted a photo of the closure Saturday, claiming the graduation celebration left broken bottles, spilled wine and champagne covering the steps of the national monument. “We will reopen as soon as the area has been cleaned and made safe,” NPS said on Twitter. Facilities staff members worked through the morning and were able to clean the mess within a few hours. The Lincoln Memorial reopened about 11:30 a.m. NPS did not say from which school the celebrating graduates hailed, but many online theorize the students could be from Georgetown University. A spokesperson for the school called the incident “concerning and disappointing.” The spokesperson noted that Georgetown was one of many universities having ceremonies over the weekend and said it no university-sponsored events at or around the Lincoln Memorial.\n\nFlorida\n\nSurfside: A billionaire developer from Dubai is set to purchase the site of a South Florida condominium that collapsed last June, killing 98 people, for $120 million after no other bids were submitted by the Friday evening deadline for this week’s auction. Michael Fay, of Avison Young, said hundreds of potential buyers had shown interest in the property, but none were ultimately prepared to match the strong initial bid of Hussain Sajwani, of DAMAC Properties. Avison Young is the commercial real estate firm that was appointed to market the land as part of a class-action lawsuit. The auction for the 1.8-acre parcel in Surfside was scheduled for Tuesday. Earlier this month, families of the victims reached a $997 million settlement with local officials, the developers of an adjacent building and others whom they hold responsible for the collapse of the 40-year-old, 12-story beachside building during the early hours of June 24. Most of the Champlain Towers South collapsed suddenly about 1:20 a.m. last June 24 as most of its residents slept. Only three people survived the initial collapse. No other survivors were found despite the around-the-clock efforts of rescuers who dug through a 40-foot pile of rubble for two weeks. Another three dozen people were in the portion of the building that remained standing.\n\nGeorgia\n\nWatkinsville: Two Republican front-runners hoping to clinch primary majorities made their final pitches to voters Saturday ahead of Tuesday’s election. Gov. Brian Kemp and former football star Herschel Walker hope to win GOP nominations for governor and U.S. senator Tuesday without runoffs, with polls showing both men backed by more than 50% of voters. Kemp met voters at a rally in Watkinsville, near his home in Athens, with Nebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts showing up to support him. Walker spoke to Republicans in Columbus, having moved into a more public campaign phase in recent days despite continued questions about his past. Walker has been accused of threatening his ex-wife’s life, exaggerating his business record and lying about graduating from the University of Georgia. An Associated Press story Saturday found that Walker was actually a paid spokesman for a for-profit veterans program that Walker has described as a way he helps veterans. Walker’s speech focused on his life story and general attacks on Democratic policies. “It is time that we get back to where we started,” Walker said, arguing that Democrats have strayed from American values. Other candidates making final pitches include former U.S. Sen. David Perdue, Kemp’s top rival for the Republican nomination, and state Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black and Navy veteran and former banker Latham Saddler, Walker’s rivals for the Senate seat.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The Hawaii Board of Education has selected the former principal of Waipahu High School to be the next superintendent of the state’s public schools. The board voted 8-1 Thursday to select Keith Hayashi, who has been interim superintendent since August. At Waipahu High School, Hayashi pioneered the Early College program, which allows high school students to take college classes through a partnership with the University of Hawaii. College professors teach the classes on high school campuses for which students receive both high school and college credit. The program is now available at 36 high schools across the state. The board’s chairperson, Catherine Payne, said the board was looking for a candidate who could heal the school system, bring the community and stakeholders together, and transition schools out of the pandemic. “His work at Waipahu High School has really touched a lot of students who were struggling and helped them to move forward into successful lives,” Payne said. “So looking at how that might be able to be applied throughout our system is really important.” Hayashi’s appointment will take effect July 1. Payne said his salary and other contract details will be negotiated. The state Legislature has set a maximum salary of $250,000 a year for the job.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s unemployment rate in April dropped a tenth of a percent to 2.6% to mark a third consecutive month of historic lows since record-keeping started in 1976, state officials said Friday. The Idaho Department of Labor said 913,000 workers have jobs, while about 24,000 are looking for work, as Idaho’s red-hot economy continues. The state’s labor force of 937,000 in April represents a labor force participation rate of 62.1%, an increase of a tenth of a percent over the previous month. Idaho’s peak participation rate was 71.4% in September 1998. The labor force participation rate is calculated from those 16 years and older working or looking for work. The Labor Department said there are more than two jobs available for every unemployed Idaho resident looking for work. Idaho’s nonfarm jobs exceeded expectations with an increase of 3,000 jobs to 815,500 in April. Industry sectors showing the most gains include natural resources, wholesale trade, professional and business services, and private educational services. Those showing greatest job declines include arts, entertainment and recreation, and information. Idaho’s unemployment rate continues to run below the national unemployment rate, which was 3.6% in April.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: An officer who shot and seriously wounded a 13-year-old boy who ran away after being pulled over while driving a stolen vehicle was relieved of his police powers Friday, officials said. “He’s still an active member of the Chicago Police Department,” police spokesman Don Terry told the Chicago Tribune about the officer, whose name hasn’t been released. “He’s not going to be patrolling the streets, and he won’t be able to arrest people.” The action means the officer will still get paid but will be assigned to “desk duty,” Terry said. The officer had already been placed on administrative duties while the Civilian Office of Police Accountability investigates the shooting. Police Superintendent David Brown said Thursday that the fleeing teenager turned toward the officer during Wednesday’s encounter before the officer fired on him. No shots were fired at the officer, Brown said. The boy jumped from the car as officers approached the vehicle, which police said was stolen Monday and used in a carjacking Tuesday. The boy was in serious but stable condition at a hospital, Brown said Thursday. He did not elaborate, and no charges have been announced. No weapon was found at the scene, COPA said.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Democrats and activists are holding out little hope of getting the votes needed to uphold the governor’s veto of a bill banning transgender athletes from competing in school sports. The Republican-dominated Legislature is slated to override the veto by GOP Gov. Eric Holcomb, who said in March that the legislation doesn’t provide a consistent policy for what he called “fairness in K-12 sports.” But the bill passed by wide margins, and Republican leaders in the House and Senate pledged to override Holcomb’s veto with simple majorities. Although two Republicans in the House and seven in the Senate voted against the measure, Democratic Sen. J.D. Ford of Indianapolis said the override will likely be successful when the Legislature reconvenes for one day Tuesday. “This bill was filed, I believe, with the intention to specifically go after transgender Hoosiers because it was a politically savvy thing to do for the Republican base,” Ford said Friday. Still, Ford said Democrats continue to have conversations with lawmakers across the aisle, noting that some Republicans might be inclined to change their votes following the primary and the governor’s veto.\n\nIowa\n\nBettendorf: Students are once again attending class in the 1873 Forest Grove School. After raising about $200,000 over seven years to restore the falling-down, one-room school, supporters have opened the building for free “reenactments” of a typical student day. A schoolmarm teaches subjects and skills as they might have been taught during the 1920s, the time period to which the school was restored. Iowa once had 12,000 to 14,000 one-room school houses, depending on the report consulted, but with either number, Iowa had more than any other state in the nation. Supporters of Forest Grove preservation efforts want Forest Grove to be used to interpret and teach the role these schools played in the state’s history, Sharon Andresen, project coordinator for the nonprofit group, told the Quad-City Times. Because of legislation requiring consolidation of schools, Iowa’s last one-room school closed in 1967; Forest Grove closed 10 years earlier in 1957. Half- or full-day reenactments are open to any public, private or homeschool classes in the Quad City area. Fourth grade is a good target level, but Diane Borcherding, a retired Bettendorf High School biology teacher who is volunteering her time as the schoolmarm, is open to other grades, depending on the circumstances.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state Supreme Court on Friday disbarred former prosecutor Jacqie Spradling for her conduct during a double-murder trial in Topeka in 2012. The court said while Spradling was a prosecutor in Shawnee County, she engaged in “repeated patterns of misconduct” during the trial of Dana Chandler, who was convicted of killing her husband and his fiance. Chandler’s convictions were later overturned because of prosecutorial misconduct. She is scheduled for a new trial later this year. The Supreme Court said Spradling ignored a court order, made arguments not supported by evidence, lied in her briefs and oral arguments, and made false statements during a disciplinary investigation. The Kansas Board for Discipline of Attorneys recommended in June 2021 that Spradling be disbarred for her “win at all costs” attitude in the Chandler case and in the 2017 conviction of Jacob Ewing, of Holton, on rape and sodomy charges. The state Supreme Court found Spradling did not violate ethical standards in Ewing’s case. The Kansas Court of Appeals reversed Ewing’s conviction in 2018, but he later accepted a plea deal. Last year, Spradling resigned from her position as assistant county attorney in Allen County and as county attorney in Bourbon County.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Katy Perry earned her zookeeper stripes at the Louisville Zoo on Saturday. Zoo staff welcomed the pop music icon with an up-close encounter featuring the zoo’s own superstars, Simon, a black-footed penguin, and Sebastian the sloth. The “Roar” singer has been staying in Kentucky recently with her daughter, Daisy Dove, while fiancé Orlando Bloom shoots his new movie, “Red Right Hand.” Production on that film is expected to wrap up in June. At the zoo, Perry was “Walking on Air” through Wild Lights, a lantern festival featuring 50,000 LED lights. She also posed like a penguin next to Simon and admired the hang-ten skills of Sebastian the sloth, who “truly connected” with Perry, according to a post on the zoo sloths’ Twitter page. The Louisville Zoo features over 1,200 animals in exhibits with themes from all over the world, including Africa, home to Simon and other African penguins, as well as Australia and South America, where the sloths hang out. Earlier this month, Chelsea Handler hosted Perry on her podcast, “Dear Chelsea,” to chat about Perry’s stay in the Bluegrass State. “I’m like, living in Kentucky, and I have for almost a month now. And that’s quite an amazing experience because it reminds you that Hollywood is not America,” Perry said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards’ administration has agreed to remove the COVID-19 vaccine from the list of shots students are required to get to enroll in school, officials said. The state health department said in a news release Wednesday that it will continue to strongly recommend the vaccine, in accordance with recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Academy of Pediatrics, but acknowledged that the vaccine had not yet received full U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for those under age 16. “While we strongly recommend all eligible children be vaccinated against COVID-19 now, if they have not already been so, we are making this decision to give families and schools the time they need to prepare accordingly,” the news release said. Because the vaccine is not fully approved for those age 15 and under, requiring it would have made little difference to most students in kindergarten through high school, Edwards noted during his monthly call-in radio show. State Sen. Fred Mills, R-New Iberia, announced on the Senate floor that the administration agreed to remove the requirement after meeting with legislators. Legislation that would have removed the COVID-19 vaccine from the requirement list had stalled earlier in the session.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A teacher whose LGBTQ lesson plan for kindergartners was removed from a state website said Friday that the governor and education department succumbed to outside pressure. The governor and department “caved to pressure instead of standing up for some of the most vulnerable people, families, and students in Maine,” Kailina Mills wrote in a social media post. The lesson plan was at the heart of a Republican attack ad that accused Democratic Gov. Janet Mills of spending $2.8 million to create “radical school lessons” aimed at kindergartners. On the video, the teacher discusses “Freedom Holidays” like the Fourth of July, Juneteenth and Women’s Equality Day before discussing freedoms won by the LGBTQ community, including same-sex marriage. She talks about sexual identities under the umbrella of “LGBT+” in the discussion. The governor previously said she agreed with the Department of Education’s review that concluded the lesson wasn’t age-appropriate. Kailina Mills disagreed with that assessment, citing a study that showed gender identities are solidified between ages 5 and 7. She wrote Friday that she’s taught preschoolers who are transgender and nonbinary and said that “those children and those families deserve to be represented in their school curriculum.”\n\nMaryland\n\nHagerstown: A western Maryland race track has evicted the remnants of a trucker protest that had used the site as a staging ground. The People’s Convoy had conducted a series of rolling protests around the Capital Beltway in March to protest pandemic restrictions and other grievances. After a hiatus, a smaller group of truckers returned Wednesday to the Hagerstown Speedway. But Speedway General Manager Lisa Plessinger asked the group to leave amid infighting over its next steps. The last of the truckers left Friday night, she said. She compared the convoy to “like when your mother-in-law comes to visit and decides to stay.” A press release issued Friday on a Facebook page for The People’s Convoy “declares victory and announces its conclusion of the national convoy portion of this great movement.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWellfleet: More than 40 people – including marine mammal experts, interns and volunteers – spent several hours battling an incoming tide to help rescue seven dolphins that got stranded in the shallow waters of a Cape Cod river last week. The International Fund for Animal Welfare first got word that the Atlantic white-sided dolphins got stranded in a shallow gut of the Herring River in Wellfleet on Wednesday morning, and rescuers were on the scene in about an hour, the organization said in a statement. It’s not unusual for dolphins to get stranded in the area because of its shape as a hook within the larger hook of Cape Cod’s shoreline and because of large tidal fluctuations in Cape Cod Bay. “The dolphins appeared alert and in good health, but the day was sure to be sunny and warm, and we needed to move quickly,” said Misty Niemeyer, of IFAW’s Marine Mammal Rescue & Research team. The tide was also coming in, and dolphins often risk getting stranded again when it rolls out, she said. The dolphins – all likely young males, 6 to 8 feet in length and weighing up to 250 pounds – were then taken in a vehicle custom-designed to transport dolphins and released in deeper waters off Provincetown in the early afternoon.\n\nMichigan\n\nGaylord: Nearly all of the power lost following a deadly tornado that killed two people and flattened parts of a northern Michigan community has been restored, state police said Sunday. Police also said everyone had been accounted for in Gaylord, where Friday afternoon’s EF3 twister also left more than 40 people injured. Authorities had said Saturday that they were not able to account for one person. Cleanup continued Sunday in the town of 4,200 people about 230 miles northwest of Detroit. About 6,100 utility customers in Otsego County, where Gaylord is the county seat, lost power due to Friday’s storms, according to Jackson-based Consumers Energy. State police said Sunday that electricity had been restored to 99% of utility customers in Gaylord. The tornado packed winds of 140 mph that tore roofs and walls from businesses and largely destroyed a mobile home park. Such storms are uncommon in northern Michigan. State police Lt. Derrick Carroll has said the city doesn’t have tornado sirens, though anyone with a mobile phone got a “code red” warning from the weather service about 10 minutes before the tornado hit. The Nottingham Forest mobile home park was one of the first places hit by the tornado. Two residents, described by police as being in their 70s, were killed.\n\nMinnesota\n\nRedwood Falls: A partial skull that was discovered last summer by two kayakers will be returned to Native American officials after investigations determined it was about 8,000 years old. The kayakers found the skull in the drought-depleted Minnesota River about 110 miles west of Minneapolis, Renville County Sheriff Scott Hable said. Thinking it might be related to a missing person case or murder, Hable turned the skull over to a medical examiner and eventually to the FBI, where a forensic anthropologist used carbon dating to determine it was likely the skull of a young man who lived between 5500 and 6000 B.C., Hable said. “It was a complete shock to us that that bone was that old,” Hable told Minnesota Public Radio. The anthropologist determined the man had a depression in his skull that was “perhaps suggestive of the cause of death.” After the sheriff posted about the discovery Wednesday, his office was criticized by several Native Americans, who said publishing photos of ancestral remains was offensive to their culture. Hable said his office removed the post. “We didn’t mean for it to be offensive whatsoever,” he said. Hable said the remains will be turned over to Upper Sioux Community tribal officials.\n\nMississippi\n\nBiloxi: Gilbert Mason Jr., who grew up in the civil rights movement and became a physician and a Black and civil rights historian, has died at age 68. Mason died Wednesday and funeral arrangements were not yet complete, according to Infinity Funeral Home in Biloxi. Mason was 5 years old in 1959 when he watched his father, Gilbert Mason Sr., lead Biloxi’s first wade-in to desegregate beaches, the Sun Herald reports. And his name was on the 1971 lawsuit that made Biloxi schools the state’s first to integrate. Like his father, Mason became a physician who served poor people. His practice was in the New Orleans area, but he returned to Biloxi when his father became ill. The elder Mason died in 2006. The son spent his last years documenting civil rights and Black history and his father’s accomplishments, the newspaper reports. Father and son both had photographic memories, said Clemon Jimerson Sr. He said the younger Mason’s memories helped to document the history of scouting on the Mississippi Coast, the music history of Biloxi and other areas for the Mississippi Blues Trail, the integration of Coast schools, and the preservation of Nichols Elementary, the historically Black school in East Biloxi.\n\nMissouri\n\nKansas City: City officials have approved a new ordinance that clarifies when people may witness or record police officers’ actions without being arrested. The Kansas City Council on Thursday approved the ordinance to settle a federal lawsuit filed by three women who were arrested during racial injustice protests in 2020. The women were charged with violating city laws involving resisting or interfering with an officer. The lawsuit said those laws were unconstitutionally vague and overly broad, KCUR reports. The ordinance approved Thursday says witnessing or recording police officers does not violate city law unless the offender is substantially impeding the officer’s duties. The women were among more than 200 nonviolent protesters arrested at or near the Country Club Plaza during protests after the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd. The settlement did not require the city to pay any monetary damages.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A full month after a judge temporarily blocked enforcement of a state law that required transgender people to undergo surgery before they could change their gender on their birth certificate, the state still isn’t in compliance with the court order, the ACLU of Montana said. Jon Ebelt, spokesperson for the state health department, said the agency is still working with the Department of Justice to review the April 21 ruling and its implications. He did not respond to an email asking if that meant the state was evaluating whether to appeal the order. “We have continued to be patient in allowing the state time to comply with the court ordered preliminary injunction,” the ACLU of Montana said in a recent statement. “However, close to one month has passed and the State’s willful indifference to the court order is inexcusable.” Montana is among a growing list of Republican-controlled states that have moved to restrict transgender rights, including requiring student-athletes to participate in sports based on their gender assigned at birth or making it illegal for transgender minors to be treated with hormones or puberty blockers.\n\nNebraska\n\nWayne: A pilot died after a single-engine plane crashed at the Wayne Municipal Airport, officials said. The Cessna 140 crashed Friday evening during the MayDay STOL Drag Races. The organization that planned the events said in a Facebook post that the pilot crashed on final approach at the airport after apparently stalling and spinning. No one else was aboard the plane, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. The FAA and National Transportation Safety Board are investigating the crash. The pilot’s name was not released. STOL, or short take-off and landing, drag racing involves pilots flying side-by-side 2,000 feet down and back up. The rest of the weekend’s planned events were canceled.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: COVID-19 emergency declarations for Nevada ended Friday as the public health agency for metro Las Vegas noted that the pandemic isn’t over and said it will continue to monitor spread of the coronavirus and provide assistance with vaccinating and testing. While most of the state’s pandemic measures, including business restrictions and mask mandates, have already been lifted, the Southern Nevada Health District said it was important to remind the public that the virus that causes COVID-19 continued to circulate. “Cases are currently increasing, and new variants are emerging,” said Dr. Fermin Leguen, chief medical officer for the district. Gov. Steve Sisolak on Thursday signed a proclamation ending the state’s emergency Friday – a planned action he announced two weeks ago, saying he wanted to ensure that there would be no gap in services. “Today, we are turning the page on the State of Emergency caused by COVID-19 and are laser focused on ensuring our recovery from the public health, fiscal and economy crisis serves the needs of Nevada’s families,” Sisolak, a Democrat running for reelection, said Thursday in a statement. Clark County, which includes the Las Vegas area, on Thursday announced the end of of its emergency declaration, which was declared March 15, 2020.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConway: A forest fire in northern New Hampshire that’s burned 106 acres is nearly contained, officials said Friday. The Bemis Fire in Crawford Notch State Park, the White Mountain National Forest, and on private land began May 13 in steep, rugged terrain. The cause is under investigation. “It’s important for the public to know that the Bemis Fire remains an active fire scene, and there are still firefighters and equipment on site,” said Capt. Adrian Reyes of the New Hampshire Forest Protection Bureau. “This weekend is expected to bring record temperatures to the region, and we ask that anyone wishing to spend time outdoors avoids the area of the fire, for their own safety as well as for the safety of the wildland crew,” he said.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: The state’s black bear population appears to be increasing, based on the number of reported serious encounters with humans, but as New Jersey has had no official bear management plan for the past two years, the Division of Fish and Wildlife doesn’t know for sure. Without the plan, the division did not make an estimate of the bear population in the state’s northwest area last year and won’t do so this year. The last count was done in 2020 and coincided with the last statewide bear hunt. At that time there were about 3,158 bears in northwestern New Jersey, specifically in the areas previously designated as bear hunting zones north of Route 80 and west of Route 287. Records show that reported serious encounters with bears since the count have gone up nearly ninefold. “The DEP does not have a statewide population estimate, though sightings of black bears have been reported in all 21 counties,” said the Department of Environmental Protection, which oversees the Division of Fish and Wildlife. At least two people in Sussex County were injured in separate black bear encounters just outside their homes, and at least three dogs were killed or injured. The 2020 count shows the bear population doubled from the 1,522 counted in 2018, the last year a bear hunt was allowed on state-owned lands.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nMora: As more than 2,700 firefighters in northern New Mexico continued to battle the nation’s largest active wildfire Sunday, many evacuees were growing concerned about their future after weeks away from home. The biggest fire in the state’s recorded history has been burning for six weeks now, and some of the hundreds forced to evacuate say their financial resources are dwindling. Amity Maes, a 30-year-old Mora resident who said she is 81/ 2 months pregnant and penniless, told the Santa Fe New Mexican she bounced around for weeks before finding shelter at an evacuation center in Glorieta, where she believes she contracted COVID-19. Officials at Glorieta Adventure Camps said there have been 67 coronavirus cases among evacuees, including some that required hospitalization. After her isolation period, Maes said she was urged to leave and go to a hotel in Santa Fe where she could be closer to a hospital if she went into labor. But the hotel didn’t have her reservation when she arrived, and when she finally got a room, it was only for one night. “They keep encouraging us to go to Albuquerque” where evacuees are being housed in hotels, Maes told the newspaper. “We don’t have gas. We don’t have no income. There’s no gas vouchers. There’s no anything. I’m on a quarter-tank of gas, and I don’t know what I’m going to do.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: A street inside the city’s sole Army base now bears the name of a Black Congressional Medal of Honor recipient rather than a Confederate general. Fort Hamilton changed the road’s name to John Warren Avenue on Friday morning, following a years-old push by local officials to remove Confederate symbols nationwide. The base had previously called the street General Lee Avenue, after Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. Lt. John Warren, of Brooklyn, was killed at the age of 22 in 1969 in the Vietnam War when he fell in the direction of a grenade and shielded at least three men from the blast. His Congressional Medal of Honor citation says Williams’ “ultimate action of sacrifice to save the lives of his men was in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflects great credit on him, his unit, and the U.S. Army.” Warren is buried in Long Island National Cemetery, and his Congressional Medal of Honor was posthumously presented to him in 1970. The base will also rename its Stonewall Jackson Drive, which is named after another Confederate general.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Advocacy groups and voters who this year persuaded state courts to overturn the Legislature’s congressional redistricting plan asked the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday to avoid hearing arguments on whether such courts must be curtailed in reviewing U.S. House maps. Attorneys representing the state also joined with outside lawyers to file four legal briefs with the justices urging them to reject a petition from Republican legislative leaders to take up the issue. Through their own private lawyers, the GOP lawmakers already asked the court to formally rule on whether a provision in the U.S. Constitution delegating to state legislatures the manner of holding U.S. House elections means that state judges can’t void congressional district lines created by the General Assembly. The authors of Friday’s filings say the Supreme Court already has ruled before that some decision-making on congressional redistricting can be delegated by a state’s citizens. The same holds true when the North Carolina Legislature passed laws two decades ago setting in place the authority of courts to review redistricting plans that they approved, the lawyers wrote.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nPembina: One of the largest employers in northeastern North Dakota is closing later this year. Winnipeg, Manitoba-based New Flyer Industries is shutting down its charter and transit bus manufacturing plant in Pembina, located close to the Canadian border. Pembina Mayor Mike Fitzgerald said company was notified of the decision in a letter. The company told Fitzgerald that it was having difficulty finding qualified employees, a factor in its conversion to electric vehicles, and the plant’s location has become an issue. New Flyer has a plant in Crookston, Minnesota, which is about 100 miles from Pembina. Fitzgerald called the move “devastating” and said it will put more than 200 employees out of work, KFGO radio reports. The Pembina plant opened in 1963.\n\nOhio\n\nLancaster: An exhibit pairing photographs from two moments of societal crisis – the Great Depression and the COVID-19 pandemic – aims to help visitors see parallels between the human tolls felt across generations. The show, “Chronicles: The Great Depression and the Pandemic,” opened Saturday at the and runs through Aug. 28. It couples images of day-to-day life gathered by 10 Depression-era photographers and five contemporary Ohio photographers. The 1930s photographers – including Dorothea Lange, Esther Bubley, Jack Delano, Russell Lee, Carl Mydans, Gordon Parks, John Vachon and Ben Shahn – were hired by the U.S. government Works Progress Administration’s Farm Security Administration. The Ohio photographers are Autumn Bland, Donald Black, Jr., Angelo Merendino, Jane Alden Stevens and Shane Wynn. Their pictures document the ravages of the coronavirus across different social and economic groups. Special events tied to the exhibit include a talk with co-curators Christine Fowler Shearer and Arnold Tunstall on Sunday, a history lecture on the WPA, an artist talk with Wynn, and classes on smartphone photography and enhancing Instagram accounts.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: With the state only days away from enacting the toughest ban on abortion in the U.S., questions remained Friday about enforcing the law’s limited exceptions. The law allows abortions to save a pregnant patient’s life “in a medical emergency,” and supporters said doctors still would decide what an emergency is, though that could change later if it becomes perceived as a loophole. There’s also an exception for cases of rape, sexual assault or incest that have been reported to law enforcement, but that doesn’t help victims who don’t report the crimes to police. Abortion providers said they are likely to be cautious because the new law, like a ban at about six weeks enacted earlier and a similar 2021 law in Texas, will expose them to potentially expensive lawsuits over alleged violations. They’re planning to refer some patients to states like Colorado or Kansas, but some won’t be able to manage the extra time or travel involved. Oklahoma will provide a preview of what is in store for other states if the U.S. Supreme Court follows through on a draft opinion leaked earlier this month overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision legalizing abortion. The law also is likely to prompt Oklahoma residents – and Texans who’d traveled to the neighboring state – to go elsewhere to end their pregnancies.\n\nOregon\n\nOregon City: A Democratic state lawmaker is calling for an investigation into a ballot-printing fiasco that will delay results from Tuesday’s primary by weeks, with a key U.S. House race hanging in the balance in a state that prides itself on voter access and election transparency. Tens of thousands of ballots in the state’s third-largest county were printed with blurred barcodes, making them unreadable by vote-counting machines – a mistake that wasn’t caught until ballots were already being returned in the vote-by-mail state. Elections workers must now hand-transfer the votes from those ballots to new ones that can be read in a painstaking process that also raises the possibility of duplication errors. As the scope of the crisis became apparent, local, state and federal lawmakers Friday all escalated their criticism of Clackamas County Elections Clerk Sherry Hall, who defended her actions at a news conference Friday and said she had learned from the mistakes. State Rep. Janelle Bynum, who represents voters in the county, called the situation “unreasonable, and untenable,” and U.S. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, who represents some Clackamas voters in Congress, called Hall’s slow reaction “unconscionable.” Oregon Secretary of State Shemia Fagan demanded a written plan from Hall detailing how she would get results tabulated by June 13, the state deadline.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Summer Lee has won a five-way Democratic primary for a Pittsburgh-based U.S. House seat, making her the favorite in the heavily Democratic district to win the fall general election and become the first Black woman elected to Congress from Pennsylvania. Friday was the fourth day of counting ballots after Tuesday’s primary in the closely contested race for the open 12th District seat. Lee, a second-term state House member, lawyer and former labor organizer, comes from the party’s progressive wing. She was endorsed by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., the two-time presidential candidate and a leading voice in the Democratic Party’s left wing who came to campaign for Lee. Lee beat out second-place Steve Irwin, who was endorsed by the Allegheny County Democratic Party and backed by prominent Democrats from the county. The seat is open because longtime Rep. Mike Doyle – first elected in 1994 – is not running again. It also has new boundaries since Pennsylvania’s congressional districts were redrawn to account for a decade of demographic changes identified by the 2020 census. Lee will face the Republican nominee of the same name as the outgoing Democratic incumbent – Mike Doyle – in the fall general election.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBristol: Dr. Anthony Fauci urged graduates of Roger Williams University on Friday to fight what he called the “normalization of untruths,” which has become a growing and more troubling problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert and the face of the federal government’s response to the coronavirus, was the commencement ceremony’s keynote speaker but addressed students at the private Rhode Island college remotely because he had to attend a memorial service for a family member. “During the COVID-19 pandemic, I have experienced firsthand something that has troubled and saddened me – a deepened divisiveness in our nation,” he said. “Unfortunately, differences of opinion or ideology are propped up by deliberate distortions of reality to the point of fabrications, conspiracy theories, and outright lies.” He told the students to apply the analytic skills they have learned during their time at the university to challenge and renounce untruths, which he called a threat to the nation. “Reject the politicization of science that denigrates evidence and facts,” he said.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Two new state laws require elementary school teachers to get a 30-minute break each day without students and ban districts from turning over school lunch debt to collection agencies. The bills were passed in the final days of the 2022 General Assembly session and signed into law by Gov. Henry McMaster. Both passed the House and Senate unanimously. The break bill requires teachers in elementary school and special education teachers who have students in their classes for most of the day to get 30 minutes without any assigned duties or responsibilities. Teacher groups requested the law, saying some teachers never had time to eat a lunch or even use the bathroom because they were watching students. A second bill prohibits school districts from turning over debt a student owes for school lunches to a collection agency. Supporters said students need to eat regardless of their ability to pay, and turning debt over to a collection agency was too drastic of a step.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSturgis: The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled a sex crime conviction doesn’t require an actual victim. The court last week upheld the conviction of a man stemming from a sting operation during the 2017 Sturgis motorcycle rally. Carlocito Slim argued he was just looking for a massage when he responded to an ad on the Backpage website under the headline “Women Seeking Men.” Slim was actually responding to an ad that was a sting setup and unknowingly texted a special agent with South Dakota’s Division of Criminal Investigation. The agent, posing as a pimp, told Slim he could meet a 15-year-old girl. And when Slim showed up at the assigned meeting place with condoms and $200, he was arrested and later convicted of two federal felonies. Slim argued there couldn’t be a conviction because there was no pimp and no crime victim. Defense attorney Terry Pechota told the judges his client simply didn’t understand the text communications and was only looking for a massage, South Dakota Public Broadcasting reports. “He doesn’t ask about whether or not the girl is 16, or whether they’re going to engage in any funny stuff or illegal stuff,” Pechota said. But Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Kelderman said Slim knew what was going on and later told investigators he thought he was meeting a girl for sex.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee said Friday that he doesn’t have a timeline yet on when his administration might roll out a long-blocked school voucher program that saw its biggest legal roadblock removed by the state’s high court last week. The Republican told reporters it was a “good first step” for the Supreme Court to rule Wednesday that the voucher initiative doesn’t violate the Tennessee Constitution’s “home rule,” which says the Legislature can’t pass measures singling out individual counties without local support. The decision upends earlier court rulings that have kept the program that passed in 2019 from ever being implemented. The program applies only to Nashville and Shelby County, which includes Memphis, the areas with the lowest-performing schools and regions with Democratic political strongholds who opposed the measure. The two counties were among the entities that sued over the program. But the governor also said there are “legal decisions yet to be made” and “a lot of steps that have to come to fruition” before the program can get up and running. “Once we determine the speed with which the court will make its final decisions, then we can move forward with the particulars to make sure this works and fits, and how it is that we roll it out,” Lee said.\n\nTexas\n\nMentone: The top elected official in a rural, sparsely populated West Texas county has been arrested after being accused of stealing cattle. Loving County Judge Skeet Jones, 71, and three other men were arrested Friday on charges of livestock theft and engaging in organized criminal activity. All four men were taken to the jail in neighboring Winkler County, where they have since been released on bond. Jones hadn’t returned a call seeking comment Sunday. The arrests came after a yearlong investigation, according to a statement from the Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association. The association has commissioned peace officers known as special rangers who investigate agricultural crimes, including the theft of cattle and horses. The rangers also determine the ownership of stray livestock. The association’s special rangers allege Jones and the others gathered stray cattle and sold them without following procedures set forth in the Texas Agriculture Code. Those procedures include calling the sheriff to report stray livestock and allowing the sheriff to search for the animal’s owner. The association declined to provide additional details about the case, citing the ongoing investigation. The theft of livestock charge carries a sentence of up to 10 years in prison and the organized criminal activity charge up to 20 years in prison.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: Southern Utah’s first 24-hour child care center is opening soon, aiming to help families break away from poverty. The new Stepping Stones day care center is slated to open June 1 and will be housed under SwitchPoint, the St. George-based nonprofit that runs and operates the area’s largest homeless shelter, food bank and other programs aimed at helping people living in poverty. The center will stay open 24 hours per day, seven days per week, and will aim to help parents and guardians who struggle who pay the costs of child care elsewhere. “We’ve got to create something that can help alleviate keeping families trapped in poverty,” said Carol Holloway, the executive director of Switchpoint, to a packed room of people at a ribbon-cutting event at the center Tuesday. Kamie Blake, the program director for the care center, said it will be the only 24/7 child care center in southern Utah and one of the few in operation in the state. Children as young as 6 weeks old and up to 12 years old will be eligible to attend. At full capacity, Stepping Stones can take up to 270 kids each day and has a kitchen, laundry and sleeping areas to accommodate the round-the-clock operations. There are five classrooms on site, with lessons scheduled based on age.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Gov. Phil Scott vetoed a bill that would have created a drug use standards advisory board within the state sentencing commission, saying it “places no limits on which drugs can be contemplated for legalization or the amounts.” The board would determine “the benchmark personal use dosage and the benchmark personal use supply” for regulated and unregulated drugs, with a goal of preventing and reducing the criminalization of personal drug use, according to the bill. Scott, a Republican, said in his letter Thursday to the General Assembly the bill includes “absolutely no recognition” of health and safety impacts of using fentanyl, heroin and other drugs, and it doesn’t acknowledge law enforcement’s role in stopping dealers. Scott also vetoed a bill that would have expanded eligibility for the expungement of criminal records for nonviolent crimes. “Ultimately, I find this bill inconsistent with the State’s responsibilities to keep the public safe,” he wrote. Rep. Selene Colburn, P-Burlington, who supported both bills, said she was upset about the outcome, WCAX-TV reports. “We are not talking about reducing penalties for violent crimes or changing expungement eligibility. We are simply talking about treating people who have used drugs and who have struggled with substance use disorder with dignity and respect and the basic belief that their lives are valuable,” she said.\n\nVirginia\n\nWilliamsburg: Attorneys for the U.S. government have indicated they will not oppose a plan to lift all remaining restrictions next month on John Hinckley Jr., the man who tried to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981. U.S. District Court Judge Paul L. Friedman in Washington ruled last year that Hinckley can be freed unconditionally in June if he continues to follow the rules placed on him and remains mentally stable as he continues to live in Williamsburg. Hinckley, 66, has indeed remained mentally stable and violated no conditions, according to a letter filed by U.S. attorneys with the court Thursday. That determination was based on letters from the Washington’s Department of Health, which has overseen Hinckley’s care. A court hearing is scheduled for June 1. Hinckley was 25, suffering from acute psychosis, when he shot and wounded the 40th U.S. president and injured three others. When jurors found him not guilty by reason of insanity, they said he needed treatment and not a lifetime in confinement. A 2016 court order granted him permission to live with his mom full time, after experts said his mental illness had been in remission for decades. She died in July. He signed a lease on a one-bedroom apartment in the area last year and began living there with his cat, Theo, according to court filings. In recent years, Hinckley has sold items from a booth at an antique mall that he’s found at estate sales, flea markets and consignment shops. He’s also shared his music on YouTube.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An invasive European green crab was captured last week in Hood Canal, the farthest south the species has been found in the Salish Sea. Volunteers with Washington Sea Grant trapped the male European green crab in Nick’s Lagoon near Seabeck in Kitsap County, The Seattle Times reports. The organization has been tasked by the state with early detection of the crab’s spread. Washington Sea Grant marine ecologist Emily Grason said in a news release the crab arrived at the lagoon last year, based on its size. The Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife in response will increase trapping there to assess the scope of the green crab presence and try to locally eradicate the species. Gov. Jay Inslee issued an emergency proclamation in January to address a significant increase in European green crab populations within the Lummi Nation’s sea pond near Bellingham. The crab is highly adaptable and preys on juvenile clams before they reach harvestable age. It also out-competes native crab species and wreaks havoc on marine and estuary ecosystems. It was first found in Washington’s inland waters in 2016.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice said Thursday that social services workers will receive a 15% pay increase by tapping funds from existing vacant positions after such efforts failed in the Legislature. About 970 employees of the Department of Health and Human Resources’ Bureau for Social Services will receive the raises starting June 18. There are more than 6,500 children in the care of the state. According to the DHHR, there is a 30% vacancy rate statewide for foster care employees. “I told you we’d get this done, and we got it done without spending any excess money,” the Republican governor said in a statement. “I always say we need to mind the store, and we’ve done it the right way. As a result, we’re now able to compensate these people that are doing incredible work.” Employee pay raises and other key provisions were stripped from a social services bill before it died on the final day of the regular legislative session in March. After the pay raises were gutted, DHHR Secretary Bill Crouch told a Senate committee that the department would reduce the number of open positions to provide the much-needed raises to child protective services employees. Crouch said Thursday those vacant positions indeed funded the raises.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: A disorderly conduct conviction can’t disqualify someone from obtaining a permit to carry a concealed weapon, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday in a unanimous decision that could dramatically broaden who can carry hidden firearms, knives and stun guns. The court found that disorderly conduct isn’t a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence under federal law and therefore doesn’t disqualify a person from holding a concealed carry license. Justice Jill Karofsky, a member of the court’s liberal minority, concurred but in a separate opinion called on legislators to close a “dangerous loophole” that will allow domestic abusers to carry concealed weapons. Lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill a year ago that would have reconciled the language, but it never got got a hearing. “Though legally correct, this result is as nonsensical as it is dangerous,” Karofsky wrote. “When a domestic abuse perpetrator, who has engaged in threats to kill or any other type of domestic violence, has access to a gun, the lethality risk for his victim increases significantly.” The case revolves around Daniel Doubek, of Green Bay. According to court documents, Doubek broke into his estranged wife’s trailer in Door County in 1993 waving a board and shouting threats. He was ultimately convicted of disorderly conduct.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: Local reservoirs are likely to be nearly drained this summer amid lingering drought in the Snake River basin, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reports. Federal officials predicted Thursday during an annual water meeting at the Teton County Library that reservoirs like Jackson Lake and Palisades could fall to 2%-10% if summer proves particularly hot and dry, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/05/23"}]}

WSFA-TV reports cotton leafroll dwarf virus is a new strain of cotton blue disease. The Alabama Cooperative Extension System says the virus is transmitted by aphids and diminishes blooms and bolls in the upper canopy, resulting in lower yields, mainly in late-planted cotton. The new strain was discovered in Alabama in 2017 but has been observed in Brazil in 2006. It has since been confirmed in Florida, Georgia, and Mississippi. The virus reduced cotton yields by nearly 50,000 bales in 2018. Alabama Farmers Federation’s Carla Hornady says symptoms include red leaf veins, cupped leaves and sterility, and it will likely take years to develop new, resistant cotton cultivars.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The Legislature failed Wednesday to override budget vetoes by Gov. Mike Dunleavy that will prompt a massive 41% cut of state funding to the University of Alaska and lay waste to other programs the governor deemed unaffordable. More than a third of lawmakers missed the vote – many because of an ongoing dispute about where the Legislature should have met for the special session. Lawmakers needed 45 votes – a three-fourths majority of the 60 members of the state Senate and House – to override the vetoes by Dunleavy, a Republican who took office in December. The effort fell short with a 37-1 vote in Juneau. Only Rep. Tammie Wilson, a North Pole Republican, voted not to override. The special session began Monday, and the Legislature has until midnight Friday to again consider veto overrides.\n\nArizona\n\nSupai: For those hoping to score notoriously hard-to-get permits to visit Havasupai Falls, Beyonce may be making it even more difficult. The singer shot a music video Wednesday at the foot of Havasu Falls, TMZ reports, almost guaranteeing the in-demand destination at the bottom of the Grand Canyon will grow even more popular. According to TMZ, Beyonce, her daughter Blue Ivy and her crew flew in and out by helicopter, spending about five hours at Havasu Falls with the blessing of the Havasupai Tribe, which owns the land. The shoot likely inconvenienced hikers, as Beyonce and her crew were allowed exclusive access to the falls and its turquoise pools. The superstar’s visit emphasized the gap between the haves and have-nots. Campers must cross their fingers each Feb. 1 when permits for the upcoming year are released online. Demand typically overwhelms servers, and very few manage to secure reservations.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A group plans to begin gathering signatures soon to put a proposal to legalize recreational marijuana on the ballot in the state next year. The Drug Policy Education Group on Wednesday submitted a proposed constitutional amendment that would allow licensed dispensaries to sell marijuana for recreational use. Arkansas voters legalized medical marijuana in 2016, and dispensaries began selling it in May. The group also submitted a proposed amendment that would allow people convicted of low-level marijuana offenses to petition courts for relief, including release from incarceration and expungement of their conviction. The group has until July 3, 2020, to gather the needed 89,151 signatures from registered voters to qualify for the November 2020 election ballot. The state Board of Election Commissioners must also review the ballot measure’s wording.\n\nCalifornia\n\nPasadena: A statue capturing Brandi Chastain’s iconic reaction to scoring the U.S. team’s winning goal in the 1999 Women’s World Cup has been unveiled outside the Rose Bowl. Chastain was on hand for the unveiling Wednesday, the 20th anniversary of the historic win, which coincided with celebrations in New York for this year’s World Cup champion team. This year’s team sealed its second consecutive tournament win by beating the Netherlands 2-0 on Sunday. The statue shows Chastain at the moment she dropped to her knees in exultation, clutching the jersey she pulled off after cinching the win over China on a penalty kick in the game played at the Rose Bowl. The moment has been credited as a watershed for invigorating women’s sports.\n\nColorado\n\nWalden: Photos of what appears to be a black-colored wolf captured north of the town this week could be the first credible wolf sighting in the state in four years. Colorado Parks and Wildlife released images of the black animal wearing what appeared to be a radio collar around its neck. The photos were shot by a member of the public near the Colorado State Forest State Park. CPW biologists are working to confirm the sighting, as well as another recent sighting in Grand County. CPW spokesperson Rebecca Ferrell says she’s not sure if the photos were taken on public or private land. The animal is believed to have wandered into the state from Wyoming. Wolves were extirpated from the state in the 1940s mainly because of their depredation of livestock. But the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has restored gray wolf populations in Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, New Mexico and Arizona.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew Haven: Renowned forensic scientist Henry Lee is defending work he did three decades ago. The state Supreme Court criticized Lee last month when it overturned the convictions of two men for a 1985 murder. The decision came after experts determined that stains on a towel that Lee had testified were consistent with blood were something else. Wendall Hasan has been in prison since 1986 for murder. His lawyers filed court papers Tuesday that he should be freed after more recent tests found no blood on a pair of sneakers Lee testified were bloodstained. Lee responded Thursday at a news conference that his testimony in that case was accurate, as was his testimony in two other cases. Lee says the blood sample likely was used up during his earlier testing.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: David Bromberg, a master of stringed-instrument Americana, says a deal to sell his massive collection of historic violins to the Library of Congress has fallen through. The local singer-songwriter and session musician has compiled a collection of 263 historic American violins over the years and, at 73, was hoping to sell it intact for $1.7 million as his retirement plan. Now he fears the collection will have to be broken up and sold separately. The Library of Congress announced in 2016 that it would buy the collection Bromberg spent 50 years curating. It even set up a center for their study. It would’ve been among the library’s largest instrument collections. Bromberg says library officials told him they now have other priorities.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The D.C. Council is considering legislation that would allow minors to run small-scale businesses such as lemonade stands without having to get a business license or permit. WTOP-FM reports Councilman Brandon Todd on Tuesday introduced the Lemonade Stand Amendment Act of 2019, which was co-sponsored by all the other members. The bill would allow minors to operate small businesses as long as the businesses are open for no more than 100 days and are reasonably distanced from licensed commercial businesses. Todd said harassment against entrepreneurial minors has become too common. As various states consider and enact similar legislation, Country Time Lemonade has also gotten into the mix and started a “Legal-Ade” to help pay for fines and permits.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: There’s a baby boom at Zoo Miami. The zoo announced on Facebook that six babies were born within a seven-day period to six different mothers. All of the new additions are female. The baby boom started July 2 with the birth of an addax. On July 5, a Grevy’s zebra was born, followed July 7 by a newborn Arabian oryx. The next day, another Grevy’s zebra and two giant elands were born. And the boom is continuing with another giant eland and a giraffe expected any day. Zoo officials say the addax was the 67th born at Zoo Miami. There are fewer than 100 of the African desert antelopes left in the Sahara, which makes the addax a critically endangered species.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge has ordered state election officials to allow computer experts and lawyers to review the databases used to create ballots and count votes. The ruling came Tuesday in the lawsuit filed by election integrity advocates and voters that challenges Georgia’s election system and seeks statewide use of hand-marked paper ballots. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg gave the state until Friday to turn over electronic copies of the databases to the plaintiffs’ lawyers and computer experts. The plaintiffs’ experts had said inspection of the databases was necessary to begin to evaluate security vulnerabilities and flaws. Lawyers for the state had argued disclosure of sensitive information in the databases could jeopardize the security of the election system. Totenberg wrote that they provided no evidence of that.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Construction on a giant telescope will start again next week after lengthy court battles and passionate protests from those who say building it on the island state’s tallest mountain will desecrate land sacred to some Native Hawaiians. State officials announced Wednesday that the road to the top of Mauna Kea mountain on the Big Island will be closed starting Monday as equipment is delivered. Scientists revere the mountain for its summit above the clouds that provides a clear view of the sky with very little air and light pollution. Astronomers say it will allow them to reach back 13 billion years to answer fundamental questions about the advent of the universe. The Thirty Meter Telescope project got approval to move forward last month. While it was the final legal step, opponents vowed to keep fighting and even get arrested if necessary to stop construction.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Officials say the city is installing facial recognition technology at its city halls to keep “banned people” out of the government buildings. Mayor David Bieter’s spokesman Mike Journee says the city will spend $52,000 to install the technology at Boise City Hall and City Hall West in an effort to identify people who enter either building in violation of legal no-contact orders. No one is currently banned from City Hall. Journee says the technology will likely be in use by the end of 2019. At least two U.S. cities have banned facial recognition technology over concerns that that the real-time surveillance technology could be misused or that it could violate civil rights. Journee says the facial data collected by Boise’s system will not be stored or connected to any police database or criminal records.\n\nIllinois\n\nDuQuoin: Country rock band Confederate Railroad has been barred from performing at a state fair because of its use of the Confederate flag, setting off a firestorm by southern Illinois fans who believe they’re under Chicago liberals’ thumb of political correctness. The band was scheduled to appear Aug. 27 at the DuQuoin State Fair , but Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s administration canceled the appearance last week. “This administration’s guiding principle is that the state of Illinois will not use state resources to promote symbols of racism,” Pritzker spokeswoman Emily Bittner said. The logo for the Grammy-nominated band, known for acoustic ballads such as “Jesus and Mama” as well as its raucous anthem “Trashy Women,” features a steam engine from which waves dual Confederate Navy Jacks, whose stars and bars are the most widely recognized symbol of the Confederacy.\n\nIndiana\n\nWest Lafayette: Local Twitter has been abuzz with Purdue Boilermakers expressing pride over the feature of a powder blue Purdue University sweatshirt in the newest season of Netflix’s “Stranger Things.” Erika Austin, manager of trademarks and licensing for Purdue, says she was as surprised as everyone else to see the shout-out. The Purdue Trademarks and Licensing department is working with its licensing agency and the Purdue Team Store to produce and sell a replica of the shirt, with the possibility it could eventually be sold in other retail locations, she says. Set in the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana, “Stranger Things” gives no indication as to where in the state it’s located. A limestone quarry in the first season led some Hoosiers to believe it could be in the southern portion of the state; season two includes a geographical reference to west-central Tippecanoe; and the feature of Purdue gear helps anchor the idea of it being a northern town.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The state Department of Human Services says it has agreed to pay an additional $386 million to two insurance companies that will provide Medicaid services for the 2020 fiscal year. The 8.6% increase announced Wednesday will include $115 million in additional state funding, with the federal government paying for the remaining portion. The $5 billion Medicaid program serves about 600,000 poor and disabled people. DHS says the rates include changes made by the Legislature, which account for about 2% of the increase. Last year the agency approved a $344 million increase over the previous year. The state privatized the Medicaid program in 2016, with then-Gov. Terry Branstad promising cost savings and improved care. Democrats say neither goal has been accomplished.\n\nKansas\n\nMulvane: Some drivers got a surprise windfall when a malfunctioning toll machine spat out coins instead of accepting money near a casino. The Wichita Eagle reports Kansas Turnpike Authority spokeswoman Rachel Bell says the agency learned Tuesday morning about the problem with the machine at the Mulvane exit. The agency inadvertently divulged details about the mishap when it sent a text alert to its public subscribers. The note said there was “NO WAY” to know the exact dollar amount that was taken. KTA says the message was meant to be internal but made it out into the public realm after someone newly responsible for disseminating messages sent it to the wrong group of subscribers. Bell wasn’t immediately sure how many customers used the machine while it was being generous.\n\nKentucky\n\nClermont: Louisville Gas and Electric Co. wants to build a natural gas pipeline to feed the growing energy needs of Bullitt County, but some area property owners – including Bernheim Arboretum and Research Forest – are pushing back. LG&E is preparing to go to court in an attempt to take control of the land it wants through eminent domain. Bernheim’s executive director, Mark Wourms, says the nonprofit won’t accept that without a fight because the pipeline would cut through an area that’s home to endangered Indiana bats and two species of extremely rare snails. “It’s just insane to intentionally impact rare animal habitats,” he said. “Is it an uphill battle? Sure it is ... and we think it’s better for Kentucky if we don’t (stop fighting).” The Bernheim Forest covers more than 16,000 acres about 25 miles south of downtown Louisville.\n\nLouisiana\n\nShreveport: The State Fair of Louisiana has announced the theme for this year’s event. The Times reports the 113th State Fair will be known as “Gumbo of Fun” and be held Oct.24 through Nov.10 in Shreveport. Since 1906, the State Fair of Louisiana has been a tradition for many families, drawing an average of 425,000 people through the gates annually. In addition to carnival rides, it offers food vendors and live music. Authorities say the event has a $24 million economic impact on Shreveport’s economy and creates more than 300 temporary jobs during the season.\n\nMaine\n\nRaymond: A summer camp has brought together dozens of children suffering from a rare disease. Camp Sunshine says only about 1,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with Diamond-Blackfan Anemia, and 59 families affected by the disease are at the camp in Maine. The camp, on the shore of Sebago Lake, says it’s the largest gathering worldwide of families who are dealing with the disease, which affects bone marrow and reduces red blood cells. Officials say 4-year-old Noah Dowie of Australia traveled the farthest in hopes of finding support from other families and getting help from clinicians and researchers. The camp brings together families of children with life-threatening illnesses. It has helped more than 50,000 individuals from all 50 states and 27 countries.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The Federal Aviation Administration is going to reconsider its position challenging the state over new flight patterns and the noise they bring residents near Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport. The FAA filed a motion Tuesday to hold Maryland’s case in abeyance while it reconsiders. In September, the FAA wrote a letter to the state declining to respond to a petition asking for more review of the flight patterns. Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh says he’s hopeful the FAA will undertake a thorough review of the facts and ultimately lead to changes in flight paths. Gov. Larry Hogan says his administration remains committed to restoring the quality of life for residents who live around the state’s airports.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Health officials say the mosquito-borne West Nile virus has officially returned to the state. The Department of Public Health announced Thursday that West Nile was detected in mosquitoes collected in Boston last week – the first positive sample of the year. No human cases have been reported so far. A year ago there were 49 confirmed human cases of West Nile, the most ever reported in a single year in Massachusetts. State Epidemiologist Catherine Brown says the risk for human infection generally peaks in August. As always, health officials are advising people to protect themselves from mosquito-borne illnesses such as West Nile and Eastern Equine Encephalitis by using mosquito repellent, draining standing water near their homes and repairing any tears in window screens.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Water levels in parts of the Great Lakes system hit record highs last month and are only expected to keep climbing, prompting concern from state officials for waterfront communities already flooded. Lake Superior, Lake St. Clair, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario set record-high monthly mean water levels in June, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reported this week. Lake Michigan-Huron was less than an inch short of its June record. The situation has prompted emergency response measures from the local and state levels as communities deal with the consequences of simply having too much water. Overflowing lakes have flooded lakefront properties, eroded shoreline and erased beaches, say officials with the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. High waves, strong currents and hidden debris create hazards for recreational boaters and swimmers.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: State taxpayers helped foot the bill when Jimmy Fallon broadcast “The Tonight Show” from Minneapolis as part of last year’s Super Bowl festivities. Minnesota Public Radio News obtained information via public records request that shows the state paid the show $267,000 through a rebate program. The state’s Snowbate program is aimed at luring productions and fostering local industry talent. Talk shows are ineligible to participate in the program. But the NBC show was reclassified as a “variety show” to fit the confines of state law. The records show that Michael Tabor, a member of the program’s advisory committee, said giving away state funds to Fallon’s show “isn’t responsible.” He said NBC was set to be in Minnesota anyway because it was shooting the Super Bowl.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A new Mississippi Writers Trail marker honoring novelist and poet Margaret Walker was unveiled this week at Jackson State University, where she was an English professor from 1949 to 1979 and was also known as Margaret Walker Alexander. In 1942, she became the first African American woman to win the Yale Prize, for her poetry collection “For My People.” One of her best known novels, “Jubilee,” was published in 1966 and tells of a biracial woman born into slavery in the American South. Walker was born in 1915 in Birmingham, Alabama, and her family moved to New Orleans when she was 10. She earned degrees from Northwestern University and the University of Iowa. Jackson State’s Margaret Walker Center is dedicated to the interpretation of black culture. She died in 1998.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The locally based brewery that makes Kraftig beer, which is operated by an heir to the family that founded Anheuser-Busch, is going out of business. The William K. Busch Brewing Co. announced the decision Wednesday, citing market demand. Billy Busch said in a statement that he hopes eventually to return to the brewery business. The company says Kraftig will continue to be available in stores while supplies last, which is expected to be through September. The brewery began operation in 2011 in Brentwood, a St. Louis suburb. Busch is a son of August “Gussie” Busch Jr., the longtime leader of Anheuser-Busch credited with building the St. Louis brewer into the dominant force of the beer market. Anheuser-Busch was sold to Belgian brewer InBev in 2008.\n\nMontana\n\nWhitefish: The Under the Big Sky music and arts festival is coming to Big Mountain Ranch this weekend. The concert will be held Saturday and Sunday from noon to 11 p.m. Featured artists include Nathaniel Rateliff and The Night Sweats, Band of Horses, The Lil Smokies and Mike Murray. A Montana-based singer-songwriter from Kalispell, Murray typically plays as a solo or duo act, but for Under the Big Sky Festival, he will be performing with a full band. Tickets for the festival are still on sale online. Two-day last-call tickets are $129.00 plus a $28.81 fee. Two-day VIP last-call tickets are $275.00 plus a $37.83 fee. More information is available online.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: State corrections officials are exploring options to combat the delivery by drone of drugs and other contraband to inmates. The Lincoln Journal Star reports that the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services is asking companies what they can do to detect unmanned aircraft. Laura Strimple, chief of staff to the department’s director, says officials are considering proposals made by six companies in February. No details have been provided about how much a drone detection system would cost, but the department told the companies that funding would come from its budget or a grant. The department began looking into drone detection after an inmate found a crashed drone in February at the Lincoln Correctional Center. The craft was carrying two bags containing marijuana, tobacco and rolling papers.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: Rep. Steven Horsford, D-Nev., called for U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry’s resignation Wednesday after the department acknowledged multiple shipments of low-level radioactive waste to a site north of Las Vegas may have been mislabeled and out of compliance with safety regulations for years. The department had announced earlier that shipments of the waste from Tennessee to Nevada have been suspended while it investigates whether the materials were “potentially mischaracterized” as the wrong category of low-level waste. Low-level waste can include equipment or worker’s clothing contaminated by exposure to radiation, while mixed low-level waste can include toxic metals. Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette also has ordered a departmentwide assessment of its “procedures and practices for packaging and shipping all radioactive waste types,” according to a memo.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nBretton Woods: It seems bears enjoy a good view just like any other visitor to the White Mountains. A photo snapped by an employee at the Omni Mount Washington Resort shows a black bear holding onto a rail on the veranda and looking out. The snapshot was taken about 5 a.m. a couple of weeks ago; Sam Geesaman says he had only wanted to get a photo of the sunrise. Instead, he caught the bear as it climbed stairs in search of a trash can. The bear moved on after Gessaman loudly clapped and stomped. New Hampshire routinely has reports of bears finding their way into homes, campgrounds and even apartment complexes. Last year, food shortages were blamed for a sharp increase in bear-human conflicts and the highest numbers of bear killings since 2014.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold: A high-stakes trial about beach access at the Jersey shore has stalled after the judge in the case made clear, in often colorful terms, that she was less than impressed with arguments made by both sides. With quips and lacerating observations during a hearing Wednesday, Superior Court Judge Lisa Thornton at one point told one of the attorneys, “Don’t get your underwear in a bunch,” and she said another’s responses amounted to “dancing” around the question. The American Littoral Society, a coastal environmental group, is suing the borough of Deal, trying to nullify an ordinance it passed in December that would vacate the end of an oceanfront street in return for a $1 million payment from a nearby landowner who wants the property as part of a development proposal.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The long-simmering battle between the state and its neighbor to the north over which one grows the best chile is heating up. New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham went on the offensive Wednesday after Colorado Gov. Jared Polis proclaimed on Twitter that hot peppers from Pueblo were the best and would be stocked across a four-state region by a well-known grocery store chain. Polis went on to say stores in Lujan Grisham’s state would be supplied with inferior New Mexico chile. Lujan Grisham fired back, saying New Mexico chile is “the greatest in the world,” and she’s ready for a chile duel. Researchers at New Mexico State University have explained that soil conditions, warmer temperatures, the right amount of water and a longer growing season result in the unique flavor of the state’s chile.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Dozens of plaintiffs have filed a class-action lawsuit in state Supreme Court arguing a newly enacted law that ended the religious exemption for vaccinations violates their religious beliefs. The lawsuit, filed Wednesday, comes just weeks after a contentious vote by lawmakers approving the end of religious exemptions for vaccinations in the state. The bill was immediately signed into law by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. More than 1,000 cases of measles have been confirmed nationwide since October, most of which have been in New York – particularly in New York City and Rockland County, home to large Orthodox Jewish communities where some are opposed to vaccines. More than 266 cases of measles were reported in Rockland County as of last month. The suit was filed by Orange County attorney Michael Sussman and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a fierce critic of vaccinations.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nAsheville: There might soon be one more way for the public to view the majesty of Mount Pisgah, one of Western North Carolina’s most beloved natural landmarks. A new state park is nearly a done deal after a bipartisan, unanimous vote by the state House this week passed the bill authorizing the park. The bill to create Pisgah View State Park out of some 1,600 acres of Pisgah View Ranch land in Buncombe and Haywood counties, with a picture-perfect view of Mount Pisgah, was also unanimously passed by the state Senate on June 24. It was introduced by Sen. Chuck Edwards, R-Henderson, in April to authorize the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources to add Pisgah View State Park to the State Parks System. Rep. Brian Turner, D-Buncombe, sponsored the bill in the House.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s pardon advisory board on Wednesday unanimously backed a policy change that will allow people with low-level marijuana convictions to apply for pardons and have their records wiped clean if they don’t commit another crime for five years. Republican Gov. Doug Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both support the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities that have been trying to fix problems that such past convictions have caused for people trying to find jobs and housing. North Dakota’s change doesn’t go as far as some others that automatically dismissed or pardoned convictions. Instead, people applying for pardons would have to fill out an online form on the corrections department’s website. The deadline for the first round of applications is Aug. 10. It costs nothing to apply.\n\nOhio\n\nToledo: Heavy rains that inundated the Great Lakes region this spring will fuel another massive algae bloom across parts of western Lake Erie later this summer, researchers said Thursday. Scientists with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration expect this year’s bloom to rank among the top five since it began measuring their severity in 2002, according to their annual algae forecast for the lake. What’s not known is how toxic it might be or whether it will pose a threat for cities like Toledo and Cleveland that draw their drinking water from the lake. Lake Erie, the shallowest and warmest of the Great Lakes, has been hit particularly hard by algae blooms over the past decade. Five years ago a toxic bloom caused a two-day shutdown of drinking water in Toledo.\n\nOklahoma\n\nGuthrie: Police say they found a rattlesnake, a canister of radioactive powdered uranium and an open bottle of Kentucky Deluxe whiskey during a traffic stop of a vehicle that had been reported stolen. The traffic stop happened June 26 in Guthrie, about 30 miles north of Oklahoma City. Guthrie police Sgt. Anthony Gibbs told Oklahoma City TV station KFOR that police don’t know why the uranium was in the vehicle or how it was obtained, though uranium ore can be bought on Amazon. Gibbs says police also found a gun in the console and a terrarium in the backseat containing a pet timber rattlesnake. Gibbs says the driver, Stephen Jennings, was charged with possession of a stolen vehicle, transporting an open container of liquor and driving with a suspended license. Jennings remains jailed in Logan County.\n\nOregon\n\nRoseburg: Federal officials have formally declared a disaster in Douglas, Linn and four other Oregon counties for severe storms that hit the area in April. KATU-TV reports the disaster declaration signed Tuesday comes in response to the severe storms, flooding, landslides and mudslides April 6 through April 21 in Oregon’s Curry, Douglas, Grant, Linn, Umatilla and Wheeler counties. State officials say the storms caused more than $8 million in damage and killed one person in Douglas County. It’s the second disaster declaration for Douglas and Curry counties in 2019. In May, the Federal Emergency Management Agency declared that February storms that toppled trees and closed highways in Douglas, Curry, Lane and Coos counties qualified as a disaster.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state attorney general’s office launched an effort Thursday to improve the use of firearms databases so that law enforcement can better track guns used in crimes and, ultimately, clamp down on gun violence. The move comes amid a surge in such violence in Philadelphia. The city’s rate of homicides this year is about the same as it was in 2018, when Philadelphia recorded 349 of them, the most since 2007. Speaking at a news conference in Erie, Attorney General Josh Shapiro said he wants police departments to enter serial numbers from every gun used in a crime or seized by police into a law-enforcement database so that its original seller can be identified and the information shared with other departments. “Because this information is not shared, we actually have no idea how many crime guns were recovered in Pennsylvania last year, and that makes us all less safe,” he said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The governor has signed a bill to deregulate the business of African-style hair braiding. The legislation signed by Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo defines natural hair braiding and exempts braiders from the state’s requirement for hairdressers and cosmeticians to be licensed, effective immediately. Democratic Rep. Anastasia Williams, of Providence, has been working to exempt hair braiders from licensing requirements for several years. She says their techniques are passed down from generation to generation and don’t require formal training. Williams also says forcing braiders to meet the same licensing requirements as cosmetologists is an injustice, and the new law allows entrepreneurs, including many low-income women, to make a living.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: For the second time in two years, the state has moved its death row inmates to a new prison. State Corrections Department Director Bryan Stirling says the 37 inmates awaiting execution were taken Thursday morning from Kirkland Correctional Intuition to Broad River Correctional Intuition about a half-mile away. Stirling says prison officials studied death rows in Virginia and North Carolina to address concerns about treatment from a 2017 federal lawsuit by 16 inmates. The new death row will allow inmates to eat meals with each other, worship together and have jobs. Previously, death row inmates were in solitary confinement even during the hour they got outside their cells. Death row was moved from Lieber Correctional Intuition near Charleston to Kirkland Correctional Intuition in 2017.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nRapid City: The South Dakota School of Mines & Technology will work with the Air Force Civil Engineer Center at the Ellsworth base on environmental stewardship goals. The school’s experts in ecology, hydrology, environmental engineering and other disciplines will help the Air Force clean up contaminated sites, reduce or prevent future pollution, and comply with environmental rules and law at its installations. Mines President Jim Rankin says the partnership boosts top-tier science and engineering research and education at the school while supporting the Department of Defense efforts on environmental challenges.\n\nTennessee\n\nMurfreesboro: Country singer Chris Young’s alma mater is honoring him by naming a new live music venue after him on campus. Middle Tennessee State University plans to open the Chris Young Cafe sometime in the fall semester. University President Sidney McPhee said at an event Tuesday at the Country Music Association headquarters that Young has donated $50,000 for the 3,200-square-foot facility’s renovations. The stand-alone building will host teaching and practice for student performers and technicians in the day, and at night it will become a performance venue for musicians, radio broadcasters, comedians and other entertainers. Young has funded an annual scholarship for recording industry students at the university since in 2016 and has donated the school a selection of his touring audio equipment.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: A county battered by Hurricane Harvey has earmarked $60 million to speed up flood protection projects in 105 damaged subdivisions outside mapped flood plains. The Houston Chronicle reports the Harris County Commissioners Court earmarked the funds Tuesday to help the Harris County Flood Control District complete the work in four years, not 5 1/ 2 years. The effort is part of 230 projects in the $2.5 billion flood bond program approved by voters last August – a year after Harvey. County Engineer John Blount says commissioners are spending local funds to design projects, rather than waiting on matching federal funds that will instead be used for construction. Harris County risks losing $37 million that might not be reimbursed.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: Brigham Young University has updated its honor code process following widespread student criticism that it lacks transparency and compassion. University officials announced the changes Wednesday that include following an “innocent until proven guilty” policy and allowing someone to accompany students in honor code meetings. Honor code office director Kevin Utt said the chances are meant to reduce anxiety and misunderstanding among students. The Utah university is owned by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and mandates students follow a code that prohibits premarital sex; the consumption of alcohol, coffee and tea; and beards and piercings, among other rules, to comply with the church’s health code. Students began an informal campaign earlier this year to reduce honor code punishments that ban activities common at other colleges.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: The state wants to increase the number of electric vehicles by more than 16 times by 2025. About 3,100 plug-in vehicles are currently registered in Vermont. The 2025 goal is 50,000. The push for electric vehicles is part of the state’s long-term goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Transportation accounts for about 45% of Vermont’s emissions. Republican Gov. Phil Scott says the current state budget contains $1.1 million to help low- and moderate-income Vermonters purchase or lease all-electric vehicles. Starting this month, at least half of the vehicles purchased for the state fleet must be plug-in electric. In two years that figure will increase to 75%. The current state transportation fund also contains money to increase the number of electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State transportation officials are asking the public for ideas on how to improve a heavily trafficked highway. Officials said Wednesday that the first round of public comments on a study to improve the Interstate 95 corridor will end Aug. 21. Officials are looking to identify key problems areas along I-95, which runs for 179 miles in Virginia, from Alexandria to the North Carolina border. State lawmakers have directed transportation officials to also study potential financing options for improving the highway. A similar directive recently led lawmakers to approve a regional fuel tax hike to pay for improvements to Interstate 81 in the western part of the state. Some lawmakers initially supported adding tolls to the highway. The public can submit comments at VA95Corridor.org.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympic National Park: For the second straight summer, mountain goats are flying. This week officials began rounding up the sure-footed but nonnative mammals from remote parts of the park, where humans introduced them in the 1920s, to relocate them to the Cascade Mountains, where they do belong. Animal capture specialists called “gunners” and “muggers” sedate the animals with darts or capture them in nets, blindfold them, pad their horns and fly them – on slings dangling from a helicopter – to a staging area. There, they’re looked over by veterinarians and outfitted with tracking collars before being trucked to the Cascades and once again flown by helicopter, this time into their new alpine habitats. Officials captured 17 Monday and Tuesday, including a kid about 6 weeks old, which got a ride on a mugger’s lap inside the helicopter instead of hanging beneath it.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nHolden: State wildlife officials are hoping to bring back the bobwhite quail. The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports the birds disappeared from the state in the late 1970s thanks to a combination of habitat destruction and two very harsh winters. Now wildlife officials say they are a good candidate for reintroduction at the Tomblin Wildlife Management Area, a 32,000-acre tract of former surface-mined land in Logan and Mingo counties that was acquired by the state Division of Natural Resources in 2015. The agency reintroduced elk to the area in 2016. Now it is working to make a suitable habitat for quail. The earliest the birds could arrive would be next spring. Even then, they will be kept off limits to hunters until a self-sustaining population is established.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: A man would receive $7.5 million from the city, under a resolution before the Common Council, after he was wrongly imprisoned for 24 years based on what he says was bogus bite-mark evidence. Robert Lee Stinson agreed to settle his claims against the city and one of its former police detectives for an initial payment of $3.5 million in August and $4 million in January. The settlement was reached during a jury trial over Stinson’s claims that detectives and dentists conspired to frame him in his neighbor’s homicide using the bite-mark evidence. Stinson was convicted in 1985 of killing Ione Cychosz of Milwaukee. He was freed in 2009 after the Wisconsin Innocence Project found experts who rejected the dentists’ conclusions that a bite mark on the victim was left by Stinson.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: After more than three years and $300 million, the Capitol is back open for business. State leaders cut a red ribbon in front of the 132-year-old building Wednesday. The ceremony capped a massive renovation to the sandstone landmark and nearby facilities including the Herschler Building, a state office complex. Afterward the building was opened up for people to take a look around inside. Gov. Mark Gordon told a crowd of a couple thousand that it’s good to be back in the Capitol, which he calls the “heartbeat of Wyoming.” Several state agencies and the offices of Wyoming’s top elected officials moved into temporary offices elsewhere in the city while the work took place. State lawmakers met for four legislative sessions in a rented office building in Cheyenne.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/12"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/07/20/corrections-clarifications-archive/30417315/", "title": "Corrections & Clarifications: Archive", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nTo report corrections and clarifications, contact Standards Editor Brent Jones:\n\nPlease indicate whether you're responding to content online or in the newspaper.\n\nThe following USA TODAY corrections and clarifications were published between October 2012 and December 2014 :\n\nDecember 2014\n\nNews: A Dec. 19 article on Fidel Castro misstated the year of the Cuban missile crisis.

Under Social Security, workers pay taxes into the program, and the money is disbursed as monthly income.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nBoth programs face an uncertain future. Though Social Security still has funding it can rely on, it may be depleted as soon as 2033, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\nAnd the Medicare Hospital Insurance Fund could have only enough money to pay full benefits until 2031.\n\nAs Johnson settles in as speaker, it's not clear whether he'll try to make cuts to these services or reform them, which would make it harder for some Americans to receive their benefits.\n\nWill Mike Johnson try to cut Social Security?\n\nJohnson hasn't publicly supported cuts to Social Security as House speaker. But the Louisiana Republican has called for the creation of a bipartisan commission to address America's trillions of dollars of debt.\n\nThe push comes after Johnson served as the chair of the conservative Republican Study Committee from 2019 to 2021. During his tenure, the committee released a budget plan that urged Congress to adopt changes for Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThe goal, according to the plan, was “long-term solvency” for the program. But it also included cuts to Medicare and Social Security.\n\nThat doesn't mean Johnson will target the benefits. As speaker, Johnson represents all House Republicans, from the most moderate to the most conservative.\n\nHis earlier views on Social Security and Medicare could take a back seat while he serves as leader. Johnson told reporters last month that, as speaker, he did not want to \"predetermine\" any policies.\n\n“I think it needs to be an organic decision process that is made by very thoughtful people who have a passion about the issue and have expertise in the subject matter,” he said.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare would not be specifically targeted in a future debt commission, but they could be addressed, according to a source from Johnson's office who described the issue as \"open to discussion,\" just like any other policy.\n\nSome of the reforms from Johnson's plan from 2020 included adjusting the retirement age until it reaches 69, which would apply to those turning 62 in 2030 and beyond. He has also supported legislation that would allow recipients to choose when they receive their benefits, among other measures.\n\nMost Americans balk at proposals that would cut Medicare or Social Security, according to a poll from the The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research this year. Seventy-nine percent say they oppose reducing the size of Social Security benefits, and 67% are against raising monthly premiums for Medicare.\n\nWhat about Medicare?\n\nThe new House speaker hasn't said he would single out Medicare as a method of turning around the national debt.\n\nBut the plan Johnson led from the Republican Study Committee called for providing \"premium support.\" That could mean Medicare enrollees would receive assistance from the federal government to simply offset the costs of their health insurance plans.\n\n\"Seniors could direct this payment to the Medicare plan of their choice offered on a regulated exchange that includes both private plans and traditional fee-for-service Medicare,” the 2020 plan reads.\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy floated a similar proposal for a commission to tackle the nation's debt, but Democrats were wary of the idea, and it never became a reality.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle have long viewed targeting Social Security, Medicare and other major benefits as a political mistake, alienating voters from coast to coast.\n\nContributing: Paul Davidson, USA TODAY; The Associated Press", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/03/11/congress-tiktok-ban-bill-donald-trump/72938017007/", "title": "Congress to vote on law targeting TikTok against Donald Trump's ...", "text": "WASHINGTON – Congress is moving ahead with plans to force TikTok’s parent company to sell the popular social media app or face a ban, despite opposition from former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe House vote to be held Wednesday is expected to pass with sizable bipartisan support, and President Joe Biden said on Friday that he would sign the legislation if it makes it to his desk.\n\nTikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, is based in Beijing. Members of the House’s Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party argue that it creates “an unacceptable risk to U.S. national security” by allowing the Chinese government to “surveil and influence the American public.”\n\nIf the bill passes, it won’t be for lack of trying on TikTok’s part. The company’s CEO is expected to meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill ahead of the vote, and TikTok pushed users to reach out to members last week, prompting a flood of messages that irked some lawmakers.\n\nIt’s a show of steadiness in a chamber often disrupted by Trump’s influence. House Speaker Mike Johnson supports the bill and says TikTok is \"actively undermining our economy and security.\" He told reporters Monday that he hasn’t talked to the former president about the legislation and still plans to bring it up for a vote on Wednesday.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nRep. Elise Stefanik, the fourth-highest ranking member of GOP leadership, said she still supports the bill and, when asked about Trump’s influence, said they’re focused on gauging the interest of House members.\n\nThe bill's future in the Senate is more uncertain. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hasn’t said whether he would bring it up for a vote and at least one senator – Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., – has said he would block speedy passage in the upper chamber.\n\n“In a free country you don’t take people’s companies,” Paul told USA TODAY. “I think it also violates the First Amendment rights of 180 million Americans who use it so I’m absolutely opposed to it.”\n\nThe leading Republican and Democrat on that committee introduced the legislation, that would make TikTok unavailable in app stores or web hosting services – effectively making it unavailable to U.S. users – unless it severs ties with ByteDance within 180 days.\n\nTikTok has said it now uses a separate, U.S.-based entity from ByteDance to store its American user data in response to lawmaker concerns.\n\nThe bipartisan bill has had a speedy rise. Introduced last Tuesday, it passed out of the House Energy and Commerce Committee with a unanimous 50-member vote on Thursday – a mark of cohesion that Stefanik noted when asked whether Trump will influence the vote. It’s set to be considered by the full House on Wednesday and will require a two-thirds majority vote to pass.\n\nTrump starts pulling strings on Capitol Hill\n\nTrump wields significant influence over Republicans in Congress and has successfully derailed policy fights before. Despite unsuccessfully attempting to ban the platform when he was president, Trump has come out against the House bill, raising concerns it would push users to Facebook instead.\n\n“If you get rid of TikTok, Facebook and Zuckerschmuck will double their business,” he wrote on Truth Social last week, referring to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. “I don’t want Facebook, who cheated in the last Election, doing better. They are a true Enemy of the People!”\n\nIn an interview with CNBC Monday, Trump added that he does believe TikTok is a national security threat, but that a lot of young people would “go crazy without it.”\n\nTrump met recently with Jeff Yass, a major GOP donor and a donor to the Trump-allied Club for Growth. Yass has a multibillion-dollar stake in TikTok, the Wall Street Journal reported last year. Former Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway is also reportedly advocating for TikTok on Capitol Hill on behalf of Club for Growth.\n\nBut Trump told CNBC that he and Yass did not discuss the platform during their meeting. “He never mentioned TikTok,” he said. A spokesperson for the Club for Growth did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nHouse Republicans stand by the bill despite Trump's opposition\n\nTrump’s apparent flip-flop on banning TikTok has raised eyebrows among House Republicans who are supporting the effort to strongarm ByteDance into selling the app.\n\nRep. Mike Garcia, R-Calif., told USA TODAY he doesn’t “understand the rationale,” behind Trump’s opposition and was concerned his influence could affect final support for the bill when it hits the House floor for a vote.\n\n“I don’t know who’s advising him,” Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Texas, said of Trump’s statements on TikTok, “I don’t agree with him on everything, I agree with him on most things but this isn’t one of them.”\n\n“Well he’s wrong,” Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, a co-sponsor of the bill, said. “He had his own executive orders and his own actions he was doing and now he’s suddenly flipped around on that.”\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said TikTok urging users to call lawmakers was “a tactical mistake” but that he’s still making up his mind: “I’m not a fan of the Communist Chinese but I’m a fan of the First Amendment, so I’m kind of torn.”\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has also come out against the legislation, saying it is a threat to First Amendment rights: “Just because the bill sponsors claim that banning TikTok isn’t about suppressing speech, there’s no denying that it would do just that,” senior policy counsel Jenna Leventoff said in a statement.\n\nHowever, Heritage Action, the advocacy arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation, came out in support of the bill and urged lawmakers to vote for it on Wednesday.\n\nAn unclear future in the Senate\n\nIf the bill does pass the House, it’s not clear it will be welcomed with open arms in the upper chamber.\n\nSen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who supports the House bill, said he “wouldn’t hold my breath” that the bill would come up for a vote on the Senate floor: “There’s a coalition of folks who are very much in favor of this but also an entrenched coalition of people who don’t want this.”\n\n“It’s a very good sign,” that it’s moving ahead in the House, said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee.\n\nSen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., called the app “toxic” and said he thinks the legislation will be successful.\n\nThe second-ranking Republican in the Senate, Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., said the app is a national security threat, “so I don’t have a problem with where the House is headed on this.”\n\nBut others said they’re concerned that the House bill could open up legal vulnerabilities by targeting a specific company, or other solutions could better tackle the issue.\n\n“My concern is that if you try to deal with this by name, you’re playing a game of Whack-a-mole,” Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. “Because what’s TikTok today will come up next week as TockTik or TicTack or whatever.”\n\nSenate Commerce Committee Chair Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., told Politico that she prefers another bill that would allow the Commerce Department to regulate TikTok and other foreign apps.\n\n“I'm glad they brought up a subject but we got to get a real solution,” Cantwell said. The House bill, “I don't think will make it all the way through.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/11"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/us/958410/john-fetterman-the-giant-who-could-lose-the-midterms-for-the-democrats", "title": "John Fetterman: the giant Democrat who upset the polls in ...", "text": "John Fetterman has defied the polls to hand the Democrats a crucial midterms victory in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\n\nFetterman’s win over celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz flipped the Republican-held Senate seat as the two parties battled for control of the chamber. The campaign had centred around Fetterman’s health after he suffered a stroke in May that “impacted his ability to speak and process the sound of others’ speech”, The Guardian��s Adam Gabbatt reported from Pittsburgh.\n\nOz had launched “needlessly cruel attacks” against his 6ft 8in-tall Democrat rival, said Jeremy Stahl at Slate.

While Oz fended off queries about his links to Pennsylvania after living in New Jersey for decades, Fetterman’s strategy centred on “searching for votes in ‘ruby red’ parts” of the state, said Richard Hall in The Independent.\n\nCampaigning on the slogan “Every County, Every Vote”, Fetterman narrowed the margins by “talking about those towns that the Democrat Party left behind”.\n\n‘Working-class persona’\n\nFetterman was born on 15 August 1969 in Pennsylvania, and was raised in the southern city of York by Republican-voting parents.\n\nDespite presenting a “working-class persona, shaped in part by his signature outfit of gym shorts and a hoodie, Fetterman grew up wealthy”, said The Philadelphia Inquirer. He told CNN in 2015 that he was born to then-teenage parents who were “extremely poor”, although his father went on to become a successful insurance executive.\n\nAfter graduating from high school, Fetterman got a bachelor’s degree at Albright College, also his father’s alma mater, and then did a master’s in business administration at the University of Connecticut.\n\nHe told CNN that he “sleepwalked” through his much of his early adulthood, until a friend was killed in a car accident while en route to pick him up in 1993. Fetterman later recalled that “I started to look at the world differently, and I wanted to give back”.\n\nHe had been “poised” to join the family insurance business, said The Philadelphia Inquirer, but instead moving to Pittsburgh to work for AmeriCorps, a federal agency dedicated to national service and volunteerism. He then attended Harvard University to get a master’s in public policy, before returning to Pittsburgh to set up a programme “helping kids get their GEDs (General Educational Development)” in the borough of Braddock, said CNN.\n\nFetterman made his first foray into politics came in 2005, after two of his students were shot and killed. He won his bid to become mayor of Braddock by one vote, before going on to win re-election “by comfortable margins” in 2009 and 2013, the news site reported.\n\nHis first run for Senate was in 2016. “Little-known and underfunded, he finished third in the Democratic primary,” said The Philadelphia Inquirer. But in 2018 he made a successful run for lieutenant governor, and “used the job, which comes with limited power, to advocate for marijuana legalisation and criminal justice reform”.\n\nA ‘progressive crusader’?\n\nFetterman is “unmistakable”, towering above his peers and sporting “a goatee and tattoos”, said Vox. He has also sought to stand out from his political rivals by billing himself “as a true progressive”.\n\nHis main issues, said Time, are “raising the minimum wage, legalising marijuana” and “expanding health care access”. In his only debate with Oz before the elections, Fetterman also vowed to “fight to re-establish” Roe v. Wade, adding that the “choice for abortion belongs with you and your doctor”.\n\nYet Fetterman didn’t run as a “progressive crusader or policy wonk”, the magazine continued. He is also “pro-policing, pro–community policing, pro–funding the police”. And despite having previously described fracking as an “environmental abomination”, he said during his Senate campaign that ensuring the “energy security” of the US had to take priority.\n\nFetterman also addressed questions about his health during his sole debate with his Republican rival, claiming that Oz “never let him forget” his stroke.\n\nBut while “it knocked me down”, Fetterman said, “I’m going to keep coming back up” in order to help “everyone in Pennsylvania that ever got knocked down that needs to get back up”.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Chas Newkey-Burden", "The Week Uk", "Harold Maass", "The Week Us", "Mark Gimein", "Rafi Schwartz", "Theunis Bates", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2022/11/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/28/who-is-mike-johnson-marjorie-taylor-greene/73109331007/", "title": "Who Is Mike Johnson? Why did Marjorie Taylor Greene push to oust ...", "text": "House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. is facing an ouster threat from his own party just five months into his tenure.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R- Ga., an ultraconservative lawmaker who has drawn criticism for promoting conspiracy theories, is leading the charge. Greene filed a motion to vacate against Johnson on Friday. It's a move that could boot him from his position, challenging his leadership after Johnson worked with Democrats to help pass a $1.2 trillion package to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nIf this all seems familiar, it’s because we’ve been here before. Just five months ago, a handful of conservative lawmakers voted with Democrats in the House to remove former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from his leadership post.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Mike Johnson, and where the push against his speakership could go next.\n\nWho is Mike Johnson?\n\nJohnson came to power on the heels of several failed votes to replace McCarthy last year. He ultimately secured the speakership because he was able to bring together right-wing lawmakers with more moderate members. The new speaker started in the House in 2017. He's currently serving his fourth term as the representative for Louisiana's fourth congressional district, which covers the Shreveport area.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nJohnson has strong conservative credentials. He opposes expanding abortion rights and has advocated for hardline immigration reforms. He also previously fought against expanding LGBTQ rights.\n\nHe has also worked as a constitutional lawyer and served in Louisiana's House of Representatives. He served on Trump’s defense team during both of his Senate impeachment trials.\n\nWhy is Marjorie Taylor Greene trying to oust Mike Johnson?\n\nWhile Greene often supported McCarthy, for her fellow conservatives, Johnson was originally seen as a welcome departure from the former speaker. Some viewed McCarthy as too moderate after he worked with Democrats to avoid a shutdown and raise the debt ceiling last year.\n\nBut Greene had warned Johnson from the beginning – she would move to oust him if he crossed certain lines.\n\nFor example, she warned Johnson that she would try to remove him if he tried to pass certain funding for Ukraine as it continues to fight off Russia's invasion.\n\nJohnson has yet to put that funding up for a vote, as his focus was on the months-long effort to fund the government. But with that out of the way, Johnson has said funding for Ukraine is one of his next priorities.\n\nCue Greene’s “warning” to Johnson that may put aid to Ukraine at risk.\n\nWhat comes next in the motion to oust Johnson?\n\nCongress is on a two-week spring recess, so the motion to vacate remains in limbo for now. Greene did not force the resolution to be taken up by the House prior to the recess, arguing that she was laying the groundwork for a vote after Congress returns to Washington.\n\nThere is no vote currently scheduled. And unlike the effort to remove McCarthy, the fight to oust Johnson faces a larger uphill battle.\n\nMany Republicans are simply not on board with the idea, still feeling the sting of the weeks-long, arduous process to elect a new speaker of the House that froze the lower chamber last year. The heavily-televised spectacle exposed deep divides within the Republican Party – something many in the GOP wish to avoid in the runup to the 2024 election.\n\nWithout the votes to move forward, Greene’s attempt to oust Johnson may languish in the halls of Congress.\n\nMelissa Cruz is an Election Reporting Fellow for USA TODAY focusing on voter access issues.

Those include provisions to seize Russian assets to distribute them to Ukraine and to force TikTok's Chinese parent company to sell it or face a practical ban in the United States.\n\nWhatever passes in the House will then be sent to the Senate to grapple with and where it's uncertain if the measure can find the votes to become law.\n\nOne thing is clear: The drone and missile attack – retaliation for an Israeli airstrike earlier this month on the Iranian embassy in Damascus – has been met with an outpouring of messages of support for Israel from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle.\n\nThe new four-bill approach discussed in a closed-door meeting of House Republicans at the U.S. Capitol on Monday afternoon in the wake of that attack allows the conference's fractured membership to vote in favor of funding for Israel without simultaneously approving funding for Ukraine.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIt also introduces new uncertainty for the path forward for the aid package – the funding for Israel has until now been connected to another $60 billion in aid to Ukraine and $5 billion for Taiwan as part of the national security supplemental.\n\nThe White House and Democrats on both ends of Capitol Hill have been urging the Republican-led House to pass that package as-is, despite a vocal faction on the left that has raised concerns about sending additional aid to Israel amid the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Monday that President Joe Biden still opposes a standalone Israel aid bill. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said Monday he’ll “take a look at it,” and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., told reporters he would hold off on judgment \"until we understand the substance.\"\n\nAlong with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and a handful of moderate Republicans in the Senate, the Biden administration and its supporters in Congress maintain the dual approach remains the fastest way to get much-needed aid to both allies.\n\nHowever, House Republicans remain divided over Ukraine aid, which former President Donald Trump has expressed skepticism over. Around one third of the GOP conference is staunchly against more Ukraine funding, though supporters of the package say there would be enough votes between both parties to pass it if it reached the floor.\n\nThe stakes are high for House Speaker Mike Johnson, who has the power to put the bill up for a vote whenever he pleases but risks losing his job if he does so.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has argued Johnson has failed the GOP conference and threatened to attempt to remove him from the speaker’s office if he tries to pass Ukraine aid. Greene left the closed-door conference meeting Monday afternoon frustrated with Johnson's plan, calling it a \"scam\" and the \"wrong direction.\" The conservative firebrand though did not commit to when she would call up her vote to remove Johnson.\n\nBut the new approach seems to be well-received by key conservatives in the House: House Freedom Caucus member Rep. Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., told reporters on Monday he supported the plan, and Republican Study Committee Chair Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., said Johnson is doing \"the right thing.\"\n\nWhile conservatives have often used procedural tactics to freeze the House in protest of leadership, they're signaling they will allow Johnson's plan to hit the floor for a vote. Rep. Ralph Norman, R-S.C., a hardliner who sits on the House Rules Committee, said he wouldn't stop foreign aid from coming to the floor, saying lawmakers \"deserve\" to vote on it.\n\nHow the plan came together in the House\n\nJohnson had been signaling for weeks that the House would advance legislation to support Ukraine, and on Sunday told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that the House will \"try again this week\" to pass Israel funding. But in both instances, he would not say whether the House would consider the $95 billion Senate-passed supplemental.\n\nRepublicans also said they were discussing a vote on each tranche of aid separately, rather than as a package, or a vote only on Israel funding, which has strong support among House Republicans.\n\nBut the House has tried and failed to do so twice before: The first attempt in November passed the House but has stalled in the Democratic-controlled Senate because the bill includes funding cuts to the IRS. Johnson’s decision to move an Israel aid bill with spending offsets drew condemnation from Democrats and even some Republicans who said the IRS cuts have impeded congressional action on Israel.\n\nThe second attempt, a “clean” bill without any funding cuts, in February failed in the House over bipartisan concerns it would take away leverage to pass Ukraine aid.\n\nThat second attempt noticeably garnered more support from 46 centrist and pro-Israel House Democrats, who supported the legislation begrudgingly while lambasting House Republican leadership for not putting the Senate package on the floor.\n\nThe House is slated to vote on a swath of legislation aimed at sanctioning Iran and reiterating U.S. support for Israel in the wake of Iran’s attack. With Israel once again on top of minds, it’s possible another crack at a clean Israel aid bill would draw more Democratic support and pass, but such a move could endanger aid to Kyiv if Congress decides to move on it as a standalone issue.\n\nHouse Foreign Affairs Chair Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, who supports Ukraine funding, said on CBS Sunday that he has “a commitment” from Johnson that he will put it up for a vote, and House Intelligence Committee Chair Rep. Mike Turner, R-Ohio, told NBC that he expects a Ukraine aid vote this week.\n\nWhile Johnson mulled over his options under intense pressure to pass Ukraine funding, lawmakers from both sides of the aisle were attempting to sidestep Republican leaders and instead muscle Ukraine aid to the floor themselves.\n\nHouse Democrats have largely rallied behind an archaic procedure called a discharge petition that would force the lower chamber to vote on the Senate’s supplemental package. The petition currently has more than 190 signatures and requires 218 to call a vote on the floor.\n\nIt’s unclear though if the Democratic effort can succeed. A number of progressive lawmakers critical of how Israel has approached its war in Gaza likely won’t sign on to the discharge petition. Democrats would need tens of Republicans to join them and it’s uncertain how many GOP lawmakers would be willing to effectively sidestep Johnson.\n\nShifting attitudes among Democrats\n\nThe attack also comes as support for Israel has been shifting among Democrats.\n\nFrustration inside the left wing of the party has been slowly seeping into the mainstream as Israel’s bombing campaign in pursuit of Hamas has killed more than 33,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Aid organizations estimate around half of the population is starving as supplies have struggled to get through Israeli aid restrictions and bombing.\n\nSchumer — the highest-ranking Jewish official in American history — called for Israel to hold new elections to replace Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in part because “he has been too willing to tolerate the civilian toll in Gaza, which is pushing support for Israel worldwide to historic lows.”\n\nThat sentiment seemed to hit a turning point in recent weeks after seven aid workers — including one American — with World Central Kitchen were killed in an Israeli military strike as they attempted to deliver aid to Gaza. Netanyahu also refused to back down from a planned attack on Rafah, the southern Gaza city where more than 1 million displaced Palestinians are living.\n\nThis prompted calls for new strings attached to aid to Israel. Forty Democrats, including Biden ally and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., sent a letter to the Biden administration urging it to withhold offensive weapons transfers to Israel.\n\nBut that’s unlikely to halt Democratic support for the Israel and Ukraine funding currently in front of the House, which passed the Senate with 70 votes.\n\nSchumer on Monday called for swift passage of the funding, emphasizing the threats to Israel “on all sides.”\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., a close Biden ally, Israel advocate and member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told CNN after the World Central Kitchen strike: “I think we’re at that point” that the U.S. should pursue a change in policy toward Israel.\n\nBut Coons clarified to USA TODAY last week that his comments represented a \"fairly narrow and precise concern\" about Israel's recent efforts in Gaza and \"should not be misunderstood as being unwilling to support funding for Israeli defense.”\n\n“I will strongly defend Israel against any attacks from Iran, from Hezbollah, from other Iranian proxies,\" Coons said.\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/12/is-non-citizen-voting-law-backed-by-trump-johnson-really-necessary/73299529007/", "title": "Trump, Speaker Mike Johnson talk about non-citizen voting. Experts ...", "text": "Former President Donald Trump and House Speaker Mike Johnson on Friday gathered at Mar-a-Lago to conflate a pair of conservative hot-button issues: border security and election security.\n\nJohnson announced the GOP caucus in the U.S. House will present legislation requiring every person registering to vote to show proof of citizenship. It will also require states to remove ineligible voters from their rolls and databases.\n\n\"Everywhere we go one of the first issues people ask about is this issue of election integrity. The border is the number one issue in America,\" Johnson said in front of Trump's Palm Beach mansion and resort. \"Election integrity is tied to the lack of border security.\"\n\nThe announcement, however, clashed with the assessments of voting specialists, including one formerly hired by Trump four years ago. It was criticized by immigration advocates as further demonizing immigrants in the United States.\n\nA national elections expert said the allegations, accusations and claims of massive election fraud by people who are not citizens of the United States have long been debunked.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\n\"We're talking about something that is almost a statistically zero problem,\" said David Becker, executive director of the Center for Election Innovation & Research.\n\nNonetheless, Johnson stated his belief that there are \"so many millions of illegals in the country\" that if only one in every hundred cast a ballot it would amount to hundreds of thousands of votes.\n\n\"That could turn an election,\" he said, adding, \"We will do everything within our power to insure that we do have free and fair elections in this country.\"\n\nAs for Trump on Friday, he did not address the proposed GOP legislation. But he again decried what he said was the Biden administration's \"disastrous\" border policy.\n\n\"As a citizen I demand the border has to be closed,\" he said. \"Our country can't take it.\"\n\nTrump again stated that he believes the number of immigrants that have entered the United States under the Biden administration, reported to be more than three million, is well into the eight figures.\n\n\"They are coming from all over the world,\" Trump again said. \"Our country is like a dumping ground.\"\n\nElections expert: Voting by non-citizens a near 'zero problem'\n\nBecker noted Georgia officials performed an audit of ballots cast in the 2022 midterm election and \"found a grand total of zero votes\" cast by non-citizens. And in the billions of ballots studied by the Heritage Foundation in the past 45 years, the total number of such instances found amounted to a few dozen cases, Becker said.\n\nIt's not a problem, he said, largely because of the Help America Vote Act of 2002 signed into law by then-President George W. Bush.\n\nThe 22-year-old law, a response to the 2000 elections, ended punch card voting systems, which contributed to the debacle in Florida balloting, and other measures. And, Becker explained, the law created a voter registration process and reaffirmed it is a serious violation of federal law to vote illegally.\n\n\"It was a big bill, it was bipartisan and W signed it,\" Becker said.\n\nThe law requires a prospective voter to provide a driver's license or Social Security number when registering to vote, he said, and those numbers are crossed-check against department of motor vehicle records to see what document was used to ascertain residency, either a U.S. passport or birth certificate, or an immigration visa or permanent residency card.\n\n\"If DMV has evidence you're not a citizen, you're not going to get registered,\" he said. \"It very clearly requires a driver license number or Social Security number to register. And if you don't provide either, you have to show photo ID when you show up to vote. It's basically ID to register.\"\n\nBecker also doubted the motivation of a non-U.S. citizen, who likely endured significant hardship to enter the United States, to risk it all by casting an illegal ballot.\n\n\"If you illegally registered to vote, or voted illegally, you are putting a big bull's eye on yourself. You will be discovered, you will be prosecuted and you will be deported,\" he said. \"Why would anyone do that? It just doesn't happen, hardly at all, for that very easy-to-understand reason.\"\n\nTrump has made election fraud claims for years. Hasn't backed them up in court\n\nIt's not the first time Trump has raised the specter of non-citizen voting. After he lost the popular vote to Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election, Trump tweeted: \"I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally.\"\n\nAfter taking office, Trump ordered the creation of a commission to investigate the claim of illegally cast votes. But the panel, led by Vice President Mike Pence and Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, disbanded shortly after, not having found evidence of fraud.\n\nAt the time, Trump and those supporting his claims partly pointed to a report from the Pew Center to back up their assertions. But the CEIR's Becker said he intimately knows why the Pew center report did not support Trump's argument.\n\n\"The problem with that is I wrote that Pew report,\" Becker said. \"That Pew report did not say anything about voter fraud at all. It was about how hard it is to keep voter lists accurate as people move.\"\n\nFour years alter, Trump wildly expanded his baseless claim of election fraud alleging in a tweet that \"Massive FRAUD took place with machines, people voting from out of state, illegals, dead people, no signatures — and so much more!\"\n\nTo this day, said Becker, who has monitored every 2020 election audit and court challenge, Team Trump refuses to offer evidence of voter fraud for cross-examination and review in the judicial system.\n\n\"They have put forth the evidence,\" he said. \"Every single time they back down.\"\n\nFraud investigator: Trump should pursue 'foundational, seismic' changes\n\nKen Block, who investigated claims of election fraud for the Trump campaign in 2020, said the announcement was a \"big miss\" for the 2024 GOP presumptive presidential candidate.\n\nBlock said his experience trying to confirm incidents of alleged voter fraud for Trump four years ago, including accusations of non-citizen voting, is that disproving the citizenship status of voters would require a massive investment in a database and other procedures.\n\nA more fruitful pursuit, he said, would be to standardize state laws. For example, states should provide information on who cast an in-person vote. And that should be done within the timetable a candidate has to challenge the results before an election is certified. Block also said a third of states allow an early vote by a citizen who dies before Election Day to be counted, while a third don't and another third don't even address the issue.\n\n\"There are a lot of things that we should be fixing in terms of our elections.\" said Block, who documented his work for Trump in 2020 in a book titled \"Disproven.\"\n\nAn even more \"foundational and seismic\" proposal, he said, would be for Trump to call for an end to gerrymandering of elections with skewed and patently unfair districts.\n\n\"If you're interested in free and transparent and fair elections, how can you have any of that when partisan elected officials can draw a map that screws their opposition?\" he said. \"That's tin pot democracy. That's not something the world's foremost democracy should have as a foundational element, but we do.\"\n\nImmigration advocates braced for more demonizing of immigrants for political advantage\n\nImmigration advocates said they were braced for another onslaught of ugly and incendiary rhetoric. The announcement followed Trump's recent escalation of border security rhetoric, in which he has repeatedly said people entering the country are coming from insane asylums and prisons. He has highlighted sporadic incidents such as cases in Georgia and Michigan where an undocumented immigrant has been charged with murder by local law enforcement officials.\n\nThis time, America's Voice research director Zachary Mueller said he expected an elections version of \"replacement theory,\" a white nationalist, far-right conspiracy theory that states immigrants and non-white people are being lured to the country to change the racial and ethnic mix of America at the expense of the white majority.\n\n\"That is what they are getting at with this language around trying to quote unquote ban non-citizen voting at the federal level,\" Mueller said. \"There isn't a nefarious conspiracy happening here but in fact this is a solution in search of a problem.\"\n\nMueller added that the more sinister effort is the one to undermine faith in the U.S. electoral system by whipping up immigration fear-mongering.\n\n\"They're leading people towards not only the great replacement but as well the kind of feeding of the election deniers that we saw end in a violent assault on the Capitol on Jan. 6,\" Mueller said. \"They continue to lay that groundwork ahead of the November election and it's extremely concerning to us.\"\n\nTo that end, Mueller said Johnson's willingness to \"lend\" Trump the credibility of Congress \"with the fig leaf of legislation\" further will erode public confidence in the country's governmental institutions and beyond.\n\n\"This isn't just about immigrants, or hate, or vitriol or demonization to immigrant communities,\" he said. \"What he is doing is taking immigrants as a vehicle to socialize a justification for undermining our democracy.\"\n\nAntonio Fins is a politics and business editor at The Palm Beach Post, part of the USA TODAY Florida Network.

In Congress, you have one or two things that pass every two years, whereas most of the consistent stuff is at the state level,” said Abhi Rahman, communications director for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nBecause of that difference, Democrats and Republicans alike are paying extra attention to Tuesday's down-ballot elections.\n\n“If you want to really affect policy change, you have to be able to win elections where the most policy gets done,” Rahman said.\n\nHere are some of the issues where voters are looking to their state and local governments, instead of national officials, to make change:\n\nProtecting abortion rights\n\nSince the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that made abortion legal nationwide, President Joe Biden has called on congressional lawmakers to protect abortion rights. But he has also acknowledged there isn't enough support in Congress to make the move.\n\nThat’s why activists are pushing for abortion rights to be enshrined on the state level, particularly in states where strict bans now exist.\n\nMultiple national polls show that support for abortion rights has increased since the Supreme Court blocked Roe v. Wade. And so far, voters in six states – California, Michigan, Vermont, Kansas, Kentucky and Montana – have either passed measures to protect abortion access or rejected efforts to restrict it.\n\nThis week, the eyes of the nation turned to Ohio, where voters considered a ballot measure known as Issue 1 to enshrine abortion rights in the state's constitution through viability, typically around 24 weeks gestation.\n\nNext year, voters in Maryland and New York will vote on amendments to their state constitutions that could strengthen access to abortion. And advocates from Arizona to Florida are also pushing to put similar measures on their ballots, eyeing Ohio as a blueprint.\n\nBut ballot measures aren’t the only factor driving the national abortion debate. State candidates have also centered their campaigns around the issue.\n\nFor example. in Virginia, Republican officials support Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s proposal for a 15-week abortion ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and severe medical emergencies, while Democrats have rallied against it.\n\nIn Kentucky, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear and his opponent, Republican Daniel Cameron, have clashed over exceptions to abortion bans against the backdrop of the state’s law. In the Bluegrass State, officials have completely banned the procedure, except in cases where a pregnant person’s health is at risk.\n\nStates pass slew of education bills, while Congress stalls\n\nEducation became a high-profile campaign issue after COVID-19 pandemic-related school closures and curriculum “culture wars.”\n\nRepublicans in particular have capitalized on the issue, making it a cornerstone campaign message.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is also running for the Republican presidential nomination, signed his state's Parental Rights in Education Act into law last year. Florida officials later expanded the act, dubbed “Don’t Say Gay” by critics, to bar instruction of gender identity or sexual orientation in grades K-12.\n\nA handful of copycats have since passed elsewhere, including in Ohio and Alabama. Nearly half of all states introduced some version of so-called \"parents’ rights\" legislation this year alone, according to the Georgetown University think tank FutureEd.\n\nVoters in Virginia have signaled they’re thinking about education as they head to the polls this year. The state has been a hotbed for the issue since Youngkin capitalized on parents’ frustration during his successful 2021 gubernatorial campaign.\n\nAt the federal level, the Republican-led House tried to pass their own parental rights in education law earlier this year. The bill promised to give parents across the country full insight into schools’ curriculum, spending and any violent activities on campus.\n\nBut the same criticism the laws have faced at the local level has emerged in Congress. Critics accuse the legislation of being a guise for racist or homophobic beliefs, designed to limit which perspectives or versions of history are taught in classrooms.\n\nAfter passing the lower chamber in a party-line vote, the parents’ bill of rights has been stuck on the Senate side, where the legislation faces an uphill battle against a Democratic majority.\n\nCOVID-19, marijuana and other issues drive voters to the polls\n\nOther issues driving voters to the polls include COVID-19, the legalization of marijuana, voting procedures and slavery.\n\nVoters weighed in on two ballot measures in Arizona and California centered around COVID-19-related regulations. The Arizona amendment was focused on limiting emergency powers for the state's governor, while the California amendment is designed to create a state Pandemic Early Detection and Prevention Institute.\n\nQuestions around the use and sale of marijuana − which has long appeared on ballots − are making another round in this year and next year’s elections.\n\nThis week, voters in Ohio weighed in on whether to legalize the recreational or personal use of marijuana in the Buckeye State. Several states, including Nebraska, South Dakota and Florida, are taking steps to include similar measures on the ballot next year.\n\nSince the 2020 presidential election, voting policies have also spurred nationwide interest. Ranked choice voting, in which voters rank candidates by preference on ballots, and candidates with a majority of the votes win, will be up for debate in 2024 in both Oregon and Nevada.\n\nAnd anti-slavery measures will also play a role in future elections. Though Congress ratified the 13th Amendment to the Constitution and abolished slavery in 1865, it is still legal in some states to work without pay as \"a punishment for crime\" because of a loophole clause.\n\nLast year, measures to eliminate the exception appeared in five states, and four of them approved it. Next year in Nevada, voters will decide whether to remove slavery as a punishment for a crime from their constitution.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/11/08"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/us/952728/joe-biden-how-do-you-solve-a-problem-us-mexican-border", "title": "How can Joe Biden solve the US-Mexican border problem? | The ...", "text": "Joe Biden has U-turned on his decision to stick with a Donald Trump-era annual cap on refugees admitted to the US, after facing a backlash from angry Democrats.\n\nAnnouncing that the number of refugees allowed to enter the country each year will increase from 15,000 to 62,500, the president argued that the “historically low number” set by his predecessor “did not reflect America’s values”.\n\nBiden also pledged to seek to raise the figure further to 125,000 - fuelling accusations from Republicans that the Democrat leader is “caving to the demands of liberal activists”, The Washington Post reports.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

As The Telegraph notes, he “campaigned on promises to break from his predecessor's hard-line immigration policies”.\n\nRepeating that pledge in February, Biden “promised to turn the page” on Trump’s “anti-immigrant policies”. But after that initial announcement, the president and his aides “went quiet in public for two months as he refused to officially sign-off on a new policy”, The Washington Post says.\n\nThe radio silence alarmed “human rights advocates and fellow Democrats”, the paper adds, while the border surge “prompted strong criticism from both Democratic and Republican elected officials”.\n\nJoint polling by the paper and ABC News shows that US voters are concerned about Biden’s handling of the situation. However, this week’s announcement that the cap of refugees will be raised was “quickly welcomed by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee”, which is controlled by the Democrats.\n\nCommittee chair Senator Bob Menendez tweeted that he “welcomes the Biden administration’s announcement that it will increase the number of refugees allowed to be resettled in the United States”, adding: “This is an important step in continuing our proud, bipartisan tradition of providing refugees protection through resettlement.”\n\nHowever, Republican Senator Tom Cotton immediately “made clear that Republicans intended to seize on Biden’s immigration agenda to galvanise the party’s base” ahead of next year’s midterm vote, The New York Times says.\n\n“Increasing the refugee admissions cap will put American jobs and safety at risk,” Cotton tweeted. “The Biden administration should be focused on getting Americans back to work.”\n\nPerennial problem\n\nHaving served as a senator for over half a century, Biden is all too aware of the perennial challenges caused by his country’s porous southern border with Mexico.\n\nIn a statement released on Monday announcing the new refugee admissions cap, Biden said that it was “important to take this action today to remove any lingering doubt in the minds of refugees around the world who have suffered so much, and who are anxiously waiting for their new lives to begin”.\n\n“We are working quickly to undo the damage of the last four years. It will take some time, but that work is already under way,” he added.\n\nA group of migrants cross the Rio Bravo from Ciudad Juarez in Mexico into El Paso (Image credit: Herika Martinez/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nHaving pledged to resign Trump’s border policy to the annals of history, Biden’s “flip-flopping” over exact figures came amid “concern over bad optics” following the migrant surge, but provoked “the ire of refugee advocates and some Democratic lawmakers”, Reuters reports.\n\nProgressive Democrats to the left of his party are calling for policies that are “out of step with wider American opinion” and “championing impractical demands” such as an end to all deportations, The Economist says. But Biden can only deliver on his legislative agenda if he “avoids a confrontation with progressives, whose support he needs”, the paper adds.\n\nOn the other hand, losing control of Congress next year would also leave him in a legislative bind. The president’s critics have “seized on the issue as a political weapon”, using it to accuse Biden of “making poor policy choices that opened the floodgates to illegal immigration during a pandemic”, the NYT reports.\n\nThe White House held a call with refugee organisations on Monday in an effort to “repair frayed relations” amid ongoing anger over the administration’s previous silence, The Washington Post adds.\n\nBut as an experienced political operator, Biden will be conscious that he cannot afford to fray relations too far with the voters who can help him maintain control of Congress in next year’s all-important election.", "authors": ["The Week Staff", "Last Updated", "Harold Maass", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Rafi Schwartz", "Joel Mathis", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2021/05/04"}, {"url": "https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/politics/959664/the-race-to-replace-jens-stoltenburg-as-nato-chief", "title": "The race to replace Jens Stoltenberg as Nato chief | The Week", "text": "The tenure of Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, is set to end this September, and rumours of possible successors are swirling.\n\nStoltenberg, who served as prime minister of Norway from 2000 to 2001, and again from 2005 until 2013, has held the key post for almost nine years.\n\nHe was due to step down last autumn, but was kept on as leader for an extra year following the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nSubscribe to The Week Escape your echo chamber.

However, the voices of the four most powerful economies – the US, Germany, France and the UK – “exercise inordinate influence, even if they don’t always claim the coveted position for themselves”, said Foreign Policy.\n\nWhoever is chosen, they will be taking on the role at a crucial time. “The Russian war against Ukraine has given Nato a renewed sense of its vital role in the defence of Europe”, said The New York Times.\n\nWho is up for the top job?\n\nFew names have been officially thrown in the ring, but the list of rumoured contenders is long and varied.\n\nIt is custom that the US does not put its own candidate forward, because an American general traditionally takes the high-ranking role of Supreme Allied Commander Europe in the organisation.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox A free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors\n\nHowever, the US does carry a lot of sway in the decision.\n\nUS officials familiar with the debate told The New York Times that Chrystia Freeland, the deputy prime minister and finance minister of Canada, is seen as a promising choice in Washington. Freeland is Canadian-Ukrainian, and has a strong stance on the conflict. She would also be the first woman to hold the job.\n\nThere is a concern, however, “that her Ukrainian grandfather, a grateful immigrant to Canada, was as a younger man involved with a Ukrainian nationalist movement that saw the Nazis as useful foils to counter the Soviets”. This could play into Russian hands.\n\nThe name of Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has also been proffered as a promising option, said Politico. Asked about the speculation, however, Rutte said he wanted to “leave politics altogether and do something completely different”.\n\nEstonia’s Prime Minister, Kaja Kallas, is “a worthy challenger” for the job, said Politico. Estonia, unlike Canada, spends at least 2% of its GDP on defence, which is a stated goal for member nations of Nato. However, Kallas “is seen as staunchly anti-Putin and has advocated against negotiating with him”, so her selection could be seen as an aggressive move.\n\nA Baltic leader for Nato is in general viewed by some as a logical choice in the context of the Ukrainian conflict. Some Western capitals, however, would not support the move, said Politico, viewing it as “too hawkish when war is raging next door”.\n\nLithuanian Prime Minister Ingrida Šimonytė, Slovakia’s President Zuzana Čaputová and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen of Germany are other names that get thrown around, a European diplomat told Politico.\n\nCould it be someone from the UK?\n\nThe UK’s defence secretary Ben Wallace has also been tipped repeatedly for the job.\n\nAsked last year if he would be interested in succeeding Stoltenberg, Wallace “admitted it would be ‘a nice job’ but added that he ‘loved’ his role as defence secretary”, reports the Daily Mail.\n\nWallace is “popular” among Tory members and has not ruled out a bid for party leader in the future, though he twice declined to run last year.\n\nWallace or not, this is a job “London dearly wants as another symbol of its post-Brexit engagement in the world”, said The New York Times.\n\nBoris Johnson, as well as his predecessors Theresa May and David Cameron, has also been touted for the Nato top job.\n\nBut given his past diplomatic gaffes, “it’s hard to imagine a role that Boris Johnson would be less well suited for than that of Nato secretary general,” said The New Statesman.\n\nWill Stoltenberg definitely step down?\n\nMany in the diplomatic community still feel another extension of Stoltenberg’s term is one of the most likely options, said VOA News.\n\nThis weekend, though, Nato spokesperson Oana Lungescu appeared to shut down rumours: “The mandate of Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has been extended three times and he has served for a total of almost nine years. The secretary general’s term comes to an end in October of this year and he has no intention to seek another extension of his mandate.”\n\nThe “overall feeling”, one senior Nato diplomat told Politico, is that it is “time for fresh air”.\n\nBut the allies may end up “playing it safe after all, and sticking with Stoltenberg”, the magazine reports.", "authors": ["Asya Likhtman", "Harold Maass", "The Week Us", "Peter Weber", "Sorcha Bradley", "The Week Uk", "Social Links Navigation"], "publish_date": "2023/02/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2023/11/13/gaza-israel-hamas-palestine-government-shutdown-donald-trump-taylor-swift/71565403007/", "title": "Israel-Hamas war, government shutdown, Trump New York trial ...", "text": "United Nations officials have urged immediate international action to end the attacks on Gaza hospitals.

The dances are: Ainu traditional dance (Hokkaido), Ryukyu Eisa (Okinawa Prefecture), Nishimonai Bon Odori (Akita Prefecture) and Gujo Odori (Gifu Prefecture).\n\nThe ceremony will then shift to the passing of the baton to Paris for the 2024 Games.\n\n--Chris Bumbaca\n\nWhere is everyone?\n\nCOVID restrictions forced a bulk of Games participants to leave Tokyo prior to the closing ceremony, but a surprising number stuck around and are at Olympic Stadium tonight. They’ve filled up about 80 percent (rough estimate) of the infield and brought their countries’ flags with them, plus a party spirit, for sure.\n\nThe Olympic cauldron continues burning off to the side.\n\n--Chris Bumbaca\n\nParade of athletes\n\nA fun combination of classical music with a modern-day feel has the athletes in a good mood as they congregate on the turf. All of them have their cell phones out to take video and snap pictures with their friends from their own country and abroad. The U.S. women’s volleyball team is here showing off their gold medals. And yes, some athletes are shirtless.\n\n--Chris Bumbaca\n\nEntrance of Japan’s flag\n\nThe national flag of Japan will be carried into the stadium by six people – four athletes, one person with an impairment and one healthcare worker. This format was also used during the opening ceremony.\n\nAs the flag is raised, the host country’s national anthem will be performed by the Takarazuka Revue – a theatre troupe that has been in existence for more than 100 years. It is one the few groups in the world with an all-female cast. They will be wearing a green hakama, a traditional Japanese garment.\n\nThirty-eight Japanese self-defense officials will participate in the flag-raising and anthem portion of the ceremony.\n\n--Chris Bumbaca\n\nAfter the Games\n\nTo celebrate the accomplishments of the athletes that participated in the Tokyo Olympics, they will play a central role in the Closing Ceremony.\n\nAfter the flag-bearers from each National Olympic Committee enter the Olympic Stadium, the athletes will follow them in random order and walk onto the field from all four gates. Assistant cast members will raise each nations’ flags once the athletes have entered.\n\nAccording to event organizers, the concept of having the athletes walk en masse out onto the field was brought about by John Ian Wing, an apprentice carpenter in Australia for the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. Prior to then, athletes marched behind their flag-bearer as they do at the Opening Ceremony.\n\nThen, particles of light will arrange to form the Olympic rings at the center of the field. In the lead up to their formation, those beads of light will gather in the stadium. Event organizers said they represent both the athletes and all the Olympics viewers watching from home over the past two weeks.\n\n--Chris Bumbaca\n\nUsing stadium effects, the field will look like a grassy space to resemble a Sunday in a Tokyo park, emphasizing the relaxation theme.\n\nMusic will begin to play and various performers, among them pop singer Kyu Sakamoto and the Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra, will enter the athlete area.\n\n--Chris Bumbaca\n\nNotable closing ceremony flag-bearers\n\nAs is Olympic ceremony tradition, the procession of countries goes in the alphabetical order of the host country’s alphabet.\n\nHowever, the host country marches last. And the upcoming Games hosts will march right before them. Therefore, Japan will march last and France will be the penultimate country since they are hosting the 2024 Summer Games in Paris.\n\nWith Los Angeles hosting four years later, the United States will march third-to-last. The American flag-bearer is javelin thrower Kara Winger, who competed in her fourth Olympics in Tokyo.\n\nFrance’s flag will be carried by karate gold-medalist Steven da Costa; the 23-year-old won the men’s kumite -67kg championship on Thursday.\n\nAnother karateka, Ryo Kiyuna – the men’s kata champion – will be Japan’s flag-bearer.\n\n--Chris Bumbaca\n\nHow ceremony will start\n\nAccording to organizers, the goal of the closing ceremony is to create a relaxed feel for participants and viewers at home after a more stressful-than-usual Olympics – all while looking toward the future.\n\nA theme of “The Worlds We Share” will embrace “a more diverse future.” A video will recap the 17 days of competition and a fireworks display – 130 shots to be exact – will follow.\n\nThen Crown Prince Akishino and International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach will take their places in the official stand.\n\n--Chris Bumbaca\n\nTeam USA dominates medal count thanks to strong showing by women\n\nTOKYO — The American women had been trendy toward leading the medal count. In the Tokyo Olympics, they hit the accelerator.\n\nThe U.S. women finished these Games with 66 medals to lead the team. They also helped the U.S. finish first in the overall medal count with 113 to China's 88, including 39 golds to 38 for China.\n\nThe American women delivered some of the memorable and iconic moments of the Olympics. The basketball team claimed its seventh consecutive gold, beating Japan on Sunday, while the water polo team won its third gold in a row and the volleyball team won its first.\n\n-- Rachel Axon\n\nLooking ahead to 2024: Parisian landmarks to play starring role\n\nTOKYO — Beach volleyball at the Eiffel Tower. Skateboarding at the Place de la Concorde. Equestrian at the Château de Versailles.\n\nIn three years’ time, the Olympic Games will find themselves amid some of the most iconic Parisian landmarks. Tokyo organizers will pass the torch to Paris 2024 at the closing ceremony here on Sunday, and the French hosts offered a glimpse of what their Games could be.\n\nParis organizers will mark the handoff by unfurling the world’s largest flag atop the Eiffel Tower during the ceremony here. Led by French athletes and undisclosed special guests, the handoff will mark Paris taking over as host of the Summer Olympics once these Games close.\n\nThe city last hosted in 1924, and it received these Olympics in 2017 as part of a double award with Los Angeles, which will host in 2028.\n\n-- Rachel Axon\n\n2024 Paris Olympics: Breakdancing in, baseball, softball, karate out\n\nSkateboarding, sport climbing and surfing made their debuts at the Tokyo Olympics. All three will return for the Paris Games in 2024, which will also add breakdancing, or breaking, for its Olympic debut. The event will feature men's and women's competitions with head-to-head matchups in which judges determine the winners.\n\nThose sports are easy to pick up and have active communities on social media, Paris 2024 noted.\n\nSome of the sports added for the Tokyo Games – baseball/softball and karate – are gone for now.\n\nIOC rules now allow host cities to add sports to their program, so karate made sense in the country it originated. Baseball and softball, which have strong followings here, did too.\n\nBut they’re less of a fit in 2024 and won’t be contested then.\n\n-- Rachel Axon\n\nSome athletes will quarantine for 2 weeks after Olympics\n\nTOKYO — By the time their Games are done, Tokyo Olympians will have spent years training and weeks here while they compete.\n\nFor some athletes, getting home from the Olympics might come with a longer time commitment – in quarantine.\n\nDepending on the regulations in their home countries, some Olympians face days or even weeks in isolation when they return from Tokyo. While many countries don’t require a quarantine or allow travelers to avoid it with vaccination, testing or both, some require isolation regardless of vaccination status.\n\nTake Australia and New Zealand. The two island nations have fared better than almost any large countries. Athletes from both will quarantine for two weeks upon return.\n\n-- Rachel Axon", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/08/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/03/sport/paris-olympics-lasers-france-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Paris Olympics: French government orders laser weapon prototype ...", "text": "Paris, France CNN —\n\nBeach volleyball against the backdrop of the Eiffel Tower, equestrian disciplines in the magnificent Versailles Palace garden, and the Opening Ceremony on the Seine – France plans to charm visitors from around the world with everything that Paris has to offer during the 2024 Summer Olympics.\n\nThe latest, yet less glamorous addition to its Olympic arsenal is a laser weapon system that will shoot drones down from the sky.\n\nThe French Ministry of the Armed Forces announced in June that it has ordered one prototype of an anti-drone laser weapon system, called HELMA-P, to be deployed for the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\n“The HELMA-P system provides a calibrated response to the drone threat, from dazzling the drone’s observation instruments to the neutralization of a mini or micro drone (from 100g to 25kg) by altering its structure, causing it to fall in a few seconds,” the ministry said in a statement.\n\n“Altering its structure” is a nice way to say burning a hole through any potential drone.\n\nThis prototype will also help “deepen the military’s understanding of its deployment,” as an anti-drone campaign is a priority laid out by the French Ministry of the Armed Forces for the 2019-2025 period, according to the statement.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) told CNN that security of the Games is the responsibility of local authorities.\n\nThe HELMA-P system can shoot out powerful laser beams that heat up drones to a point where they either burn or overheat and shutdown, according to Jean, chief engineer of weaponry at the ministry’s General Directorate for Armament, in charge of developing and purchasing weapons.\n\nThe ministry declined to give out Jean’s last name for security concerns.\n\nDrone threats have increased exponentially in recent years including for big events such as the Olympics, according to Philippe Gros, senior research fellow at French security and defense think tank Foundation for Strategic Research.\n\nDrones can be used to scan and search a given area to identify the location of potential targets. They could also be modified to carry weapons or explosives. Mini drones, which is what the French system targets, have been playing an active role on the frontline in Ukraine.\n\nApart from the laser unit, the anti-drone system will also include radar and radio frequency sensors to aid in locating drones. Once identified, the weapon developed by CILAS, owned by French defense giant ArianeGroup, has a one-kilometer killing range, according to Jean.\n\nThe Olympic rings seen on the Parvis de l'Homme in Trocadero, in front of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. Isa Harsin/SIPA France/AP\n\nBut employing such a powerful weapon in densely populated Paris, where visitors from around the world gather to celebrate the Olympics, brings up safety concerns.\n\n“An important part of the anti-drone laser program is the safe operation of this weapon,” Jean said.\n\nIt will be up to the team operating on the ground to determine if they should shoot down a drone or not.\n\n“This decision will take into account the fact that the fall of the damaged drone could lead to some danger,” Jean said.\n\nA laser weapon system is also one of the most cost-effective ways to tackle the growing drone threats in urban areas, according to experts.\n\n“One of the reasons lasers are interesting is that, compared to interception missiles, there are no explosives involved and even if the drone explodes, it’s just its debris that will fall. In general, it brings less collateral damage,” Gros told CNN.\n\nLaser weapons offer other advantages, including precision and low operational cost; they don’t need munitions, which helps explain their increasing popularity among military powers such as the United States, China, France and the UK, according to Gros.\n\nMore specific to drone prevention, the HELMA-P system and other similar laser weapon systems fill in a gap where traditional anti-drone tools struggle to keep up with new developments in drone technology.\n\n“The problem is drones are becoming more and more autonomous, they can fly many parts of the mission without an operator,” Gros said.\n\nThis means the traditional way of jamming signals between drones and operators could become obsolete.\n\nCurrently, anti-drone laser weapons still have many weaknesses. For instance, bad weather impact their accuracy and efficiency. The industry is still on a learning path, according to Gros.\n\nFor tourists visiting Paris in 2024, the Ministry of the Armed Forces assured that its laser weapon won’t cause too much distraction for the public.\n\n“The system is quite stealthy since it does not emit light because the laser in fact is invisible,” Jean said.\n\n“It doesn’t make any noise either. It’s actually a very discreet weapon.”", "authors": ["Xiaofei Xu"], "publish_date": "2022/08/03"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/19/sport/los-angeles-2028-olympics-dates-spt-intl/index.html", "title": "Los Angeles 2028 announces key dates for Olympic Games | CNN", "text": "Reuters —\n\nThe Opening Ceremony of the 2028 Summer Games in Los Angeles will be held on July 14 and the Games will conclude on July 30, Games organizer LA28 announced on Monday.

Michael Kappeler/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nUnlikely beginnings\n\nStokes told CNN that the 1988 team “started from zero.”\n\nThe movie “Cool Runnings” came five years after Jamaica competed in the Calgary Games – but according to Stokes, the film was conceptualized by Americans William Maloney and George Fitch before he and his teammates even started competing together.\n\n“I was told the two gentlemen had the idea. William [Maloney] wanted to march in the Opening Ceremonies of an Olympic Games. He has his bucket list and has been ticking off things all his life. And George Fitch always had in mind to do a movie,” he said.\n\nThe men were both living in Jamaica at the time: Fitch was working for the US government and businessman Maloney was married to a Jamaican.\n\n“The two of them were drinking in a bar in Kingston and saw the pushcart derby on television and struck up on bobsled.”\n\nThe pair couldn’t get any athletes to take up bobsled for their endeavor, so they went to the army to find potential candidates, according to Stokes.\n\n“At the time, I was a sports fan, playing football in the army, as well as being an officer,” he said.\n\nOn holiday at the time, Stokes said he got a phone call from his unit, instructing him to try out for box cart trials to test his capability for the sport.\n\nThe orders “came down the chain of command to me as an order, and I really didn’t have a choice. And so I went,” he said.\n\n‘A brutal existence’\n\nGetting to grips with bobsled didn’t come easily: “I knew nothing about the sport I was getting into,” said Stokes.\n\nTraining for bobsled was a “brutal existence, from your eyes open to your eyes closed,” according to Stokes, with the team having to work hard in order to reach a competitive standard with no prior experience in the sport.\n\nJamaica's first-ever bobsledders, pilot Dudley 'Tal' Stokes and brakeman Michael White, are cheered on by fans during the first run of the Olympic two-man bobsled event February 20, 1988 at the Canada Olympic Park in Calgary. Stokes and White placed 31st out of 41. AFP/Getty Images\n\n“[The team] was coming into cold weather. Strict, strict timing regimes in days that were structured from start to finish on time, and just hammering away,” said Stokes.\n\n“We had to change the culture or rather look at the culture that was successful in the sport, and which is typically a German culture,” added Stokes. “We had to go into German mode to get things done.”\n\nA complicated legacy\n\n“Cool Runnings” became hugely popular, grossing over $154 million at the box office. But the film’s commercial success had a profound impact on Stokes’ life, and the happy go lucky plot starring hapless athletes didn’t fully reflect how much the real team achieved.\n\n“‘Cool Runnings’ has cast a massive shadow over my life,” Stokes told CNN.\n\n“There’s a very uncomfortable position of actually being alive to watch your legacy unfold,” he said. “Most people die before their legacy is revealed, but I’ve had to live it.\n\n“It started with what, you know, was really a comedy,” he explained. “A lot of what we did at first was comedic. But then over the years, we really became competitors and operated at the very highest level. And that was a journey in itself.”\n\nHis sporting career spanned four Olympic Games, during which time, he shaved significant time off his running speed.\n\n“My Olympic career was 10 years … I went to four Games 1988 to 1998: Calgary, Albertville, Lillehammer, Nagano in Japan. So it is very, very uncommon, that doesn’t happen.”\n\nInspiring the next generation\n\nJamaica has not yet won an Olympic medal in bobsled, but this year’s four-man team, nicknamed “Fire on Ice,” wants to change that – 24 years since the nation’s four-man bobsled team last qualified for the Winter Olympics.\n\nThis year, Benjamin Alexander made history as Jamaica’s first alpine skier, after Cool Runnings jibes on the ski slopes caused him to consider seriously pursuing the sport.\n\n“As I got good enough to kind of ski with them socially, being the only Black representative in the group, even though I am only half Black, and being of Jamaican heritage, people kept throwing jokes, sideways jokes at me about ‘Cool Runnings,’ the Jamaican bobsled team and, ‘you should go to the Olympics,’” Alexander told CNN Sport.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Benjamin Alexander: From DJ to Jamaica's first ever alpine skier 03:39 - Source: CNN\n\nAlexander went to the PyeongChang Games in 2018 as a spectator and started to wonder if he could compete at that level.\n\n“One of the things I noticed, other than thoroughly enjoying the spirit of the Olympics, was that there were only three Jamaican athletes in attendance.\n\n“It took me aback knowing how strong Jamaica is in the Summer Games, knowing how popular that movie ‘Cool Runnings’ is.\n\n“I kind of had this idea in the back of my head: let’s see if this is possible. I thought the most likely outcome was death or at least a serious injury.”\n\nBenjamin Alexander of Jamaica competes in the men's alpine ski event on February 13 at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. Michael Kappeler/picture alliance/Getty Images\n\nIn the years since his Olympic debut, Stokes has become more comfortable with his position in sporting and pop-culture history.\n\n“I’ve come to appreciate that Olympic participation is a worthy goal. Participation that’s aimed not at getting a gold medal does have its place,” he said.\n\n“Most people, most athletes at an Olympic Games … one: no medal, and two: don’t get into the finals. That’s a reality.\n\n“Life is a struggle, anything worth doing in life is a struggle. And anytime you enter into a struggle, you are going to suffer. And the one thing I would like to communicate to people that people think that suffering is something to be avoided: no.

It’s a sphere that opened like a flower, “to embody vitality and hope,” organizers said. A second cauldron has been placed in Tokyo’s waterfront area was to be lit after the opening ceremony.\n\nIt’s always a mystery until the last moment who gets the honor of lighting the cauldron.\n\nSadaharu Oh, Shigeo Nagashima and Hideki Matsui were among the baseball greats who took part in bringing the flame into the stadium. They passed it to a doctor and nurse, Hiroko Oohash and Junko Kitagawa, who ran a couple hundred yards with it.\n\nWakako Tsuchida, a Paralympic athlete, took it from them and began rolling it and his wheelchair closer to the stage as athletes and others on the floor for the ceremony rushed forward for a closer look.\n\nA group of six students were next to bring it closer to the stage, and at the foot of the stage with the last torch was Osaka — the four-time Grand Slam winner who will compete at the Tokyo Games.\n\nShe brought it to the center of the stage. A staircase emerged, the cauldron opened and Osaka walked to the top, the Olympic and Japanese flags blowing in the breeze off to her left. She dipped the flame in, the cauldron ignited and fireworks filled the sky.\n\n___\n\nAt long last, the Tokyo Olympics have officially been declared open by Japan’s Emperor Naruhito.\n\nThe games, delayed for a year by the pandemic, have had competition taking place since earlier in the week, but are not considered officially having started until the opening ceremony.\n\nSeiko Hashimoto is the president of the Tokyo Organizing Committee and told the athletes, “I greet you all from the bottom of my heart.” She spoke of what Japan has been through during the planning for the Olympics, including the recovery from a devastating earthquake and the ongoing fight with the pandemic.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach also spoke, saying the Olympics are again showing the “unifying power of sport.\"\n\nBach began his remarks by telling those in the stadium, “Today is a moment of hope. Yes, it is very different from what all of us had imagined. But let us cherish this moment. Finally, we are all here together.\"\n\nAfter Bach spoke and the Emperor made his declaration, the Olympic flag was carried into the stadium, with pandemic frontline workers being honored in that portion of the ceremony. The workers were from Tokyo, but represented all those who have been on the front lines globally.\n\nFrom there, a choir of Japanese students sang as a prequel to the traditional release of doves, the Olympic gesture to express a desire for world peace.\n\n___\n\nAn array of singers, including John Legend and Keith Urban, have performed “Imagine” at the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe song’s inclusion was a nod to the song that John Lennon and Yoko Ono co-wrote 50 years ago. The singers appeared on video.\n\n“We’re not the first to say ‘Imagine no countries’ or ‘Give peace a chance,’ but we’re carrying that torch, like the Olympic torch, passing it hand to hand, to each other, to each country, to each generation,” Lennon once said. “And that’s our job.”\n\n___\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron says Japan was right to hold the Olympic Games despite a rise in coronavirus infections, now at a six-month high.\n\n“These Olympic Games had to be held,” said Macron, who was in Tokyo for the start of the games. “The Olympics is the spirit of cooperation and we need it … in this time of COVID,” he said in an interview on France Television, the public TV channel.\n\nThe 2024 games will take place in Paris.\n\nJapan is holding the Games amid a state of emergency, and some have criticized the country's leaders for prioritizing the Olympics over the nation’s health.\n\n“Japan authorities were right to hold the Olympics because no one knows how the epidemic will evolve in the coming years\" or if there will be others, Macron said, adding that this only shows that nations must adapt.\n\n___\n\nThe U.S. Olympic team entered the opening ceremony for the Tokyo Games with first lady Jill Biden among those in the stadium to cheer the Americans' arrival.\n\nBasketball's Sue Bird and baseball's Eddy Alvarez had the flagbearer duties for the U.S. It was a particularly emotional moment for Alvarez, a Cuban-American from Miami — given the current times in his home city.\n\nProtests and demonstrations have been common in Miami for several days, a show of support for Cubans who have taken to the streets in the communist nation to air grievances about poor economic conditions and other complaints.\n\nMost members of the U.S. basketball teams marched in the parade. The Americans were followed by only France and Japan in the 207-nation parade.\n\nBiden's appearance at the opening ceremony is part of her first solo trip abroad as first lady. She is also expected to attend some events involving U.S. athletes before departing Japan.\n\n___\n\nPita’s back, and he brought back his oil.\n\nThe shirtless Tongan whose fame rocketed after entering the 2016 Olympics with his upper body glistening for all to see — his name is Pita Taufatofua, by the way — returned to the Tokyo Games as one of his nation’s flagbearers again.\n\nAnd yes, he was shirtless.\n\nIt’s the third consecutive Olympics in which Taufatofua has competed as an athlete. He competed in taekwondo at the Rio Games, took part in skiing at Pyeongchang in 2018 — yes, shirtless for that one, too — and is back in Tokyo as part of his taekwondo team again. Taufatofua tried to qualify in kayaking, but didn’t make the Tokyo cut in that sport.\n\nHe’s also used his fame for good. Taufatofua is a UNICEF ambassador, works with homeless shelters and is busy raising money for sporting equipment for nations in need.\n\n___\n\nSue Bird is one of the flagbearers for the U.S. in the opening ceremony for the Tokyo Olympics, sharing that role with baseball’s Eddy Alvarez.\n\nBird is a five-time Olympian in women's basketball. She remembers 2004 when the U.S. women’s basketball team got to walk at the front of the delegation along with flag bearer Dawn Staley, now the U.S. head coach in Tokyo. Bird says one of her favorite memories was walking in and hearing the crowd in Athens roar.\n\nThere was some noise for the athletes on Friday night. Just no roars; the stadium wasn’t anywhere near filled enough for those.\n\nBird says “this Olympics are like no other.”\n\n___\n\nThe parade of athletes at the opening ceremony for the Tokyo Olympics has started.\n\nOrganizers expect about 5,700 athletes to take part in the parade. Some will skip it because of early competitions on Saturday or to avoid risk of exposure to the coronavirus. And this parade differs from most others in the past because the nations are being spaced out — a nod to social distancing.\n\nHundreds of volunteers are on the stadium floor as well to greet the athletes as they walk through. Many athletes are waving; others are capturing their entrance on their phone cameras.\n\nMoments before the parade, a wooden set of Olympic rings was displayed at the center of the stadium in a nod to the 1964 Tokyo Games. There, athletes from around the world were asked to bring seeds that could be planted and become trees.\n\nWood from 160 pines and spruces, seeds that came from Canada, Ireland and Northern Europe, were used to build the set of Olympic rings displayed Friday.\n\n___\n\nJapan’s Emperor Naruhito and International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach have arrived for the opening ceremony of the Tokyo Games.\n\nNaruhito attended the 1964 Tokyo Olympics as a 4-year-old, watching the marathon and equestrian events. Bach won a gold medal in fencing at the 1976 Montreal Games.\n\nThey were followed by a delegation chosen to carry the Japanese flag into the stadium, before the host nation’s national anthem was performed by singer Misia.\n\nTributes were paid to those lost during the pandemic, and the Israeli delegation that was killed at the Munich Games in 1972. A moment of silence was offered inside the stadium.\n\n___\n\nWith a blaze of indigo and white fireworks lighting the night sky, the Tokyo Olympics opening ceremony has started.\n\nIt began with a single female athlete at the center of the stadium, kneeling. As she stood, the shadow behind her took the shape of a seedling, growing as she walked. A number of athletes were featured in a video that started with the moment Tokyo won the Olympic bid in 2013, then eventually to images of a world silenced by the pandemic.\n\nThen came the fireworks, a 20-second blast of light — as if to say these Olympics have finally emerged from dark times.\n\n___\n\nThe International Olympic Committee has released the order of the parade of nations for the opening ceremony and the names of all the flagbearers.\n\nGreece, per Olympic tradition, enters first. The host nation always enters last, so it’ll likely take a couple hours or so before Japanese flagbearers Yui Susaki and Rui Hachimura lead their national contingent into the stadium.\n\nThe Refugee Olympic team goes second in the parade. The others are slotted by their order in the Japanese alphabet, so Iceland and Ireland precede Azerbaijan, for example.\n\nThe IOC says 206 teams — 205 nations and the refugee team — will be taking part in the opening ceremony. Some nations will have their flags carried by volunteers. Other nations will have only one flagbearer. Most will have two, with one male and one female athlete chosen for the role.\n\n___\n\nThe Tokyo 2020 opening ceremony is about to begin, 364 days behind the original schedule and with a very different feel than what was originally intended before the pandemic changed everything.\n\nThe Olympic Stadium is largely empty. The Tokyo 2020 souvenir store outside the front gates is closed. But that doesn’t mean fans have stayed away. Hundreds of fans gathered outside the gates and along the sidewalks of closed streets, waving at any person with an Olympic credential or any vehicle that went by with an Olympic logo.\n\nTrack and field events will be held in the stadium later in these games. The track itself is covered by a large black tarp for the opening ceremony and the infield is covered with a white tarp, one where graphics will be displayed over the course of the evening.\n\nSome dignitaries and invited guests will be in the stadium seats, including U.S. first lady Jill Biden.\n\n___\n\nSix Polish swimmers have returned home before the Olympics even started, their dreams scuttled by the country mistakenly sending too many athletes to Tokyo.\n\nOnly 17 swimmers from Poland qualified for the Tokyo Games. The country’s swimming federation put 23 athletes on the plane to Japan, sparking outrage among those who were denied a chance to compete.\n\nTwo-time Olympian Alicja Tchorz was among those sent home. She griped on social media about all the sacrifices she had made to earn another trip to the Summer Games, only for it to result “in a total flop.”\n\nThe team sent out a statement demanding the resignation of Polish Swimming Federation president Paweł Słomiński. He issued his own statement expressing “regret, sadness and bitterness” about the athletes’ situation.\n\nSłomiński said there was confusion over the qualifying rules and he was merely trying to “allow as many players and coaches as possible to take part” in the Olympics.\n\n___\n\nA bad weather forecast for Monday in Tokyo has prompted Olympic officials to move scheduled rowing events to Sunday.\n\nOfficials say rain, high winds and strong gusts could cause choppy and potentially unrowable conditions at the Sea Forest Waterway in Tokyo Bay.\n\nThe change affects men’s and women’s single and double sculls semifinals, and men’s and women’s fours repechage. The opening heats in the men’s and women’s eights also were moved from Sunday to Saturday.\n\n___\n\nAustralian swimmer Kaylee McKeown has surprisingly withdrawn from one of her best events because of a busy schedule at the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nMcKeown dropped the 200-meter individual medley, where she’s ranked No. 1 in the world and would have been a favorite to win a gold medal. She’ll focus instead on her two backstroke events and the relays.\n\n“You have a rookie coming into the Olympics — it is a new experience and a big call,” Australian coach Rohan Taylor said.\n\nThe 200 IM semifinal heats are Monday night and the 100 back final is the next morning. Taylor says the timing “could be a challenge,” so the decision was made to drop the individual medley.\n\nMcKeown set a world record in the 100 back last month at the Australian trials, and the 20-year-old swimmer will be a gold medal favorite in that event.\n\n___\n\nThe U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee says about 100 of the 613 U.S. athletes descending on Tokyo for the Olympics are unvaccinated.\n\nMedical director Jonathan Finnoff says 567 of the American athletes had filled out their health histories as they prepared for the trip. He estimated 83% had replied they were vaccinated.\n\nFinnoff says 83 percent is a substantial number and and the committee is quite happy with it.\n\nNationally, 56.3% of Americans have received at least one dose of the vaccine.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee estimates that around 85% of residents of the Olympic Village are vaccinated. That’s based that on what each country’s Olympic committee reports but is not an independently verified number.\n\n___\n\nSouth Korea’s An San has broken the women’s Olympic archery record with a score of 680 in the qualifying round on a hot and humid day.\n\nHer mark topped the score of 673 set by Lina Herasymenko of Ukraine in 1996. An San’s teammates Jang Minhee (677) and Kang Chae Young (675) were second and third.\n\nRussian Olympic Committee archer Svetlana Gomboeva collapsed in the intense heat and was treated by medical staff. The temperature soared above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nIn the men’s qualifying round, Kim Je Deok of South Korea posted the top mark of 688, with Brady Ellison of the United States second (682) and Oh Jin Hyek of South Korea third (681).\n\nThe Olympic debut of the mixed team event will be Saturday. The women’s individual competition is next Friday and the men’s individual event the following day.\n\n___\n\nAbout 50 protesters have gathered in Tokyo to demand the cancellation of the Olympics.\n\nThe opening ceremony is set for Friday evening local time.\n\nThe protesters gathered outside the Tokyo Metropolitan Government building chanting “no to the Olympics” and “save people’s lives.\" They held up signs reading “cancel the Olympics.\"\n\nThe Games, largely without spectators and opposed by much of the host nation, are going ahead a year later than planned.\n\nA day earlier, Tokyo hit another six-month high in new COVID-19 cases as worries grew of worsening infections during the Games. Still, the number of cases and deaths as a share of the population in Japan are much lower than in many other countries.\n\nThe opening ceremony will be held mostly without spectators to prevent the spread of coronavirus infections, although some officials, guests and media will attend.\n\n___\n\nJill Biden has held a virtual meet-and-greet with several U.S. athletes who will compete at the Tokyo Games.\n\nThe U.S. first lady is in Tokyo to support the athletes and attend the opening ceremony.\n\nShe spoke virtually with Eddy Alvarez, a baseball player and short track speed skater, and basketball player Sue Bird. Both will be flagbearers for the U.S. at the opening ceremony. She also spoke with Allison Schmitt, a four-time Olympic swimmer and mental health advocate.\n\nBiden told the athletes that they'd given up a lot to be in Tokyo and relied on support from family and friends.\n\nOn Saturday, she'll dedicate a room in the residence of the U.S. chief of mission to former U.S. Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, and his wife, Irene Hirano Inouye.\n\nShe will host a U.S.-vs.-Mexico softball watch party at the U.S. Embassy for staff and their families, and cheer U.S. athletes competing in several events before leaving Tokyo.\n\n___\n\nSouth African race walker Lebogang Shange has been banned for four years for doping and will miss the Tokyo Olympics.\n\nThe former African champion was entered in the men’s 20-kilometer race on Aug. 5. The Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled on the case in Tokyo.\n\nThe 30-year-old Shange tested positive for the anabolic steroid trenbolone and was provisionally suspended in December 2019. His ban will expire before the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\n___\n\nThe Swiss Olympic team says 400-meter hurdler Kariem Hussein has accepted a nine-month ban after testing positive for a banned stimulant.\n\nThe 2014 European champion was entered in the event at the Tokyo Games. The heats start next Friday. It is unclear if Hussein will be replaced in the 40-athlete lineup.\n\nThe Swiss Olympic body’s tribunal backdated the ban by one week from the time Hussein was provisionally suspended. That suspension had not been disclosed.\n\n___\n\nTokyo Olympic organizers have reported 25 new COVID-19 cases. Three of them are athletes that were announced on Thursday.\n\nThere are 13 athletes among the 110 Olympic-accredited people that have tested positive in Japan since July 1.\n\nThree media workers coming to Japan from abroad were included in the latest update.\n\n___\n\nNaomi Osaka’s opening match in the Olympic tennis tournament has been pushed back from Saturday to Sunday.\n\nOrganizers did not immediately provide a reason for the switch. They said only that the move came from the tournament referee.\n\nOsaka was originally scheduled to play 52nd-ranked Zheng Saisai of China in the very first contest of the Games on center court Saturday morning.\n\nOne reason for the move could be that Osaka might have a role in the opening ceremony Friday night. That wouldn’t leave her much time to rest before a Saturday morning match.\n\nOsaka is returning to competition for the first time in nearly two months after she withdrew from the French Open following the first round to take a mental health break.\n\nShe is one of Japan’s top athletes.\n\n___\n\nThe World Anti-Doping Agency says several Russian athletes have been kept away from the Tokyo Olympics because of doping suspicions based on evidence from a Moscow testing laboratory that was shut down in 2015.\n\nWADA director general Olivier Niggli says it intervened with sports bodies to ensure those athletes — “not many, but there was a handful” — were not selected.\n\nThe team of 335 Russian athletes accredited for Tokyo is competing without a national flag and anthem as punishment for state tampering with the Moscow lab’s database. The team name is ROC, the acronym for Russian Olympic Committee, without the word “Russia.”\n\nThe identity ban for the Tokyo Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Games was imposed by the Court of Arbitration for Sport last December.\n\nGiving WADA the database and samples from the lab was key to getting closure for the long-running Russian state-backed doping scandal.\n\nWADA had a list of around 300 athletes under suspicion and gave evidence to Olympic sports bodies for possible disciplinary cases.\n\nNiggli says “we cross-checked what we had from this long list” to ensure athletes were not selected for Tokyo.\n\n___\n\nRussian archer Svetlana Gomboeva lost consciousness during a competition at the Tokyo Olympics in intense heat.\n\nCoach Stanislav Popov says in comments via the Russian Olympic Committee that Gomboeva collapsed shortly after completing the qualifying round Friday.\n\nPopov says “she couldn’t stand it, a whole day in the heat” and adds that humidity made the problem worse. Temperatures in Tokyo were above 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit.)\n\nThe heat in Tokyo’s summer months already prompted organizers to move the marathons and race-walking events to the cooler city of Sapporo.\n\n___\n\nU.S. men’s water polo captain Jesse Smith will skip the opening ceremony for the Tokyo Olympics on Friday after the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee limited how many players from his team could participate in the festivities.\n\nOlympic water polo rosters consist of 13 players, and 12 are designated as available for each game. Smith said the team was told by the USOPC that it could have 12 credentialed athletes walk in the ceremony.\n\n“We tried to keep our team together and change it with every constructive outlet, but no success, and now it’s time to refocus on getting game ready,” Smith wrote on Twitter. “So tonight I am sending my team out there to represent (the United States) proudly and soak up every moment. Let’s go boys!”\n\nThe 38-year-old Smith is playing in his fifth Olympics, matching Tony Azevedo for most Olympic teams for a U.S. water polo athlete. He was under consideration to serve as the male U.S. flag bearer for the opening ceremony before that honor went to baseball player Eddy Alvarez.\n\n___\n\nA map on the Olympic website has been changed after Ukraine protested that it included a border across the Crimean Peninsula.\n\nThe map is part of a “Cheer Zone” feature tracking how fans around the world have backed different teams at the Tokyo Games.\n\nLate Thursday the map had a black line across the top of Crimea in the same style as national borders. On Friday morning, there was no line across the peninsula. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Ukraine still considers it to be Ukrainian territory.\n\nThe Ukrainian embassy in Japan tells the Associated Press in an e-mail that “we have protested to the IOC and the map was corrected.”\n\n___\n\nRoad cyclist Michal Schlegel is the fourth Czech athlete from three different sports to test positive before their competition at the Tokyo Games.\n\nSchlegel tested positive at the team’s training base in Izu and will miss Saturday’s road race.\n\nThe Czech Olympic Committee said in a statement Friday that Schlegel is in isolation, and that Michael Kukrle and Zdenek Stybar will be its only two riders lining up at Musashinonomori Park for one of the first medal events of the Summer Games.\n\nCzech beach volleyball players Marketa Slukova and Ondrej Perusic and table tennis player Pavel Sirucek also tested positive earlier this week. That has prompted the Czech Olympic team to investigate whether the outbreak is linked to its chartered flight to Tokyo.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/04/opinions/beijing-winter-olympics-opening-ceremony-bass/index.html", "title": "Opinion: As Olympics begin, the world is looking.

The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\nCNN —\n\nAs Olympic mic drops go, China just raised the bar with a cauldron-lighting surprise that openly acknowledged the layers of political meaning at play.\n\nAmy Bass Courtesy Rodney Bedsole\n\nThe Olympic torch entered the stadium after International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach’s welcome at Friday’s Opening Ceremony of the XXIV Olympic Winter Games in the hands of speed skater Zhao Weichang, the first of seven torch bearers, who emerged in order of the decade in which they were born.\n\nThe torch relay finished in the hands of two Olympians competing in Beijing: One was Nordic Combined athlete Zhao Jiawen. The other, in a nod to gender equity and one of the political controversies at the center of these Olympics, was cross-country skier Dinigeer Yilamujiang, who hails from Xinjiang and who the Chinese state media said has roots in the Uyghur minority, whose plight has been central to the diplomatic boycott of these Games by the United States and other nations.\n\nAs the two lit the cauldron together, the message was clear to the many countries who refused to send dignitaries to Beijing: These Olympic Games are our moment, not yours.\n\nAmid layers of political symbolism, many firsts\n\nInjecting the lighting of the Olympic flame with layers of political meaning and symbolism is nothing new. Cathy Freeman represented aboriginal Australia in Sydney in 2000. US Cold Warrior Mike Eruzione and his 1980 hockey teammates – who took down the Soviet Union’s legendary team on the ice after that country’s invasion of Afghanistan – performed the honor in Salt Lake City in 2002.\n\nIn no uncertain terms, the spotlight on China’s legacies of human rights violations has been nothing short of rightfully intense. But from the waving athletes to the male-female duos bearing each delegation’s flag, there was, to be clear, also much joy to behold during the opening ceremony to these Games, which marks the first time a city has hosted both summer and winter Olympics.\n\nJust as Tokyo gave the world a somber but hopeful start to its Games, Beijing’s ceremony, again in the hands of Oscar-nominated director Zhang Yimou, presented a more subdued pageant than we saw in 2008, with a fraction of the number of performers on the floor of National Stadium – the Bird’s Nest.\n\nGone were the 2,008 drummers that made the Opening Ceremony 14 years ago so memorable. In their place was a lightshow peppered by winsome children filled with song, and most of the pageantry that followed took on a snowflake theme.\n\nVolunteers brandished large snowflake-shaped signs to bring the athletes into the stadium: 91 teams who field 2,900 athletes in 109 medal events – seven of which are new to these Games. As always, the Parade of Nations gave each squad a chance to show its best face. With Tokyo 2020, the IOC began the tradition of a male-female duo carrying each flag, but for some countries – 19 in all – who field just one athlete, this was not possible.\n\nAmerican Samoa featured sledder Nathan Crumpton, who took up the legacy of Tongan crowd favorite Pita Taufatofua (who stayed back home in Tonga to help with disaster relief) and walked into the stadium shirtless and oiled up. Skier Sarah Escobar, a student at St. Michael’s College in Vermont, carried the flag for Ecuador, becoming the country’s first female athlete in a Winter Olympics.\n\nDespite good gender optics during the ceremony, gender equity in the Winter Olympics has a way to go. While Tokyo became the first to achieve near parity along gender lines, the Winter Games, continue to lag. In Beijing, women will comprise nearly 45% of athletes, a 4% increase from 2018. Men have more events on the winter program – 51 as opposed to 46 for women – and compete in the Nordic Combined, the only Olympic sport not open to women. The large men’s field in hockey – 12 teams include some 300 players while the women’s side will see 10 teams and just over 200 athletes – also contributes to the imbalance.\n\nIn Beijing, gender stretches beyond male-female equity of representation to include more nuanced understandings of identity (and competition). American figure skater Timothy LeDuc will become the first non-binary Winter Olympian to compete, partnering with Ashley Can-Gribble in the pairs competition. Additionally, there will be more opportunities for men and women to compete together. While nine new gender-mixed events launched in Tokyo last summer, Beijing will build on events such as team figure skating with the debut of a mixed relay in short track speed skating, as well as mixed events in ski jumping and snowboard.\n\nThe whole world is looking, but will they be watching?\n\nBut despite all of these exciting firsts, the ceremony – designed as one of the key rituals that separate everyday life from life during an Olympics – can only do so much in a moment when the world is, collectively, exhausted. While the Covid-19 pandemic has thrown a spotlight on every ill humanity faces, from global public health inequities to disinformation and pseudo-science, the virus is but one specter haunting China.\n\nRussian leader Vladimir Putin, seated alone but not far from China’s President Xi Jinping (earlier the two had had a seemingly warm meeting together), stood to applaud hockey player Vadim Shipachyov and speed skater Olga Fatkulina carrying in the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee, rather than the nation’s flag. Beijing marks the third and last time Russian athletes, some 200 strong in Beijing, will compete in this manner, serving out the end of a ban instituted for doping violations.\n\nBut Russia’s past doping scandals are barely a headline at this point, pushed onto one of the world’s many backburners by the thousands of troops amassed on Ukraine’s border. Ukraine selected freestyle skier Oleksandr Abramenko, who won gold in aerials in 2018 and marks his fifth Olympic appearance in Beijing, and ice dancer Oleksandra Nazarova for the honor of carrying its flag with its team of 45.\n\nBefore competition even began, Ukrainian officials warned its athletes to avoid social contact with members of the Russian team, perhaps especially in photos. Last August in Tokyo, Ukrainian Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who took bronze in the high jump, drew the ire of many back home for a celebratory photo with Russia’s Mariya Lasitskene, the gold medalist in the event.\n\nThe political tensions between the two countries have, without question, leaked into China’s ‘closed loop’ Olympic bubble, regardless of Bach’s appeal in his welcoming remarks to “all political authorities across the world [to] observe your commitment to this Olympic truce.” Bach’s pleas match those of just about every other IOC leader in history – including Avery Brundage, who in 1936 shunned the idea of a boycott of the Games hosted by Nazi Germany because “the Olympic Games belong to the athletes and not to the politicians.”\n\nRussia, especially, is no stranger to this kind of tension bleeding into the Olympics – sometimes quite literally. The Melbourne Olympics in 1956 saw Hungary defeat the Soviet Union 4-0 against the backdrop of the Hungarian Revolution, dubbed “blood in the water” after Soviet player Valentin Prokopov punched Hungary’s Ervin Zador in the eye in the final minutes of the game. In 1968, Czech gymnast Věra Čáslavská noticeably averted her eyes away from the Soviet flag and anthem during medal ceremonies, protesting the Soviet invasion of her country.\n\nIn 2014 during the Sochi Olympics, Ukrainian athletes asked to wear black armbands when protests against Viktor Yanukovych’s administration turned deadly, while others left the Olympics in solidarity of those fighting in the streets of Kyiv. At that time, Bach urged Ukrainian athletes to demonstrate how “sport can build bridges and help to bring people from different backgrounds together in peace.”\n\nPutin’s own relationship with the Olympic Games, too, should not be forgotten. In 2008, whether by coincidence or design, Russia invaded Georgia, taking over South Ossetia, just as the Olympics got started. Just three days after the conclusion of the Sochi Games, he seized Crimea.\n\nWhether or not those Russian troops step over the line during these Games is anyone’s guess, especially with speculation that Xi has asked Putin not to take the limelight off the Olympics. Not exactly flush with friends, Putin might hold off while Xi has his party. But if not, the world that watched this Opening Ceremony might not be the same as the one that watches Closing.\n\nGet our weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWith that in mind, did this Opening Ceremony provide enough light, enough hope, to illuminate the dazzling quad jumps of six-time US figure skating champ Nathan Chen, who hopes to rectify his disappointing finish in PyeongChang (and is off to a good start, if his short program in the team competition is any indication)? Can we make room amidst masks and nose swabs and vaccination cards and isolation to root for snowboarder Chloe Kim, the first woman to land a front-side double cork 1080, making her to the mountain what Simone Biles is to the vault?\n\nWe shall see.

We’re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.\n\nCNN —\n\nOn January 28, UN Secretary-General António Guterres asked nations around the world to lay down their weapons and observe an Olympic Truce from seven days before the Beijing Games until seven days after the end of the Paralympic Games. “Through the power of sports and the Olympic ideal, let us build a culture of peace,” he said.\n\nThe Olympic truce dates back almost 3,000 years to the early days of the ancient games when the leaders of three Greek city-states agreed to limit their battles. In modern times, the truce has been invoked as a universal goal by the UN regularly since 1993. But the treaty originally didn’t actually aim to stop all wars, only to safeguard the athletes as they traveled to and competed at Olympia, David C. Young pointed out in the Encyclopaedia Britannica.\n\nAs the Winter Olympics proceed in China this year, Guterres’ worthy aspiration is being tested – we’ll find out whether this year’s truce may prove as limited as the earliest ones were.\n\nWorth noting: On the day of the opening ceremony the last time the Games were held in Beijing, in 2008, Russia invaded Georgia.\n\nClay Jones/CNN\n\nThis year’s games began while a huge force of Russian troops remained perched on the Ukraine border and with US President Joe Biden sending troops to Eastern Europe.\n\nChina’s Xi Jinping and Russia’s Vladimir Putin met Friday before the opening ceremony in a show of harmony between the US rivals, agreeing, in general, to “step up coordination and cooperation in international affairs” and specifically to oppose NATO expansion.\n\nIn some ways, the threat of war overshadowed the start of the Olympics. As Amy Bass noted, “Before competition even began, Ukrainian officials warned its athletes to avoid social contact with members of the Russian team … Last August in Tokyo, Ukrainian Yaroslava Mahuchikh, who took bronze in the high jump, drew the ire of many back home for a celebratory photo with Russia’s Mariya Lasitskene, the gold medalist in the event.”\n\n“The political tensions between the two countries have, without question, leaked into China’s ‘closed loop’ Olympic bubble, regardless of (IOC President Thomas) Bach’s appeal in his welcoming remarks to ‘all political authorities across the world (to) observe your commitment to this Olympic truce.’ Bach’s pleas match those of just about every other IOC leader in history – including Avery Brundage, who in 1936 shunned the idea of a Berlin boycott of the games hosted by Nazi Germany because ‘the Olympic Games belong to the athletes and not to the politicians.”’\n\nFor more:\n\nMark Clifford: This is what victory at the Beijing Games looks like\n\nBiden’s moves\n\nResponding to Putin’s massing of troops, “Biden has launched a muscular diplomatic offensive, coordinated with NATO allies and held high-level talks with Russian officials, while warning of stiff economic sanctions and boosting the military defenses of Ukraine and now of the United States’ allies in Eastern Europe, such as Romania and Poland,” wrote Frida Ghitis. Leading Senate Republicans backed Biden’s moves while Trumpists adopted positions more sympathetic to Russia.\n\nRepublican Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri supported a key demand of Putin – that the US oppose allowing Ukraine to join NATO. “Hawley has staked his position,” Ghitis observed. “He’s betting that the Republican Party, with or without Trump, will follow a Trumpian path to victory. He wants that to be his victory, too, even if it means Ukraine comes under Putin’s heel and autocracy continues spreading across the globe.”\n\nBiden’s aggressive response to the crisis is gaining praise in Europe. In the Financial Times, Edward Luce wrote that “by threatening Ukraine’s sovereignty, Putin has done something Biden could not on his own – unite the west.”\n\nThe President also approved a special forces raid in Syria this week that led to the death of ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi. The week “seemed like quite an about-face for the President,” wrote Peter Bergen. “Over the past decade, Biden has been far more cautious about deploying troops or using force. Biden pulled all US troops out of Afghanistan in August, which triggered the departure of thousands of allied NATO soldiers and American contractors, precipitating the takeover of the country by the Taliban.” And as vice president, Biden cautioned President Barack Obama against authorizing the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, the head of al Qaeda.\n\nFor more:\n\nRafael Loss: Why Germany is the weakest link in Europe’s chain against Putin\n\nThe potential contenders\n\nAnn Telnaes/Cartoonist Group\n\nA replacement for retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer will be nominated this month, if Biden meets his own deadline for the pick. One potential choice, US District Court Judge J. Michelle Childs, already has support from both sides of the aisle – from Sen. Lindsey Graham and Rep. James Clyburn – in her home state of South Carolina. Bakari Sellers, who has represented clients in Childs’ courtroom, called her “a judge without any air of pretension.”\n\nGet our weekly newsletter Sign up for CNN Opinion’s new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\n“She is like so many Americans who have worked incredibly hard to achieve success in life,” Sellers wrote. “And isn’t it time we put someone on the bench who reflects our experiences? The daughter of a police officer, who died when she was just a teenager, and a personnel manager for Bell Telephone, she’s faced the same adversity so many of us have.” Unlike the current Supreme Court justices, Child has experience as a judge in state courts. “At a time when faith in our democratic institutions is being eroded by charges of tone-deafness and elitism, don’t we deserve a Supreme Court nominee who stands not above us, but among us?”\n\nAnother possible choice, US Court of Appeals Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, impressed CNN legal analyst Elie Honig for her handling of the challenge to a US House of Representatives subpoena of former President Donald Trump’s White House counsel Don McGahn. “Ultimately, Jackson issued a thorough – exhaustive, even – ruling that ran 118 pages. Her decision was deeply researched, impeccably written and incisive,” Honig wrote, describing her as “a truly exceptional federal judge.”\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, of Texas, was among the prominent Republicans criticizing Biden for pledging to nominate a Black woman to the court, saying it tells other Americans, “You are ineligible.” Brandon Tensley wrote that “Conservatives’ characterizations of President Joe Biden’s commitment to nominate a Black woman to the US Supreme Court have been as ridiculous as they’ve been predictable … the tub-thumping about Biden’s position on a still-to-be-named nominee does two things: It hides the fact that conservatives also have long embraced picks’ identities, and ignores the substantive value of injecting more diversity into the judiciary.”\n\nTrump floats pardons\n\nThe week began with condemnation from Democrats and some Republicans of Trump’s suggestion that he could consider pardoning some January 6 rioters if he is elected president in 2024. For some, it was even more troubling that at his rally last weekend, he also threatened prosecutors investigating him with massive demonstrations if they “do anything wrong or illegal.”\n\nThe week ended with the Republican National Committee censuring two members of Congress who dared to call out Trump for his election lies and serve on the House select committee investigating January 6.\n\nDean Obeidallah wrote, “Think back to December 2020, when Trump called for a protest because he felt he’d been ‘wronged’ with the 2020 election results – the end result was the deadly Capitol attack. Even as his role in that outcome is investigated, Trump obviously knows how that played out. That’s why common sense says Trump now calling for his supporters to potentially amass again in huge numbers to help him right any perceived wrongs should ring alarm bells. That’s especially true given Trump’s apparent message to his supporters on Saturday that if you commit acts of violence in his name, he will consider pardoning you if he ever becomes president again.”\n\nFor more:\n\nMichael D’Antonio: Trump’s growing recklessness is a ticking time bomb\n\nElie Honig: The Jan. 6 committee is facing a stark choice\n\nBlack History Month\n\nEver since 1976, US presidents have designated the month of February as a time to recognize Black history. But this year, as Peniel E. Joseph noted, “Black History Month commemorations will unfold alongside efforts in numerous states to ban the teaching of its content. Efforts that purport to bar the teaching of ‘Critical Race Theory’ have evolved into a full-scale assault, with Republican lawmakers unleashing attacks on Black History under the guise of protecting White children from ‘discomfort.’”\n\n“Efforts to cancel Black history because it’s too uncomfortable also reflect mainstream media narratives centering the anger and indignation of White parents regarding the teaching of Black history in public education. This has largely erased the perspective of Black parents. As one Black mother of three from Charlottesville, Virginia, told The Washington Post, ‘They say, “Our children are too young to hear about racism.” Who is “our” children? I don’t remember a day of my life when I wasn’t taught about racism, or learning about it through just existing.’”\n\nA survivor’s voice\n\nJoan Salter\n\nJoan Salter was born in Brussels, the child of Polish Jews. Her mother’s family was murdered in the Treblinika death camp and her father’s in Belzec. “It was thanks to a tip-off from a police officer that deportations of women and children were due to start, that my mother managed to smuggle us out of Paris in a laundry van in the dead of night,” Salter wrote. She was shipped to the US in 1943 as a child survivor.\n\nSalter spoke out this week after Whoopi Goldberg apologized for saying the Nazi persecution of the Jews had nothing to do with race.\n\n“I do not believe that Goldberg was deliberately seeking to distort the Holocaust. I find it unfortunate, however, that her comments represent a futile attempt to oversimplify a very complicated situation – the annihilation of an entire group of people, the Jews – in racial terms,” Salter observed.\n\n“The reality is that Nazis declared Jews and other groups like the Romani and Sinti as inferior to their own supposedly superior ‘Aryan race.’ In the years leading to the Holocaust, Nazis referred to Jews as ‘rats.’ And it is for this one reason that Jews were targeted for destruction. Six million of my people were murdered simply for who they were.”\n\nFor more:\n\nJill Filipovic: The bigger problem behind Whoopi Goldberg and Ron DeSantis’ incendiary comments\n\n‘Pam & Tommy’\n\nErin Simkin/Hulu\n\nUnder different circumstances, a new series streaming on Hulu could be applauded for foregrounding the story of a woman victimized. But that’s not what’s being delivered to viewers, wrote Sara Stewart:\n\n“This eight-episode show about the infamous 1995 Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee sex tape is, at its core, about a violation of privacy. It’s the story of a honeymoon videotape the famous couple never wanted anyone to see, stolen and distributed at great profit to various men. And the story of that piracy is now being sold as a TV series … at great profit to the team who made it. Without the consent of the woman at its center …”\n\n“It’s incomprehensible,” wrote Stewart, “that a team of people making a show in 2021, in the age of #MeToo, would be this oblivious to the importance of getting consent – especially when their series is entirely about the importance of consent.”\n\nBigger than Boris\n\nAt week’s end, Boris Johnson was still the UK’s prime minister but there’s no doubt he’s been badly weakened by the revelations of frequent alcohol-fueled parties at 10 Downing Street and other government buildings while the nation was on lockdown. Portions of a report by civil servant Sue Gray put it in classically understated language: “Some of the events should not have been allowed to take place. Other events should not have been allowed to develop as they did.”\n\nHolly Thomas wrote, “As Johnson probably realizes, it isn’t just the fact of our nation’s cabin crew boozing their way through the pandemic that offends the British populace.”\n\n“The real insult is that while we abstained, he and his colleagues did not. And incredible though it is that so many people shouldering huge professional responsibilities were prepared to attend these potentially dangerous gatherings, the ingrained presenteeism in Britain when bosses or colleagues hit the bar has always come at a heavy price …”\n\n“Regular and excessive bouts of group drinking are chronic throughout British working culture – and the political world of Westminster is an exaggerated caricature of what goes on elsewhere. In non-lockdown times, Whitehall pubs spill onto the streets from 6 p.m. onward – and overflow even more with proximity to the Houses of Parliament. Drinking carries on until late every weekday. Junior advisers know the value of showing up for pints if they want to endear themselves to their superiors and as a result, journalists cruising for stories do the same, habitually stalking the House of Commons’ heavily subsidized bars.”\n\nFor more:\n\nRosa Prince: The Boris Johnson Party is over. But the hangover is just beginning\n\nThe future of policing\n\nMichael Fanone, a former Washington, DC, police officer who was badly injured defending the Capitol on January 6, traveled to New York for the funeral of NYPD Officer Jason Rivera, one of two officers killed responding to a domestic disturbance call last month. Fanone, who wanted “to honor their sacrifice and grieve alongside my peers,” cited former police officer and current New York Mayor Eric Adams’s remark, “Once a cop, always a cop. It never goes away.”\n\nFanone argued that “far too many of our elected leaders on both sides of the political aisle have placed politics and pandering above our public safety. All of us, as partners in our criminal justice system, must set clear goals and expectations for each of our law enforcement officers through open and honest dialogue and then work together to meet them.”\n\n“Adams understands this, as evidenced by his administration’s recently released ‘blueprint to end gun violence,’ a 15-page plan which includes proposals to detect and confiscate illegal guns, create new public safety units and provide mental health resources and other social programs.”\n\nPresident Biden flew to New York Thursday to meet with Adams, as Julian Zelizer noted.\n\n“The Biden administration is acknowledging the problem and taking steps to show it can be tough on crime. This visit also appears to be an attempt to push back against progressives who are calling to ‘defund the police,’ and neutralize any GOP attacks on Democrats for being soft on crime.” But Zelizer wrote that the administration shouldn’t lose sight of the genuine issues raised by the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\n“A President who tries to game out exactly what policy positions will win the elusive moderate vote in our era of polarization is taking on a fool’s errand. One thing that Biden can do, however, is take a genuine stand and promote policies that address racism in policing, sentencing and prisons because it is the right thing to do.”\n\nFor more:\n\nJeff Asher: We need to understand America’s spike in murders\n\nNFL plays defense\n\nDrew Sheneman/Tribune Content Agency\n\nFormer NFL coach Brian Flores confronted the NFL last week with a blockbuster lawsuit. “No one expected Flores, who seemed to have a long career in front of him at the age of 40, to disrupt the NFL,” wrote Roxanne Jones.\n\n“But disrupt he did.”\n\nFlores, “fed up with his treatment and that of other Black executives, filed a class-action lawsuit against the NFL and three teams Tuesday alleging racial discrimination. He is suing the Miami Dolphins over his firing in January – a termination that happened despite the team’s first consecutive winning seasons in nearly 20 years … Flores is also suing the Denver Broncos and the New York Giants, alleging those two teams discriminated against him in the hiring process. The NFL called Flores’ allegations meritless, and all the teams named in his lawsuit deny any wrongdoing.”\n\nJones saluted Flores for “fighting for equality. But he is only one man. And I’m hoping Flores won’t have to go it alone.

As Nicole Hemmer wrote, “Unlike the lose-yourself-for-hours games that dominated the early pandemic months, from low-tech jigsaw puzzles to the omnipresent Animal Crossing, Wordle meets the needs of a mostly open, still-chaotic country that has refilled its empty calendars but still faces the disruptions of constant testing and unexpected closures and quarantines. A game takes only a few minutes to play, and the platform offers only one game a day. Once you’re done, you’re done – the perfect late-pandemic pastime.”\n\nThe game makes it easy for people to share their results on social media. “Sharing Wordle scores is not just an act of community but, in some ways, a boast of intelligence,” wrote Hemmer. “Solving a Wordle with just two or three guesses feels not lucky but savvy: a combination of intellect and cleverness.”\n\nWardle’s partner Palak Shah told the Times she was grateful for his invention: “It’s really sweet,” she said. “This is definitely how Josh shows his love.”\n\nDon’t be surprised if the Wordle for Valentine’s Day is H-E-A-R-T.", "authors": ["Richard Galant"], "publish_date": "2022/02/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/beijing/2022/02/03/winter-olympics-opening-ceremony-tv-stream-info/6640759001/", "title": "2022 Winter Olympics opening ceremony: How to watch, stream online", "text": "The 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics will officially commence on Friday with the opening ceremony at the National Stadium, known as the Bird’s Nest, the same stadium that hosted the opening and closing ceremonies for the 2008 Beijing Summer Games.\n\nAlthough competition is already underway in several sports, the opening ceremony will mark the ceremonial start of the Beijing Games when the Olympic flame is officially lit.\n\nMore than 150 U.S. athletes are expected to participate in the fanfare of the opening ceremony, which includes the illustrious Parade of Nations, where athletes and officials from participating countries march into the Bird's Nest with their country's flag.\n\nThe U.S., however, will not send an official delegation after the Biden administration announced a \"diplomatic boycott\" over China's human rights abuses.

At 5 p.m., nearly all flights will cease at those airports, the airline said in a statement.\n\nFlights will begin gradually ramping up at 10 a.m. Tuesday. The airline said it expected to be fully operational by 3 p.m. Tuesday.\n\n\"This is to ensure recovery of our operations as efficiently as possible and to be fully operable by tomorrow,\" the airline said in a statement.\n\nA total of 3,621 flights had been canceled in the U.S. as of 3 p.m., according to FlightAware.com, which tracks flights. Another 4,392 have been delayed so far. Those numbers could increase throughout the day because delays and cancellations typically have a domino effect across the country.\n\nThere were 3,497 cancellations and 10,046 delayed flights in the U.S. on Sunday.\n\nChicago O'Hare airport has been the hardest hit after being pummeled by a foot of snow last week. There were 803 canceled flights there as well as 63 delays as of 1:30 p.m., according to FlightAware.com.\n\nNew York's JFK, which was shut down for a couple of hours yesterday morning when a plane skid into a snow bank, had 99 cancellations and 92 delays so far today.\n\nRon Marsico, a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the airport, said all four runways were back in service as of Sunday.\n\nDelays and cancellations rippled across the country, even down to Florida, where 43 flights were canceled and 89 delayed at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport. The airport, airlines and conventions bureau were trying to find discounted hotel rooms for stranded travelers.\n\n\"Conditions may improve or worsen depending on weather conditions in the Midwest and Northeast,\" said airport spokesman Gregory Meyer.\n\nCoupled with the weather problems, airlines were also operating under new federal rules that require pilots to spend more time sleeping between shifts and to fly fewer consecutive hours. The rules, which went into effect Saturday, were adopted after a 2009 Colgan Air crash near Buffalo that was blamed partly on pilot fatigue.\n\nAirlines say the new rules require pilots to time out and replacement pilots to step in at sometimes inopportune times like a bad weather day.\n\n\"These rules further impact our ability to operate an already disrupted schedule, causing our pilots to 'time out' even sooner,\" said Tamara Young, a spokeswoman for JetBlue, \"As a result, additional cancellations are likely to occur as we work to reset the operation.\"\n\nMorgan Durrant, a spokesman for Delta Air Lines, said the new rules had not had a significant impact on operations yet.\n\n\"By and large what we're seeing over the last few days and today is very similar to what we would have seen under the old rules,\" he said.\n\nAirlines relax rules on change fees\n\nMany airlines were waiving change fees while warning that it could take days for flights to get back to normal.\n\nAlan Bender, professor of aeronautics at Embry-Riddle University, said airlines are generally much more willing to cancel flights ahead of time because of federal rules that impose fines on them if they keep passengers on planes on tarmacs for too long.\n\n\"Airlines have been very, very proactive in cancelling flights in poor weather, or forecasted poor weather, since institution of the tarmac rule a few years ago,\" he says.\n\nAmerican Airlines canceled more than 500 flights as of 10 a.m. today \"with more to come,\" said spokesman Matt Miller.\n\n\"While there is little to no precipitation, the extremely cold temperatures in the Midwest and Northeast are having a big impact on our operations today,\" he said.\n\nHe said that fuel and glycol supplies were frozen at Chicago's O'Hare and other airports in the Midwest and Northeast.\n\n\"Additionally, our employees are only able to be out on the ramp for a few minutes at a time because wind chills are as low as 45 below zero at some airports,\" he said. \"We will have minimal operations today in Chicago and in other cities in the Midwest and Northeast.\"\n\nAmerican is offering customers scheduled to fly to, from and through 26 airports in the Midwest and Northeast the opportunity to re-book their flights without penalty.\n\nUnited Airlines spokeswoman Mary Ryan said about 200 mainline and 1,300 United Express flights were canceled so far this morning, but that those numbers would change throughout the day. The airline is based in Chicago.\n\n\"Thankfully, at least here in Chicago the snow has stopped falling,\" she said. \"But we are experiencing record low temperatures. That still has an impact on our operations.\"\n\nShe said the airline canceled flights proactively to prevent customers from traveling to the airport in freezing temperatures and give them enough time to reschedule flights online.\n\n\"I think we're still going to be looking at some reductions in the schedule through tomorrow,\" she said.\n\nUnited is offering waivers of fees and refunds to customers traveling to, from and through 22 airports if they choose not to fly through Wednesday, even if they have nonrefundable tickets.\n\nDelta canceled about 400 flights. Passengers in select states could get fee waivers.\n\nDurrant said he expects flights to start normalizing on Tuesday.\n\nSouthwest Airlines canceled almost 200 flights, said Dan Landson, an airline spokesman.\n\n\"One of our big concerns is the safety of our employees and crews. They can only be outside so long,\" he said. \"And of course, we're still trying to get back on track from last week.\"\n\nSouthwest was also waiving change fees at a number of airports.\n\nUS Airways canceled about 150 flights of both mainline and Express operations.\n\nInbound trans-Atlantic flights from Europe to Philadelphia, a US Airways hub, were running 20 to 45 mins late due to headwinds. Flights from Amsterdam to Philadelphia were necessitating a stop in Canada for fuel due to headwinds and were running two hours late.\n\nChange fees were being waived at affected cities.\n\nAllegiant Air moved 18 flights scheduled for today to tomorrow.

Just ask Fr. Zachary Navit, who said he’s been living in the terminal for almost two days with a group that was scheduled to fly out on a Catholic pilgrimage trip to Ireland.\n\n“What’s consistently come out behind the scenes in talking to people on the ground, it’s staffing,” Navit told USA TODAY. “They just do not have the staffing to handle the volume of people, the flights that are scheduled.”\n\nThe tour group he’s leading was originally scheduled to depart on Sunday evening. Their first flight to Dublin was delayed multiple times and eventually canceled, and then the whole group was rebooked for a 7 p.m. departure on Monday. They did eventually board the plane around 3:45 a.m. Tuesday, but that flight never made it out, either, because the crew eventually timed out.\n\n“The person at the gate explained, we’re just trying to keep postponing this flight instead of canceling it in the hopes of putting together a crew, but we just don’t have a crew,” Navit said.\n\nHis trip was booked through a third-party tour company, Select International Tours, which is working to rebook the group.\n\nIt’s the fourth day of travel headaches for passengers on United and other airlines in the Northeast, though United seems to be faring the worst.\n\nAccording to tracking website FlightAware, at about 2:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday, United had canceled more than 410 flights, or about 14% of its daily schedule, with 684 more flights delayed. Newark, also, had the highest cancellation rate of any airport in the country on Tuesday, with 167 departures and 209 arrivals already canceled by the early afternoon. That represents 24% of the outbound schedule and 29% of the inbound schedule for the day.\n\nOn Monday night, United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby sent a letter to his employees in which he mostly put the blame for these ongoing issues at the feet of the Federal Aviation Administration.\n\n\"The FAA frankly failed us this weekend,\" the letter said. \"The FAA reduced the arrival rates by 40% and the departure rates by 75% (on Saturday). That is almost certainly a reflection of understaffing/lower experience at the FAA. It led to massive delays, cancellations, diversions as well as crews and aircraft out of position.\"\n\nHe went on to say that those Saturday issues cascaded through the weekend as summer weather continued, with more than 150,000 passengers affected on United alone.\n\n\"To be fair, it's not the fault of the current FAA leadership that they are in this seriously understaffed position – it's been building up for a long time before they were in charge. But it's incumbent on them now to lead and take action to minimize the impact. It's not their fault, but they are responsible for solving the problem they inherited,” the letter said.\n\nThe FAA forewarned of travel headaches in the New York area this summer, saying that staffing issues were going to reduce capacity in one of the busiest sectors of the nation’s airspace. The agency preemptively asked airlines to reduce their schedules in the Northeast to account for those limitations.\n\nA United spokesperson told USA TODAY that Newark was more affected by this week's weather than other airports in the New York area, and that the airline is continuing to work to recover its operations. United has issued a waiver for some major Northeast airports, providing passengers with extra flexibility to rebook if they are scheduled to travel in the region through Wednesday. The airline also recommends that passengers keep track of their flight status and use self-help rebooking tools as much as possible.\n\nThe FAA issued a statement responding to Kirby’s letter.\n\n“We will always collaborate with anyone seriously willing to join us to solve a problem,” it said.\n\nFlight delayed or canceled?:Why what you're owed may be less than you think\n\nBut that’s probably cold comfort to travelers who are stranded, like Thompson Gerhart.\n\nThe 34-year-old was on his way to Malta for a family trip and was approaching 24 hours at the airport on Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“We’re, I don’t know, three or four, maybe even five gates away from where the customer service desk is, and the line is forming around here,” he said. United was able to rebook his group on flights for Friday, but he said now they’re trying to see if they can get their bags back so they’ll have the clothes and other necessities they’d packed for the time they were supposed to be away.\n\nTo other travelers headed to Newark, he said: brace yourselves.\n\n“Expect delays. I would definitely say that, and if things do get to the point where they’re delayed or canceled, you may be better off trying to start a rebooking process on your own, because everyone’s going through a lot of pain right now,” he said.\n\nZach Wichter is a travel reporter for USA TODAY based in New York.

The exchange, however, did not include another American that the State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan.\n\n“She’s safe, she’s on a plane, she’s on her way home,” Biden said at the White House Thursday morning alongside Griner’s wife, Cherelle. “After months of being unjustly detained in Russia, held under untolerable circumstances, Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones, and she should have been there all along.”\n\nBiden acknowledged that Griner’s release was occurring while Whelan remained imprisoned, saying that Whelan’s family “have to have such mixed emotions today.”\n\n“This was not a choice of which American to bring home,” Biden said. “Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul’s case differently than Brittney’s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul’s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up.”\n\nGriner is expected to land in San Antonio, Texas, a US official told CNN.\n\nGriner’s February arrest in Russia sparked diplomatic drama between the US and the Kremlin that played out alongside Russia’s war in Ukraine. At the same time that the US enacted crippling sanctions in response to the Ukraine war, US diplomats kept open lines of communication with Moscow over prisoner negotiations to try to secure the release of both Griner and Whelan.\n\nBiden said efforts to bring Griner home took “painstaking and intense negotiations” as he thanked members of his administration who were involved.\n\n“This is a day we’ve worked toward for a long time. We never stopped pushing for her release,” he said.\n\nThe prisoner swap occurred in Abu Dhabi Thursday, according to senior Biden administration officials. A joint statement from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia said the Gulf countries played a role mediating the exchange between the US and Russia.\n\nAsked when Griner would be home following his remarks, Biden indicated it would be in the next “24 hours.” As for what he would say to Whelan’s family, he said, “We’re speaking to them.”\n\nCherelle Griner thanked the administration for helping secure her wife’s release and said she was “overwhelmed with emotions.”\n\nBoth she and Brittney Griner “will remain committed to the work of getting every American home, including Paul, whose family is in our hearts today,” she added.\n\nThe Griner family echoed those sentiments in a statement Thursday night.\n\n“We sincerely thank you all for the kind words, thoughts and prayers - including Paul and the Whelan family who have been generous with their support for Brittney and our family during what we know is a heartbreaking time,” the family said. “We pray for Paul and for the swift and safe return of all wrongfully-detained Americans.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch President Biden give remarks after Brittney Griner release 04:19 - Source: CNN\n\nWhelan told CNN in an exclusive phone call from the penal colony where is being held in a remote part of Russia that he was “disappointed” the Biden administration has not done more to secure his release. Whelan said he was happy that Griner was released, but that he “was led to believe that things were moving in the right direction, and that the governments were negotiating and that something would happen fairly soon.”\n\n“I don’t understand why I’m still sitting here,” he said.\n\nThe Biden administration has ideas about “new forms of offers” they are going to try with the Russians in an effort to secure Whelan’s release, a senior administration official told CNN on Thursday.\n\nThe official said there is a recognition that the US needs to make available “something more, something different” from what they have offered to the Russians thus far – and didn’t rule out offering a Russian spy in US custody in a potential prisoner swap.\n\n“There is a willingness to pay even a very big price on the part of this president,” the official said. “We have made clear to the Russians, that we at least are open to talking about that which is at our disposal, that which we could actually deliver. It would be somebody in our custody.”\n\nThe Griner prisoner exchange prompted criticism from Republicans, who accused the Biden administration of releasing a dangerous prisoner back to Russia while not securing Whelan’s release.\n\n“This is a gift to Vladimir Putin, and it endangers American lives,” tweeted House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy. “Leaving Paul Whelan behind for this is unconscionable.”\n\nGriner – who, for years, had played in the off-season for a Russian women’s basketball team – had been detained since February, when she was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region. Despite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil that was found in her luggage, she was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in the Mordovia republic in mid-November after losing her appeal.\n\n‘The only deal we could make right now’\n\nMonths and months of “difficult” negotiations with the Russians culminated in Thursday’s prisoner swap, senior US administration officials said, with it becoming clear only in recent weeks that an opening existed to secure the American basketball player’s release.\n\nThe final deal itself came together over the past 48 hours, the officials said, launching the process of moving Griner from the penal colony where she was serving a lengthy sentence.\n\nThat opening, while a significant breakthrough, was still a “painful” one, the officials said: in exchange for a convicted arms dealer, Russia would only agree to release Griner, leaving another American – Whelan – behind. In multiple engagements over the past weeks and months, Russian officials made clear that releasing Bout was the only way they would free Griner from her detention.\n\nBiden gave final approval for the prisoner swap freeing Griner over the past week, an official familiar with the matter said.\n\nBiden was briefed throughout the morning as he awaited confirmation that Griner was back in US hands, a US official said. Once that happened, Biden spoke with Griner from the Oval Office, with Cherelle Griner, Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also on the call, a second official said.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Brittney Griner's wife speaks about WNBA star's release 01:49 - Source: CNN\n\nThe Russians signaled recently that they were only willing to negotiate for Griner and not Whelan, a US official said, because Russia said it has been handling their cases differently based on what each has been accused of.\n\nThe Biden administration repeatedly made offers to get Whelan released as part of this deal, even after Russia made clear only Griner was acceptable.\n\nIn the end, when it was clear Russia was going to refuse on Whelan, the US had to accept it.\n\n“It was a choice to get Brittney or nothing,” the US official said.\n\nThe official says that was a “difficult decision” for Biden, but again, one he felt he had to make.\n\nGriner was moved from the penal colony to Moscow within the last 48 hours. Thursday morning, she boarded a plane for the United Arab Emirates. Upon arriving there, she was met on the tarmac by US officials, including special presidential envoy for hostage affairs Roger Carstens. She was in “an extremely upbeat mood” and “all smiles” and “grateful.”\n\nWhelan family ‘devastated’\n\nWhelan, a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges he has vehemently denied. Whelan had been carrying out his sentence at a different labor camp in Mordovia, an eight-hour drive from Moscow, where he told CNN in June 2021 he spent his days working in a clothing factory that he called a “sweatshop.”\n\nWhelan’s family expressed happiness at the news that Griner is on her way home but said Thursday they are “devastated” that he was left behind.\n\n“It’s a great day for the families of the wrongfully detained and we feel wonderful for them,” David Whelan, Paul’s brother, said on “CNN This Morning.” “But we do worry about what’s in Paul’s future. I think it’s become clear that the US doesn’t have any concessions that the Russian government wants for Paul. So I’m not really sure what the future holds.”\n\nThe Biden administration told Whelan’s family ahead of the Griner announcement, David Whelan said.\n\nIn an email to the media, David Whelan said his family was “devastated” at the news and increasingly worries that Paul won’t survive the rest of his sentence.\n\nAs it became clear that Whelan would not be released alongside Griner, Whelan’s sister was visited in person by senior US government officials to “share and talk through” the news, according to senior administration officials.\n\nEarlier this year, after the US secured the release of Trevor Reed, another American who’d been detained in Russia since 2019, Paul Whelan expressed frustration through a statement shared by his parents.\n\n“Why was I left behind?” Whelan said in April. “While I am pleased Trevor is home with his family, I have been held on a fictitious charge of espionage for 40 months.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Brother of Paul Whelan reacts after sibling remains detained in Russia 02:59 - Source: CNN\n\n‘Merchant of Death’ included in swap\n\nBout has returned home to Russia, the Russian foreign ministry said Thursday. The prisoner exchange with Griner was “completed successfully at Abu Dhabi Airport” on Thursday, the ministry said.\n\nIt was a US decision to have the exchange happen in Abu Dhabi, an official familiar with the discussion said. “Russia was happy with it,” then UAE facilitated and provided the venue.\n\nWhen Putin and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, known as MBZ, met in Russia in October, one of the issues they discussed was prisoner exchanges, and there was an agreement that the UAE could be helpful on the topic, a senior UAE official told CNN.\n\nThe US was aware that MBZ planned to raise the topic with Putin and there was nothing but encouragement from the US side, the official said.\n\n“There was criticism of the Putin meeting at the time. But that meeting is part of the reason that Griner was released today,” the official said.\n\nIn his statement Thursday, Biden thanked the United Arab Emirates for its help with the exchange.\n\nThe UAE and Saudi Arabia said in a joint statement that the two countries were involved in joint mediation efforts leading to the prisoner swap. The statement said that the “success of the mediation efforts is a reflection of the mutual and solid friendship that connects both countries with the United States of America, and the Russian Federation.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Watch interview with Viktor Bout 13 years ago from Thai jail after US sting operation 03:00 - Source: CNN\n\nAsked about the role of Saudi Arabia, US officials suggested a number of countries were involved.\n\n“We have and I’m sure we’ll continue to lean on partners around the world to work this through with us and to give us their ideas and to impress upon the Russians how important it is to us to resolve these sorts of cases. We appreciate when those partners do help us,” an administration official said.\n\nBout, nicknamed the “Merchant of Death,” is a former Soviet military officer serving a 25-year prison sentence in the United States on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles, and provide material support to a terrorist organization. Moscow had slammed his sentencing in 2012 as “baseless and biased” and Bout has maintained he is innocent.\n\nSteve Zissou, Bout’s lawyer in the US, told CNN on Thursday that the prisoner swap between Griner and his client was “fair.”\n\n“As I have urged for some time, given the 15 long years that Viktor Bout has been in custody since the United States government targeted him in 2006, his exchange for Brittney Griner, who has only been in custody for a few months, is fair,” Zissou said in a statement.\n\nZissou told CNN said that his legal team knew a swap was imminent 24 hours ago.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.", "authors": ["Jennifer Hansler Kylie Atwood Jeremy Herb Mj Lee Kevin Liptak", "Jennifer Hansler", "Kylie Atwood", "Jeremy Herb", "Mj Lee", "Kevin Liptak"], "publish_date": "2022/12/08"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/20/middleeast/russia-iran-friendship-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "Iran and Russia's friendship is more complicated than it seems | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: A version of this story first appeared in CNN’s Meanwhile in the Middle East newsletter, a three-times-a-week look inside the region’s biggest stories. Sign up here.\n\nAbu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\nOne image distributed by Iranian media on Tuesday of Russia and Iran’s leaders meeting stood out. Russian President Vladimir Putin is shown clasping palms with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as the two rulers – both heads of oil-rich countries grappling with grueling Western sanctions – boast about their tight partnership.\n\nRussia and Iran say they are now closer than ever as the West clamps down on both states. But some observers say the two countries’ highly publicized friendship has both a tumultuous past and a difficult future ahead.\n\nIn his first trip outside the former Soviet Union since the Ukraine war, Putin on Tuesday landed in the Iranian capital Tehran, where he met with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, as well as the country’s highest-ranking ruler, Khamenei.\n\nPutin’s visit was part of a trilateral meeting with Raisi and NATO leader Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has so far refused to join in on Russian sanctions and offered to play a mediating role between Moscow and Kyiv.\n\nBut some analysts are skeptical of the true strength of Russia and Iran’s declared friendship, with some saying the meeting was mostly about the optics, signaling potential cooperation as opposed to the more modest support both countries currently give one another.\n\nIn the past, Russia had always “overpromised and underdelivered,” said Ali Vaez, Iran Project Director at Crisis Group, a think tank in Washington, D.C., and has even “stabbed [Iran] in the back repeatedly and sold it to the highest bidder.”\n\nBut options for Iran and Russia are limited, he added, and so they cannot afford to alienate one another.\n\nThe timing of the meeting is also pertinent, coming just days after US President Joe Biden ended a Middle East tour that many hoped would yield more oil and forge a stronger regional alliance against Iran, yet ended in Biden going home largely empty-handed.\n\nThe Islamic Republic has accused the US of rallying the region against it, planting instability and spreading “Iranophobia.”\n\nThe meeting is, from Tehran’s point of view, “a signal of strength in response to the American attempt to show itself as in charge of the region,” Mohammad Marandi, a professor at the University of Tehran, told CNN’s Becky Anderson on Tuesday, who added that Biden’s trip to Saudi Arabia “was perhaps seen as a sign of weakness” and is “representative of a relative decline of the United States.”\n\nRussia is in a similarly isolated position after becoming the world’s most heavily sanctioned country in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine. Iran comes in second, according to Castellum.Ai, which tracks sanctions.\n\nThe two oil-rich states were keen to show their tight alliance in Tuesday’s meeting, with Iran showing strong support for Russia’s war effort in Ukraine.\n\nIn a bilateral meeting with Raisi, Putin said he was “very pleased to be on the hospitable Iranian soil” and that the two countries “can boast about record figures in terms of trade growth.”\n\nThe talks also brought forth a $40 billion agreement between Iran’s national oil company and Russia’s state-run gas company Gazprom, according to a statement from Shana, the news agency for Iran’s oil ministry. The memorandum of understanding is meant to develop Iranian gas fields and build new pipelines for export.\n\nHowever, Iran’s heavily restricted economy and Russia’s past ventures in the Persian Gulf state are driving skepticism about whether the deal will indeed materialize.\n\nThe Gazprom deal is an example of the complexities facing close Russian-Iranian cooperation, says Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder and CEO of the Bourse & Bazaar Foundation think tank in London.\n\n“It is part of a pageantry of state visits,” he said. “It does not obligate Russia to invest and Russia is not going to invest in Iran’s energy sector while Iran’s energy sector is under stricter sanctions than Russia’s energy sector.”\n\nInvestment in Iran’s energy sector would “trigger enforcement action from the US that would jeopardize Russia’s continued energy exports to Europe and to other countries,” Batmanghelidj added.\n\nUnlike Russia, Iran is under secondary US sanctions that place firms or individuals that deal with Iran at risk of being penalized.\n\nGazprom had previously signed a gas deal with Iran’s National Oil Company in 2016, when Iran was not yet under secondary sanctions, but which “didn’t lead anywhere” due to several barriers constricting Iran’s economy, said Batmanghelidj.\n\nRussia has in the past hindered Iranian policy when it stood as an obstacle to key interests.\n\nThe two countries have also recently fallen into a tense energy competition as they scramble to find buyers for their sanctioned oil. As the West began barring Russian oil, Moscow has been biting into Tehran’s last remaining lifeline for its energy exports –, China – , leading to an oil price war where Russia still maintains the upper hand.\n\nAnd in March, Russia rose as a temporary hurdle in nuclear talks with Iran, asking for guarantees that protect its own national interests as Western sanctions fell down on Moscow.\n\n“The track record is full of so many negative experiences, where Iran felt that Russia has undercut Iran,” said Batmanghelidj, adding that in many situations Russia acted as “ruthless and self-serving country” in its dealings with Iran.\n\n“It takes a long time for two countries to build genuine trust,” he said.\n\nWhile there is relatively little Russia can expect Iran to do to help help it emerge from its heavily sanctioned economy, the US has warned that Tehran is planning to help Russia on the battlefield in Ukraine.\n\nEarlier this July, the White House said that Iran is expected to supply Russia with “hundreds” of drones – including weapons-capable drones — for use in the war in Ukraine and that Iran is preparing to begin training Russian forces on how to operate them as soon as this month.\n\nIran has denied selling drones to Russia, but on Tuesday, Iranian media reported that Iran is ready to export military equipment and weapons to friendly nations, quoting an Iranian army general.\n\nIran’s experience in evading sanctions may also be of use to Russia, said Vaez, showing Moscow the tricks – and limitations – of living with a restricted economy.\n\n“I think it is completely natural that both sides are thinking about creating a club of sanctioned states,” he added, “But I think there are also limits to how far they can go.”\n\nThe digest\n\nAustralian teenager dies while detained in Syrian prison\n\nAn Australian teenager who was forced as a child to live under the Islamic State (ISIS), has died in detention in a northeastern Syrian prison, Human Rights Watch says, citing family members. The rights group said Monday that 17-year-old Yusuf Zahab’s family had previously asked the Australian government to bring him home, but to no avail.\n\nBackground: There are believed to be 41,000 foreigners held in camps and prisons in northeast Syria, many being children living in poor conditions. Diseases like tuberculosis and deaths from serious wounds are reportedly not uncommon. It is unclear what Zahab died of, but his story is not unique – like many in detention, he was forced to live under ISIS when brought from his native country at a young age against his will. His family were then captured by US-backed Syrian forces a few years later.\n\nWhy it matters: The Syrian Defense Forces currently have between 69 and 80 Australian nationals detained, mostly women and children, according to HRW, but Australia’s government only repatriated eight citizens in 2019. They are not alone in their hesitancy to bring home citizens, as many nations cite security concerns.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s economy expected to grow an average of nearly 4% a year until 2026\n\nThe credit rating agency Moody’s has given Saudi Arabia a top score and says it expects the Gulf powerhouse to grow 3.9% yearly from 2022 to 2026, according to the Saudi Press Agency. The country’s robust balance sheet, relatively modest debt levels and large oil reserves were factors considered in Moody’s stable outlook.\n\nBackground: Some of the world’s biggest hydrocarbon producers , the Gulf nations are seeing billions of dollars added to their coffers aided by a Ukraine war-driven rally in oil prices. They are expected to register their first budget surpluses after an eight-year oil slump that was compounded by a pandemic-linked downturn.\n\nWhy it matters: Despite the recent oil-linked boon to the Saudi economy, its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman continues his mission to diversify its sources of revenue for a post-oil future. After an oil price crash induced by the pandemic slowed down his Vision 2030 plan two years ago, it seems the Gulf nation’s economy is back on track and possibly stronger than ever.\n\nHuman rights groups demand action on decaying oil tanker off Yemen\n\nSeveral humanitarian and human rights groups are again calling for a government-led salvage operation of a supertanker moored off Yemen’s coast to prevent an environmental catastrophe. The groups, which include Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, said in a statement Monday that the enormous FSO Safer oil storage tanker sitting in the Red Sea could explode or rupture at any moment.\n\nBackground: The FSO Safer tanker – which contains 1.1 million barrels of oil, or more than four times the amount spilled in 1989 by the Exxon Valdez 2 – has been “deserted” off Yemen’s coast since 2015 and continues to deteriorate. The United Nations have been trying to inspect the vessel for years, but cannot due to insufficient funding\n\nWhy it matters: Fisheries are responsible for providing subsistence for 1.7 million people in the country, which is in its seventh year of conflict and is on brink of famine. Nearly all of those fisheries are under threat if there is a major oil spill, according to a 2021 study published in the journal Nature Sustainability.\n\nWhat to watch\n\nFrance is on the lookout for alternative energy sources as Europe prepares for the worst amid gas disruptions from Russia, and just days ago signed an energy deal with the United Arab Emirates during a state visit by UAE President Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan to Paris.\n\nFrench foreign minister Bruno Le Maire tells CNN’s Becky Anderson that France “must be prepared” for the possibility that Putin cuts off gas for all of Europe.\n\n\"I really think that nuclear energy will be one of the key advantages for France facing this question of energy supply\"\n\n\n\nFrench Fin.

Crop One Holdings & Emirates Flight Catering\n\nThe Gulf has never been known for its lush vegetation or bountiful soil. The desert heat, which can reach 120°F in the summer months, makes it almost impossible to grow traditional produce on a large scale.\n\nHowever innovative modern technology has changed the future of farming, as indoor vertical farms spring up across the world, from Los Angeles to Kyoto.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is also experimenting with new ways to produce food locally, most recently in opening one of the world’s largest indoor vertical farms in Dubai.\n\nCrop One, a Boston-based food technology company, and Emirates Flight Catering (EKFC), a subsidiary of the Emirates Group, best known for its airline, have teamed up to build a 330,000 square foot facility – that’s nearly six football pitches in size.\n\nIt aims to produce more than 900,000kg of crops annually, which won’t require washing or contain artificial pesticides and other chemicals. The farm will use 95% less water than traditionally grown greens, according to Crop One.\n\nOne of the other advantages of vertical farming is the removal of seasonal constraints and weather changes, allowing a year-long harvest. Dubai’s newest vertical farm is no different, promising to produce fresh food 365 days a year.\n\nCritics of vertical farming say the technique uses too much energy and is more expensive than traditional farming.\n\nBut rising temperatures and extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change are making farming conditions increasingly challenging and disrupting food distribution. Countries such as the UAE, which are heavily dependent on food imports, can also be vulnerable to external shocks like Russia’s war on Ukraine; hence the adoption of technologies like vertical farms and smart greenhouses to increase local food production – even in the desert.\n\nBy Eoin McSweeney\n\nPhoto of the day", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim"], "publish_date": "2022/07/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/10/business/china-covid-lockdowns-impact-global-business-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "How China's Covid lockdowns are taking a toll on global companies ...", "text": "International brands are revealing the damage to their bottom lines from China’s “zero Covid” policy, where tens of millions of people remain in lockdown and almost every major business has been disrupted.\n\nIn recent weeks, dozens of mainland Chinese cities, including the financial hub of Shanghai, have been locked down as authorities work to stamp out the coronavirus. For industries ranging from Big Tech to consumer goods, that’s destroying both supply and demand — and giving executives another major headache.\n\nMany companies had just run up millions, or billions, of dollars in losses due to the war in Ukraine, which led to a massive — and costly — corporate exodus from Russia.\n\nThe combination of both events has created a staggering one-two punch for multinational corporations, such as Estée Lauder (EL), which said last week that the “two significant headwinds” forced it to slash its outlook for the year.\n\nThe crisis is a stark reminder of China’s outsized importance to global companies.\n\n“Like it or not, at this point if you’re a multinational, China is probably your first or second largest consumer market,” said Ben Cavender, managing director of the consultancy China Market Research Group.\n\n“And it’s probably your major base of production, or it’s responsible for some significant amount of your supply chain work,” he said in an interview from Shanghai, which has been under lockdown for six weeks.\n\nThe measures have left tens of millions of people confined at home for more than a month, leading to high levels of mental stress. In many cases, residents are unable to leave their apartments without special permission from community leaders, and a large number of businesses remain closed.\n\nNo mood to shop\n\nIn recent years, China has become the biggest market for a range of industries, from luxury goods to automobiles. But last month, the world’s second-largest economy slowed sharply, hitting not only consumer spending but also employment.\n\nEstée Lauder, which is home to Bobbi Brown and MAC cosmetics, now expects its global sales to grow between 7% and 9% year-on-year, down from a previous range of 13% to 16% outlined in February.\n\nThe company said it had taken a hit from suspending all business in Russia and Ukraine following the invasion, leading to a decline in sales. Sales also fell 4% in Asia Pacific over the last quarter, which was “driven entirely by Greater China,” Chief Financial Officer Tracey Travis said on an earnings call.\n\nSome businesses have declined to make a forecast at all.\n\nLast week, Starbucks (SBUX) suspended financial guidance for the next six months, with CEO Howard Schultz calling it “the only responsible course of action.”\n\n“The situation in China is unprecedented,” he told analysts on an earnings call. “Conditions in China are such that we have virtually no ability to predict our performance in China in the back half of the year.” The country is Starbucks’ second biggest market.\n\nA pedestrian walking by a closed Starbucks outlet in Hangzhou in April. LONG WEI/ Feature China/Future Publishing/Getty Images\n\nKering, the owner of Gucci and Bottega Veneta, said last month that it was also feeling the pain, with “sharp drops in traffic,” store closures and major logistics challenges posed by the lockdowns.\n\n“The situation is hopefully temporary,” Chief Financial Officer Jean-Marc Duplaix said on a corporate sales call.\n\nHowever, the mood on the ground is gloomier.\n\nThe situation in China is unprecedented. Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz\n\n“Frankly speaking, consumers right now are not worried about buying lipstick or coffee,” said Cavender. “They’re really much more focused on getting [necessities].”\n\nIn Shanghai, for instance, the lockdown initially led to a massive scramble for food and widespread complaints about difficulties receiving deliveries.\n\nNow, even as access improves, many people concentrate on what’s known as “group buying,” allowing users who live in the same community to place bulk orders together for groceries and other essentials.\n\nEven those who aren’t stuck at home may be affected. Consumers who live in cities without restrictions might also hesitate to go out and hit the mall, for fear of “what has happened in Shanghai,” where people remain in lockdown indefinitely, said Cavender.\n\n“It’s been a very big negative drag on consumption.”\n\nStill the world’s factory\n\nCompanies are also facing trouble at the back end.\n\nOver the last few years, many businesses have worked to shift at least some of their manufacturing outside China, thanks to the trade war with the United States. But that hasn’t prevented a large number of household names from getting caught up in the country’s Covid crackdown.\n\nLast month, Apple (AAPL) warned of huge losses related to the Covid-19 outbreak in China, saying that supply chain issues could hit its sales by as much as $4 billion to $8 billion this quarter.\n\nApple blamed the expected revenue drop on both restrictions in China and component shortages worldwide. Some of the shutdowns briefly affected about 20% to 30% of all iPhone production, according to Everstream Analytics, a firm that provides supply chain risk analysis.\n\nApple’s constraints were “primarily centered around the Shanghai corridor,” where it has several factories that were impacted, CEO Tim Cook said in an earnings call.\n\nIn some cases, the tension has boiled over. Videos posted on Chinese social media last week showed workers from a factory in Shanghai flooding past barriers and clashing with security guards dressed in hazmat suits, suggesting heightened friction over weeks of lockdowns. It was not immediately clear what exactly sparked the incident.\n\nThe factory is owned by Quanta, a Taiwanese Apple supplier. According to Chinese state news outlet Xinhua, the plant had resumed work under a closed loop system, whereby workers live in designated areas and adhere to strict protocols.\n\nApple referred CNN Business to Quanta when asked about the matter. Quanta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAn outdoor advertisement for the Apple iPhone 13 Pro, seen in April in Wuhan, China. Getty Images/Getty Images\n\nLast month, Microsoft (MSFT) also said that shutdowns in Chinese production had hurt its supply for Surface laptops and Xbox consoles, and could potentially “have a big impact” on its quarterly performance. Much of the PC maker’s production is in China, according to its most recent list of top suppliers.\n\nThe global auto industry has also been particularly hard hit, with some players temporarily shuttering factories, suffering a slump in sales or having to delay launches of new cars.\n\nTwo of the world’s biggest automakers, Volkswagen (VLKAF) and Toyota (TM), were both forced to suspend production for weeks recently. While both companies have since resumed production, they warned that they would only build up gradually as supply chain snags continued.\n\nTesla (TSLA), which runs a Gigafactory in Shanghai, also managed to restart production last month after a shutdown of several weeks, but the company may have hit another snag.\n\nOn Tuesday, Reuters reported, citing unidentified sources, that Tesla production had halted most production again due to issues with suppliers. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAccording to Cavender, many auto suppliers have continued to face difficulties keeping their own factories up and running, or delivering components.\n\nDemand for electric vehicles has stayed strong though: Both Volkswagen and Chinese manufacturer BYD reported a recent surge in Chinese sales.\n\nChinese ports and other logistics hubs continue to face troubles, however.\n\nLast month, Amazon (AMZN) flagged that “line-haul air and ocean shipping rates continue to be at or above the rates in the second half of last year” in part because of China’s Covid surge.\n\nThose “were already much higher than pre-Covid levels,” Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told analysts during the company’s results presentation, citing the spread of the Omicron variant in China and labor shortages in various locations.\n\nThe aftermath\n\nMany brands have expressed optimism about a recovery for their businesses once the crisis subsides.\n\nIn recent weeks, the Chinese government has worked to get more businesses up and running, while also vowing to help curb the economic damage.\n\nBut analysts have warned of the adverse effects of the country’s “zero Covid” policy, saying that the economy could slow significantly this year.\n\nThe damage can be seen on all sides. Last month, China’s enormous services sector suffered its second steepest drop on record, while manufacturing activities also hit a record low.\n\nHealth workers wearing protective clothing at the entrance to a Covid-19 testing site at a shopping complex in Beijing. Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nDespite that, Chinese President Xi Jinping has doubled down on the country’s pandemic approach, saying Thursday that the government would “resolutely adhere to” its “zero Covid” policy.\n\nAccording to CNN’s latest calculation based on government data, at least 31 cities in China are under either full or partial lockdown, potentially affecting about 214 million people across the country.\n\nThe ongoing dilemma may ultimately lead some businesses to reconsider their positions, according to trade groups.\n\nAs other nations continue to reopen, some foreign companies may consider moving their regional headquarters out of China, according to Jörg Wuttke, president of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\n“I definitely see discussions,” he told CNN Business.\n\nPedestrians along the near-empty Nanjing Road shopping street outside of the impacted areas during a lockdown in Shanghai, China in March.

This is not the time when you want any variability at all, especially when you have terrain considerations.\"\n\nDisabled travelers:Airlines must do better in their handling of wheelchairs\n\nAs the FAA's statement above said, in order to let passengers use their cell service onboard, operators would have to prove that the devices wouldn't interfere with the plane's communication or navigation systems.\n\n\"There’s no extensive testing that is done on all the different types of airplanes combined with all the different types of cellphones,\" Pruchnicki said. \"There’s a tremendous amount of different combinations here.\"\n\nPlus, he said, at cruising altitude, most phones aren't powerful enough to connect to cell towers on the ground, but they drain your battery trying to link up anyway.\n\nWhat's the worst that could happen?\n\nIn theory, electronic interference could cause a plane crash – though there's no proof that has ever happened.\n\n\"From an accident investigation perspective, we have no evidence whatsoever that this has caused an accident, but that doesn’t mean that it can’t be responsible for an accident or that it can’t cause an accident,\" Pruchnicki said. \"This is even more of an unknown because the newer aircraft that we have out there are even more sophisticated and are even more automation-dependent.\"\n\nA comfier ride? Spirit Airlines will offer new seats with more padding\n\nPruchnicki added that the Federal Communications Commission has found that cellphones that aren't in flight mode can overload the networks on the ground, especially during takeoff and landing as they try to connect to multiple towers at once.\n\nHow is airplane Wi-Fi different? And what about 5G?\n\nMany airlines provide onboard internet access, and passengers can use their personal devices to access it, even while in airplane mode. Pruchnicki said onboard Wi-Fi systems don't present the same risks as cell networks do.\n\nThey operate at a lower strength and different frequencies than cellphones and flight instruments are less of an interference risk.\n\nSimilarly, 5G uses wavelengths that are less likely to interfere with airplane instruments than older-generation cell services.\n\n\"In principle, any wireless device may interfere with systems in the airplane such as the radio altimeter,\" said Eduardo Rojas-Nastrucci, an associate professor of electrical and computer engineering at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. \"In the particular case for 5G, there are bands that are far enough in frequency from the frequencies the airplane uses that the risk is minimal.\"\n\nDeals over the Atlantic:A head-to-head review of Play at Norse Atlantic Airways\n\nAdvice for travelers\n\nBecause the question hasn't been thoroughly studied and tested, most experts say it's just common sense to follow the FAA regulation.\n\n\"With no plans to investigate this with any level of certainty and because it’s pretty uncommon to be able to receive a signal above 10 or 15,000 feet, there’s really no point in risking safety to change this restriction,\" Pruchnicki said. \"With so many unknowns and lack of testing, why would you put the flight at risk just to advise your family that you’re five minutes from landing?\"\n\nAs 5G service becomes more common and the airline industry moves toward enabling cell phone use in flight, Rojas-Nastrucci said it's still a good idea for those with older-generation cell phones to keep using airplane mode, even if the risk is relatively low.\n\n\"If you’re on a highway, if you have a car that’s right next to you in the lane, there’s a higher risk of interfering than if the car is 10 lanes away,\" he said, and added that the technology that enables 5G use onboard likely won't be compatible with older-generation receivers anyway.\n\n'Too good to be true':Why booking flights on third-party websites can be risky\n\nDrazen, however, said she'll probably just keep forgetting to flip the switch.\n\n\"Is that going to change my behavior? Probably not,\" she said. \"Will I feel guilty if the plane I’m on crashes? 100%. Am I willing to take that chance? I’m not sure.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/12/01"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/15/business/russia-sanctions-iran-playbook-04-15-2022-mime-intl/index.html", "title": "If Russia wants to evade sanctions, it could learn from Iran's ...", "text": "Abu Dhabi, UAE CNN —\n\nAs Russia faces unprecedented sanctions on virtually all sectors of its economy, it may have to turn to a trusted ally with more than four decades of experience with Western embargoes.\n\nUntil the Ukraine war, Iran was the most sanctioned country in the world, according to Castellum.Ai, which tracks sanctions. Russia now holds that record and the two countries are in what analysts call “a marriage of convenience” that is likely to grow stronger as the war in Ukraine escalates.\n\n“Common interests in helping the other evade sanctions are important to these dynamics in Russia-Iran relations,” said Giorgio Cafiero, CEO of Gulf State Analytics in Washington DC.\n\nAmid tit-for-tat air blockades between Moscow and the West last month, Russian transport minister Vitaly Savelyev said his country is “studying the case of Iran” to help it deal with sanctions on maintenance and spare parts. Iran still operates some planes purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution that ruptured its ties with the West.\n\n“This bilateral relationship will likely grow stronger as the war in Ukraine rages on, especially if the Vienna talks fail to revive the JCPOA,” Cafiero added, referring to the 2015 deal that put verifiable limits on Iran’s nuclear program designed to prevent the country from obtaining a nuclear weapon. He noted that Iran’s isolation will further push Tehran to make itself useful to the Kremlin.\n\nAfter decades of Western economic constraints, the Islamic Republic has become a master of evasion, using illicit markets and manipulating vessel-tracking to circumvent sanctions. Today, Russia is living a similar crisis as the West clamps down on Moscow in an effort to cripple its war effort.\n\nCan Russia follow Iran’s lead to circumvent Western sanctions? Some analysts say it already is.\n\nThe US, the G7 group of rich nations, and the European Union have imposed a series of unprecedented sanctions on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine on February 24.\n\nThe largest blow, however, would be to Russian energy, which by 2020 made up more than half of Russia’s exports. The US and Britain have already banned Russian oil. Today, the EU – which remains highly dependent on Russia’s supply – is considering a similar move, but is yet to reach consensus on the matter.\n\nOne way Russia can learn to survive potential sanctions on its oil is to shift vessels and rebrand its blend, a tactic that has been used by Iran.\n\nIran has in the past hidden millions of oil barrels off little-known ports in Asia to escape Western sanctions, Reuters reported in 2012. Barrel transfers in the dead of night from one vessel to another allowed Iran to masquerade under different flags, selling its oil to keen Asian buyers without catching the eye of Western monitors. Iran didn’t respond to a request for comment, Reuters added.\n\n“About 8% of the world’s largest tankers are now engaged in the smuggling of sanctioned oil, largely comprising Iranian and Venezuelan product,” said Cormac Mc Garry, security expert at Control Risks in London.\n\n“Ghosting” is the most commonly used mechanism, Mc Garry told CNN, whereby ships turn off their automatic identification systems as they switch cargo from one vessel to another.\n\n“The trick here is that the second tanker may look completely compliant [with sanctions], and the trader or consumer can be duped into thinking they have purchased an unsanctioned cargo,” said Mc Garry.\n\nWindward, an Israeli maritime intelligence company, said that over the past month it identified Russian crude trading under the radar, where there were ship-to-ship operations between oil tankers departing from Russian ports with other oil tankers. Tankers engaged in this activity arrived in North America, Asia, Russia and Europe, according to Windward.\n\n“While the new restrictions are changing vessel behaviors … it seems like some companies are maintaining business as usual, by concealing their actions and trying to keep regulatory bodies … in the dark,” wrote Windward in a blog post.\n\nIn Iran’s case, remote Malaysian territories were used as “blending” or “re-branding” spots, where Iranian oil would be mixed with others and sold as a non-Iranian product to international buyers. “Malaysian blends” have been a known gateway to evading oil sanctions, with Asian buyers – specifically Chinese – making use of the rebranded mix to purchase sanctioned oil.\n\nRussia is already taking a similar route, its oil now rebranded as “Latvian blend” – a 49.99%-Russian mix that is blended with other oil and labelled Latvian. The crude has been bought by UK-based oil and gas company Shell, Bloomberg reported.\n\nDealing with sanctioned oil risks both reputational and financial damage, but demand for crude could still drive some buyers to the deep ends of black markets, analysts say.\n\n“Commodities markets are already being squeezed due to supply concerns and so it is not clear that Russian supplies can be replaced,” said Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, founder and CEO of the Bourse & Bazaar Foundation think tank in London.\n\nFinancially, Iran has built a shadowy network that uses front companies and circuitous transactions to launder money and dodge sanctions, analysts say, which some believe may be offered for Russian use.\n\nThose companies are used to give the appearance that there is no Iran connection, said Richard Nephew, a scholar at Columbia’s Center on Global Energy Policy in New York who previously serves as deputy sanctions chief at the State Department and director of Iranian Affairs at the US National Security Council.\n\nFront companies are a tactic that Nephew believes Russia would be keen to learn from.\n\n“I think that Iran would be prepared to help Russia with respect to some sanctions evasion tools,” said Nephew, “but of course, this assumes that Iran itself has access that it can make readily available.”\n\nSanction evasion is not an easy task, said Batmanghelidj. And while finding complicit partners delays economic collapse in the short-term, it still cuts the chances of long-term profit.\n\n“The main lesson that Russian should draw from Iran’s experience is that evading sanctions and resisting sanctions is hard,” said Batmanghelidj. “At best, Russia can aim to demonstrate resilience to sanctions, but that just means staving a runaway economic collapse,” he told CNN.\n\n“This is why the real cost of sanctions is an opportunity cost of forgone growth.”\n\nOther top Middle East news\n\nIranian, Ukranian foreign ministers discuss Russian invasion in phone call\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said after speaking to his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir-Abdollahian that Tehran “stands against Russia’s war on Ukraine” and “supports a diplomatic solution.” He also said that Iran refuted allegations that arms were transferred to Russia with the help of Iranian companies.\n\nBackground: Iran has sided with Russia in its war on Ukraine by supporting it in international forums like the United Nations, but it has also presented itself as being anti-war. After Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, Tehran condemned the expansion of Nato instead of providing explicit support for the war.\n\nWhy it matters: Ukraine is likely to present the phone call as a victory against Russia for having one of its closest allies condemn the war and deny facilitating transfers of weapons.\n\nUS Navy launches task force to patrol waters around Yemen\n\nThe US Navy said on Wednesday it is establishing a task force that will help combat arms smuggling in the waters around Yemen.\n\nBackground: The US has recently reassured Gulf monarchies of its commitment to helping them fight off Houthi attacks targeting Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. Tehran has long backed the Houthi movement in Yemen and has been repeatedly accused of smuggling weapons to the rebel group, an allegation it denies.\n\nWhy it matters: The task force is the latest of steps taken by the American military against Houthi attacks on Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The region has doubted America’s security commitment to its Middle East allies, especially as nuclear talks open doors to stronger Iranian influence if sanctions are lifted.\n\nAt least 150 injured in Al-Aqsa mosque clashes\n\nPalestinians and Israeli forces clashed in and around the Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem’s Old City, marking a significant spike in tensions on what is a day of significance for all three of the city’s main religions. At least 150 people were taken to hospitals with injuries from rubber bullets, stun grenades and police beatings, according to the Palestinian Red Crescent.\n\nBackground: A spokeswoman for the Israeli police said earlier that officers confronted “dozens of young lawbreakers” who began a procession in the mosque compound. Police said several officers were taken to hospitals after they were hit by rocks. The clashes follow weeks of unrest between Israelis and Palestinians. Four Palestinians were shot dead by Israeli forces in the West Bank on Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nWhy it matters: Israeli security forces have stepped up operations in Palestinian territories in recent days, following a series of shooting attacks on Israelis that killed 14 people.\n\nAround the region\n\nJyo John Mulloor\n\nBlistering hot car steering wheel and bursts of hot air at every exit from an air-conditioned refuge, UAE residents are getting a reminder of what desert heat feels like as the weather in the Gulf country turns.\n\nOne digital artist in Dubai, however, has used art and technology to let residents fantasize about a UAE with more green than the orange of sand dunes that residents are used to seeing.\n\nJyo John Mulloor visualizes the desert country in sage, jade, olive, and every other shade of green as he drapes key landmarks like the Burj Al Arab and Burj Khalifa with forests all around. The pictures, which took 26 days to create, have gone viral on social media. This was Mulloor’s sequel to his #letitsnow series where he imagined the city covered in snow.\n\nCalling it the #letitbloom project, the renderings of a greener Dubai aren’t an entirely unfamiliar sight. Mulloor says he was inspired by Dubai’s ambitious plan to make the desert bloom in a similar way, telling CNN that while his previous project, #letitsnow, was a dream, #letitbloom is a vision. One that he shares with the top royal in Dubai.\n\nIn April last year, Dubai ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashed Al Maktoum launched the “Dubai 2040 urban master plan,” which aims to double green and recreational places in the city as well as dedicate 60% of the emirate’s total area to nature reserves and rural areas.\n\nWhile Mulloor admits his renderings are an exaggeration of the 2040 vision, he believes Dubai can transform up to 60% of what his artworks depicted. “If anyone in the world can do it, Dubai can do it,” he says.\n\nBy Mohammed Abdelbary\n\nTweet of the day\n\nInteresting. Just two questions, if I may.\n\n\n\nHow much of Twitter does the Kingdom own, directly & indirectly?\n\n\n\nWhat are the Kingdom’s views on journalistic freedom of speech? — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 14, 2022\n\nElon Musk took a jab at Saudi Arabia on Twitter after his recent bid to purchase all outstanding shares of the social media platform for $43 billion was rejected by a royal shareholder.\n\nAccording to a regulatory filing on Thursday, Musk offered to buy all outstanding shares of Twitter for $54.20 per share. If what he called “my best and final offer” is rejected, Musk said he will need to reconsider his position as a shareholder. Musk currently owns a 9.1% stake in Twitter.\n\nSaudi prince Al Waleed Bin Talal, one of the world’s richest men who holds 5.2% of Twitter shares, took to his 14.2 million followers to say he doesn’t believe Musk’s offer “comes close to the intrinsic value” of Twitter.\n\nMusk responded by asking Al Waleed how much of Twitter Saudi Arabia owns, publicly and privately, as well as about the kingdom’s views on freedom of speech.\n\nAl Waleed is yet to respond.\n\nBy Mohammed Abdelbary", "authors": ["Nadeen Ebrahim"], "publish_date": "2022/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/20/business/hong-kong-covid-bans-aviation-hub-decay-intl-hnk/index.html", "title": "Hong Kong's controversial Covid rule is ruining its status as an ...", "text": "Hong Kong CNN Business —\n\nHong Kong’s Covid-19 curbs are continuing to severely limit travel into the city, with only one flight from outside the Asia Pacific region landing on Tuesday and Wednesday.\n\nThe government recently allowed flights from nine countries, including Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to resume after bans that lasted two to three months, but airlines continue to struggle with the city’s strict “zero Covid” policy. Officials this week temporarily banned flights again from India, Pakistan and the Philippines.\n\nAs of Wednesday, 11 flight routes from 10 airlines had been temporarily cut off, including those from London and Amsterdam, the government said in a statement.\n\nThe latest disruption is linked to a controversial regulation that requires routes to be suspended for seven days if three or more passengers on an incoming flight test positive for Covid-19 or have insufficient health documentation.\n\nThe carriers affected are Cathay Pacific, Singapore Airlines, Ethiopian Airlines, Qatar Airways, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Air India, Turkish Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, All Nippon Airways and regional budget airline Scoot, according to Hong Kong authorities.\n\nIn recent months, the rise of the Omicron variant has meant this rule has been repeatedly activated, causing many flights into the city to be canceled and chaos for travelers around the world. So far this month, 21 routes have already been suspended over the rule, according to a CNN tally.\n\nJoanne Townson, who has lived in Hong Kong for more than 25 years, said she’d had at least six flights to the city canceled over the last 16 months for various reasons, including the regulation.\n\nShe said Hong Kong’s flight bans and quarantine restrictions recently prompted her to resign “from a job I loved” and fly to Europe, because she had been unable to see her daughters for 18 months.\n\nThe flight suspension rule is slamming Hong Kong’s position as a premier aviation hub, which was already in question as the city grappled with the impact of its strict quarantine measures. Prior to the global health crisis, the city was home to one of the world’s busiest airports.\n\nThe latest effects of the restrictions were seen starkly on Tuesday, as just a single flight came in to the city from outside the Asia Pacific region, according to Hong Kong International Airport. The flight was operated by Emirates and came from Dubai.\n\n‘Off the map’\n\n“The restrictions there have been very severe and have led directly to the cancellation of a lot of services with airlines effectively finding it incredibly difficult, if not impossible, to operate there,” Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association, said at a media briefing earlier this month.\n\nWalsh added that Hong Kong’s status as an international hub had “slipped,” leaving it “effectively off the map now.”\n\n“I think it’s going to be difficult for Hong Kong to recover,” he said.\n\nFrederik Gollob, chairman of the European Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong, told CNN Business that the airport used to be one of the city’s biggest advantages.\n\nBesides the city’s quarantine rules, flight suspensions are one of “the biggest” concerns of the international business community, he added. Currently, most travelers are required to stay in hotel rooms for seven days at their own expense, down from a previous mandate of isolation for up to three weeks.\n\nTownson, the Hong Kong resident, said that her family will soon go through quarantine themselves if a Cathay Pacific flight scheduled from Paris to Hong Kong next month goes ahead as planned.\n\n“I am praying that the flight flies, and won’t actually believe we’re on our way until takeoff,” she said.", "authors": ["Michelle Toh Jake Kwon Lizzy Yee", "Michelle Toh", "Jake Kwon", "Lizzy Yee"], "publish_date": "2022/04/20"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/03/24/business/ukrainian-crew-member-sabotaged-russian-oligarch-linked-yacht-invs/index.html", "title": "Ukrainian crew member who tried to sink Russian oligarch linked ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nFor 10 years, Taras Ostapchuk worked at what many might consider a dream job, as the chief engineer for the Lady Anastasia, a luxurious 156-foot yacht that cruised mostly from one upscale port to another across the sparkling Mediterranean Sea.\n\nBut on February 26, with the ship docked on the Spanish island of Mallorca, in the Mediterranean, all that changed.\n\nOstapchuk saw media reports of a Russian missile strike on an apartment building in his home city of Kyiv. It was similar to the one he lived in with his wife, when he wasn’t aboard ship.\n\nAt that point, he said, “I think, my home can be next.” That’s when he decided to sink the yacht. “It was my first step for the war with Russia.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN from Ukraine, Ostapchuk, 55, said he connected the destruction in his home city straight to the man he calls the owner of the Lady Anastasia: Russian oligarch Alexander Mikheev. He’s the chief executive of Russian weapons company Rosoboronexport, which sells everything from helicopters, to tanks, to missile systems, to submarines.\n\nAlexander Mikheev is the director general of Rosoboroexport, a Russian supplier of weapons and military aircraft. He is among the Russian oligarchs sanctioned by the US on March 15 in relation to Russia's war on Ukraine. Universal Images/Getty Images\n\nHis mission, Ostapchuk decided: To scuttle the Lady Anastasia.\n\nThe latest phase of Russia’s war on Ukraine had begun two days earlier, with forces attacking from Russia, Belarus and Russian-annexed Crimea. As the offensive unfolded, the US and the European Union responded with economic sanctions and the seizure of assets linked to oligarchs in Vladimir Putin’s circle.\n\nAnd perhaps no assets so clearly symbolized how Putin’s enablers had thrived under his rule quite like oligarchs’ yachts, some of them nearly as long as the height of the Washington Monument, sporting helipads, swimming pools, and extravagantly opulent interiors.\n\nOstapchuk said he headed to the Lady Anastasia’s engine room, where he opened a valve connected to the ship’s hull. As water flooded in, he made his way to the crew quarters, where he opened another valve.\n\n“There were three other crew members on board besides me. I announced to them that the boat was sinking, and they had to leave,” he said, in Russian.\n\nHide and seek\n\nBy most standards, the Lady Anastasia, with a crew of nine, is sumptuous: A master stateroom with a Carrara marble bath; cabins for 10 guests; a jacuzzi on the sun deck that’s stabilized against the ship’s movement, and so on.\n\nRussian oligarchs own among the most lavish yachts in existence. The Dilbar, a 512-foot yacht, is owned by billionaire Alisher Usmanov, according to the Treasury Department, which on March 3 identified the Dilbar as “blocked property.” It has two helicopter pads and cabins for dozens of guests. Usmanov didn’t respond to CNN queries about the yacht.\n\nOr take the Amore Vero, a yacht that French authorities seized March 2. They say it’s linked to Igor Sechin, a sanctioned Russian oil executive and associate of Putin. (The company that manages the vessel denies it’s owned by Sechin.) A former crew member of the yacht, who asked not to be named because he’d signed a non-disclosure agreement, said the Amore Vero includes a safe room on its lowest deck.\n\n“It wasn’t even on the official drawings of the boat,” he said. “There was a secret door with a hidden camera. And you could pull the wall away and inside there were beds, emergency communications, a bathroom, and CCTV.”\n\nThe yacht called \"Lady Anastasia\" reportedly owned by Russian oligarch Alexander Mikheyev is seen at Port Adriano in the Spanish island of Mallorca, Spain March 15, 2022. REUTERS/Juan Medina Juan Medina/Reuters\n\nThough officials in various countries have attributed ownership of yachts to Russian oligarchs, the paper trail between ship and owner is typically obscured, running through shell companies and complicated legal structures. Spain, for example, says it has “provisionally detained” yachts while it sorts out ownership.\n\nMikheev was sanctioned by the US State Department on March 15.\n\nWhen CNN tried to contact Mikheev about ownership of the Lady Anastasia, a spokesman for Rosoboronexport responded via email that the company “never comments any information about the personal life of employees and their property, except in cases stipulated by the legislation of the Russian Federation.”\n\nBut Ostapchuk said he had no doubts. “Why, you know, if a creature looks like a dog, barks like a dog, bites like a dog, it is a dog. Therefore, if in the course of ten years, the yacht [was] used for vacations only [by] Mr. Mikheev and his family, then I think that he is definitely the real owner of this yacht.”\n\nAmid a growing list of sanctions and seizures, yachts that have been reported to be owned by Russian oligarchs have sped to countries where sanctions are unlikely to be enforced, according to data from the website MarineTraffic.\n\nTwo yachts reportedly owned by Roman Abramovich, an oligarch and ally of Putin who has been sanctioned by the European Union and the United Kingdom, docked at ports in southwestern Turkey on Monday and Tuesday. One of the yachts, the Solaris, had been docked in Barcelona until early March, while the Eclipse – among the largest yachts in the world – departed the Caribbean around the same time and crossed the Atlantic.\n\nBoth vessels appeared to skirt EU waters on their way to Turkey, taking a circuitous route that went around several Greek islands. Turkey, though a NATO member, has made clear that it will not sanction Russia for its aggression against Ukraine.\n\nA small group of protesters waving Ukrainian flags and chanting “no war in Ukraine” tried to block the Solaris from docking at a port in Bodrum, Turkey on Monday, as the massive yacht loomed over them. Some of the protesters were members of a Ukrainian junior sailing team who had left their country before the invasion to compete in a sailing competition in Turkey, the BBC reported.\n\nSeveral other Russian-linked yachts appear to be headed to Middle Eastern or South Asian countries that also declined to impose sanctions on Russia. The Clio, a yacht reportedly owned by Putin ally and aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, and the Quantum Blue, reportedly owned by retail billionaire Sergey Galitsky, were both off the coast of Oman this week, the MarineTraffic data shows. The Clio listed its destination as Dubai before changing direction to Mumbai, while the Quantum Blue had been docked in Monaco before departing in early March. Deripaska has been sanctioned by the US and UK, while Galitsky has not.\n\nMeanwhile, at least a half-dozen other yachts tied to Russian oligarchs have stopped transmitting location data altogether in recent weeks, according to MarineTraffic.\n\nThe Galactica Super Nova, a yacht reportedly owned by Russian oil executive Vagit Alekperov, was last recorded leaving the port of Tivat, Montenegro, and sailing into the Adriatic Sea early on March 2 – the day after the Montenegrin government announced it would join the EU in imposing sanctions on Russia. While Alekperov has not been sanctioned, he was included on a 2018 US Treasury Department list of Russian oligarchs.\n\nGeorgios Hatzimanolis, a spokesperson for MarineTraffic, said the likeliest explanation for the lack of location data is that the yachts have switched off AIS, an automatic tracking system. International maritime regulations generally require vessels as big as the oligarch-linked yachts to keep AIS on unless they are going through areas known for piracy, Hatzimanolis said. Turning off a transmitter could potentially increase the danger of a collision when vessels are traveling through busy waters.\n\n“It is unusual,” Hatzimanolis said of the yachts going dark. “But these are unprecedented times for these yachts and their owners. They’re trying to keep out of the way and get to destinations where they won’t be sanctioned.”\n\n‘You have to choose’\n\nAfter he began flooding the compartments, Ostapchuk told the other three crew members on board what he’d done.\n\nThey, too, were Ukrainian, he said. But, fearful he’d just cost them their jobs, they yelled at him that he was crazy, according to a summary statement at his arraignment.\n\nThen they called the port authorities and the police. Port workers brought a water pump and prevented the boat from sinking. Ostapchuk was arrested.\n\n“I made a statement to the police that I tried to sink the boat as a political protest of Russian aggression,” he told CNN.\n\n“You have to choose. Either you are with Ukraine or not. You have to choose, will there be a Ukraine, or will you have a job… I don’t need a job if I don’t have Ukraine.”\n\nBefore he tried to sink the Lady Anastasia as a protest against Russia's war on Ukraine, Taras Ostapchuk served as the yacht's chief engineer for a decade. This 2013 photo was taken in Corsica, in the Mediterranean. Taras Ostapchuk\n\nIn some cases, those jobs may be in jeopardy anyway. On March 15, Spanish authorities provisionally detained the Lady Anastasia while they determine whether it falls under European sanctions and can be seized. It was one of three yachts linked to Russian oligarchs they detained that week. Others have been seized or detained in France, Germany, Italy and Gibraltar.\n\nOn March 7, the company managing the yacht Dilbar laid off all 96 crew members, saying that sanctions prevented normal operations of the ship, according to Forbes.\n\nSanctions on Russian oligarchs seem to have sparked challenges and confusion among some yacht crews. The seafarers union Nautilus International held a question-and-answer session with yacht professionals earlier this month and received questions such as, “Should we be resigning from all Russian yachts?” and “What am I owed if I’m dismissed/laid off due to sanctions on my vessel?” Union representatives counseled members to check the terms of their contracts.\n\n‘They should be held responsible’\n\nWhen CNN spoke with Ostapchuk from Ukraine on Wednesday, the conversation was immediately interrupted by an alert of an incoming Russian attack. Later, after Ostapchuk returned from a shelter, he said that as soon as Spanish authorities had released him on February 27 he’d gone back to Ukraine.\n\n“Now I serve in the army, and I hope that my service will bring our victory closer,” he said.\n\nHe added that he hopes the oligarchs who backed Putin will feel the bite of sanctions.\n\n“They should be held responsible, because it is they who, with their behavior, with their lifestyle, with their unquenchable greed, they precisely led to this … In order to distract the people from the real plunder of Russia by these rulers, that arrange diversionary wars with other countries, that are innocent.”", "authors": ["Bob Ortega Al Goodman Casey Tolan Curt Devine Jeff Winter", "Bob Ortega", "Al Goodman", "Casey Tolan", "Curt Devine", "Jeff Winter"], "publish_date": "2022/03/24"}]}

One, who was later excused, said she likes to \"go to the club.\"\n\nJury selection didn't begin until the afternoon, after the judge and lawyers handled procedural legal issues.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDismissed juror speaks\n\nA man, who declined to give his name, walked out of criminal court with his jury identification in his pocket. His name was crossed out.He said the judge dismissed him from jury selection because his daughter had a wedding in early June in Seattle.He didn’t have to answer any questions for the selection, but he believed Trump could get a fair trial.“His challenge is that he's a public figure and there's a ton of information already,” he said.\n\n−Eduardo Cuevas\n\nJudge rejects Trump's request to be excused for Supreme Court immunity arguments\n\nAfter jurors were excused at the end of the day, Judge Juan Merchan rejected a request from Trump lawyer Todd Blanche to excuse the former president from the trial on April 25 so he can attend Supreme Court oral arguments in his criminal federal election interference case. The high court is reviewing whether Trump is immune from prosecution for official acts during his presidency.\n\n\"Arguing before the Supreme Court is a big deal,\" Merchan said, adding that he can very much understand why Trump would want to be there. However, Merchan said he wouldn't alter the plans for the criminal case on that basis.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump Media stock price plummets Monday\n\nWhile Trump was in court Monday, his Trump Media & Technology Group shares plummeted more than 18% after the company took steps to sell millions of additional shares.\n\nTrump Media, the parent company of social media platform Truth Social, filed to register up to 146.1 million shares for sale, including nearly 115 million owned by Trump personally. The company also listed the potential sale of another 21.5 million shares linked to warrants – contracts that give investors the right to buy or sell a stock at a specific price within a certain time frame.\n\nTrump Media’s market cap and Trump’s net worth – both tied to the company’s stock – have taken a hit as its stock price has dipped. The company’s market value as of Monday was more than $3.5 billion, down from a peak of nearly $8 billion.\n\n−Bailey Schulz\n\nTrump glares at reporter who said he appeared to be sleeping in court\n\nAs Trump walked out of the courtroom during a short break in the afternoon's proceedings, he glared at New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman for several seconds. Haberman reported earlier in the day that Trump appeared to be sleeping in the courtroom. She said she saw his head drop down repeatedly and his mouth go slack.\n\nHaberman has reported on Trump for years and wrote a 2022 book about him titled, \"Confidence Man: The Making of Donald Trump and the Breaking of America.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nIndividual jury questioning begins\n\nIndividualized questioning of potential jurors has begun as the New Yorkers orally respond to 42 jury questions Judge Juan Merchan decided on before trial.\n\nA young woman is the first to respond orally to each item from the questionnaire, which she is reading silently. Donald Trump appears to be reading the questions silently at the table as he listens to the responses.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore than half of first-round potential Trump jurors say they can't be impartial\n\nJudge Juan Merchan excused at least 50 potential jurors from a group he earlier said included 96 New Yorkers because they indicated they couldn't be fair and impartial in the case. A handful of the potential jurors were wearing masks.\n\nAt least nine more potential jurors were excused after they indicated they couldn't serve for other reasons that weren't disclosed, leaving about 34 potential jurors.\n\nIt was a speedy whittling-down of the first group of potential jurors to be sworn in as former President Donald Trump goes on trial over whether he falsified business records to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge instructs potential jurors on being fair\n\nJudge Juan Merchan told prospective jurors that fair jurors will remain impartial and will guard against various stereotypes, asking themselves if their views on the defendant would be different if the defendant had a different political affiliation, among other attributes.\n\nMerchan also explained that the jurors are the judges of the facts in the case, while Merchan's job is to judge and instruct them on the law.\n\nDonald Trump has largely been looking at Merchan while the judge addresses the potential jurors, but he has occasionally looked at the jury box where some prospective jurors are sitting.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJurors are sworn in as judge begins opening remarks\n\nAt 2:34 p.m. ET, the first batch of potential jurors was sworn in. Judge Juan Merchan instructed the jury about the case and introduced the lawyers as well as Donald Trump. Both sides, including Trump, stood up after they were introduced and turned to face the potential jurors.\n\nMerchan gave the New Yorkers a brief description of the charges Trump faces. Merchan explained that the jury will have 12 jurors, and there will also be alternate jurors who would be called upon to join the jury if one of the 12 isn't able to complete the full trial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge moves Trump contempt hearing up one day, to April 23\n\nJudge Juan Merchan moved the date for a hearing over whether Donald Trump violated a gag order and should be held in contempt in the New York hush money case. The hearing will now be held on Tuesday, April 23, one day sooner than originally planned.\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy argued earlier in the day that Trump should be held in contempt and fined $3,000 for three social media posts that Conroy said violated the judge's prohibition on Trump publicly commenting on the participation of potential witnesses.\n\nMerchan didn't announce any change to the deadline for Trump's legal team to respond in writing to the prosecution's allegations in advance of the hearing: it remains April 19.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential Trump jurors begin going through security\n\nAt 2:05 p.m. ET potential jurors began going through the security that's in place before they can enter the courtroom for Donald Trump's hush money trial.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan has already decided on 42 questions the jury candidates will be asked. Prosecutors and the Trump defense team will also be able to ask follow-up questions.\n\nMerchan isn't allowing questions about whether jurors voted for Trump or intend to vote for him. But he has allowed several questions that could reveal a juror's political preferences. For example, potential jurors will be asked if they've ever attended either a Trump rally or an anti-Trump rally, and whether they have ever followed Trump or an anti-Trump group on social media.\n\nIf potential jurors' answers indicate they probably can't be impartial in the case, Merchan has said he will strike them from consideration. For any potential jurors Merchan doesn't excuse from further service, the two sides will have the option of disqualifying them themselves, though that power isn't unlimited.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat is a Sandoval hearing?\n\nIf you've been following Donald Trump's criminal hush money case so far, you may have heard the term \"Sandoval hearing\" earlier in the day. But what does the term mean?\n\nIt's basically a short hearing that happens before trials. A judge is asked what previous actions or factors can be brought up during a trial, weighing the potential impact on the case at large.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAs Trump goes on trial, asylum seekers a block away navigate immigration system\n\nA block from Donald Trump’s trial, New York's Federal Plaza had a steady flow of patrons Monday morning for immigration court. The city has faced the arrival of nearly 200,000 migrants, many bused in from the U.S.-Mexico border, in the past two years.\n\nUnder a treelined path outside the federal building, Alex Rojas, a 24-year-old Venezuelan man, read his book, “Red White & Royal Blue,” an LGBTQ romance novel by Casey McQuiston. The Manhattan criminal courthouse, where Trump was on trial for hiding hush money payments, loomed behind Rojas.\n\nHe's been in the U.S. for six months, without a work permit, and is seeking political asylum due to dangers of violence toward gay people in Venezuela. Rojas, who hopes to work as a physical therapist, admitted he didn’t know much about American politics, but he knew about Trump’s stance on immigration.\n\n“I think he’s going to deport all of us from here,” Rojas said, with nervous laughter. “I don’t think he likes migrants much, even less Venezuelans.”\n\nAs court adjourned for lunch, Rojas also left, heading back to his shelter in the Bronx. He’d return to Manhattan in the morning, as would Trump, to appear in court.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\n96 jurors to be called in for initial questioning\n\nJudge Juan Merchan said 96 jurors will be called in for initial questioning as the jury selection process gets underway in Donald Trump's New York hush money case. In total, Merchan said 500 prospective jurors have been called on for service in the case.\n\nWe are waiting for prospective jurors to arrive in the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge will hold hearing on whether to hold Donald Trump in contempt April 24\n\nFollowing a lunch break, Judge Juan Merchan declared he will hold a hearing on Wednesday, April 24 about whether Donald Trump violated a gag order through posts on his Truth Social media platform and should be held in contempt.\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy earlier in the day argued Merchan should hold Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 – or $1,000 for each of three alleged violations.\n\nMerchan told Trump's legal team to file its response on the gag order allegations by April 19.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrial schedule: Holidays, Barron Trump's high school graduation and more\n\nWhile Donald Trump's hush money trial is expected to extend six to eight weeks, the former president won't be in the courtroom every day. Judge Juan Merchan said Tuesday that the trial will take a break on Wednesdays for its duration, and there will not be any trial on April 29, NBC News reported.\n\nThe judge also said there will not be any trial dates that would conflict with religious observances. That could include Passover, though the courtroom hours could simply be cut short on April 22 and 23.\n\nThe case will also potentially adjourn for the high school graduation of Barron Trump, Donald Trump's youngest son, next month.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nPolice investigating bomb threat at Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's home\n\nPolice say they are investigating a bomb threat targeting the home of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg on Monday morning, according to the Associated Press. Law enforcement official said a 911 caller reported the threat just before 9 a.m. ET.\n\nIt's not the first time Bragg has faced an emergency situation in recent months. A powdery substance was discovered last month in a threatening letter in a mailroom at Bragg's offices, the AP reported.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nProsecutor wants Donald Trump held in contempt, $3,000 fine, for alleged gag order violations\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy asked Judge Juan Merchan to hold Donald Trump in contempt and fine him $3,000 for allegedly violating the judge's gag order. The order prohibits Trump from publicly commenting on the participation of potential witnesses in the case.\n\nConroy pointed to three Trump social media posts that he said each warrant a $1,000 fine.\n\nOne post featured a statement from Michael Avenatti, who was once a lawyer for Stormy Daniels, that it is \"outrageous that Cohen and Daniels can do countless TV interviews\" talking badly about Trump, but Trump is gagged if he responds. Trump reposted the comment along with his own thanks to Avenatti \"for revealing the truth about two sleaze bags\" who have hurt the country with lies.\n\nIn 2022, Avenatti was convicted of identify theft and wire fraud for stealing from Daniels and sentenced to several years in prison.\n\nConroy also said Trump violated the gag order by posting a photograph of a publicly available 2018 statement by Daniels denying she had a sexual encounter with Trump. A further violation allegedly occurred when Trump posted about Cohen, asking, \"Has disgraced attorney and felon Michael Cohen been prosecuted for LYING?\"\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche said the defense would like the chance to respond in writing.\n\nThe judge didn't make an immediate decision.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWas Donald Trump falling asleep at hush money trial?\n\nThe former president appeared to nod off before the trial's lunch break, closing his eyes briefly and jerking awake multiple times, according to several reports.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWill Trump testify in his hush money case?\n\nTrump said on Friday that he will testify at the trial.\n\n\"I’m testifying. I tell the truth. I mean, all I can do is tell the truth. And the truth is that there's no case, they have no case,\" Trump said at a Palm Beach press conference.\n\nHowever, the former president has backed out of testifying before.\n\nIn his New York civil fraud case, Trump was forced to testify under a state subpoena when the state attorney general's office was putting on its case. At that time, Trump's legal team didn't ask him a single question on cross-examination. Trump later said he would testify when it was the defense's turn to call their own witnesses. But the day before his scheduled testimony, he backed out.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nCourt takes a lunch break\n\nThe proceedings in the Manhattan courtroom have paused until 1:30 p.m. ET.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nE. Jean Carroll deposition will not be allowed in Trump trial\n\nJudge Juan Merchan on Monday also said prosecutors cannot show a deposition from columnist E. Jean Carroll, who accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in the 1990s.\n\nA jury last year found Trump liable of sexually abusing Carroll and defaming her. In January, a jury also ruled that Trump must pay the columnist $83.3 million in damages for defamation.\n\nBut on Monday, Merchan warned that Carroll's deposition could risk \"building in a trial into a trial.\"\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nAnti-Trump press conference takes place near courtroom\n\nA few blocks from the courtroom at nearby Foley Square, a group of anti-Trump protestors gathered for a press conference. Advocates held up large orange letters reading “No one is above the law” as a series of speakers addressed the election interference charges against the former president.\n\nIn a federal case and state-level case in Georgia, Donald Trump is accused of trying to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden.\n\nRobert Weisman, president of the non-profit Public Citizen spoke from a podium emblazoned with “Election interference is a crime.\"\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is hush money?\n\nHush money is a wide-ranging term used to refer to paying someone to not speak publicly about an issue. It's not necessarily illegal, so why is Donald Trump in court over a hush money case?\n\nThe former president isn’t actually charged with making a $130,000 payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement. Instead, he's accused of falsifying business records to hide the payment.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg described the payments to Daniels and another woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, as part of a “catch-and-kill” strategy to prevent the women from telling their stories. But the criminal charges are that Trump falsified his company’s business records to conceal the payments.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump rails against Michael Cohen, despite gag order\n\nThe former president has shown a penchant for launching accusations and insults towards judges, prosecutors and potential witnesses he deems hostile, but he could face fines or even jail time if Judge Juan Merchan determines it runs afoul of a gag order.\n\nBased on what Merchan described as a history of \"threatening, inflammatory, denigrating\" statements against officials, court staff, and prosecutors, the judge issued an order barring Trump from publicly commenting about the participation of potential witnesses in the case, such as porn star Stormy Daniels and former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.\n\nDespite the gag order's restriction on comments about witnesses, Trump posted on Saturday \"Has disgraced attorney and felon Michael Cohen been prosecuted for LYING?\"\n\nMerchan also prohibited public statements about court staff and prosecution lawyers other than Bragg, as well as their family members, if the comments are meant to significantly interfere with their work in the case.\n\nDays after that order was issued, Trump attacked Merchan's daughter in a series of posts on Trump's Truth Social media platform, calling her \"a Rabid Trump Hater\" and posting a photo of her, leading the judge to expand the gag order to prohibit the former president from publicly commenting on Merchan's or Bragg's family members if the comments are meant to significantly interfere with work in the case.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJury won't watch 'Access Hollywood' tape, judge reiterates\n\nJudge Juan Merchan previously ruled that the jury in Donald Trump's hush money trial can hear testimony about Trump's comments on the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape, but can't watch the tape.\n\nMerchan reiterated that ruling on Monday, saying he continues to regard the video as too prejudicial against Trump to be permitted in the trial. In the tape, Trump crudely describes grabbing women. The release of the tape in early October of 2016 is important context for Trump's alleged $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, according to prosecutors. They say he feared another scandal would further endanger his standing with women voters in the fast-approaching election.\n\nFor that reason, Trump authorized the payment by former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, which constituted a campaign contribution in excess of federal campaign finance limits, prosecutors say. One reason Trump faces felony charges of falsifying business records, as opposed to misdemeanors, is that the alleged falsification was done to conceal that separate federal crime, prosecutors say.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy did Michael Cohen go to prison?\n\nMichael Cohen, Donald Trump's former attorney, pleaded guilty in 2018 to concealing more than $4 million from the IRS and \"causing $280,000 in payments to be made to silence two women who otherwise planned to speak publicly about their alleged affairs with a presidential candidate, thereby intending to influence the 2016 presidential election,\" according to court records.\n\nProsecutors said Cohen arranged a $150,000 payment to McDougal and a $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nCohen was sentenced to three years in prison but was released early to home detention because of the spread of COVID-19.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump's supporters gather to demonstrate outside Manhattan courthouse\n\nAmong the crowd outside the courtroom was Vish Burra, 33, the executive secretary of the New York Young Republican Club, which helped organize the protest.\n\nSporting a black “Make America Great Again” hat, Burra, a former aide to embattled former Rep. George Santos, scanned the crowd and captured some videos of anti-Trump protesters on his phone.\n\nHe voted for Obama in 2012 but is now an ardent supporter of Trump. Free trade, immigration policy, and anti-war beliefs brought him into the GOP.\n\n“Donald Trump didn’t start any new wars when he was president and not only that but his strong presence kept people at peace, kept people at bay.”\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nJudge Juan Merchan says jury won't hear about Melania Trump's pregnancy during alleged affair\n\nAttorneys and Judge Juan Merchan are addressing a series of issues this morning about what testimony and evidence can be introduced in the trial.\n\nMerchan tentatively ruled in the morning that Melania Trump's pregnancy during an alleged affair between Trump and former Playboy model Karen McDougal can't be shared with the jury.\n\nMerchan previously ruled that the prosecution can call McDougal to the witness stand even though Trump isn't charged with falsifying business records to cover up an alleged hush money payment she received. McDougal has said she and the real estate mogul had an affair over many months, which Trump denies. In the earlier ruling, Merchan said McDougal's testimony about steps taken to secure her story \"complete the narrative\" in the prosecution's case.\n\nHowever, Merchan said Monday he doesn't believe \"at this moment\" that testimony or evidence about Melania Trump's pregnancy is necessary.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\n'It's going to backfire'\n\nBijaya Acharya, 32, slept just a couple hours after finishing driving for Uber so he could take the train from Queens to see Donald Trump leave Trump Tower in the morning ahead of his trial. Then, Acharya, donning the iconic red “Make America Great Again” hat, went to the lower Manhattan courthouse to support the former president.\n\nAcharya, a native of Nepal, lives in Jackson Heights, a diverse, immigrant Queens neighborhood, in one of the world’s most diverse, immigrant cities. Still, he supports Trump because of his push to crack down on crime and illegal immigration, two issues Acharya said he sees in New York City.\n\nSince becoming a citizen in 2021, he plans to vote in his first presidential election. He believes the trial only helps Trump’s chances of winning: “It’s going to backfire,” he said. “It’s not going to hurt him.”\n\nAcharya planned to stay outside the courthouse until the afternoon. He normally worked at night, anyway.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWhat will potential jurors be asked in Trump's NY case?\n\nAhead of trial, Merchan decided on a list of 42 questions the potential jurors will be asked, with both sides also having a chance to ask follow-up questions.\n\nSeveral of the questions could help the trial teams figure out if a potential juror has a bias when it comes to Trump that could undermine the ability to be impartial. For example, potential jurors will be asked if they've ever attended a Trump or anti-Trump rally, and whether they follow Trump or an anti-Trump group on social media.\n\nBut jurors will also be asked basic biographical information, like where they live, whether they're married, whether a loved one has ever been a victim of a crime.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nLooking for an unbiased jury in Donald Trump's hush money case\n\nStarting Monday, Donald Trump's and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's trial teams will each be working to select 12 jurors and several alternates who give them the best odds of winning.\n\nEach side will get a limited number of \"peremptory strikes\" – essentially vetoes – they can use to exclude potential jurors. Judge Juan Merchan will also be tasked with striking jurors whose responses to questions indicate they probably can't be impartial.\n\nIt's a case that turns some of the normal ways of thinking about jury selection on their head, according to Jo-Ellan Dimitrius, a seasoned jury consultant who assisted O.J. Simpson's murder trial defense team.\n\n\"In a normal criminal case, it is the prosecution that's looking for the white, older male, and it is the defense that's looking for the minority individual, the anti-police individual − but in this case it's actually reversed,\" Dimitrius told USA TODAY.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge Juan Merchan denies Trump's recusal push over his daughter\n\nTrial Judge Juan Merchan entered the courtroom and began his remarks in the proceedings by denying a Trump motion for his own recusal.\n\nTrump's legal team argued in the motion that a marketing agency headed by the judge's daughter benefits reputationally and financially by targeting Trump, rendering the judge's role in the case improper. The agency does work for Democratic political candidates.\n\nIn rejecting that argument, Merchan noted an opinion from the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics that Merchan's impartiality couldn't be reasonably questioned based on his daughter's work because Trump's case doesn't involve her business.\n\nMerchan already rejected a Trump motion for Merchan's recusal in August. Trump argued in the new motion that his success in the Republican primaries since August has \"cemented his status as a political target\" of the daughter's agency.\n\n\"The court will not address this matter further,\" Merchan said Monday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore:Donald Trump loses Hail Mary call for judge's recusal ahead of New York hush money trial\n\nTodd Blanche and Susan Necheles: Donald Trump's lawyers\n\nThey aren’t household names yet like their universally known client, Donald Trump. But the lawyers trying to keep the former president out of prison in his New York hush money trial − Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles − likely will become minor celebrities once the court battle gets going this week.\n\nA year ago, when a grim-faced Trump made history as the first former president to face criminal charges, Blanche and Necheles sat by his side as he pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records associated with hush money payments to two women.\n\nBlanche, who usually does talking in court on the hush-money case, told reporters that Trump was determined to fight the charges.\n\n\"He's frustrated, he's upset,\" Blanche said. \"It's not going to stop him.\"\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nDonald Trump's hush money trial in New York marks a historic moment: The first time a former president has even been on trial and facing criminal charges. The unprecedented case is also set against the backdrop of one of the busiest cities in the world.\n\nBefore the trial started on Monday, Mike Jamison, 67, of Philadelphia, stood alone against the barricades opposite the courthouse.\n\nWhile visiting his brother in Brooklyn, he said he stopped by the courthouse “for the circus.” He is a Democrat who planned to vote again for President Joe Biden.“I think he should get convicted,” Jamison said of Trump. “But who knows, you know? It only takes one juror.”\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWho is Karen McDougal?\n\nKaren McDougal is a former Playboy model. She indirectly received a hush money payment in 2016 after claiming to have an affair with Donald Trump.\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, funneled the money through the publication National Enquirer owned by American Media Inc., under a \"catch and kill\" approach, paying the tabloid to buy rights to her story and prevent her from telling anyone else about it.\n\nMcDougal has since spoken out about her affair with Trump, saying it lasted for about 10 months starting in 2006. He denies the allegation.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nDonald Trump begins fundraising off of trial\n\nMinutes after Donald Trump entered the courtroom, his campaign texted out solicitations for donations, saying “I'M IN COURT NOW!” in an all-caps message.\n\nTrump said in the text, “They're trying to DESTROY ME - BUT YOU CAN STOP THEM!” The former president has long claimed that the criminal charges against him are targeting his reelection campaign, though there's no evidence of that. – David Jackson\n\nWho is Alvin Bragg?\n\nLast year, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg became the first prosecutor to secure a criminal indictment against a former president. On Monday the world's attention will turn to Bragg as Trump's trial on 34 counts of falsifying business records begins.\n\nIn 2022, Bragg's office won convictions against two parts of the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer. Allen Weisselberg was sentenced to five months in prison after pleading guilty to 15 charges in a scheme to avoid taxes. Two Trump corporations were fined a combined $1.6 million for convictions of 17 felonies.\n\nBragg said company officials “have to play by the rules” and that Weisselberg used his position to get lavish perks such as a rent-free Manhattan apartment, multiple Mercedes Benz cars and private school tuition for his grandchildren – “all without paying required taxes.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWho is Stormy Daniels?\n\nStormy Daniels alleged that Donald Trump had consensual sex with her in 2006 – months after Melania Trump gave birth to Barron Trump.\n\nTrump’s then-attorney and personal fixer, Michael Cohen, paid $130,000 to Daniels just before the 2016 election to silence claims that she had an affair with Trump after she was willing to go public about the scandal.\n\n– Sudiksha Kochi\n\nDonald Trump: ‘I’m very honored to be here’\n\nDonald Trump gave a one-minute statement to reporters before entering the courtroom, alleging without evidence that his hush-money trial is “political persecution” and “an assault on America.”\n\nTrump cited unnamed legal scholars calling the case “nonsense.”\n\n“It’s a case that should have never been brought” Trump said, adding “I’m very honored to be here.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nAndrew Giuliani calls for 'unbiased jurors' in Trump hush money case\n\nAndrew Giuliani, son of longtime Trump advisor and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, stood among a mix of reporters and Trump supporters waving flags. He acknowledged the difficulty with jury selection because so many have opinions about the president. But he believed if people looked at the facts of the case, Trump would be acquitted.\n\n“You need two or three in there, even one,” Andrew Giuliani said. “But two or three, that way you don’t have one that gets bullied around by the others. I’m just hopeful that you do have a few unbiased jurors in there.”\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nDonald Trump arrives in the courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump just entered the Manhattan courtroom for the first day of his New York criminal trial. He is wearing a dark suit and red tie.\n\nIt's an unprecedented moment. Trump is the first former president ever to face criminal charges. He faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover-up a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels in advance of the 2016 presidential election.\n\nThe court has estimated the trial will last between six and eight weeks. Jury selection alone could last several days or even multiple weeks.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHow many indictments does Trump have?\n\nTrump has been indicted on 91 charges across four separate criminal cases. However, some of those charges have since been dismissed, bringing the current total to 88.\n\nIn Trump's New York case accusing him of making hush money payments before the 2016 election, he faces 34 felony counts\n\nIn the federal case accusing Trump of mishandling classified documents, Trump is charged with 40 felony counts\n\nTrump also faces a federal case accusing him of trying to steal the 2020 election from President Joe Biden. He faces 4 felony counts there\n\nIn the Georgia case accusing him of trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election in the Peach State, the former president 10 felony counts.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley & Bart Jansen\n\nWhy is Donald Trump on trial?\n\nThe trial will feature some salacious allegations. Prosecutors claim Trump falsified records to conceal that he was reimbursing his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Daniels has said she had sex with the real estate mogul shortly after his wife, Melania Trump, gave birth to their son, Barron. Trump denies Daniels' claim, and has pleaded not guilty in the case.\n\nThe charges are felonies, as opposed to misdemeanors, because prosecutors claim Trump falsified the records in order to conceal violating federal election laws through a payment that was meant to help his 2016 presidential campaign but exceeded campaign contribution limits.\n\nThe payment was made less than two weeks before the 2016 election. Prosecutors also allege the records were falsified in order to violate New York tax and election laws.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSmall (but passionate) crowd gathers outside Trump trial\n\nOutside the Manhattan courtroom where the former president's criminal hush money trial was set to begin Monday, the press and police presence seemed to outnumber the protestors significantly. A large flag that red “Trump 2024: Save America” waved above a small crowd demonstrators who appeared to support the president.\n\nOn the other side of a set of barricades, protestors criticizing the president walked silently behind a banner reading “no one is above the law.” A few nearby Trump supporters shouted at them, one with a bullhorn who repeated “Donald Trump did nothing wrong”\n\nJamie Bauer, who is part of Rise and Resist which formed after Trump’s election says the group has come out to protest every case. “They want to provoke us so that it will look like they’re the victims of left-wing aggression” they said of the pro-Trump crowd.– Anna Kaufman\n\nKey players in Trump's hush money trial\n\nDonald Trump’s former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and porn actress Stormy Daniels, who received $130,000 to keep quiet before the 2016 election are the key witnesses expected at his New York trial.\n\nCohen arranged the payment to Daniels, in exchange for her signing a non-disclosure agreement about her claim she had sex with Trump in 2006 while he was married to Melania Trump. Cohen pleaded guilty and spent time in prison on charges including a campaign finance violation for influencing the 2016 election.\n\nTrump has blasted Cohen as unreliable because he is a convicted perjurer and disbarred lawyer. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, said she was eager to sign the non-disclosure agreement to get the episode behind her.\n\nTrump has denied having a relationship with her. He has argued he was paying Cohen and that he was unaware of money going to Daniels.\n\nTrump could also potentially testify, as he did at his civil fraud trial.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump arrives at NY courthouse\n\nDonald Trump has arrived at the Manhattan courthouse where he's facing sweeping criminal charges in a hush money case.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhat time does the Trump trial start today?\n\nProceedings are expected to begin at 9:30 ET on Monday morning in the Manhattan courtroom where Donald Trump is facing sweeping criminal charges.\n\nRemember, jury selection begins in the case on Monday, so lawyers won't be presenting their cases just yet. But that will come soon: The trial is expected to last between six and eight weeks in total.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nHow long will Trump's trial last? Here's a timeline\n\nThe trial will last about six-to-eight weeks, according to a court media advisory.\n\nThe trial will start with jury selection Monday, which could be an especially lengthy process given many potential jurors will likely have opinions about former President Donald Trump that both sides may want to explore. New York law requires unanimity from a 12-person jury to convict a criminal defendant in a felony case.\n\nNormally, the trial would then proceed into opening arguments, which give both sides the chance to provide an outline to jurors of what they believe the evidence will show, followed by the prosecution calling witnesses to testify and introducing evidence. The defense will try to poke holes in the prosecution's case through cross-examination, and then will have the option of putting calling its own witnesses and introducing its own evidence.\n\nFinally, the parties will give closing arguments, and the jury will be tasked with rendering a verdict.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhere can I watch the Trump trial?\n\nThe trial won't be televised, as is typical in New York courts. Reporters will be present in the courtroom and an overflow room that will have a live stream of the proceedings.\n\nTrump may hold press conferences outside of court and speak to reporters in the courthouse hallway.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nQuiet morning waiting for Donald Trump's trial to start\n\nThere appear to be more reporters than demonstrators before Donald Trump’s trial started Monday morning in lower Manhattan.Police have barricades down the middle of Collect Pond Park, across the street from the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse. Last year, when prosecutors arraigned Trump, the barricades separated pro-Trump demonstrators with those against the former president.\n\nOn Monday, the crowds appear to be mixed, waiting. A few held signs against Trump. There was one large pro-Trump flag waving near the courthouse.\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWhat happens if Trump is found guilty?\n\nTrump could theoretically face more than a decade in prison if he's convicted on all counts in the criminal hush money case. But several legal experts told USA TODAY such a dramatic outcome is unlikely.\n\nInstead, Trump would likely face a sentence between probation and four years of prison, and he would probably still be out to freely campaign in the 2024 presidential election while his all-but-certain appeal ran its course.\n\nIf Trump were sentenced to jail or prison time, it's also unclear what that would look like. As a former president, he enjoys around-the-clock Secret Service protection, and no former president has ever been prosecuted. Special accommodations may be needed at a jail or prison, and the sentencing judge could also consider alternative arrangements such as house arrest or placement at some other secure location.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat's happening today in Donald Trump's trial?\n\nJury selection is scheduled to start Monday and last several days, if not multiple weeks.\n\nThe process will involve Trump's legal team and Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office wrangling over who should make it into the pool of 12 jurors and several alternates who will be tasked with deciding whether Trump is guilty.\n\nThe former president lost a flurry of motions and appeals in recent days seeking to delay the proceedings. But unlike in his three other criminal cases, which deal with allegations that he tried to illegally steal the 2020 presidential election and mishandled classified documents, delay tactics haven't allowed him to avoid the start of this trial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump's campaign addresses charges, witnesses and judge\n\nDonald Trump’s campaign issued a statement late Sunday dubbed a “trial fact sheet” as jury selection begins in his New York hush-money case, including that he “did nothing wrong” and the trial is a “full-frontal assault on American Democracy.”\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records to hide payments to Stormy Daniels, before the 2016 election.\n\nTrump’s fact sheet says Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, campaigned in 2021 on the potential to prosecute Trump. Bragg campaigned noting he sued Trump more than 100 times while working at the state Attorney General’s Office.\n\nTrump’s statement also notes that case relies on testimony from his former personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, who is a convicted felon, perjurer and disbarred lawyer. The statement also complained about Judge Juan Merchan’s “bizarre” schedule for the trial, as appeals linger to dismiss charges.\n\n“This is an unprecedented abuse of our legal system,” Trump’s statement said about the trial.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump lost several bids to delay his hush money trial\n\nA series of New York judges this month rejected pleas from former President Donald Trump to delay the criminal trial.\n\nIn one request, Trump said Judge Juan Merchan should delay the trial until after the Supreme Court has ruled on the scope of presidential immunity in a separate Trump case dealing with federal election interference charges. The high court is scheduled to hear arguments on that issue April 25.\n\nBut Merchan said Trump raised the argument too late. Trump only made the argument in March, almost a year after Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg announced the charges on April 4, 2023.\n\nOn Friday, Merchan rejected a separate Trump delay request based on his argument that pre-trial publicity about the case created unfair prejudice against him. Merchan said the right way to address that concern is to have a thorough jury selection process.\n\nIn addition, last week three different judges from a New York appeals court each rejected last-minute delay requests from Trump. The former president argued he should get a delay until the appeals court rules on his arguments for moving the trial out of Manhattan and tossing out Merchan's limited gag order against him, and until Merchan rules on his latest request for Merchan's recusal.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/15"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/11/donald-trump-new-york-hush-money-trial/72943245007/", "title": "Donald Trump could face prison time if he is convicted in upcoming ...", "text": "If former President Donald Trump is convicted on all counts in his New York criminal hush money trial that begins April 15, he could theoretically face more than a decade in prison.\n\nBut most legal experts who spoke to USA TODAY said such a dramatic outcome is unlikely. Instead, he would likely be sentenced to something between probation and four years in prison. And he would probably still be out, free to campaign for president as the presumptive or actual 2024 Republican nominee, while his all-but-certain appeal was pending.\n\nTrump faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to cover up a hush money payment to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. Each count carries a maximum sentence of four years.\n\nWhile Trump could in principle be sentenced to serve multiple counts consecutively, several experts said that is unlikely because he has no felony criminal record and the charges don't involve allegations of physical violence.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump has tested boundaries and feuded with the judge who may determine his fate.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTrump has antagonized Judge Juan Merchan\n\nTrump's sentence would be decided by Judge Juan Merchan, who has grown exasperated by the former president's pretrial behavior. Merchan expanded a gag order this month after Trump attacked the judge's daughter on social media over her marketing work with Democratic candidates, including posting a photo of her. Merchan said Trump has a history of attacking the family members of judges and lawyers in his legal cases.\n\n\"The average observer, must now, after hearing Defendant's recent attacks, draw the conclusion that if they become involved in these proceedings, even tangentially, they should worry not only for themselves, but for their loved ones as well,\" Merchan wrote in his gag order decision.\n\nJohn Moscow, a New York lawyer who spent 30 years in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, told USA TODAY that type of behavior could worsen any sentence Trump faces.\n\n\"If I were representing somebody in (Trump's) position, I would suggest to him that the judge is the one who imposes sentence and he ought to be careful,\" Moscow said.\n\nIf Merchan did consider a hefty sentence, it wouldn't be the first time he has taken a harsh view about behavior in Trump's orbit.\n\nIn 2023, Merchan was forced to sentence former Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg to only five months in jail because Merchan had previously accepted a plea bargain agreement between Weisselberg and prosecutors specifying that jail term. Weisselberg pleaded guilty to tax and record falsification charges and agreed to testify against the Trump Organization at trial in order to get that sentence.\n\nThe judge said, however, that he \"would be imposing a sentence much greater than that\" had he not accepted the plea bargain before hearing all the evidence at the trial. Without the plea deal, Weisselberg could have faced many years in prison.\n\nWhat is Trump charged with?\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to all counts in the case, which focuses on whether he falsified business records to cover up reimbursements to his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a $130,000 hush money payment to Daniels. Daniels has said she had a sexual encounter with Trump soon after Melania Trump gave birth to their son, Barron Trump. Trump denies the claim.\n\nIn order to secure felony convictions, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office must convince a 12-person jury that Trump falsified the records in order to commit or conceal another crime. In this case, Bragg argues Trump was trying to conceal a federal campaign finance law violation by falsely recording his reimbursements to Cohen as payments for legal services. The federal violation was a limit-exceeding contribution to Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, as the payment was allegedly designed to keep Daniels' story from hurting the then-Republican nominee's election prospects. Bragg also alleges Trump was trying to conceal a plan to violate New York tax and election laws.\n\nNothing in the Constitution prevents Trump from becoming president even if he is convicted or sentenced to prison. If he won the election, however, courts may delay any prison time until after his term in office expires.\n\nWhat is the maximum possible sentence?\n\nThe 34 felony counts Trump faces are classified as \"Class E felonies\" under New York law – the lowest level felony in the state. The maximum penalty on each count is four years of prison, and a judge would have discretion over whether to order Trump to serve sentences on each count at the same time or one after the other. However, New York caps such sentencing for Class E felonies at 20 years.\n\nIn addition, New York judges often impose sentencing ranges, where an incarcerated person becomes eligible for parole at the low end of the range. For Class E felonies, the lowest end of a range would be one-and-a-third years per count, while the highest would be four years. Good behavior in jail or prison can speed things up even more.\n\nA sentence limited to probation?\n\nMerchan would also have discretion to order a fixed sentence of less than those ranges, including probation.\n\nThat's what Mitchell Epner, a New York lawyer with decades of criminal law experience, expects would happen even if Trump were convicted on all counts. Epner noted the felony charges aren't violent and don't involve drugs.\n\n\"With a defendant who has no prior criminal record, my absolute expectation would be a sentence of probation,\" Epner told USA TODAY.\n\nEpner wasn't alone in thinking that could be the sentencing outcome.\n\n\"This is a case that does not involve any physical violence, and it doesn't – there's not sort of a 'named victim,' so to speak – and so the court is going to take that into consideration,\" Anna Cominsky, who directs the Criminal Defense Clinic at New York Law School, told USA TODAY.\n\n\"In addition, I think it is unlikely that he would be sent to prison given who he is, given both the fact that he has no criminal record, and there is no getting around the fact that he is a former president of the United States,\" Cominsky said.\n\nIncarceration a real possibility\n\nNorman Eisen, a Brookings Institution senior fellow who served as special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee during Trump's first impeachment, thought a sentence that includes some incarceration is likely.\n\nEisen co-authored a report looking at sentencing for other defendants with no criminal history who were convicted of falsifying business records in New York. There, he noted one construction executive was sentenced in 2015 to spend two days each week in jail for a year for falsifying records to conceal payments in a bribery scheme. In 2013, two corporate executives were ordered to spend four to six months in jail for falsifying records to misclassify their salaries as expenses under their employer's larger bribery and fraud scheme.\n\n\"I think he's likely to face a sentence of incarceration if he's convicted,\" Eisen told USA TODAY.\n\nCominsky said the evidence Merchan hears at trial could also influence his thinking when it comes to sentencing.\n\n\"Often you'll hear judges refer to testimony at trial, evidence that was presented at trial, and say, 'This is why I'm imposing this sentence, because I heard from this particular witness or I saw this particular piece of evidence,'\" Cominsky said.\n\nMoscow pushed back against the assumption that Trump's sentences on each count would run simultaneously, instead of being stacked on top of each other. Just as a judge may take into account that a defendant has won a Nobel Peace Prize or lifted orphans from poverty, the judge may look at significant evidence of bad acts, Moscow said.\n\n\"When you start attacking the judge's daughter, and making her out to be a target, you have just breached the normal rules,\" Moscow said.\n\nTrump has also posted a photo of himself wielding a bat, with his eyes directed toward an adjacent photo of Bragg, among other attacks on the district attorney. Bragg's office has received thousands of harassing emails, calls, and texts – including death threats – after Trump's social media attacks, it said in a court filing.\n\nDiana Florence, a New York lawyer who spent decades in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, said Merchan's sentence would need to have some relation to what other white-collar defendants in similar cases have received, and she would be surprised if someone had ever gotten a sentencing range for falsifying business records with a minimum of 10 years or more.\n\nSuch a long sentence \"would be very, very, very, very unusual, and if Judge Merchan wanted to make a point and do that, I highly doubt the appellate division would allow that to stand,\" she said. \"It's just too much time for the conduct.\"\n\nHowever, Florence added that a reasonable sentencing range could include a minimum period of more than a year incarcerated.\n\nSentencing someone with Secret Service protection?\n\nContemplating any jail or prison sentence would take Merchan into unchartered territory: Trump is the first former president ever criminally charged, and the Secret Service provides him with around-the-clock security.\n\nBut avoiding a sentence of incarceration on that basis risks undermining the idea of equal treatment under the law, Moscow suggested.\n\n\"If I were the judge − and I don't know what a judge would do in this case − I would reject out of hand the concept that because he was once president, and because as a matter of policy the Secret Service guards former presidents, that therefore he can't go to jail,\" Moscow said.\n\nThe question would then become how to reconcile equal treatment with ensuring a former president's security, according to Moscow. The judge could get creative, for example by ordering the former president to stay in a hotel wing or at a military base, where he is isolated just like any other prisoner but still has Secret Service protection.\n\n\"You can structure things to achieve the proper result without conceding that the defendant has the upper hand,\" Moscow said.\n\nChances of immediate prison? 'Less than 1%'\n\nMany convicted defendants are \"remanded\" pending sentencing, a process in which they are taken into custody while they await their sentence, Florence said.\n\nBut Florence didn't expect Merchan to give that order when it comes to Trump, and even if Merchan did, Trump would likely be able to get bail set by an appeals court in the thousands of dollars to stay free during his appeal. That's all the more likely if Trump receives a low sentence, since the appeal could take longer than his actual sentence, she said.\n\n\"The chances of him going to prison immediately, even if he's convicted in whatever, six weeks from now or whenever, are I would say less than 1% because he would immediately be released on bail pending appeal,\" according to Florence.\n\nEisen agreed Trump probably wouldn't be incarcerated by Election Day, even if he's convicted on all counts.\n\n\"I think he's extremely unlikely to be forced to serve that sentence pending appeal,\" Eisen said.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/11"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/02/21/donald-trump-criminal-trials-campaign/72612236007/", "title": "Donald Trump's criminal trials are set to collide with his reelection ...", "text": "GREENVILLE, S.C. – As he closes in on another Republican presidential nomination, former President Donald Trump is also on the cusp of leaving the campaign trail full-time for his first of four sweeping criminal cases.\n\nAfter a failed attempt to have his charges dismissed, Trump faces a March 25 start date for a trial involving hush money payments designed to influence the 2016 election.

It's complicated\n\nThe former president has spent months trying to delay his criminal cases, set for New York, Georgia and Washington. But it looks like Trump will have to balance campaigning and other criminal trials throughout the year.\n\nThe former president and his legal team are still working feverishly to delay everything past Election Day on Nov. 5, but a New York judge last week set jury selection for March 25 in his hush money case.\n\nTrump already has some experience attending trials while seeking reelection. After all, he has for months attended parts of civil cases against him, including a real estate fraud lawsuit that resulted in a $435.5 million penalty.\n\nActual criminal trials, however, require his attendance every day - and these could extend to November and beyond.\n\nIn the spring, Special Counsel Jack Smith hopes to try Trump in Washington on federal charges that he conspired to overturn the 2020 election, leading to the attempted insurrection by Trump's supporters on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nThat case was once set for March 4, but it was pushed back by Trump's pre-trial appeal claiming immunity from prosecution because he was president at the time his actions. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide soon whether they'll hear Trump's appeal on immunity, a decision that could further delay his proceedings.\n\nThe former president is also trying to hold up a May trial on federal charges of mishandling classified documents and defying a subpoena for their recovery.\n\nDitto for a case in Georgia that also alleges he attempted election theft in the Peach State. A co-defendant in his Georgia case is seeking the removal of Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, a move that would delay a potential trial in August, just weeks after Trump is expected to formally receive the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.\n\nDefense by day, campaign at night\n\nTrump faces a tight campaign-and-court calendar, but he outlined part of his political plan after New York City judge Juan M. Merchan rejected his attorneys' request to completely dismiss the hush money case.\n\n\"I'll be here during the day and campaigning during the night,\" Trump told reporters, adding that \"they want to keep me nice and busy so I can't campaign so hard.\"\n\nMeanwhile, rvals like former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley are calling that a fanciful idea that will inevitably weaken him in the general election.\n\nHaley, who trails Trump by big margins ahead of South Carolina's pivotal GOP primary, said the time constraints and expenses of Trump's trials will hurt all Republicans in races against President Joe Biden and other Democratic lawmakers.\n\n\"He himself has said he's going to spend more time this year in a courtroom than he is going to be on the campaign trail - that's a problem,\" Haley told NewsNation.\n\nDespite the former United Nations ambassador's warnings, Trump may have the Republican presidential nomination locked up before he has to face any of his criminal charges in a courthouse.\n\nIn a memo this week, the Trump campaign estimated it will rack up a majority of convention delegates no later than March 19, little less than a week before the start of the hush money trial.\n\nStill, the former president can't claim victory yet. While polling has suggested Trump's indictments have helped him with his conservative base, surveys also reflect disapproval among moderates and independents.\n\nThat's a problem for Trump in a general election, and Haley and other Republicans also point out that Trump's position will worsen if he is convicted in any of these trials.\n\nBig expenses\n\nTrump's campaign is also complicated by gigantic legal expenses, from lawyers' fees to massive civil judgments entered against him in the past month.\n\nNew York judge Arthur Engoron last week ordered Trump and his companies to pay up to $453.5 million for overvaluing his real estate holdings. And late last month, a New York jury assessed Trump more than $83 million in damages to writer E. Jean Carroll, who sued him for defamation over sexual assault.\n\nIn seeking to turn Trump's legal problems into political issues, Haley has noted that Trump is using campaign funds to pay legal bills, money that could otherwise be used to promote Republican prospects in a general election.\n\nOn Tuesday, Save America, Trump's main political action committee, reported paid and unpaid legal bills of nearly $5 million last month. Last year, the group reported legal bills of more than $55 million.\n\nIn a speech vowing not to drop out of the 2024 race, Haley said: \"It’s not normal to spend fifty million dollars in campaign donations on personal court cases.\"\n\nThe former governor during a Fox News town hall on Sunday also said that planning for Trump's pending trials are already cutting into Trump's campaign schedule. He has few events in South Carolina in the days before Saturday's primary.\n\n\"He's not campaigning a lot now,\" she said.\n\nSo even as Trump leads Haley in the 2024 Republican primary – and Biden in some hypothetical match-ups – the former president still faces dozens of criminal charges, hundreds of millions of dollars in legal judgments and a court schedule that's set to slice up his reelection campaign.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/09/01/trump-trial-dates-calendar/70727780007/", "title": "When is Trump going to court?

They’ve now been found guilty of criminal conduct, criminal tax fraud,” Honig told CNN’s Victor Blackwell on “Newsroom.”\n\n“It’s also a victory of sorts for the Manhattan district attorney,” Honig said. “Their theory, now, that part of the income for employees, including Allen Weisselberg, was paid through fringe benefits in order to avoid tax liability – that theory has been vindicated.”\n\nVideo Ad Feedback Hear what jurors in Trump Org. trial said about Trump 03:29 - Source: CNN\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told the jury in closing arguments that Trump “explicitly sanctioned” tax fraud and urged them to reject the defense’s argument that former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg was a rogue employee motivated by his own personal greed.\n\n“This whole narrative that Donald Trump is blissfully ignorant is just not true,” Steinglass said.\n\nThe jury heard that Trump agreed on a whim to pay the private school tuition for his Weisselberg’s grandchildren and signed a lease for a Manhattan apartment to shorten the executive’s commute. Trump personally signed his employees’ bonus checks at Christmas time and he initialed a memo reducing the salary of another top executives, which prosecutors said suggested he knew all along about the fraudulent scheme.\n\nProsecutors alleged for years top executives reduced their reported salaries by the amount of company-issued fringe benefits to avoid paying the required taxes.\n\nWeisselberg, who is on paid leave from the company, spent three days on the witness stand. He pleaded guilty to 15 felonies for failing to pay taxes on $1.76 million in income. As part of his plea deal, he will be sentenced to five months in jail if the judge finds that he testified truthfully.\n\nTrump Org. attorney Susan Necheles pledged to appeal, laying all the blame for any wrongdoing on Weisselberg.\n\n“Why would a corporation whose owner knew nothing about Weisselberg’s personal tax returns be criminally prosecuted for Allen Weisselberg’s personal conduct, for which they had no visibility or oversight? This case was unprecedented and legally incorrect,” Necheles said in a statement. “We will appeal this verdict.”\n\nWeisselberg’s key testimony\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg admitted he should have paid taxes on compensation, totaling roughly $200,000 in one year, which included a luxury Manhattan apartment overlooking the Hudson River, two Mercedes Benz car leases, parking, utilities, furniture and private school tuition for his grandchildren. He also testified that he paid himself and other executives’ bonuses as though they were independent consultants – enabling the Trump companies to evade paying taxes on them.\n\nWeisselberg testified that he pulled off the scheme with the help of his underling, Trump Organization controller Jeffrey McConney. McConney, who received immunity for testifying before the grand jury, admitted to some of the illegal conduct in his testimony.\n\nAfter Trump was elected president, Weisselberg testified, there was a “clean up” and many of the illegal practices stopped.\n\nHe revealed conversations he had with Trump, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., but told the jury when questioned by the Trump attorneys that he did not scheme or conspire with anybody in the Trump family.\n\nWeisselberg became emotional at times, telling the jury he was “embarrassed” by his conduct and that he “betrayed” the Trump family, who has been his employer for 49 years.\n\nProsecutors and defense attorneys called out Weisselberg’s split loyalties – wanting to live up to his plea deal and serve a lower jail sentence and his loyalty to the Trump family, who could pay him $1 million in compensation this year.\n\n‘In behalf of’\n\nTo prove the company’s guilt, prosecutors needed to demonstrate that Weisselberg or McConney was a “high managerial agent” who committed the crimes in the scope of his employment and “in behalf of” the company.\n\nProsecutors and defense lawyers went in circles arguing over what “in behalf of” meant.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan also struggled over how to explain the phrase to the jury and turned to two legal treaties to fashion a definition.\n\nThe judge explained it to the jury, saying, “Under the definition of ‘in behalf of,’ it is not necessary that the criminal acts actually benefit the corporation. But an agent’s acts are not ‘in behalf of’ a corporation if they were undertaken solely to advance the agents own interest. Put another way, if the agent’s acts were taken merely for personal gain, they were not ‘in behalf of’ the corporation.”\n\nAlan Futerfas, an attorney for the Trump Payroll Corporation, told reporters following the verdict the conclusion was incorrect.\n\n“A novel and really interesting issue developed during the trial. Obviously, the definition of ‘in behalf of’ – what that means. And we filed a lot of papers, the defense team, about what those words mean,” Futerfas said. “The judge recognized there was not a lot of definition on that at all and surely that will be one of the arguments we will make.”\n\nWeisselberg walked a fine line in his testimony, telling the jury he never wanted to hurt the company, he was driven by greed and mainly wanted to pay less in taxes. But, he also said, he knew at the time the company would benefit to some degree from his schemes.\n\nIn his testimony Weisselberg said, “It was a benefit to the company but primarily it was due to my greed.” He told the jury that the company saved money by paying less taxes on his off-the-books compensation and acknowledged when asked by prosecutor Susan Hoffinger if, while his primary goal was to avoid taxes, it also created a benefit to the company.\n\n“To some degree, yes,” Weisselberg testified.\n\nWeisselberg said he and McConney knew at the time that the company would pay less payroll taxes through the scheme although he said they never discussed it explicitly.\n\nThe Trump attorneys argued, repeatedly, to the jury that “Weisselberg did it for Weisselberg” to emphasize that he was motivated solely by his personal greed.\n\nOn cross examination, Weisselberg agreed that the decision to not pay taxes was his and made solely to benefit himself.\n\n“That was my intent,” Weisselberg said when questioned by the Trump attorneys, “to benefit myself.”\n\nThe lawyers for the Trump entities called just one fact witness, the real estate companies’ long-time accountant Donald Bender from Mazars USA, which dropped Trump as a client earlier this year.\n\nTrump attorneys said Bender was either aware of the off-the-books compensation or should have caught the tax fraud and they accused him of lying on the stand.\n\nWhen questioned by prosecutors Bender testified that he trusted and relied on Weisselberg, who testified that he hid the illegal scheme.\n\nSteinglass, the prosecutor, told the jury the Trump companies were guilty, and the illegal scheme was concocted “so the employees can get more net pay while costing the Trump Corporation less. It’s a win-win – unless you’re the tax authorities.”\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.", "authors": ["Kara Scannell Lauren Del Valle", "Kara Scannell", "Lauren Del Valle"], "publish_date": "2022/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/14/donald-trump-news-trials-calendar/73288907007/", "title": "Donald Trump faces 4 criminal trials: A calendar of what to expect", "text": "Two down, at least four to go.\n\nOn the eve of his first criminal trial, set to begin Monday in New York, former President Donald Trump continues to navigate a half-dozen civil and criminal cases as he campaigns to return to the White House.

Bragg announced the indictment Thursday and is expected to unveil the detailed charges Tuesday.\n\nTrump is expected to have his mug shot and fingerprints taken, have the formal charges read and then plead not guilty “loudly and proudly,” his lawyer Joe Tacopina told CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday. But the details haven’t been nailed down because the Secret Service will accompany Trump, Tacopina said.\n\nTrump's New York arraignment comes as he's under investigation elsewhere\n\nHowever the New York case is resolved, Trump faces other investigations in Georgia over alleged election fraud and from the Justice Department over whether he incited the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack and the discovery of hundreds of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.\n\nTrump has boasted about overcoming previous investigations including special counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 election and two House impeachments that resulted in Senate acquittals over his dealings with Ukraine and his role in the Capitol attack.\n\nTrump to go on legal assault, experts say:Donald Trump expected to unleash wave of legal challenges after Tuesday arraignment in New York\n\nTrump's arraignment spectacle:Donald Trump plans to turn his arraignment into a political spectacle. Here's how.\n\nTrump allies including Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene rally near courthouse\n\nCheers, boos and whistles drowned out Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., as she spoke briefly outside the Manhattan Criminal Court building before Donald Trump’s arraignment on criminal charges.\n\nOne attendee, Christina Lo, 61, a Manhattan retiree who supports Trump, called his indictment political persecution by Democrats.\n\n\"They had to wait until he declared his presidential run,\" she said.\n\nDion Cini, 54, of Brooklyn, carried a large “Trump or death” flag to show his support for the former president.\n\n“It’s a tragedy what’s happening in New York City today,” Cini said, adding the case could help the candidate running for the White House in 2024. “I think Donald Trump is going to get 20 points in the polls.”\n\n– Eduardo Cuevas and Zach Wichter\n\nNYC mayor's message to Greene:As Marjorie Taylor Greene leads protest against Trump indictment, NYC mayor has a message for her\n\nTrump could seek delays in criminal case: legal experts\n\nAfter New York charges against him are unsealed, Donald Trump could pursue a number of legal challenges that could delay any eventual trial, according to legal experts.\n\nTrump could try to dismiss the case, change the venue where it is heard and perhaps seek to have a new judge preside. If the charges are falsifying business records as expected, Sarah Krissoff, a former federal prosecutor, said Trump lawyers could claim the alleged violations are too old or exceed the statute of limitations of two to five years.\n\nTrump has said in a social media post Thursday that Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Mercan hates him, after presiding over a criminal case against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer.\n\n\"It is an understatement to say that he (Trump) has a litigious style,\" said Joshua Ritter, a former Los Angeles County prosecutor. \"You're going to see challenges to everything, every step of the way.\"\n\n– Kevin Johnson and David Jackson\n\nTrump expected to go on legal assault:Donald Trump expected to unleash wave of legal challenges after Tuesday arraignment in New York\n\nDonald Trump blaming George Soros while fundraising off indictment\n\nFormer President Donald Trump continues to seek political donations after his indictment, using anti-Semitic tropes that blame Democratic philanthropist George Soros in addition to longstanding themes he’s used like attacking investigations of him as witch hunts.\n\nSoros is a frequent target of antisemitic attacks on the far-right even in his home country of Hungary. As recently as Sunday, according to an archive at politicalemails.org, a campaign email referred to Alvin Bragg, the prosecutor whose office brought the case to the New York grand jury, as “George Soros’ hand-picked and funded Manhattan DA.”\n\nMoney raised by these emails will be split between Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign and a fund called Save America that has spent millions since the 2020 election paying lawyers who have worked for Trump, including on the case that prompted the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nHouse GOP chairmen oppose gag order on Trump as ‘unconstitutional’\n\nTwo House Republican chairmen opposed an anticipated gag order on Donald Trump pending his New York trial.\n\nReps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, head of the Judiciary Committee, and James Comer, head of the Oversight and Accountability Committee, called any potential order from Acting Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan against Trump speaking about the charges unconstitutional.\n\n“We are deeply concerned by reports the New York District Attorney may seek an unconstitutional gag order,” the chairmen said in a joint statement. “To put any restrictions on the ability of President Trump to discuss his mistreatment at the hands of this politically motivated prosecutor would only further demonstrate the weaponization of the New York justice system.”\n\n-- Bart Jansen\n\nTrump protests\n\nSteel barriers lined streets near the courthouse, roads were closed, and traffic was diverted across a swath of Manhattan on Tuesday in preparation for the arraignment of Trump.\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams on Monday urged potential protesters to follow police instructions and threatened anyone who becomes violent with arrest. Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell said the department has been preparing for the arraignment for weeks.\n\n\"I will remind everyone that violence and destruction are not part of legitimate lawful expression,\" he said at a briefing Monday. \"It will never be tolerated in our city.\"\n\nTrump called on his supporters to take to the streets of New York City and protest his arrest.\n\n-- John Bacon and Zach Wichter\n\nWhat time is Trump's arraignment? Trump's plans from NY to Florida\n\nAs it stands now, Trump is scheduled to leave his self-named tower around 1 p.m. for the trip to the district attorney's office and courthouse that should take about a half-an-hour, according to his schedule.\n\nAfter a formal surrender and processing, Trump is scheduled for arraignment at 2:15 p.m.\n\nThe schedule anticipates a 3 p.m. departure from the courthouse to the airport for the trip to Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump is scheduled to arrive back at his Palm Beach home in time for an 8:15 p.m. speech to supporters.\n\nAll of this is subject to change depending on events.\n\n– David Jackson\n\nWhat are the charges facing Trump?\n\nWitnesses before the Manhattan grand jury have described hush-money payments Trump directed former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen to make to silence two women who claimed to have had sex with Trump before the 2016 election.\n\nLegal experts expect a combination of misdemeanor charges alleging falsification of business records about the payments, combined with a felony such as a campaign finance violation.\n\nBut Trump has denied wrongdoing and Tacopina said there is no documentation of false business records.\n\n“All of the Tuesday stuff is very much up in the air except that we will very loudly and proudly say not guilty,” Tacopina said. “We’re not doing anything at the arraignment because that would be showmanship and nothing more because we haven’t even seen the indictment.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nMore:Trump indicted: How did Michael Cohen arrange hush payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal?\n\nTrump judge expected to be same as for Trump Organization case\n\nThe New York judge tentatively assigned to preside at Donald Trump’s arraignment is familiar with players in the former president’s orbit.\n\nActing Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan oversaw the fraud trial of Trump's namesake real estate company and the related Trump Payroll Corporation, which ended in December with a conviction and $1.6 million in fines.\n\nMerchan also oversaw the sentencing of former Trump financial chief Allen Weisselberg, whose testimony in the fraud case helped secure the convictions.\n\nTrump has harshly criticized Merchan in posts on his social media company, Truth Social.\n\n\"The Judge 'assigned' to my Witch Hunt Case, a 'Case' that has NEVER BEEN CHARGED BEFORE, HATES ME,\" Trump wrote in one post.\n\n– Kevin Johnson, Josh Meyer, David Jackson\n\nWhat is an arraignment?:What the legal proceeding means ahead of Trump's appearance Tuesday.\n\nWho is judge in Trump arraignment?:Juan Merchan, judge in Trump Organization trial, expected to preside at Trump arraignment\n\nLawyers for Trump, Cohen argue against each other’s credibility\n\nTacopina and Cohen’s lawyer, Lanny Davis, foreshadowed the fight over credibility in any eventual trial.\n\nTacopina called Cohen a convicted liar who \"is constitutionally incapable of telling the same story the same way twice.\" Tacopina said there is no documentation of Trump falsifying business records.\n\n“I know there is no such evidence,” Tacopina said. “Michael Cohen is a pathological, convicted liar.”\n\nDavis said Cohen and other witnesses have provided testimony and documentation. Cohen has already been imprisoned in part because he arranged for $280,000 in hush payments to Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal.\n\n“Michael Cohen submitted a lot of documentation,” Davis said. “There are other documents from other people and other testimony from other people.”\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nNew York mayor warns Trump protesters to ‘control yourselves’\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams on Monday urged potential protesters for Donald Trump’s arraignment – he singled out Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. – to be on their best behavior and threatened anyone who becomes violent with arrest.\n\n“While there may be some rabble-rousers thinking about coming to our city tomorrow, our message is clear and simple: control yourselves,” Adams said.\n\nHe said there were no specific threats. But he said people like Greene, “who is known to spread misinformation and hate speech,” are expected to visit the city. New York Young Republicans announced she would attend a 10:30 a.m. rally Tuesday at Collect Pond Park.\n\n“While you are in town, be on your best behavior,” Adams said.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhat is a grand jury?:Here's what to know about the jury that voted to indict Trump.\n\nStormy Daniels says she's received death threats since Trump indictment\n\nStormy Daniels says she is “kind of numb” now that the hush-money investigation stemming from her alleged affair with Donald Trump in 2006 has led to his criminal indictment – and that it has prompted death threats against her.\n\nDaniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, told the Times UK that the charges by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office amount to a vindication of her efforts to hold the former president accountable. But in her first interview since Trump’s indictment last Thursday, she said the as-yet-unspecific charges have put her in more personal danger than ever before.\n\n“The first time it was like gold digger, slut, whore. You know, liar, whatever and this time it's like, ‘I'm gonna murder you,’ “ she said of the threatening messages she has been getting.\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nStormy Daniels faces threats:Stormy Daniels' accusations against Trump prompt post-indictment death threats, she says", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/04/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/16/donald-trump-trial-live-updates/73336597007/", "title": "Trump hush money trial day 2 recap: Judge Merchan selects 7 jurors", "text": "Editor's note: This page reflects the news from Donald Trump's criminal trial from Tuesday, April 16. For the latest updates on jury selection in Trump's hush money trial, follow our live updates of jury selection on Friday, April 19.\n\nNEW YORK — Former President Donald Trump has been back in court for the second day of his Manhattan criminal trial as he's accused of covering up giving hush money to a porn star to help his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump, 77, faces 34 felony counts of falsifying business records to conceal payments to Stormy Daniels. She has said she and Trump had sex in 2006, not long after Melania Trump gave birth to their son Barron. Trump has long denied the claim.\n\nProsecutors allege the falsification was done to conceal violating federal campaign finance contribution limits and a plan to violate New York tax and election laws, making the crimes felonies.\n\nKeep up with USA TODAY's live updates from inside and outside the Manhattan courthouse:\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nDonald Trump trial live updates:Latest news on jury selection and what Day 4 will bring\n\nTrump says judge is 'rushing this trial'\n\nWhile leaving court for the day, former President Donald Trump repeated his assertion that Judge Juan Merchan is biased against him,\n\nHe's a conflicted judge,\" Trump said. \"We're having a hard time with the New York state system.\"\n\nMerchan is \"rushing this trial,\" the defendant added. \"And he’s doing as much as he can for the Democrats.\n\nThe New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics' found no \"reasonable basis to question the judge’s impartiality.\"\n\nTrump also questioned the basis of his prosecution.\n\n\"This is a Biden-inspired witch hunt and it should end,\" he said.\n\nTrump has not provided any evidence that Biden had a role in Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's decision to bring charges.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nTrump leaves the courtroom\n\nFormer President Donald Trump left the courtroom after a long day of jury selection in his New York criminal hush money case. There will be no proceedings on Wednesday, but a large group of potential jurors was asked to be at the court at 9:30 a.m. ET on Thursday.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSeventh juror selected\n\nOf three potential jurors who remained by 5:30 p.m. ET, one was selected to serve on the jury. The prosecution used \"peremptory strikes\" – a kind of veto – to get the other two excused. One of the excused jurors was a man who said he worked in the real estate industry and knew people who knew former President Donald Trump.\n\nThat makes seven selected jurors. 12 jurors plus several alternates are needed before the case may proceed to opening statements.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nMore juror selection coming this evening?\n\nIt's possible we could have more jurors selected this evening. Judge Juan Merchan asked remaining potential jurors to step outside the courtroom after lawyers for the prosecution and the defense questioned them about their ability to be fair and impartial in the case. Merchan said the lawyers will review their notes.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump to hold campaign rally Saturday in North Carolina\n\nBodegas in Harlem aren't the only campaign trail stops Trump has planned this week. The Trump campaign is moving forward with plans to hold political rallies during his hush money trial on days when he doesn't need to be in court.\n\nTrump has a campaign rally scheduled for 7 p.m. Saturday at an airport in Wilmington, N.C.\n\nNorth Carolina is an important state in the fall presidential race between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump carried North Carolina by narrow margins in 2016 and 2020, but Biden supporters believe that issues like abortion and Trump's legal problems give them a chance to flip the state this fall.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nTrump to target crime in New York\n\nIn an attempt to clap back at Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, Donald Trump is going to Harlem − Bragg's native neighborhood and political home base − to campaign at a bodega that was the site of a fatal stabbing in 2022.\n\nIn an incident that inflamed critics, the bodega clerk was charged with murder after he stabbed an attacker in self-defense. The charges were later dropped.\n\nTrump, a former New Yorker, is expected to characterize the nation's largest city as crime-ridden, in order to portray Bragg as a left-wing zealot who is misdirecting his energies on Trump's prosecution for 34 counts of falsifying business records, instead of focusing on street crime. Trump has previously attacked Bragg on social media.\n\nAlthough Trump and congressional Republicans have previously argued that New York City suffers from high crime, the murder and violent crime rates in the city are lower than the national average, lower than most other large cities, and well below the rates during the 1990s when Rudy Giuliani was mayor.\n\nTrump's new home state of Florida has a higher murder rate rate than New York, and West Palm Beach, Florida, which neighbors Trump's Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, has the ninth-highest murder rate in the country.\n\n-Ben Adler\n\nPotential juror in real estate industry says he knows people who know Trump\n\nIt's a big city, but a small world: A potential juror who said he has lived on Manhattan's Upper East Side since 2004 said he knows people who know former President Donald Trump.\n\nThe New Yorker's comment didn't come in response to a question. Instead, he brought the indirect connection up after responding to the 42 preliminary questions jurors are being asked before lawyers for the two sides will speak to them.\n\nThe potential juror said he has worked in the real estate development industry since 2010. He also briefly followed Trump when Trump was on Twitter, which is now called X. He added that he read Trump's book, \"Trump: The Art of the Deal,\" a long time ago.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJury selection continues: Multiple potential jurors dismissed as group responds to Judge Juan Merchan's questionnaire\n\nMultiple potential jurors were dismissed late Tuesday as a group of six individuals was brought in to respond to the the list of 42 questions for potential jurors that Judge Juan Merchan decided on before trial.\n\nOne of the individuals was excused over work timing issues. Another was let go after she said she \"deeply\" felt she had concerns, upon being in the courtroom, about her ability to be fair and impartial.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nIs hush money illegal?\n\nHush money is a wide-ranging term used to refer to paying someone to not speak publicly about an issue. It's not necessarily illegal, so why is Donald Trump in court over a hush money case?\n\nThe former president isn’t actually charged with making a $130,000 payment to porn actress Stormy Daniels in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement. Instead, he's accused of falsifying business records to hide the payment.\n\nManhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg described the payments to Daniels and another woman, former Playboy model Karen McDougal, as part of a “catch-and-kill” strategy to prevent the women from telling their stories. But the criminal charges are that Trump falsified his company’s business records to conceal the payments.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nWhy is Trump on trial?\n\nProsecutors claim Donald Trump falsified records to conceal that he was reimbursing his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, for a $130,000 hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels. Daniels has said she had sex with the real estate mogul shortly after his wife, Melania Trump, gave birth to their son, Barron. Trump denies Daniels' claim, and has pleaded not guilty in the case.\n\nThe charges are felonies, as opposed to misdemeanors, because prosecutors claim Trump falsified the records in order to conceal violating federal election laws through a payment that was meant to help his 2016 presidential campaign but exceeded campaign contribution limits.\n\nThe payment was made less than two weeks before the 2016 election. Prosecutors also allege the records were falsified in order to violate New York tax and election laws.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nNew potential jurors told to come back Thursday, but jury questioning continues Tuesday for others\n\nJudge Juan Merchan had several dozen new potential jurors brought into the courtroom and instructed them to return Thursday at 9:30 a.m. ET. A court security officer told one of them, \"Ma'am, ma'am put your cell phone away,\" after the woman saw Trump and tried to take out her phone.\n\n\"I know that you’ve been sitting around all day,\" Merchan told the new group. He said things would start promptly on Thursday.\n\nProceedings aren't over for the day, however. There are six more people from an earlier group of potential jurors still to be questioned.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nSix jurors chosen for Trump's hush money trial\n\nSix jurors have been selected to serve throughout Donald Trump's New York criminal hush money trial. All six were sworn in late Tuesday afternoon.\n\n12 jurors, plus several alternates, are needed in total before the trial can move forward to opening statements.\n\nMerchan instructed the six selected jurors to plan to come back Monday at 9:30 a.m. ET, indicating it's possible opening statements in the trial could happen next week.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge Juan Merchan allows potential juror to continue despite satirical posts\n\nThe judge allowed another potential juror to continue after the Trump team took issue with her previous social media posts. Merchan said the posts were satire, and the prospective juror was fairly open about disagreeing with Trump's political views.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump trial dates: Holidays, Barron Trump's high school graduation and more\n\nWhile Donald Trump's hush money trial is expected to extend six to eight weeks, the former president won't be in the courtroom every day. Judge Juan Merchan said Tuesday that the trial will take a break on Wednesdays for its duration, and there will not be any trial on April 29.\n\nThe judge also said there will not be any trial dates that would conflict with religious observances. That could include Passover, though the courtroom hours could simply be cut short on April 22 and 23.\n\nThe case will also potentially adjourn for the high school graduation of Barron Trump, Donald Trump's youngest son, next month.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJuror who posted 'I'm dumb as f---' parody video featuring Trump dismissed\n\nJudge Juan Merchan dismissed a potential juror who posted on social media a parody video generated by artificial intelligence that was titled \"I'm dumb as f---\" and featured Trump. The potential juror also posted \"no one is above the law\" about Trump's separate criminal case over his handling of classified documents.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPotential juror allowed to continue despite Trump's trial team knocking a post from her husband\n\nJudge Juan Merchan allowed another potential juror to continue despite the Trump trial team taking issue with a social media post it uncovered from her husband, which the judge said was from eight years ago.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump smirks at potential juror who posted 'lock him up'\n\nDonald Trump craned his neck toward a potential juror and flashed a smirk, after the man said he didn't still believe Trump should be \"locked up.\" The non-verbal expression from Trump came after his trial team uncovered a social media post in which the potential juror celebrated a court striking down a Trump travel ban and then stated, \"Get him out and lock him up.\" The man said he didn't still believe Trump should be behind bars after the man was called in for questioning by Judge Juan Merchan, who ultimately struck him from consideration based on the post.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJuror who posted 'lock him up' about Donald Trump dismissed by judge\n\nJudge Juan Merchan struck a potential juror from consideration after Trump's legal team uncovered a social media post in which the potential juror said \"lock him up\" about Trump.\n\nThe post wasn't shown to reporters, but the judge read it out loud (without detailing what the spelling, capitalization, or spacing looked like, although he described the exclamation points): \"Good news!! Trump lost his court battle on his unlawful travel ban!!!\"\n\nThe post continued by stating about Trump, \"Get him out and lock him up.\"\n\nMerchan said if the post ended before the last phrase, he wouldn't really have a problem. However, the juror expressed a desire for Trump to be locked up.\n\n\"I don't think that I can allow this juror to remain,\" Merchan said.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge Juan Merchan allows juror linked to anti-Trump 'party' video to continue\n\nJudge Juan Merchan allowed a potential juror linked to a video of anti-Trump celebrations to continue being considered for the jury after she acknowledged seeing the gathering outside and maintained she could be fair and impartial.\n\nTrump lawyer Susan Necheles described the video as \"clearly an anti-Trump event that she's out celebrating and partying at.\" Merchan agreed it was an anti-Trump event of some kind (the video wasn't shown to reporters), but said it wasn't clear the potential juror was there. He did allow the juror to be questioned about it.\n\nThe potential juror said she remembered seeing people out in the street celebrating. She maintained she could be fair and impartial in the case, repeating Merchan's explanation to potential jurors on Monday that jurors decide the facts in the case, while the judge decides the law.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nJudge tells Trump lawyer: 'I will not have any jurors intimidated. ... Speak to your client.'\n\nAfter a potential juror was questioned about a video on social media, she left the courtroom and Judge Juan Merchan said he heard Trump audibly making comments, although the judge couldn't hear what Trump said.\n\n\"I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom,\" Merchan told Trump lawyer Todd Blanche. \"Speak to your client,\" Merchan instructed.\n\nBlanche leaned over to Trump and whispered to him. Trump then leaned forward at the defense table.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer: Video proves juror should be excluded\n\nThe judge just reviewed a video that Trump's legal team says is grounds for the judge to exclude a potential juror from the case. Reporters weren't shown the video, but the legal team indicated they found it through online searches.\n\n\"This is clearly an anti-Trump event that she's out celebrating and partying at,\" said Susan Necheles, a lawyer for Trump.\n\nMerchan agreed it appears to be that kind of event, but it's not clear to the judge the potential juror was there.\n\nThe judge says he is going to allow Trump's team to ask her questions about it. The potential juror has just been brought in.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDonald Trump's lawyer says not all potential jurors gave accurate answers\n\nTrial proceedings have resumed after a break for lunch, although the jury hasn't been brought into the courtroom yet.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche says a look at the social media activity of potential jurors suggests not everyone was truthful. He wants Judge Juan Merchan to strike multiple potential jurors \"for cause,\" which would mean the judge determines a juror doesn't meet certain qualifications or probably can't be impartial in the case.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhat happened this morning in Trump's hush money trial?\n\nAfter a slight delay for two late potential jurors, more New York residents answered a set of 42 questions Judge Juan Merchan decided on before the trial, such as where they get their news.\n\nAlong the way, a handful of jurors were excused after saying they had now concluded they couldn't guarantee they would be impartial in the case or had conflicts that might prevent them from being present and giving their full attention to the trial.\n\nAnd for the first time since the trial started Monday, attorneys for Trump and the prosecution questioned jurors directly. Trump lawyer Todd Blanche asked several potential jurors what their opinion of Donald Trump was. Some said they disagreed with Trump's policies, others said they didn't have an opinion, while at least a couple said their opinion wasn't relevant in the courtroom.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhen is Trump's Georgia trial?\n\nDonald Trump faces 10 criminal counts in Georgia related to alleged election interference.\n\nHis trial in the Peach State hasn't been scheduled yet, but it will be televised, making it the only of Trump's four criminal cases to be broadcast.\n\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis proposed to start the trial Aug. 5, but that would mean the potentially five-month trial would be running on Election Day.\n\n– Bart Jansen & Kinsey Crowley\n\nTodd Blanche and Susan Necheles: Donald Trump's lawyers\n\nThey aren’t household names yet like their universally known client, Donald Trump. But the lawyers trying to keep the former president out of prison in his New York hush money trial − Todd Blanche and Susan Necheles − likely will become minor celebrities once the court battle gets going this week.\n\nA year ago, when a grim-faced Trump made history as the first former president to face criminal charges, Blanche and Necheles sat by his side as he pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts of falsifying business records associated with hush money payments to two women.\n\nBlanche, who usually does the talking in court on the hush-money case, told reporters that Trump was determined to fight the charges.\n\n\"He's frustrated, he's upset,\" Blanche said. \"It's not going to stop him.\"\n\n– Josh Meyer\n\nJudge will hold Donald Trump contempt hearing on April 23\n\nJudge Juan Merchan on Monday moved the date for a hearing over whether Donald Trump violated a gag order and should be held in contempt in the New York hush money case. The hearing will now be held on Tuesday, April 23, one day sooner than originally planned.\n\nProsecutor Christopher Conroy argued on Monday that Trump should be held in contempt and fined $3,000 for three social media posts that Conroy said violated the judge's prohibition on Trump publicly commenting on the participation of potential witnesses.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s campaign puns ‘Stormy’ criticism of Donald Trump\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s Democratic campaign put out a statement Monday criticizing Republican rival Donald Trump over abortion and highlighting the controversy in Arizona where an 1864 law has been reinstated to outlaw all abortion.\n\nBut the headline sounded more like an Empire State of mind than focused on the Grand Canyon state. The same day Trump’s trial began on charges he falsified business records to pay hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels, the Biden campaign headline cited “Stormy” coverage of the abortion ban and the attempt to “hush panic.”\n\nTrump has claimed credit for appointing as president three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade, which had guaranteed a right to abortion. He recently said states should be left to decide the decision, but that the Arizona law “went too far” and should be overturned.\n\n–Bart Jansen\n\nIs Trump trial being televised?\n\nThe trial won't be televised, as is typical in New York courts. Reporters will be present in the courtroom and an overflow room that will have a live stream of the proceedings.\n\nTrump may hold press conferences outside of court and speak to reporters in the courthouse hallway.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWhy did Michael Cohen go to prison?\n\nMichael Cohen, Donald Trump's former attorney, pleaded guilty in 2018 to concealing more than $4 million from the IRS and \"causing $280,000 in payments to be made to silence two women who otherwise planned to speak publicly about their alleged affairs with a presidential candidate, thereby intending to influence the 2016 presidential election,\" according to court records.\n\nProsecutors said Cohen arranged a $150,000 payment to McDougal and a $130,000 payment to Daniels.\n\nCohen was sentenced to three years in prison but was released early to home detention because of the spread of COVID-19.\n\n– Bart Jansen\n\nDonald Trump lashes out over hush money case on Truth Social\n\nDonald Trump has used Truth Social in the last few hours to attack his hush money trial, calling it a \"farce\" on his social media platform and an effort to target his reelection bid.\n\nThere is no evidence that the sweeping criminal charges Trump faces across four cases are attempts to undermine his presidential campaign.\n\nTrump has also shared a poll on Truth Social on Tuesday showing him leading Biden in pivotal swing states including Georgia, Nevada and Michigan.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nJurors dismissed for lunch\n\nJudge Juan Merchan dismissed potential jurors for lunch, telling them to be back at 2:15 p.m. ET.\n\nOutside of their presence, Merchan indicated in a conversation with lawyers for both sides that a process of striking jurors would begin later this afternoon. That could mean the lawyers will begin to use \"peremptory strikes\" – essentially vetos on particular jury candidates.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer to jurors: What is your real opinion of Donald Trump?\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche posed the same question to several potential jurors: What is your real opinion of Donald Trump?\n\nBlanche got a variety of answers.\n\n\"I'm a female. He's targeted some females,\" one potential juror said. She added that some of her friends have strong opinions on Trump, and she knows there are opinions that he doesn't treat females correctly, but she doesn't know the details and doesn't have her own conclusion about it.\n\nAnother potential juror said he has a lot of friends in law enforcement who are fairly \"pro-Trump,\" but he didn't personally have an opinion on Trump on national politics.\n\nOne woman said she's a person of color, so people around her have opinions on Trump. But she appreciated that Trump actually speaks his mind.\n\nAnother prospective juror said he would be happy to share his view with Blanche if they were in a bar, but in the courtroom his opinion isn't important. After being pressed, he told Blanche he's a Democrat, but all Trump is to him in this room is a defendant.\n\nTrump is \"fascinating,\" another potential juror said. Trump walks into a room and just sets people off \"one way or the other.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump lawyer to jurors: Trump wants 'a fair shake'\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche began questioning potential jurors in the early afternoon. \"This isn't a baseball game,\" Blanche started off by saying. This is extraordinarily serious, and it's extraordinarily important to President Trump that we're getting \"a fair shake.\"\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWho is Karen McDougal?\n\nKaren McDougal is a former Playboy model. She indirectly received a hush money payment in 2016 after claiming to have an affair with Donald Trump.\n\nMichael Cohen, Trump's former attorney, funneled the money through the publication National Enquirer owned by American Media Inc., under a \"catch and kill\" approach, paying the tabloid to buy rights to her story and prevent her from telling anyone else about it.\n\nMcDougal has since spoken out about her affair with Trump, saying it lasted for about 10 months starting in 2006. He denies the allegation.\n\n– Kinsey Crowley\n\nProsecutor references Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, asks if jurors can keep open mind on witnesses with 'baggage'\n\nProsecutor Joshua Steinglass told potential jurors that several witnesses in the case have some \"baggage.\" He said they include a tabloid publisher, an adult film star, and a former lawyer for Trump, Michael Cohen. The adult film star Steinglass referenced is almost certainly Stormy Daniels, who received the $130,000 hush money payment at issue in the case.\n\nCohen pleaded guilty to several crimes, including lying to Congress, Steinglass noted, adding that some witnesses have been given immunity.\n\nSteinglass said those are factors that should be taken into account by jurors, but asked if those factors would, on their own, prevent the potential jurors from listening to or believing the witnesses. No one said they would.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump changes mind on listening to private talk between lawyers and judge\n\nA lawyer for Trump previously indicated the former president wanted to be present for \"sidebars\" in the trial. Those are communications between the judge and at least one lawyer from each side that are outside the earshot of the potential jurors.\n\nBut a little past noon on Tuesday, after lawyers from each side went up to Judge Juan Merchan for a private conversation, the judge asked Trump to confirm that he was now waiving his right to be present for those conversations. Trump confirmed he was.\n\nThere are various reasons to have a sidebar, such as a lawyer's desire to explain an objection to something when giving that explanation means saying things that could prejudice the jury.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nWould-be juror Kara McGee reports on happenings inside the courtroom, says jury box is balanced\n\n\"You walked in and you felt like history was happening which was a really, really cool sensation,\" excused potential juror Kara McGee told a crowded field of reporters.. \"I wish I could have stayed for the entire trial. It's fascinating, it's unprecedented.\"\n\n\"You got a sense that people were really trying to put anything they had brought to this aside and step in and do their civic duty,\" McGee said. She reported being pleasantly surprised at the honesty of fellow jurors − some disclosed they were on Trump mailing lists or watched Fox News, while others said they had volunteered for anti-Trump causes, giving a clearer picture of the political makeup of the jury, which she said seemed fairly balanced.\n\nMcGee herself is \"not a fan\" of the former president. During COVID-19 she lived with someone who was immunocompromised and wasn't pleased with how he had handled the pandemic. She also has a sister adopted from China and cited his divisive rhetoric about the country.\n\nHer views on his policies don't mean he shouldn't get his day in court though, she said.\n\n\"Something extremely important in this country, especially in this age where en masse we do not trust each other, is the right to a fair trial,\" McGee said. \"No matter what you think of someone as a person and what other things they may have done, what he is on trial for is a very specific thing that even he deserves the right to a fair trial\"\n\n−Anna Kaufman\n\nLawyers begin addressing jury candidates directly\n\nAround 11:37 a.m. ET, lawyers began to ask potential jurors questions directly. Before, the jury candidates had only been answering questions from a 42-question list Judge Juan Merchan decided on before the trial.\n\nJoshua Steinglass from the Manhattan District Attorney's office was the first lawyer to speak. He introduced himself and his team, and said they are trying to pick jurors who will be fair to the defense and to the prosecution.\n\n\"Let's start with the obvious,\" Steinglass said, noting Trump is a former president and current presidential candidate. Steinglass said jurors aren't expected to have been living under a rock; the important thing is that jurors are able to be fair.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nDefendant Trump to hold political rally Saturday in North Carolina\n\nThe Trump campaign is moving forward with plans to hold political rallies around the hush money trial, scheduling an event for Saturday in Wilmington, N.C.\n\nThe airport rally is scheduled to start at 7 p.m. on Saturday; the trial takes weekends off.\n\nNorth Carolina is an important state in the fall presidential race between Trump and President Joe Biden.\n\nTrump carried North Carolina by narrow margins in 2016 and 2020, but Biden supporters believe that issues like abortion and Trump's criminal cases give them a chance to flip the state this fall.\n\n−David Jackson\n\nDismissed juror touts importance of fair trial\n\nKara McGee, a dismissed juror, exited the courtroom Tuesday afternoon to a swarm of microphones and cameras eager to hear what she thought of the former president and why she had been ousted from the pool.\n\nMcGee is one of the roughly 500 potential jurors called Monday when the trial kicked off. She was released Tuesday for scheduling conflicts with her cyber-security job.\n\n\"It was a little bit surreal to be that close to a former president, someone who's been on the news in the public eye so much,\" McGee told reporters. She reported looking down on the questionnaire while in the jury box and making only minimal eye contact with Trump who she assumed was looking at her.\n\nSome of the questions she was asked dealt with whether she had an opinion on the defendant being a former president, and how that should affect the trial. Mcgee told the judge she could be unbiased. \"It's very difficult for anyone really in this country to not come to this with prior opinions, I think we all have prior opinions about the defendant unless you've been living in a cardboard box since 2014,\" she said. \"But, personally, the right to a fair trial in this country is more important to me than anything this particular defendant has done or any feelings about him I personally have.\"\n\n−Anna Kaufman\n\nTrump mutters at defense table as potential juror says he is being treated fairly\n\nFormer President Donald Trump could be seen muttering at the defense table after a potential juror said she believed he was being treated fairly in the case.\n\nThe woman, who has lived in New York for more than 20 years, was responding to one of the questions each potential juror is being asked: \"Do you have any feelings or opinions about how Mr. Trump is being treated in this case?\"\n\nThe woman was later excused after she said she was \"not 100%\" sure she could be impartial in the case.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nHow long will the Trump trial last?\n\nThe trial will last about six-to-eight weeks, according to a court media advisory.\n\nThe proceedings are generally scheduled for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday each week. The court may make some accommodations for the Passover holiday in April. Trump has asked for May 17 off for Barron Trump's high school graduation, but the judge has not yet issued a ruling on the request.\n\n-Kinsey Crowley and Aysha Bagchi\n\nJuror with Republican friends and family excused over bias concerns\n\nA potential juror who said he believed he had unconscious bias that could get in the way of being impartial was excused Tuesday morning.\n\nOriginally from Texas, the man added he wasn't sure he could be fair and impartial. Judge Juan Merchan then told him there was a need for an unequivocal assurance that he can be impartial. The potential juror said growing up he had a bunch of Republican family and friends and it would \"probably\" be hard to be impartial.\n\nAfter conferring privately with attorneys, Merchan excused the man from service.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump would rather be on the campaign trail\n\nThe former president and presumptive Republican nominee argued as he entered the courtroom Tuesday that he should be campaigning in state such as Pennsylvania, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia rather than attending the trial. He alleged again without evidence that the trial was being directed from the Biden White House.\n\n“They’re using this in order to try and win an election,” Trump said.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nMonday featured mass dismissals of potential jurors\n\nThe beginning of jury selection Monday afternoon demonstrated how many New Yorkers will be quickly deemed ineligible. About 96 potential jurors came into the courtroom and more than 50 were swiftly excused because they said they couldn't be fair and impartial. At least 10 more potential jurors were excused later for other reasons, leaving a much smaller group.\n\nIn total, the New York criminal court has called upon 500 New Yorkers to potentially comprise the 12 jurors and several alternates who will be asked to hear all the evidence in the trial.\n\n−Aysha Bagchi\n\nNew Yorkers unperturbed by Trump trial circus\n\nNew Yorkers who work in the Manhattan courts lined up behind police barricades to enter as NYPD officers reported there was a security freeze while Trump entered Tuesday morning.\n\nDan Horwitz, a white-collar defense attorney who had a case later that day sat in nearby Foley Park. “You get used to it,” he said of the interruptions the former presidents cases have caused “It’s just another day in New York.”\n\nJury selection may take some time, he says, but he does think it’s possible to find an impartial bench. “Jurors take their jobs seriously, it’s New York so you gotta weed out the nuts and people who are going to say 'I hate this guy,'” he said, “but most people take it seriously.”\n\n−Anna Kaufman\n\nAs crowds dissipate, Trump becomes just another New Yorker getting his day in court\n\nDay 2 of Donald Trump's first criminal trial kicked off with little fanfare. Even the modest crowds from the day before had dissipated leaving just two pro-Trump demonstrators wandering outside the courthouse.\n\n−Anna Kaufman\n\nTrump continues futile call for judge's recusal\n\nIn his pre-trial statement to the press Tuesday morning, Trump repeated his argument that Judge Juan Merchan should be removed from the case because his daughter works for Democratic politicians.\n\nMerchan has refused to withdraw, noting that the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics' found Merchan's impartiality couldn't be reasonably questioned. The New York City Bar Association has described Trump's accusation of bias as \"baseless.\"\n\nTrump said legal scholars such as Jonathan Turley and Andrew McCarthy have called the prosecution a “disgrace.”\n\n“It should have never happened,” Trump said. “It should have been thrown out a long time ago.”\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nJurors are running late, judge says\n\nJudge Juan Merchan arrived in the courtroom at about 9:45 a.m. ET for the second day of trial proceedings. After the lawyers identified themselves and Trump, Merchan said, \"Good morning, counsel, good morning Mr. Trump.\" Trump made a displeased expression as the judge acknowledged him.\n\nThe judge said two potential jurors still haven't arrived, while a third has arrived despite feeling sick. Although she indicated she had tested negative for COVID-19, she also said she didn't feel well enough to be there. After checking with the lawyers, Merchan excused her from service.\n\nTrump lawyer Todd Blanche said the missing jurors are running more than 15 minutes late and asked that they be excused from service. Merchan indicated he will give them at least a couple more minutes.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump contends payments accurately described as ‘legal expenses’\n\nFormer President Donald Trump gave a preview of his defense Tuesday at his New York criminal trial by arguing his payments to his former lawyer Michael Cohen − which the prosecution and Cohen say were reimbursements for hush money to porn star Stormy Daniels − were accurately described as “legal expenses” on his company records.\n\n“I was paying a lawyer and marked it down as a legal expense – some accountant, I didn’t know – marked it down as a legal expense,” Trump said during a two-minute statement to reporters before entering court. “That’s exactly what it was. And you get an indictment over that?”\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records. Cohen paid Daniels $130,000 to silence her claim before the 2016 election about having had sex with Trump in 2006, while Trump was married. Trump has denied her allegation.\n\n−Bart Jansen\n\nTrump arrives in courtroom for day 2 of hush money trial\n\nDonald Trump entered the courtroom and sat down at the defense table at 9:30 a.m. ET Tuesday for the second day of his New York hush money trial. He is wearing a blue suit jacket and striped blue tie.\n\nJury selection is expected to resume in the morning. Judge Juan Merchan sizably whittled down the first batch of about 96 potential jurors on Monday. Dozens were excused because they said they couldn't be fair and impartial in the case, while several more were let go for other reasons.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump trial day 2: schedule and location\n\nThe trial is scheduled to reconvene at 9:30 a.m. today at the criminal court in lower Manhattan.\n\nThe legal teams are expected to pick up where they left off yesterday, questioning dozens of potential jurors.\n\nProceedings are likely to run through the afternoon with a break for lunch. The trial takes off on Wednesdays, so after today, the trial will reconvene on Thursday morning.\n\n−Kinsey Crowley\n\nMonday was a bad day for Trump\n\nInside the courtroom, Monday wasn't a good day for the former president.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan opened proceedings by denying Trump's request for the judge's recusal. Trump argued Merchan should get off the case because his daughter leads a marketing agency that does work for Democratic political candidates. But Merchan noted the determination by the New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics that his impartiality couldn't reasonably be questioned based on his daughter's work because the Trump case doesn't involve her business.\n\nMerchan also denied a similar request from Trump back in August. \"The court will not address this matter further,\" he said Monday.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office also asked for Trump to be held in contempt and fined based on alleged violations of Merchan's gag order on the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Merchan prohibited Trump from publicly commenting on the participation of potential witnesses in the case. But prosecutor Christopher Conroy pointed to three potential violations, including when Trump appeared to refer to Stormy Daniels and Michael Cohen as \"sleaze bags\" on his Truth Social media platform.\n\nThe judge scheduled a hearing on the gag order issue for April 23 – a signal he may entertain the prosecution's request.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nProtests fizzle out on second day of Trump’s trial\n\nAs reporters slowly trickled inside the Manhattan Criminal Court Tuesday morning, the park across from the courthouse was mostly empty aside from a handful of people sitting on benches. Near the court, a man held up a pro-Trump flag. Another man, wearing a black balaclava, held a sign “Israel vs. TikTok.”\n\n-Eduardo Cuevas\n\nWas Trump sleeping at the New York trial?\n\nTrump glared at New York Times reporter Maggie Haberman for several seconds when he walked out of the Manhattan courtroom during a short break Monday afternoon. Haberman reported earlier in the day that the presumptive Republican presidential frontrunner appeared to be sleeping in the courtroom: she saw his head drop down multiple times and his mouth go slack.\n\n– Aysha Bagchi\n\nTrump and supporters complain about possibly missing his son’s graduation ceremony\n\nDonald Trump is continuing to campaign for the White House during his criminal trial in New York, but he and his allies are complaining about how the case could hinder his other priorities, such as attending Supreme Court arguments or his son’s graduation ceremony.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan acknowledged attending arguments April 25 over whether the former president is immune from federal prosecution is important, but not as much as the trial on charges he falsified business records to hide hush money payments.\n\n“This shows such great disdain and disrespect for our Nation’s Highest Court, especially for a topic so important as Presidential Immunity, without which our Country would never be the same!” Trump wrote Monday on Truth Social.Trump also asked to not appear at the trial May 17, so he could attend his son Barron’s high school graduation. Merchan said he’d think about it.\n\nTrump called Merchan a “highly biased Judge” and the case a “Witch Hunt.” Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s former campaign lawyer and a co-defendant in his election racketeering case in Georgia, also blasted the decision as if it was already made. “Heartless and cruel,” Giuliani wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “These people have no heart or soul.”−Bart Jansen", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/04/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2024/01/09/appeals-court-trump-criminal-charges-immunity/72151527007/", "title": "As Trump criminal charges go to trial, court faces 'unique position'", "text": "Trump's lawyers contend he is immune from prosecution because he was president when he was accused of interfering in the 2020 election results.\n\nWASHINGTON – Donald Trump as president could have ordered the military to kill his political rivals, sold military secrets to foreign adversaries or peddled pardons to criminals and still would be immune from prosecution for those crimes today unless he were first impeached and then convicted in a Senate trial, his lawyer told a federal appeals court Tuesday.\n\n“You’re saying a president could sell pardons, could sell military secrets, could order SEAL Team 6 to assassinate a political rival,” Judge Florence Pan told Trump lawyer John Sauer during arguments at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals over whether he is immune prosecution.\n\nSauer told the three-judge panel a president would be swiftly impeached and convicted for ordering the murder of a rival. But he argued that without an impeachment, the Supreme Court has held that a president’s official acts are never reviewable by the courts.\n\n“He would have to be and would speedily be impeached and convicted before the criminal prosecution,” Sauer said. “There is a political process that would have to occur under our Constitution.”\n\n“If there’s no impeachment ever, and no conviction, then the official acts are immune. Period,” Sauer added later.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTrump, who attended the hearing, contends he is immune to federal charges of conspiring to interfere in the 2020 election because his actions took place while he was president. He was impeached in the House of Representatives and acquitted in the Senate for similar allegations that he incited the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nA prosecutor, assistant special counsel James Pearce, voiced concern for the country’s future if presidents could kill rivals or sell national secrets and suffer no consequences without an impeachment and conviction.\n\n“I think that is an extraordinarily frightening future,” Pearce said. “I think if we are talking about balancing interests that should weigh extraordinarily heavily in the court’s consideration.”\n\nThe case marks the first chance for federal courts to gauge a former president's criminal immunity because Trump is the first to be charged. Each side claims the Constitution and historical precedent are on their side.\n\nThe case could eventually reach the Supreme Court, where Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith last month asked for a ruling. But the high court said the appeals court should weigh in first.\n\nIn the meantime, the appeal puts a hold on Trump’s election interference trial tentatively scheduled for March 4. Trump has sought to push this and three other criminal trials he faces until after the November election, as he campaigns again for the White House.\n\nHere is what we know about the case:\n\nProsecuting Trump could open 'Pandora's box': Trump lawyer\n\nRequiring the House to impeach and the Senate to convict a president before criminal charges can be pressed appeared to concern the judges hearing the case. The judges said there could be many reasons why Congress might not impeach a president.\n\n“Not everybody has to go through that process,” Judge Michelle Childs said.\n\n“It seems to me that there are a lot of things that might not go through that process because it’s quite a cumbersome process,” Pan said.\n\nBut Sauer said the impeachment process is what shields presidents from having political rivals and prosecutors second-guess their policy decisions. He argued the case against Trump should be dismissed.\n\n“The current incumbent of the presidency is prosecuting his No. 1 political opponent and his greatest electoral threat,” Sauer said, referring to President Joe Biden.\n\nSauer argued that without such protection, George W. Bush could have been prosecuted from spreading false information to justify the invasion of Iraq or Barack Obama for authorizing drone strikes that killed civilians.\n\n“To authorize the prosecution of a president for his official acts would open a Pandora’s box from which this nation may never recover,” Sauer said.\n\nDistinguishing between public, private acts\n\nJudge Childs noted that former President Richard Nixon was pardoned without being impeached, signaling that he could have been prosecuted.\n\nBut Sauder argued Nixon's alleged wrongdoing involved private conduct rather than official acts, just as Bill Clinton was accused of private rather than public wrongdoing.\n\nJudge Karen Henderson asked prosecutors how the judges could fashion a decision to avoid opening the floodgates to charges against future presidents.\n\nPearce argued that prosecutors, grand juries and trial juries already prevent unwarranted charges, as illustrated by Trump being the first former president to face criminal charges.\n\nInvestigators in the Iran-Contra scandal assumed Ronald Reagan was subject to prosecution but couldn't find enough evidence to pursue a case, Pearce said.\n\nPearce disputed that Nixon was accused of private acts because he accused of wielding the CIA to interfere with an FBI investigation. Pearce argued that shielding presidents from criminal liability would provide no accountability.\n\n“I want to push back on this idea of floodgates,\" Pearce said.\n\nTrump called hearing 'a very good day'\n\nThe hearing wasn't the first time Trump has chosen to attend one of his post-presidency court proceedings. He has also showed up several times for his New York civil fraud trial, in which state Attorney General Letitia James is seeking hundreds of millions of dollars from him and his business. Closing arguments in that case are scheduled Thursday.\n\nTrump said he thought the appeals hearing went well. He argued that presidents must be shielded from prosecution and that he did nothing wrong.\n\n\"We think we had a very good day today,” Trump told reporters at the Waldorf Astoria hotel in D.C. after the hearing. \"A president has to have immunity – and the other thing is I did nothing wrong, we did nothing wrong.\"\n\nWhat are the charges Trump is seeking immunity from?\n\nTrump has pleaded not guilty to four federal charges − three for conspiracy and one for obstruction − for falsely claiming election fraud and trying to overturn the legitimate election results.\n\nProsecutors contend the conspiracies culminated with the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021. The riot temporarily prevented Congress from certifying Biden's victory, forced lawmakers and then-Vice President Mike Pence to flee and injured more than 140 police officers.\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected Trump's request to have the case dismissed. \"Defendant’s four-year service as Commander in Chief did not bestow on him the divine right of kings to evade the criminal accountability that governs his fellow citizens,\" Chutkan said in her Dec. 1 ruling.\n\nTrump argued his actions responding to potential election fraud \"unquestionably\" fell within his official duties. He appealed her decision.\n\nWho is hearing the case?\n\nThe case was heard by a three-judge panel. Henderson was appointed by George H.W. Bush. Childs and Pan were each appointed by Biden.\n\nHowever the panel decides, the losing side could appeal the ruling to the full D.C. Circuit, which has 11 current judges.\n\nDepending on the full appeals court’s ruling, the losing side could ask the Supreme Court to hear the case.\n\nWhat is Trump's argument?\n\nTrump's lawyers argued that the Constitution and founders of the government thought the president should be shielded from criminal prosecution to protect the office from political antagonists.\n\n\"No prosecutor, judge, or jury may sit in judgment over the President’s official acts,\" Sauer wrote in his filing. \"A President’s official acts 'can never be examinable by the courts,'\" he wrote, quoting one of the earliest Supreme Court decisions.\n\nSauer also cited more recent Supreme Court decision called Nixon v. Fitzgerald in 1982. The court ruled 5-4 that presidents have absolute immunity from civil lawsuits for acts in office.\n\n“The President’s ‘unique position in the constitutional scheme’” guarantees him immunity, Sauer wrote.\n\nThe Senate’s acquittal of Trump at an impeachment trial charging him with citing the insurrection at the Capitol prevented him from being tried again for the same events, Sauer argued. The Senate voted 57-43 to convict Trump, but a two-thirds majority was required for conviction.\n\n\"The likelihood of mushrooming politically motivated prosecutions, and future cycles of recrimination, are far more menacing and crippling to the Presidency than the threat of civil liability,” Sauer wrote.\n\nFederal courts haven't ruled on charging a former president\n\nFederal courts haven’t ruled specifically on charging a former president because it’s never come up before.\n\nDespite Sauer’s argument, the Fitzgerald case dealt with civil litigation rather than criminal charges, so its implications for Trump are disputed.\n\n“The immunity is limited to civil damages claims,\" the late Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote in a concurring opinion in the Fitzgerald case.\n\nAlthough no previous presidents were charged criminally, Gerald Ford gave a deposition in a criminal trial, Bill Clinton gave videotaped testimony in two criminal cases, Ulysses Grant gave a deposition in a criminal case and Jimmy Carter gave videotaped testimony for use at a criminal trial.\n\n“It is settled law that the separation of powers doctrine does not bar every exercise of jurisdiction over the President of the United States,” the court said in the Fitzgerald case.\n\nThe Justice Department issued a memo in September 1973, amid the Watergate investigation, and reinforced it in October 2000 that indicting a sitting president would impermissibly undermine the chief executive. But the department found no prohibition against charges in the Constitution.\n\n“The spectacle of an indicted President still trying to serve as Chief Executive boggles the imagination,” the memo said.\n\nBut the memos didn’t deal with a former president and the Justice Department has now charged Trump in two pending cases.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled in a 1974 case, U.S. v. Nixon, that presidents aren't entirely immune from criminal prosecution.\n\n“Neither the doctrine of separation of powers nor the generalized need for confidentiality of high-level communications, without more, can sustain an absolute, unqualified Presidential privilege of immunity from judicial process under all circumstances,” the high court said.\n\nWhat are prosecutors arguing?\n\nSmith's team argued that historical precedent, the principles of the separation of powers between branches of government and the Constitution all make clear that a former president can be charged criminally.\n\nSmith’s team argued that Trump’s claim of immunity would prevent prosecution of a president who accepts a bribe in exchange for directing a lucrative government contract, a president who instructs the FBI to plant evidence on a political enemy, a president who orders the National Guard to murder his critics or a president who sells nuclear secrets to an adversary.\n\n“Under the defendant’s framework, the Nation would have no recourse to deter a President from inciting his supporters during a State of the Union address to kill opposing lawmakers – thereby hamstringing any impeachment proceeding – to ensure that he remains in office unlawfully,” assistant special counsel James Pearce wrote.\n\nOutside groups raise more questions for judges to consider\n\nThe judges notified the Trump and Smith legal team to prepare for questions that outside groups submitted in the case.\n\nOne group is a collection of former federal officials who served in Republican administrations. The officials include former Deputy Attorney General Donald Ayer; former U.S. ambassador John Danforth, who was also a senator from Missouri; former Solicitor General Charles Fried; former acting Attorney General Peter Keisler; and Michael Luttig, a former counselor to the attorney general and retired appeals court judge.\n\nThe Republicans urged the appeals court to reject Trump's claim, arguing that presidential immunity shouldn’t embolden presidents who lose reelection to engage in criminal conduct. The former officials noted Trump is accused of enlisting Justice Department personnel to make false statements to state officials to overturn election results.\n\n“If that conduct qualified for absolute immunity, this would improperly unleash a future President to disregard current criminal statutes and deploy the military in efforts to alter the results of a presidential election,” lawyer Richard Bernstein wrote for the former Republican officials.\n\nAnother group participating in the case is the advocacy group American Oversight, which argued the appeals court has no jurisdiction to hear the immunity case.\n\nAmerican Oversight argued that the Supreme Court has identified only two reasons to allow an appeal to delay a trial: disputes about double jeopardy or the Constitution’s speech or debate clause. Appeals courts have long dismissed similar appeals asserting claims of immunity, the group argued.\n\n“This Court should dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction,” lawyer Stanton Jones wrote for American Oversight.\n\nTrump's lawyer contends the group is wrong by arguing that issues of executive privilege are immediately appealable.\n\n\"This is incorrect,\" Sauer wrote of American Oversight's argument.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/12/26/donald-trump-criminal-trials-timeline/71969783007/", "title": "Trump trials: Why former president faces 'extraordinary' challenges", "text": "Trump's federal trials tentatively scheduled March 4 and May 20 could each be delayed as prosecutors and defense lawyers argue issues all the way to the Supreme Court.\n\nGeorgia prosecutor Fani Willis proposed an Aug. 5 trial that would overlap with the election, which Trump lawyer Steve Sadow called potentially the 'most effective election interference' in history.\n\nProsecutors are striving to get verdicts before the election. Trump's lawyers contend if he wins the election, he can't be tried in either state or federal courts while in office.\n\nWASHINGTON — The traffic jam of four criminal trials pending against Donald Trump has left prosecutors and judges struggling to get any of them moving while avoiding collisions.\n\nThe result leaves open the question of which – if any – will begin before the November election. Prosecutors are eager to get verdicts before Election Day, but legal experts say the first trial might not start until summer, as issues are debated and appealed.\n\nThe first trial, on federal charges the former president tried to overturn the 2020 election, is tentatively scheduled for March 4 in Washington. But preparations are on hold while Trump argues that he is immune to the charges at the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals − and potentially at the Supreme Court.\n\nAnother appeal before the Supreme Court – with potentially no answer for months – could upend two of the four charges against Trump, as well as those against hundreds of defendants in the Capitol attack on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nNext up is a trial set for May 20 on federal charges Trump retained national defense records after leaving the White House. But legal disputes about how to handle classified records in the case could postpone it.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nIf either case slips too far, Justice Department policy is to not try politically sensitive cases within months of an election. But state prosecutors in Georgia and New York don’t face that restriction.\n\nSteering a wide berth around the federal cases, Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis proposed to start her election racketeering trial against Trump and 14 co-defendants on Aug. 5, which could overlap with the election. Trump lawyer Steven Sadow called the schedule potentially the \"most effective election interference in the history of the United States.\"\n\nIdling in the wings, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg has also waited on the federal cases for his trial on charges that Trump falsified business records.\n\nTrump has argued that each case represents Democratic political interference against his Republican campaign to return to the White House, so all should be postponed until after the election. If he wins, Sadow contends the Constitution would prevent any state or federal trial while Trump serves as president.\n\n“The preference would be that he’s not on trial while he’s campaigning,\" Sadow told Fulton County Superior Judge Scott McAfee earlier this month. But McAfee has not yet set a date.\n\nHere is what we know about the four trials and their potential delays:\n\nWhat could delay Trump's federal election interference case?\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected Trump’s request to dismiss the federal election interference case, when he argued he is immune to the charges for actions he took as president. But she put the case on hold while he appeals.\n\nRather than wait for the circuit court, Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith asked the Supreme Court to decide the case quickly. But the high court sent it to the circuit court, which could spend weeks or months weighing the case first at a three-judge panel and potentially before the full appeals court.\n\n\"The United States recognizes that this is an extraordinary request,” Smith wrote. “This is an extraordinary case.\"\n\nLegal experts said the eventual Supreme Court decision could take time for such a historic decision.\n\n“The fact that Jack Smith wants to go to trial by March 4, I don’t think they’re going to cause them to act precipitously,” Clark Cunningham, a law professor at Georgia State University, told USA TODAY. “Then they have to come up with a majority that’s going to be for the history books.”\n\nWhat other Supreme Court case could delay Trump's trial?\n\nThe Supreme Court could face another urgent case dealing with Trump over the holidays. The Colorado Supreme Court decided Tuesday to disqualify Trump from the state’s 2024 ballot for his role in the Jan. 6 insurrection, which his aides said they would quickly appeal.\n\nColorado’s secretary of state must certify the primary ballot by Jan. 5, which legal experts said might cause justices to cancel their holiday plans.\n\n“This likely takes priority over Jack Smith’s request for quick SCOTUS review of immunity question,” Barb McQuade, a former U.S. attorney and now law professor at the University of Michigan, said on social media.\n\nIn another case the Supreme Court agreed to hear Dec. 13, the justices will decide whether to overturn two of the charges pending against Trump. The ruling might not come until the end of June.\n\nThe case was filed by Joseph Fischer, who was one of more than 200 people charged in the Jan. 6 riot with “corruptly” obstructing an official proceeding.\n\nAn 'anti-shredding' law for walking through the Capitol for a few minutes?\n\nFischer described the statute as an “anti-shredding” law that shouldn't apply to his walking through the Capitol for a few minutes. Congress approved the legislation in 2002 after Enron’s financial meltdown, and Fischer argued it was intended to punish people for tampering with evidence rather than participating in a riot.\n\nBut the Justice Department argued the official proceeding he obstructed was Jan. 6, when Congress was interrupted while counting Electoral College votes. The law could cover someone lying to a grand jury or “burning a building to conceal the bodies” of murder victims, prosecutors wrote.\n\nCircuit courts have upheld the statute through several challenges, but the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case for potentially a different outcome. Two of Trump’s charges are based on the same statute.\n\nClassified documents case could be delayed: legal experts\n\nTrump's Florida trial features 40 federal charges associated with storing hundreds of national defense records at his Mar-a-Lago club after leaving the White House in 2021. The challenges in the case include how to allow lawyers for Trump and his two co-defendants to deal with classified documents to prepare their defenses.\n\nAt a November hearing, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon pushed back several deadlines in the case and stuck to her May 20 trial date. But she said she would reconsider the schedule at a March hearing about classified documents.\n\n“I think the classified documents issues will in fact prove to be more difficult than the judge in Florida has anticipated, and it will in fact get pushed back,” Stephen Saltzburg, a law professor at George Washington University, told USA TODAY.\n\nMcQuade, the former U.S. attorney, agreed that dealing with disputes over the Classified Information Procedures Act in March could postpone the trial.\n\n“That trial could get pushed until after the election interference case later in the summer,” she told USA TODAY.\n\nFederal prosecutors expected to keep election interference case ahead of documents case\n\nIf both federal trials are delayed, legal experts expect prosecutors to aim for keeping the Jan. 6 trial first.\n\nLegal experts say the documents case may be easier to prove than election interference because the documents shouldn’t have been outside a secure government facility and the FBI seized the documents at Mar-a-Lago. But former Vice President Mike Pence and President Joe Biden also mishandled classified documents and have not been charged.\n\n“In any other environment, the classified documents would be a slam dunk for the prosecutors,” Saltzburg said. “As bad as what happened in Mar-a-Lago was, I don’t think the public will respond to that in the same way they are likely to respond to a conviction for trying to steal the presidency.”\n\nIf the election interference trial is delayed a few months, it could basically take the place of the documents trial and coincide with a Supreme Court decision in the Fischer case resolving which charges are valid against Trump.\n\n“A June trial date seems about right,” McQuade said of the election interference case.\n\nJustice Department policy discourages politically sensitive trials months before election\n\nThe challenge with federal cases slipping into August is that the Justice Department has an informal policy − not a formal regulation or law − against trying politically sensitive cases within two to three months of an election.\n\nThe risk that an investigation could influence an election was illustrated in 2016. Then-FBI Director James Comey announced days before the election that he was reopening an investigation into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton’s emails. She then lost to Trump.\n\nMichael Horowitz, the Justice Department’s inspector general, reported on the tradition of an “unwritten 60-day rule” for delaying overt investigative steps close to an election. But he found the practice was \"not written or described in any Department policy or regulation.\"\n\nFormer Attorney General Loretta Lynch told Horowitz’s team the general practice was not to take actions that might have an impact on an election, even if it wasn't an election case. Matt Axelrod, a former principal associate deputy attorney general, said there wasn’t a 60- or 90-day rule, but “the closer you get to the election, the more fraught it is.”\n\nCould Georgia or New York prosecutors leapfrog the federal cases?\n\nIn contrast to the federal policy, state prosecutors face no similar restrictions on the timing of their trials. Trump faces 13 charges in Georgia alleging he conspired to overturn the 2020 election and 34 charges in New York alleging he falsified business records to pay hush money to women who claimed to have had sex with him.\n\nSo far, the local prosecutors have waited for federal prosecutors to try their cases. But legal experts speculated that Willis or Bragg could start their trials in February or March if the federal cases are postponed.\n\nNeither prosecutor has actually proposed setting their case that early.\n\nBut Cunningham suggested Willis could hold a trial in February against Trump and a few co-defendants, such as campaign lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman, to resolve the case before the election. Giuliani spread baseless accusations of election fraud and Eastman developed a strategy for Republicans to field alternate presidential electors for Congress to count in states President Joe Biden won.\n\nBuddy Parker, one of Eastman’s lawyers, asked to separate his case from others to avoid having it delayed into 2025.\n\n“There are a number of defendants as noted who are not running for president of the United States,” Parker told McAfee during a Dec. 1 hearing. “We would like possibly to be earlier if we could be accommodated.\"\n\nWillis has said she was prepared for trial in October, when co-defendants Sidney Powell and Kenneth Chesebro pleaded guilty before their scheduled trial.\n\nMcAfee said he was inclined to divide the 15 remaining defendants and hold at least two trials to avoid straining the judicial system. The prosecutors could choose the order, if that happens, he said.\n\n“If you’re judge McAfee, certainly you would like for this trial to be over as early as possible in the election season,” Cunningham said.\n\nNew York, where Trump was first indicted, is another option. Bragg was initially given a trial date in March. His case has been on hold amid the legal jockeying, but would be another option for an early trial if the federal cases are postponed.\n\n“That trial seems to be under the radar at the moment, but might be ready to go first,” McQuade said. “The Georgia case seems unlikely to start until fall, and then, the judge may find it too close to the election to begin.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/26"}]}

The truck plant has about 8,200, and those relocated to the truck plant are considered new positions.\n\nUAW Vice President Rory Gamble said in a statement Wednesday that the labor union is working with members on the shift reduction and placement of members, who are protected by a collectively bargained contract.\n\n“The UAW will be working with our members to ensure they have a continuous work and help minimize, as much as possible, any hardship on members and their families,” he said.\n\nThe UAW will begin negotiations with car companies in 2019 to craft a new contract.\n\nFord previously announced it intends to exit the passenger car market, except for its popular Mustang, to concentrate on SUVs and trucks. Analysts offered a fairly upbeat view of Ford's moves after GM's announcement earlier this week shocked the industry.\n\nIvan Drury, senior analyst for Edmunds, said in response to the news: \"Ford's gamble on trucks is paying off, which should put both investors and employees at ease.\"\n\nSee also:Ford Motor contract leads Kentucky company to expand in Southern Indiana\n\nMarick Masters, a business professor at Wayne State University, said President Donald Trump, who is angry at GM, is sure to praise Ford for its “no layoffs” announcement.\n\n“When people see GM make an announcement about cutting jobs, they think, ‘When is the shoe going to drop?’ If you’re going to make an announcement about moving product, you should make certain it’s coupled with an announcement that no layoffs will take place,” Masters said.\n\n“What Ford is trying to convey to the employees, and to the market, is that they are shifting their focus to the more profitable end of the market. And fortunately, especially at this time of the year, this announcement comes with no layoffs. It gives employees an opportunity to adjust to the transition that the company plans to make.”\n\nFord said to meet demand for full-size SUVs and trucks, it's rebalancing production at some U.S. plants, \"further increasing our efficiency while retaining jobs for all full-time hourly employees.\"\n\nIt noted that Expedition retail sales are up 36 percent from a year ago, while Lincoln Navigator sales are up more than 80 percent from this time last year.\n\nFord built 8,872 fewer Escape compact SUVs at Louisville Assembly in September compared with the same month a year ago, a 28 percent cut in response to slowing consumer demand for its once hot-selling models.\n\nThe company also dialed back production of its higher-priced Lincoln MKC at the assembly plant, which is on Fern Valley Road near Interstate 65. It trimmed MKC production by nearly 18 percent year over year in September and by more than 34 percent through the first nine months of the year. In October, Ford actually increased production over the prior October by nearly 500 Escapes and MKCs.\n\nRead more:Here's why Ford isn't making as many vehicles in Louisville\n\nFord spokeswoman Kelli Felker said in early October that there were no job cuts planned at Louisville Assembly. The company is getting ready to post openings for the jobs at the truck plant in Louisville and in Livonia, Michigan, where workers are also expected to move from another assembly plant in nearby Flat Rock. Ford wants to give workers an opportunity to get the paperwork completed, Felker said.\n\nThe Expedition model has seen a 36 percent jump in sales, or 44,144 more vehicles from a year ago, while the Lincoln Navigator has seen an 80 percent increase in sales or 14,200 vehicles from a year ago.\n\nThe F-Series trucks are up 2 percent, or 749,456 pickups — outselling the nearest competitor, the Chevy Silverado, by 280,000 vehicles through October 2018. The shift changes and reallocation of workers will allow Ford to increase production of the Expedition and Navigator when demand is still increasing for both models, Felker said.\n\nGrace Schneider: 502-582-4082; gschneider@courierjournal.com; Twitter: @gesinfk.

Their elimination could result in a hit of $7 billion to $9 billion to GM's yearly revenue, analysts and economists said.\n\nIt could also lead to a full percentage point loss in GM's current 17.1 percent U.S. market share, said one economist. That loss could take the automaker years to recapture, if it ever could, considering that GM’s market share has been eroding for decades.\n\nThe end result is more jobs will have to be eliminated at GM and its engine plants, said Jon Gabrielsen, an economist who consults with automakers and auto suppliers. He said the engine plants most likely to be impacted are in Flint, Romulus and one in New York, as well as two engine component plants, one in Bay City and one in Ohio.\n\n\"There are almost guaranteed to be job losses at the plants that make or made the engines for the terminated vehicle models,\" said Gabrielsen.\n\nThat's because even if GM shifts sales volume from cars to SUVs and pickups, those vehicles' engines likely would be built at different plants, he said.\n\nBeyond 14,000 salaried and production job cuts already announced, GM will need to trim more costs to compensate for the revenue lost from the cars going away, Gabrielsen said. That's especially true, he said, if the company loses sales volume from sedan buyers migrating to other carmakers or buying used vehicles.\n\nThe company has said it intends to trim costs by $6 billion by the end of 2020.\n\n\"Now that GM is lowering its sales and profits potential further through the elimination of these models and plants, I am raising my estimate of total metro Detroit GM salaried jobs losses to at least 10,000 over the next two years,\" said Gabrielsen. \"That is probably understated.\"\n\nThat's 2,000 more than the 8,000 white-collar job cuts than GM has said it will eliminate in North America this year. Gabrielsen accurately predicted that GM would cut about 7,000 salaried jobs, mostly in metro Detroit, ahead of GM's Nov. 26 announcement.\n\nMore:General Motors wanted at least 7K workers to take a buyout; layoffs loom\n\nMore:Why these 4 GM plants should be worried about closure risk\n\nGetting ahead of the news\n\nGM says it will replace any lost market share with increased sales of the redesigned 2019 Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups, the new 2019 Chevy Blazer SUV launching now and several new Cadillac SUVs to go on sale through 2021.\n\n“Our strategy is profitable growth, and our aggressive new product launches, all centered in the key growth segments of crossovers, SUVs and trucks, will help us achieve that goal,\" GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said in an email to the Free Press. \"The new product launches will help offset any market share losses from our decision end production of certain passenger cars.”\n\nTo temper the troubling news of job cuts, GM is taking the unusual step of hosting its Capital Markets Day for investors on Friday in New York, ahead of the Detroit auto show. Morgan Stanley equity analyst Adam Jonas said in an investor note that GM likely wants to get out ahead of the bad news swirling around it.\n\n\"Our 2019 estimates are roughly 30 percent below (earnings) consensus, as we expect significant declines in international profit and margin erosion in North America,\" Jonas wrote in his note.\n\nGM continues to face harsh backlash following its announcement Nov. 26 that it would idle Detroit-Hamtramck, Lordstown Assembly in Ohio and Oshawa Assembly in Ontario by the end of 2019. It said it would also close a transmission plant in Warren and one near Baltimore.\n\nGM will eliminate the vehicles — all sedans — built at these plants: Cadillac CT6 and XTS, Chevrolet Cruze, Volt and Impala, and Buick LaCrosse.\n\nMore:General Motors to close Detroit, Ohio, Canada plants\n\nMore:CEO Mary Barra tells members of Congress: GM must move forward\n\nMore:Chevy Volt was going to save Detroit. Now its workers are losing jobs\n\nGM will likely reiterate Friday that the steps are necessary to withstand \"market volatility and to make necessary investments in future technologies, partnerships and business models,\" said Jonas.\n\nGM faces continued push-back against the cuts in Canada and the United States, with Michigan and Ohio lawmakers criticizing the moves and citing government investment of $11 billion to save GM after its 2010 bankruptcy.\n\nIn Canada, GM's plans to shutter the Oshawa plant threaten to reduce Ontario's gross domestic product by $5 billion with a decline of $330 million to Ontario's government revenues in 2020, according to an independent study commissioned by Canada's autoworker union Unifor. The study projects that job losses will mount over time to reach 14,000 in Ontario and 10,000 elsewhere across Canada by 2025.\n\nIn the United States, GM said with its increased production of SUVs and pickups, as well as added production of the Chevrolet Bolt electric vehicle, it will be giving more than 2,000 current UAW workers the chance to relocate to other plants.\n\n\"For the hourly employees at the four unallocated U.S. plants, we have opportunities at other GM plants where we are launching these products in the growth segments,\" said Morrissey. Those include plants in Flint; Spring Hill, Tennessee; and Arlington, Texas.\n\nGM name change?\n\nOne way to polish its image, Jonas said, might be a name change.\n\n\"Several investors have asked us about the potential for a name change to accompany a radical strategic shift for the company,\" wrote Jonas. \"We have no knowledge or strong opinion on a potential name change, but do not exclude the possibility of such an action being considered by GM's leadership to help foster perception and cultural change.\"\n\nGM is not the first carmaker to lay out a business transformation.\n\nIn 2016, Fiat Chrysler announced the Dodge Dart and Chrysler 200 sedans would be discontinued as it refocused its efforts on building its popular Jeep SUVs and Ram pickups and boosted its electric vehicle lineup.\n\nEarly last year, Ford announced it would eliminate its traditional cars from the U.S. lineup except the Mustang. It loses the Fusion, Focus, Fiesta and Taurus so it can focus on SUVs and pickups.\n\nAuto dealer Bob Shuman said FCA made the right move. It gauged consumers' shifting tastes away from sedans.\n\n\"Our year-over-year sales continue to grow. We’re still selling the same or more each year in total units whatever the mix is,\" said Shuman, owner of Shuman Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram Walled Lake. Shuman's store sold 2,700 new and used cars in 2018 and, despite still selling the Chrysler 300 and Dodge Charger and Dodge Challenger cars, the hottest movers have been the Jeep Renegade and Compass SUVs.\n\n“The Jeep Renegade and Jeep Compass are smaller vehicles and are home runs,\" said Shuman. \"Those vehicles have stepped into that niche for people who want a smaller vehicle.\"\n\nEconomist Gabrielsen said FCA was in a position of strength when it embarked on the decision to trim the Chrysler 200 and Dodge Dart.\n\n\"It already had significant momentum building\" when it made the move, said Gabrielsen.\n\nOver a 10-year period, FCA has gained a half-percentage point in market share each year, almost the exact same as GM has lost each year. So GM is now employing the same strategy as FCA, but from a position of weakness, he said.\n\n\"It's cutting one leaky boat in cars for another leaky boat in crossovers and SUVs,\" said Gabrielsen. \"Over the past decade GM has lost 4 points of market share in the crossover/SUV sector ... with no indication of any end in sight.\"\n\nEven as GM prepares to introduce new model SUVs such as the Chevrolet Blazer being built now and the Cadillac XT6, all it will do is reduce the average volume for those SUVs GM already has, not gain overall share for GM, said Gabrielsen.\n\n\"GM has been adding new models for a while, and rather than gain total share it has lost the share,\" Gabrielsen said. \"Thirty years ago, there were only about a dozen SUV model; today there are over 100 all fighting for share.\"\n\nNot only was Jeep the brand best suited to pursue this strategy, he said, but FCA \"moved first and claimed that strategy.\"\n\nThe slow decline\n\nSome GM sedan buyers who will shift to GM's SUVs and pickups, analysts said.\n\n\"These vehicles going away will eventually be replaced with more light truck models, likely battery electric vehicles, but not until early 2020s,\" said David Whiston, U.S. autos equity strategist at Morningstar Research Services. \"So GM won't lose all those owners. Some say Chevy Cruze owners may want to go bigger anyway for their next vehicle, but it's hard to put a number around that.\"\n\nBuick GMC dealer Sam Slaughter said sales of the Buick LaCrosse sedan have been stalling at his store in suburban Detroit in the last 24 months.\n\n\"It was a slow decline, but suddenly nobody wanted to look at them anymore. Their neighbor got an SUV or crossover and suddenly that’s what they want,\" Slaughter said. \"The crossover is popular because nobody wants to drive their dad’s sedan.”\n\nSellers Buick GMC in Farmington sold 3,500 new and used cars last year. Slaughter is not worried that losing the sedan will mean losing customers. He said those who come in for a LaCrosse are already opting for a similarly priced an Envision or Enclave instead.\n\n“My thoughts are that people have already made the shift,\" said Slaughter. \"The fuel economy advances, the features and sizes of these SUVs and crossovers have really made the sedan obsolete. There are certainly some customers who want to buy sedans, but in our market, customers have already made that decision.”\n\nThe bottom line\n\nThat may be the case in Detroit, but nationally the numbers don't reflect that yet.\n\nFor the year, sales of the Buick Enclave rose only 2.2 percent and the Envision's sales are down 26.5 percent compared with 2017. Sales of the LaCrosse were down 23 percent.\n\nFor 2018, GM sold about 3 million vehicles in the United States. Of those, the six cars it will eliminate composed 250,743 in sales or about 8 percent of GM's total U.S. vehicle sales.\n\nAnalyst Stephen Brown said some of the higher car sales are because GM was forced to offer generous customer discounts on them to move car inventory given buyers' preferences for SUVs and pickups.\n\n\"This has pressured the margins of passenger cars, which were already thinner than those of SUVs and pickups,\" said Brown, a senior director at FitchRatings.\n\nGM has made it clear in the post recession that its focus is, \"on the bottom line, rather than the top line,\" said Brown. \"The company will forego revenue that does not carry a suitable profit margin along with it.\"\n\nPut another way, dealer Sam Slaughter said, \"GM is reacting to the market rather than arbitrarily pulling the plug on products. I see a lot of happy faces driving away in SUVs.”\n\nContact Jamie L.

And the value of GM stock grew.\n\nSoon Ford Motor Co. will announce its early retirement buyouts amid reorganization, a signal that the economic landscape goes beyond GM. No question, things were bound to deteriorate. The whole business is cyclical, after all.\n\nAnd the largest car market in the world, China, is seeing a slowdown, too.\n\nSo cutting passenger cars once seen as key to U.S. carmakers' recovery appears to make sense.\n\nYet no one needs to be frightened, economists say. America is at full employment and that’s good for the economy.\n\nBut when GM sheds about 7,000 workers in the metro Detroit area, for a total of 14,000 or so in North America, that’s significant.\n\nWhen Ford is forecast to trim 10,000 workers from its rolls in metro Detroit for a total of 20,000 or so in North America, well, those numbers start to add up.\n\nPreparing for the next dip\n\n“Car sales hit a record in 2016 and have been edging downward since,” said Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for Autotrader. “At the same time, the auto industry is on the verge of potentially massive change,\" she added. \"Auto companies are investing in future things, like autonomous vehicles, electric vehicles, mobility services like ride sharing. No one is clear on when those will turn a profit.”\n\nShe continued, “The major takeaway of the Great Recession was that automakers must keep their cost in line so that even if sales plummeted they could still break even or eke out a profit.\n\nKrebs said that coming out of the recession, automakers laid off workers and cut plant capacity. But as the good times came, the companies added people. Companies like Ford have said maybe they added too many. So now they’re preparing for the next dip, she said.\n\nFocusing exclusively on the strength of America and the U.S. dollar can be a mistake. Markets now are so interconnected that the buying power of Chinese consumers, for example, directly impacts the jobs of people in America.\n\n“The global business environment is softening,” said Ellen Hughes-Cromwick, associate director at the University of Michigan Energy Institute and senior adviser for Macro Policy Perspectives. “Consequently, here in the U.S., we’re in the 10th year of an economic expansion. We’re starting to see the cyclical part of the economy roll over. We’ve seen housing starts really languish … the best of times are now in the rearview mirror.”\n\nRain on the parade\n\nWhile recessions are notoriously difficult to forecast, ingredients do exist for an economic downturn.\n\n“Now you will start to see a lot of cutbacks, not just trimming. These are leading cyclical indicators,” Hughes-Cromwick said. “You can look out your window and say, ‘Wow, we’re going to have an incredible holiday season. Retail sales are doing great, there’s a low unemployment rate, wage growth is moving up.’ All of that is great, to be sure, but it may be misleading.”\n\nNo panic\n\n“We do see a slowdown in manufacturing and professional and business services — that includes white-collar auto, engineering, design, computer design,\" said Gabriel Ehrlich, an economic forecaster based at University of Michigan who specializes in the U.S. and Michigan economies.\n\nStill, he said, “We shouldn’t overreact. It’s not time to panic.”\n\nUnemployment claims, filed by people after they’ve been laid off, are at the lowest level since October 2000. Michigan is seeing unemployment fall below 4 percent, he noted.\n\n“Don’t get me wrong. This is worrying news,” Ehrlich said of GM's cuts. “There is never a good time to lose your job, but it is much harder on workers to lose their jobs during a recession. Right now, we’ve had nine straight years of year-over-year job growth.”\n\nKey: 2019 is a time to be “sober-minded and cautious,” he said. “We expect more of a slowdown nationally in 2020.”\n\nAt the same time, thousands of autoworkers are headed into contract negotiations in 2019 to shape their wages and benefits for the next four years. Factory workers say they made sacrifices during times of economic distress to help the car companies, and now the companies have rewarded investors instead of the employees.\n\n“This cyclical downturn could get worse before it gets better,” said Harley Shaiken, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley and a national expert on labor. “The U.S. economy is doing OK, but the rest of the world is sliding. That’s not sustainable. The cars you thought you couldn’t do without? You may be wondering instead what kind of bus pass you’re going to have.”\n\nThis latest action by GM, after workers “made pretty extraordinary contributions to the company,” is really “a punch in the gut,” Shaiken said, especially for the white-collar workers.\n\nToo often, car companies offer job training after the fact. There’s no preparation, he said.\n\nAnd with every job lost in the auto industry, an estimated five jobs in the community are affected.\n\n“GM is being, in a business sense, very proactive,” said Shaiken, whose grandfather worked at Ford. “But I think they are underestimating the pain and the reaction.”\n\nPeople are delusional\n\nThe global economy is driving good and bad developments, regardless of political party, said Jon Gabrielsen, market economist who advises automakers and auto suppliers.\n\n“Anyone who thought (President Donald) Trump could save their jobs was delusional. No person, whether Trump or not, had any more chance of reversing rapidly changing trends than to swim up Niagara Falls,” he said. “Corporations don’t enjoy doing this and their investors don’t enjoy the huge costs to do so. But it sure beats not doing it and going out of business.”\n\nWhile the national employment and unemployment levels are likely to remain favorable for hiring in the near term, once job cuts like Ford's and GM's begin, the affected areas see a pattern of unraveling that includes hiring freezes and job cuts in other industries.\n\n\"It goes from an auto supplier all the way to the clerks at Kroger,\" Gabrielsen said. \"Anywhere there's an assembly plant or an auto-related plant that's going to close, it'll wipe out the town. Anyone who loses a job will have to move to get a job.\"\n\nContact Phoebe Wall Howard: 313-222-6512 or phoward@freepress.com.

Debbie Dingell, D-Dearborn, supported his doing so if jobs are headed overseas.\n\n\"This has to be the most thoroughly disliked company in Washington, D.C., right now,\" Dingell, who worked for GM years ago, told CNN. Ford, meanwhile, announced it was ending a shift at its Flat Rock assembly plant and moving workers at other plants as the auto industry reacts to slowing sales and demand for SUVs and trucks.\n\nIn tweets Wednesday, Trump mentioned the so-called chicken tax — a 25-percent tariff placed on imported light-duty trucks in the U.S. initially created in response to other countries' taxes on imported chicken from the U.S. — as \"the reason that the small truck business in the U.S. is such a go-to favorite.\"\n\n\"If we did that with cars coming in, many more cars would be built here,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nTrump has been threatening for much of his presidency to tax imported autos and auto parts, saying it would save and create manufacturing jobs in the U.S. His administration is in the midst of a review of whether such a move could be made under national security grounds.\n\nBut many carmakers are dead-set against such a move, saying it would increase the costs of production and set in motion a trade war that could hurt their businesses. In September, other Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee criticized the proposal as well, citing estimates they could result in a $73-billion tax increase on consumers and put hundreds of thousands of jobs at risk.\n\nRead more on this:\n\nTrump's plan to tax auto imports blasted by Senate Republicans\n\nTrump threatens punishment for GM after plant closures, layoff news\n\nDemocrats say GM gets tax cuts while workers get shafted\n\nTrump argued again Wednesday, however, that tariffs may be the incentive needed for GM to keep U.S. plants open in the wake of an announcement Monday that it would shed some 14,000 jobs nationwide and close assembly plants in Michigan, Maryland and Ohio.\n\nIf tariffs were put in place, he tweeted, \"G.M. would not be closing (those) plants. Get smart Congress. Also, the countries that send us cars have taken advantage of the U.S. for decades.\"\n\nHe ended with a threat, noting that regardless of congressional action, \"The President has great power on this issue — Because of the G.M. event, it is being studied now!\"\n\nAs president, Trump could order tariffs to be increased under his present authority. But that authority — which was granted by Congress — could be challenged by votes in the U.S. House and Senate. Meanwhile, there have already been reports that Trump could look to add tariffs on autos as early as next week, following this weekend's G20 talks in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n\nTrump has sharply criticized GM following Monday's announcement, first saying he was \"not happy\" and had spoken directly to CEO Mary Barra about it and then, on Tuesday, threatening to cut subsidies, including one encouraging customers to buy electric vehicles.\n\nAccording to some reports Wednesday, the Trump administration was following up on that threat and asking agencies to review awards and subsidies to GM. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about it from the Free Press, though a source familiar with the president's thinking said the \"appropriate departments\" were working on the question.\n\nThe Energy Department and Department of Defense, which have multiple contracts and grants with the automaker, also did not immediately respond to questions on GM's government subsidies and awards.\n\nIt was also far from clear that Trump could do much to stop that benefit without having Congress change the law anyway, and U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Michigan, said such a move would be \"the exact opposite of what we should be doing right now. This is a time when we should be supporting the new jobs being created for our talented autoworkers, not doubling down on policies that will hurt them.”\n\nBut Dingell, who spoke on CNN on Wednesday morning, said she would support Trump's move if it turns out that jobs are being moved to Mexico or elsewhere.\n\nDingell — who worked for GM for 32 years before leaving in 2009 — said there is still a chance that workers could be placed in the targeted plants as a result of a new UAW contract to be negotiated. But she also said she is \"hearing on the grapevine\" that the company is \"going to move production to another country.\"\n\n\"I will make sure that GM does not locate one more plant in Mexico or they‘ll never ever get my support on anything,\" she said, speaking far more strongly about GM — or any domestic automaker — than is common for members of Michigan's delegation.\n\nTuesday afternoon, GM put out a statement saying, \"We appreciate the actions this administration has taken on behalf of industry to improve the overall competitiveness of U.S. manufacturing\" and said it remains \"committed to maintaining a strong manufacturing presence in the U.S.\"\n\nIt did not directly address the president's remarks, however. Barra said Monday the moves were being made to reposition the company at a time of downturn in auto sales overall.\n\nMeanwhile, it's also worth noting that when it comes to popular smaller trucks, not all are made solely in the U.S. now. While Ford's F-150 is the most popular vehicle and GM actually has larger market share for trucks than anyone, the most popular midsize truck is the Toyota Tacoma, which is assembled in Texas and Mexico.\n\nCompetition is heating up in the segment and production will increase. GM and Ford build their midsize trucks in the United States, and Fiat Chrysler plans a Jeep truck to be built in Toledo.\n\nContact Todd Spangler: 703-854-8947 or tspangler@freepress.com.

Combined with white-collar cuts, about 14,000 hourly and salaried jobs are affected.\n\nGM waited until Nov. 26 to tell the world its plan, though the news that GM would close its plant in Oshawa, Ontario, leaked out late Sunday, Nov. 25.\n\nSome workers expressed anger at learning about their plants closures from news reports or texts, though GM told the Free Press Wednesday that it gave the UAW a heads up Monday morning before its 10:30 a.m. public announcement.\n\n“How they kept this a secret is shocking to say the least,\" said Ivan Drury, senior manager of industry analysis at Edmunds.\n\nGiven that the automaker said it will continue to hire people for jobs related to the development of electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle technology even as it cuts other jobs, Drury warned, \"There’s definitely more to come, but it depends on where GM places its bets for the future.”\n\nExpect more job cuts and other operational shifts next year, he said. \"All those are possible until the full plan is laid out,\" said Drury.\n\nAdding to the unknown is GM's new chief financial officer, Dhivya Suryadevara, who took the role Sept. 1. Analysts said she likely played a big role as an architect to this plan.\n\nSecrets safe\n\nA document GM filed Monday with the Securities and Exchange Commission read, in part: \"On November 20, 2018, the General Motors Company Board of Directors approved a plan to accelerate the company’s transformation for the future. The plan is expected to strengthen the company’s core business, capitalize on the future of personal mobility, and drive significant cost efficiencies, and it consists, in relevant part, of restructuring the Global Product Development Group, realigning current manufacturing capacity and utilization, and reducing salaried and contract staff and capital expenditures. These actions are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2019.\"\n\nThe brief filing did not outline the exact plan. It noted that GM will report pretax charges of $3 billion-$3.8 billion related to the plan, mostly in fourth quarter and first quarter earnings. A GM spokesman confirmed the filing was referencing the plan GM announced Monday.\n\n\"Board approval is part of a process for certain decision making and once we have board approval we make sure we inform our employees first and other impacted constituents,\" said Pat Morrissey, GM spokesman.\n\nMorrissey said GM told employees, local union leadership and plant management in person the details of the plan early Monday, before calling a midmorning news conference.\n\nBut one of the plants to be shuttered, GM's Detroit-Hamtramck plant, was closed Monday for the Thanksgiving break. Some of its 1,500 workers learned their jobs are in jeopardy through media reports later. Many were shocked and angry.\n\n“You tell the world before you tell us,” line worker Dnitra Landon, pulled over in her 2017 Buick Encore before she clocked into the Hamtramck plant Tuesday morning, told the Free Press. “How come we don’t get to know before the world?”\n\nUAW's big worry\n\nThe UAW was equally surprised that GM kept the plan hushed for a full six days, but the UAW has \"long been concerned about the strategic investments without flexibility of product drive train in U.S. plants and the continuous movement of product by GM, such as the (Buick) Envision in China and product announcements in Mexico,\" UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said in an email to the Free Press.\n\nGM will close Detroit-Hamtramck, Lordstown in Ohio and Oshawa in Ontario by the end of 2019. Including 645 jobs at transmission plants in Warren and near Baltimore, more than 6,200 hourly jobs are at stake.\n\nMost UAW workers will have an opportunity to transfer to other factories, including Flint and Arlington, Texas, where in-demand trucks are produced.\n\nThe plants being idled make cars that are out of favor with consumers, including the Chevrolet Volt, Cruze and Impala, the Buick LaCrosse and Cadillac XTS.\n\nIn addition to the production cuts, GM said it will reduce its North American white-collar workforce by about 8,000. The deadline passed on Nov. 19 for a voluntary buyout for those workers. GM said 2,250 employees have asked to take the offer. That means as many as 5,750 workers could be cut if the company keeps to its announced total. The cuts are expected in mid-January.\n\nMore:General Motors to close Detroit, Ohio, Canada plants\n\nRothenberg said that the UAW discussed the affected plants with GM in the past and drew a clear \"line in the sand on U.S. plants.\"\n\n\"This was long planned through intentional strategic investment decisions and product movement over our objections,\" said Rothenberg. \"They may have kept the news about it quiet, but this was planned and had to be gradually executed long before sales numbers were known.”\n\nWho should worry\n\nIndustry experts said GM's secrecy about the cost-cutting plan is impressive, but the plan itself should not be surprising.\n\n\"One-shift plants are not financially sustainable,\" said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of Industry, Labor & Economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor.\n\nThe U.S. market is not growing and consumers prefer SUVs to sedans, Dziczek said.\n\n\"Everyone at Oshawa, Lordstown, and Detroit-Hamtramck should have been worried (as should workers at all other one-shift plants at all automakers) — even if they didn’t know the 'unallocated' announcement was coming this week,\" Dziczek said.\n\nBoth Dziczek and Edmund's Drury said GM's new CFO Suryadevara was likely instrumental in devising the plan that GM said will save $6 billion by the end of 2020\n\n“Given her tenure within the company, she likely had a good pulse on what changes needed to be made even before becoming CFO,\" said Drury. \"There’s no doubt she played a significant role in implementing these changes.”\n\nContact Jamie L.

It's the second time this year she's traveled there.\n\nThat's where GM builds the Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra 1500 pickups. Barra told its 4,500 workers that GM will invest $24 million on assembly line technology to speed up pickup production.\n\n“We are building Chevrolet and GMC crew cab pickups at record volume and mix levels to meet customer demand and the $24 million investment will allow us to build even more,” said Barra in a statement to the media. “The team here at Fort Wayne has done an outstanding job helping us satisfy customers throughout this launch.\"\n\nGM's new Executive Vice President of Global Manufacturing Gerald Johnson was with her at the plant for the news. It was his second tour of duty with Barra at a factory investment announcement since he took over the job from Alicia Boler Davis on April 1.\n\nPR roadshow\n\nBarra's visit to Fort Wayne is part of a series of plant pit stops she's made since January. But her public relations team said her appearances are not intended to mitigate the criticism from the UAW and many politicians, including President Donald Trump, over GM's decision late last year to cut some 14,000 total jobs and indefinitely idle four plants in the United States and one in Canada.\n\nWhen asked why Barra personally shows up at these investment announcements, GM spokesman Pat Morrissey said: “She feels it’s important for her to be visible to the employees and to the community to make these announcements.\"\n\nBarra visited GM plants for internal meetings and to \"mingle\" with hourly employees by walking the plant floor long before GM made its restructuring announcement, Morrissey said. Admittedly, she has made more frequent visits this year because GM has a \"significant\" number of investment announcements, he said.\n\nThis year, Barra has visited GM plants without making any investment news in Arlington, Texas, where GM builds its large SUVs, Tonawanda Engine Plant in Buffalo, New York, Fort Wayne and Flint Assembly plants, which both build pickups, Morrissey said.\n\nBut her personal appearances to announce investments are important to promote unity with UAW leaders who often take the stage with her. They applaud the investment and any added jobs, such as GM's investment announced Thursday in Fort Wayne.\n\n\"General Motors’ investment will ensure job security and continued growth in manufacturing and the economy for UAW members in Indiana, their families and their community,\" said Terry Dittes, vice-president of the UAW GM Department.\n\nBut the UAW has been fast to remind GM that the UAW will \"leave no stone unturned\" to push GM to reverse its decision to idle some plants.\n\n“There’s hardship among four of our other locations and we’ve made it clear we disagree with that,\" Dittes told Barra in March, after he first thanked GM for its $300 million investment in its Orion Assembly Plant that will create 400 jobs.\n\nMore:GM plans to make new electric car, spend $300M, hire 400 workers in Lake Orion\n\nDittes said the UAW will continue to work with GM to find a “solution for so many families who desperately need it.”\n\nLater, Dittes told reporters that the UAW is hand-tied at the moment to help the doomed factories, noting: “The UAW doesn’t allocate product and those four locations will not be forgotten by the UAW.”\n\nGM has said the ultimate fate of the plants will be determined in contract talks with the UAW this summer — bargaining that most observers expect to be contentious.\n\nFort Wayne investment\n\nThe $24 million investment in Fort Wayne is small, but significant enough to allow GM to increase the number of pickups it builds, said Morrissey. He declined to say how many more pickups will be built, but said any increase will help meet the strong consumer demand for the vehicles.\n\n“For trucks, even a few more per hour is a big deal because you’re on three shifts and running six or seven days a week and obviously truck sales are very strong,\" said Morrissey.\n\nThe $24 million investment in Fort Wayne Assembly will enhance the plant’s conveyors and other tooling to increase production, GM said. The work will be completed this summer and including Thursday's announcement, GM has invested more than $1.2 billion in the plant since 2015, it said.\n\nThis news is one of many factory-investment announcements GM has made since it said in November that it would restructure GM, cutting thousands of jobs and idling its assembly factories in Lordstown, Ohio, Detroit Hamtramck, Oshawa in Ontario, and transmission plants in Warren and near Baltimore. Those plants largely built cars, which are declining in consumer demand.\n\nSince then, GM has said it has a \"new commitment to invest a total of $1.8 billion in its United States manufacturing operations, creating 700 new jobs and supporting 28,000 jobs across six states.\"\n\nBarra's announcements\n\nBesides Thursday's visit to Fort Wayne, here are some other plants GM announced investments in this year.\n\nIn January, Barra went to Spring Hill, Tennessee, to announce a $22 million investment there to enable the engine plant to build 6.2L V8 engines with GM’s advanced Dynamic Fuel Management technology.\n\nIn February, Barra went to GM's Romulus plant to announce that GM will put $20 million into the propulsion plant to increase the plant’s capacity for future 10-speed transmission production. Romulus builds V6 engines and 10-speed transmissions used in several GM cars, trucks and crossovers.\n\nIn February, Barra went to Lansing Delta Township plant to say GM will invest $36 million there for future crossover production. The plant builds the Chevrolet Traverse and Buick Enclave SUVs.\n\nThat same month, GM President Mark Reuss said it was adding 1,000 jobs at Flint Assembly Plant as it prepares to launch the 2020 Silverado HD this summer. Barra was not at that announcement but has visited the plant this year.\n\nIn March, Barra told the 1,166 workers at Orion Assembly Plant north of Detroit that GM plans to spend $300 million to build a new electric car at the plant and add about 400 workers. The Orion factory builds the electric Chevrolet Bolt, autonomous vehicles for GM's Cruise unit, and the Chevy Sonic compact car.\n\nIn April, Barra and Johnson went to GM's plant in Bowling Green, Kentucky, to say GM will add a second shift, or about 400 hourly jobs, at the plant that builds the Chevrolet Corvette and engines.\n\nAt the Orion event, Barra defended GM, which came under harsh criticism by Trump in a tweetstorm days earlier for its decision to idle its factory in Lordstown, Ohio.\n\nMore:GM is putting $20 million in a Michigan transmission factory\n\n\"GM is absolutely committed to investing in and growing good-paying manufacturing jobs in the United States,\" Barra told the media that day in Lake Orion.\n\nContact Jamie L.

Roughly 3,700 U.S. production workers face their factories being idled, plus 2,500 in Ontario.\n\nGM also said it will help in job searches, résumé writing and other career counseling for the nearly 8,000 white-collar workers who will leave GM as it restructures its workforce.\n\nIt said it is working with Canadian GM dealers, colleges and other employers to help the 2,500 workers facing closure of the Ontario plant.\n\n“Our focus remains on providing interested employees options to transition, including job opportunities at other GM plants,\" Barra said in a statement. \"We remain committed to working with local government officials, our unions and each individual to find appropriate opportunities for them.”\n\nGM can offer the other factory jobs because of strong U.S. and Canadian economies, said Barra.\n\nGM and Barra have come under withering criticism from President Donald Trump and politicians in Ohio and Michigan, but the company has been steadfast in saying that the cuts are necessary to position the business for market changes. The plants being closed made traditional sedans that have fallen out of favor as consumers shift to SUVs, and salaried workforce skills must shift to the high-tech future of transportation.\n\nMore:GM's job cuts mean new kind of worker needed\n\nMore:How GM should navigate a confusing message to job candidates\n\nPromise criticized\n\n“Sounds like GM has turned the PR machine on full bore to try to deflect criticism from all quarters of its plant announcements,\" said Jon Gabrielsen, economist who consults with automakers and auto suppliers. \"But how long can they keep claiming that people can move around for jobs elsewhere while industry volume is also on the decline and pretty soon there will be nowhere to send them?. It is going to be musical chairs with way too few open chairs left.”\n\nLikewise, Wayne County Executive Warren Evans said the GM employee relocation announcement is a false promise.\n\n“Let’s not sugarcoat this. ‘Relocation’ is little more than a euphemism for ‘no job anymore’ for many of the workers being asked to choose between the community they love and their job,\" said Evans. \"Given the Poletown plant history, we’d expect better for Hamtramck and Detroit. We will do everything we can to help those impacted by these cuts find work in Wayne County.”\n\nThe UAW is unimpressed as well. Union leaders said the UAW's current contract already requires the company to try to relocate workers affected by production cuts, and noted that communities losing the work will still be hurt.\n\nThe UAW contract also states that GM must pay moving costs for a move of 200 miles or more, but the workers still have to pay taxes on that money, this person said.\n\nGM announced last month that its plants in Lordstown, Ohio, where it builds the Chevrolet Cruze compact car, and Detroit-Hamtramck, where it builds the Chevrolet Volt and Impala, the Cadillac CT6 and the Buick LaCrosse sedans, will be without product allocation beyond 2019.\n\nAlso, its factory in Oshawa and two transmission facilities will lose product allocation beyond next year.

Her bosses made mistake after mistake after mistake in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s as GM toppled toward Chapter 11 bankruptcy and a federal bailout in 2009.\n\nShe saw what happens when a major, bloated corporation fails to take decisive action, admit its mistakes and pivot toward the future.\n\nNo longer. Barra has distanced GM from its old ways in a bid to propel the company into the future of self-driving cars, electric vehicles and ride-sharing networks.\n\nIt hasn't all worked or been popular. Despite delivering strong profits, sales and innovation, GM's stock remains about 5 percent less than the day Barra took over as CEO in January 2014, despite rising about 6 percent on Monday to about $38.\n\nMore:GM to kill Chevrolet Volt, Cruze, Impala as Americans ditch passenger cars\n\nMore:GM poised to close plants in Michigan, Ohio, Maryland, will cut 15% of salaried workers\n\nAnd criticism was intense after Monday's announcement that the automaker would likely shutter several plants — including factories in southeast Michigan, northeast Ohio and the Baltimore area — and cut 15 percent of its salaried workforce.\n\nThe United Auto Workers union called the closures \"callous\" and vowed to fight them. And President Donald Trump expressed his displeasure and said he told Barra personally to reinvest in Ohio, in particular.\n\n\"This country has done a lot for General Motors,\" Trump said as he departed the White House for a series of campaign events in Mississippi. \"They better get back to Ohio and soon. So we have a lot of pressure on them.\"\n\nDespite the political pressure, financial analysts said GM is heading in the right direction to avoid future trouble and stay nimble. The company's bold moves have enabled it to outrun archrival Ford Motor Co., whose stock has fallen nearly 44 percent during the same period Barra has been in charge at GM.\n\nHere are 5 key ways Barra has reshaped GM:\n\nDitched money-losing operations\n\nFor years, GM clung to its money-losing European business, which failed to turn a full-year profit in the 21st Century. Her predecessors kept it alive despite perpetual difficulties.\n\nBarra sold it in 2017 to the parent company of French automaker Peugeot, preserving the bottom line and allowing GM to focus on its stronger regions.\n\nShe also authorized GM's essential exit from other areas, including India and Russia.\n\nKilled cars that weren't selling\n\nGM announced Monday that it would kill several passenger cars that simply weren't performing well. Among them: the Chevrolet Volt and Cruze — two vehicles that, before her tenure, were trumpeted as signs of GM's resurgence.\n\nBarra did not allow GM's past bets on those nameplates to sway her plans. She authorized their demise.\n\nInstead, GM is developing new SUVs, like the Chevy Blazer, and fully battery-powered vehicles.\n\nInvested in self-driving vehicles\n\nGM bought San Francisco-based self-driving car startup Cruise Automation for $1 billion in 2016, helping the company catapult past key competitors in the race to deliver autonomous vehicles.\n\nIt may prove to be one of Barra's finest moments.\n\nGM's self-driving car unit was valued at $14.6 billion earlier this year after attracting a $2.25 billion investment from Japanese investment fund SoftBank.\n\nRefused to heavily discount\n\nUnder many of her predecessors, it was common for GM to heavily discount vehicles to keep sales humming.\n\nNo more. From the beginning, Barra has placed GM's emphasis squarely on maintaining and boosting profitability. That meant the company could no longer rely on steep incentives.\n\n\"They just don’t do that anymore,\" said Autotrader analyst Michelle Krebs. \"They have shown a lot more discipline since the Great Recession.\"\n\nIt has cost the company sales volume, as its market share has contracted. But GM is solidly profitable and better poised to weather an inevitable downturn.\n\nCut thousands of jobs despite profits\n\nWith GM making good money and the North American auto industry zipping along at a healthy pace, it might seem like a strange time for GM to close several plants and cut thousands of jobs.\n\nBut that's exactly what Barra announced Monday. She's transforming GM into a more efficient company that can survive the industry's long-expected shift toward autonomous vehicles.\n\nIn the short term, however, she'll face considerable resistance. U.S. politicians on both sides of the aisle, including Trump, as well as Canadian political leaders and union officials criticized GM's plan.\n\n\"In Michigan and Ohio this is going to hurt,\" said Mike Ramsey, a transportation analyst at Gartner.\n\nIf Barra's track record is any guide, however, she won't back down now.\n\nContributing: John Fritze\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/11/27"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/12/03/gm-factory-closures-impacts-go-far-beyond-just-auto-plants/2189750002/", "title": "Detroit-Hamtramck GM plant closure would hurt not just workers", "text": "Gamil Aljohaim knows the workers at the Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly plant by the vehicles many of them drive, mostly pickups.\n\nIn the days after General Motors announced what has been interpreted as a looming shutdown at the plant and four others in North America, Aljohaim said he saw fewer of those trucks at his service station, and some of those who did come were choosing to put less gas in the tank.\n\n\"After they heard this news, they started holding on to their money,\" Aljohaim said. \"I feel bad for them.\"\n\nAljohaim, whose service station sits across a highway overpass from the sprawling plant, is also concerned about his own shop, which he said gets as much as 40 percent of its business from the more than 1,540 workers at the factory. While it's not clear in the short term whether the people who drive to and from the plant would be able to continue limiting their fuel purchases, the almost immediate reaction Aljohaim noticed demonstrates that even the threat of potential auto job losses can ripple across the economy.\n\nGM has said it plans to cut 14,000 jobs as part of a restructuring, affecting plants in Michigan, Ohio, Maryland and Ontario, along with 8,000 white-collar workers. The Detroit automaker, however, said it is still hiring for areas focused on electrification and autonomous vehicle development.\n\nWhile some experts say the specific impact in the Detroit area of these particular potential job losses could be limited in scope, the drop in business at a local service station shows how auto jobs in particular affect many other industries.\n\nMore:GM just made a big behind-the-scenes move to boost robot cars\n\nMassive multiplier effect\n\nMore than 7 million private sector jobs are supported by automakers, suppliers and dealers in the United States, and the industry is responsible for $500 billion in annual compensation to the workers it supports, according to the Center for Automotive Research (CAR).\n\n“It's estimated by various authorities that for every job there is in the automotive industry there are ripple effects that impact seven to nine jobs … so if you have an industry that is employing 1,500, you can multiply that by 7 to 9\" to see what could come from a loss of the Detroit-Hamtramck plant, said Marick Masters, a professor of business at Wayne State University.\n\nMasters said that the potential direct loss of 1,500 jobs represents a fraction of overall economic activity in the state, but it is significant for a variety of reasons.\n\n\"When you're talking about perhaps 10,000 people being adversely affected, that’s a significant number, and there are human stories behind each of those numbers,\" Masters said.\n\n\"(An) automotive assembly job has one of the highest multipliers of any job in the industry,\" affecting everything from steel to logistics to cafeteria work, said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of Industry, Labor and Economics at CAR. \"Anything that GM buys is tied to that employment as well ... and these jobs pay better than a lot of other jobs in the economy.\"\n\nThe money that workers earn also supports lots of other businesses not directly tied to the auto industry, those that provide everything from groceries to child care to boats.\n\nMore:Ford 'sweetens' deal for retirees in 2018; GM offer is less generous\n\nDown the street from Aljohaim's service station, Joseph Gojanaj stopped to chat during a break from frying omelettes and hash browns at the Legends Grill he owns.\n\n\"Our lunches will probably be a lot slower,\" Gojanaj said of the impact from a potential shutdown at the Detroit-Hamtramck plant.\n\nGojanaj predicted the restaurant would be able to survive, but he said a shutdown would still have a big effect on his business.\n\n'We built that'\n\nHe noted that he'd be sad to see the workers no longer stop by. Many of them, he said, will say, \"We built that,\" when his father drives his Cadillac CT6 to the restaurant.\n\nGlenn Stevens, executive director of MICHAuto and vice president of automotive and mobility initiatives for the Detroit Regional Chamber, said nobody wants to hear about job losses or plant closings, but he noted that there are other opportunities in the industry because there's a \"tremendous need across the (automakers) and supply chain for talent.\"\n\nHe said GM, along with the rest of the industry, has been reactive in the past, but GM is no longer being run as it was.\n\n“I really see this as a move to make sure this company is here for a long time, (which) is very important for this area,\" Stevens said, noting it's too early to tell what will ultimately happen with Detroit-Hamtramck or the other locations.\n\nMore:General Motors expected to close Ontario plant in blow to Canadian auto industry\n\nBoth Stevens and Dzizcek of CAR said that while it's never good having to deal with a plant closing or a loss of workers, GM's employees would have options as well as better protections than other types of workers in similar situations, with some having the ability to transfer to other plants.\n\nIf the worst does come to pass and GM opts to shutter Detroit-Hamtramck, Dzizcek said it might still have a future. She noted that a \"whole bevy of automakers\" in China and elsewhere would love to be in the United States, so that desire offers possibilities, too.\n\nContact Eric D.

John Kasich, in a late-day tweet, said he talked with GM leadership and was encouraging \"accelerating negotiations\" with the union to figure out a way to preserve jobs. The support encourages Green.\n\n\"I am confident that Lordstown will get a new product because we have the best workers and the best plant in the world,\" Green said. \"We’ve shown that and we’ve shown flexibility to work with the corporation.\"\n\n'Shot in the gut'\n\nLast year, UAW Local 1112 came to Detroit to renegotiate a competitive operating agreement for the plant, Green said. What they returned with was not popular among the Lordstown workforce, he said, but it kept the plant running. It called for merging two unions into one and outsourcing more work, he said.\n\nYet, on Monday, GM said it will close Detroit-Hamtramck, Lordstown and Oshawa in Ontario by the end of 2019. More than 6,200 hourly jobs are in jeopardy, including 645 jobs at transmission plants in Warren and near Baltimore.\n\nMore:GM's secret plan to shut plants, cut jobs likely signals more to come\n\nMore:General Motors to close Detroit, Ohio, Canada plants\n\nThe plants being idled make sedans, which are out of favor with consumers, including the Chevrolet Volt, Cruze and Impala, the Buick LaCrosse and Cadillac XTS.\n\n“This is very frustrating for our members. It really felt like a shot in the gut when GM told us the news,\" said Green. \"A lot of people ask me, 'What’s the feeling on the floor?' What do you think it is? Think about going into work one morning and not knowing there’s a future.\"\n\nGM said most UAW workers will have an opportunity to transfer to other factories, including Flint and Arlington, Texas, where in-demand trucks are produced. But Green said moving is not realistic for most of the 1,600 workers at Lordstown.\n\n\"I still have 700 people who’ve been laid off in the last couple of years who have not been able to relocate,\" said Green. \"GM says that because they want to reframe it. But they can’t just relocate those people.\"\n\nUAW battle ready\n\nThe current UAW contract with automakers expires in September 2019.\n\nA source close to the UAW International who spoke on the condition of anonymity said GM will target workers' benefits for concessions. The source said GM is \"ready to play hardball.\" Union leaders will fight for both Lordstown and Detroit-Hamtramck for new products, the person said, but \"at what cost?\" That means workers at those plants might face making big concessions.\n\nUAW Vice President Terry Dittes said Monday that GM's decision will not go unchallenged.\n\n\"The UAW is looking at all options available through legal, contractual and bargaining means,\" said Brian Rothenberg, UAW spokesman. \"In the coming days and weeks, those actions will become clear. As Vice President Dittes has said, during GM's darkest hours, we were there for GM. Now it is time for GM to be there for us.\"\n\nLordstown's Green said he is aware that GM's plant closures set up Lordstown to compete against Detroit-Hamtramck to win a new product.\n\n“(Corporations) have done this for decades and I don’t foresee that changing,\" Green said. \"It is what it is. But at what point do you stop giving concessions?”\n\nThe person close to the UAW International said typically an automaker considers the age of the facility, its efficiency and tooling when assigning a new vehicle to a plant. But politics matter, too, and no matter how strong union leaders might be to resist deep concessions, the person warned members to, \"Start saving your money, if we go out on strike, it’ll be a long one. If GM comes after what they say they’re coming after,” there will be a strike.\n\nRothenberg declined to comment on the possibility of a strike \"this far out\" from the start of negotiations.\n\nOfficials' backing\n\nIn addition to the production cuts, GM said it will reduce its North American white-collar workforce by about 8,000. GM said 2,250 employees have asked to take a voluntary buyout offer. That means as many as 5,750 workers could be terminated involuntarily.\n\nElected officials are trying to help plant workers. Kasich said he and GM CEO Mary Barra had a conversation Thursday morning and they agreed to \"bring both her team and JobsOhio together to explore alternatives for the future of the Lordstown Complex.\"\n\nKasich said the goal is to look at all options for use of the facility, which could include other automotive businesses or to repurpose it, such as bringing Fuyao Glass to the former GM plant in Moraine, Ohio.\n\nAlso, he said, \"We'll continue to explore opportunities for Lordstown workers at other in-state GM plants. We certainly understand GM has decisions to make in regards to the Lordstown Complex and we understand that may take some time.\"\n\nKasich said he encouraged Barra to talk to union representatives to consider \"accelerating negotiations in order to provide the clarity the workers deserve.\"\n\nDemocratic members of Congress were less understanding. U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, whose district includes Lordstown, said Thursday that GM has been crucial to the local economy, but needs to be more sensitive to the workers that will now be impacted, noting that the same day Lordstown lost its second shift, GM, announced a new car in Mexico.\n\n\"Auto rescue, how many bullets politically did we take to do that?\" Ryan told the news media on Thursday. \"We stuck our neck out because we didn’t want to lose manufacturing in this country. Years later, this same company gets a tax cut, $150 million in the last year. And the result of that is 14,000 jobs getting cut and the stock goes up 6 percent.”\n\nGreen said the local union leaders are working with community leaders, politicians and small businesses for support.\n\n\"The International has their work to do and the politicians have their work to do, but if everyone is pulling in the same direction, I do have hope we’ll get another product,\" Green said.\n\nContact Jamie L.

With difficulty. It took Lingenpolter, a young male grizzly bear, 46 attempts to safely cross the Interstate 90 highway in Montana.\n\nWearing a GPS tracker fitted by researchers, the bear was spotted approaching the highway time and time again between the fall of 2020 and spring of 2021, but always turning back. Until eventually, he got lucky, crossing the road beneath a bridge north of the town of Drummond.\n\nLingenpolter’s story is not a rare one. For animals that need space to roam, busy highways are a dangerous obstacle. If they cross they risk being hit by a vehicle, but not crossing can restrict an animal’s range, leading to populations fragmenting and declining.\n\n“(Highways) represent a real barrier for all sorts of different wildlife,” says Jodi Hilty, president and chief scientist of Y2Y, an initiative that aims to conserve prime habitat across 2,000 miles of land between Yellowstone National Park in the US and Yukon in northwestern Canada. Connectivity is vital for a species’ survival – “to sustain their genetics, find the resources they need, and help maintain healthy populations,” she adds.\n\nOne simple yet effective method to overcome these barriers is wildlife crossings – bridges or underpasses that provide safe passage for animals across a highway. Y2Y has helped to pioneer this approach across its range.\n\n“When Y2Y started in 1993, there were exactly zero wildlife crossing structures. Today, there are 117,” Hilty tells CNN.\n\nIn April, ground was broken on the 118th – the Bow Valley overpass that will cross the Trans-Canada Highway in Alberta.\n\nPressure point\n\nThis highway, which spans nearly 5,000 miles, cuts through some of the country’s most scenic landscapes, including the majestic Canadian Rockies and breathtaking Banff National Park – home to grizzly bears, wolves, elks, deer and other wildlife.\n\nAccording to Y2Y, 22,000 cars use the road each day, and this swells to more than 30,000 in the summer, when tourists pour in to witness the region’s natural beauty. But this intrusion of traffic into the wilderness has led to high numbers of wildlife-vehicle collisions.\n\nThe Trans-Canada highway cuts through the stunning scenery of Alberta. CNN\n\nIn one 25-mile stretch of highway, which has no fencing or wildlife crossings, Y2Y has recorded around 70 roadkills a year – and the true number is likely to be far higher as injured animals often move off the road and die later, says Hilty.\n\nYet in places where there are wildlife crossings and roadside fencing, roadkill has dramatically reduced. Take Banff National Park, where there are 41 underpasses and seven overpasses across a 55-mile stretch of highway. Here, wildlife-vehicle collisions have dropped by more than 80% and, for elk and deer, by more than 96%.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback How animals cross one of the world's longest roads 04:07 - Source: CNN\n\nAs well as helping animals, crossing “improve safety for people,” says Jesse Whittington, a wildlife ecologist for Parks Canada, which manages Banff National Park.\n\nWhittington has studied the effect of the crossings in and around the park for years. Camera traps capture which animals are using them, and radio collars attached to grizzlies and wolves have shown how crossings can help to enable long-range movements.\n\nFootage from a camera trap shows a bear and its cubs using an underpass in Alberta. HighwayWildling.org\n\nAnimals don’t learn where a crossing is immediately, he says, but highway fencing – with foundations built two meters underground, so that animals can’t dig under it – helps to funnel them towards it. Over time, grizzlies and wolves learn to use the crossings and they pass this knowledge on to their offspring.\n\nSince 1996, Parks Canada has documented animals using overpasses and underpasses on 187,000 occasions, according to Whittington – “a sign that these crossing structures work.”\n\nBanff National Park and the Y2Y project have set an example for others to follow, says Hilty.\n\n“I really hope that our model gets picked up continually, because I think that together we can ensure that both people and nature can thrive,” she says.\n\nThere are signs of momentum. In 2021, the US government announced its Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which will provide $350 million over five years for the construction of wildlife bridges, tunnels, fencing and other infrastructure. And in April of this year, construction began on the world’s largest wildlife crossing, which will span over 10 lanes of Highway 101 in northwest Los Angeles, linking the Simi Hills with the Santa Monica Mountains and giving wild animals like cougars more space to roam.\n\nHilty hopes the use of wildlife crossings will become standard practice across the planet. “We need to get to a point where when roads are busy, it becomes part of normal societal practice that we create safe passage for wildlife,” she says.", "authors": ["Leif Coorlim", "Written Nell Lewis", "Video Stefanie Blendis"], "publish_date": "2022/07/04"}]}

He returned eight of his 47 career regular-season interceptions for touchdowns. Barber won Super Bowl 37 with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, the team he spent his entire 16-year career with.\n\nDon Coryell\n\nAlready a member of the College Football Hall of Fame, Coryell has been eligible for the Hall for 36 years and a finalist for the last seven. He coached 14 seasons with the St. Louis Caridnals (1973-77) and the San Diego Chargers (1978-1986) and took both teams to the postseason. During his college coaching career, Joe Gibbs and John Madden were assistants on his staff.\n\nChuck Howley\n\nHowley was drafted seventh overall in the 1958 draft by the Chicago Bears out of West Virginia. He retired the next season after suffering what was thought to be a career-ending injury. But he participated in the West Virginia alumni game in 1961 and mounted a comeback that landed him in Canton. He was the MVP of Super Bowl 5, making him the first defensive player (and non-quarterback) to win those honors. He's also the only Super Bowl MVP from the losing team. Howley was All-Pro from 1966-70 and was inducted into the Dallas Cowboys Ring of Honor in 1977.\n\nJoe Klecko\n\nOnly five New York Jets players have had their jerseys retired, and Kelcko's No. 73 is one of them. He's the second player in NFL history, along with Frank Gifford, to be selected to the Pro Bowl at three different positions.\n\nDarrelle Revis\n\nAt the peak of his career, no quarterback would so much as look in the direction of Revis. Hence, the iconic nickname \"Revis Island\" he picked up in the early part of his career with the Jets. He finished his career with 29 interceptions and 139 passes broken up and was also a member of the New England Patriots' Super Bowl 49 team. Revis and Joe Thomas are the lone first-ball Hall of Famers in this year's class.\n\nKen Riley\n\nA quarterback in college at Florida A&M, he converted to cornerback for his 15 seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals (1969-1983). He led the AFC in interceptions for three seasons and is tied for fifth with Charles Woodson on the NFL's all-time interceptions list. Riley picked up the nickname \"Mr. Bengal\" and died on June 7, 2020 in his native Bartow, Florida.\n\nJoe Thomas\n\nThe 21st century version of the NFL's ironmen, Thomas played 10,363 consecutive snaps at one point in his career that ended after suffering a torn triceps on Oct. 22, 2017. Thomas retired after that season, but not before becoming the first offensive lineman to make the Pro Bowl in each of his first 10 seasons – all with the Cleveland Browns. He allowed a total of 30 sacks over his career and was a first-team All-Pro in six seasons.\n\nZach Thomas\n\nThomas made an immediate impact by winning 1996 AFC Defensive Rookie of the Year with the Miami Dolphins, where he played from 1996-2007. Thomas amassed 100 tackles in each of his first 11 seasons and was a first-team All-Pro five times. He finished his career with 20.5 sacks and played his last season in 2008 with the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nDeMarcus Ware\n\nIn his 12 NFL seasons, Ware played on only one team with a losing record. With the Dallas Cowboys (2005-13), he twice led the NFL in sacks (2008, 2010) and holds the Cowboys' career sacks record with 117. Ware won Super Bowl 50 with the Denver Broncos – he had two sacks and four quarterback hits in the game – and was named first-team All-Pro on four occasions.\n\nFollow Chris Bumbaca on Twitter @BOOMbaca.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/09"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2024/02/08/pro-football-hall-fame-2024-class-julius-peppers/72524895007/", "title": "Julius Peppers headlines Pro Football Hall of Fame's 2024 class ...", "text": "LAS VEGAS – Julius Peppers is in.

Peppers, who starred for the Carolina Panthers, Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears during a 17-year NFL career, has the rare distinction of being chosen to an All-Decade Team for two decades.\n\nHe headlines a 2024 class that includes Devin Hester, Andre Johnson, Patrick Willis and Dwight Freeney as modern-day candidates.

The former Bears star, elected on his third time as a finalist, has the most kick-return touchdowns in NFL history (19).\n\nFreeney, a former Super Bowl champion with the Indianapolis Colts, was a two-time finalist who generated 125 ½ career sacks.\n\nJohnson, the former Houston Texans dynamo, is one of only three players during the Super Bowl era to lead the NFL in receiving yards in consecutive seasons (along with Jerry Rice and Calvin Johnson). He was a three-time finalist.\n\nWillis played eight seasons as a San Francisco 49ers linebacker and earned five first-team All-Pro selections and seven Pro Bowl nods. A two-time NFL leader in tackles, he was elected on his fifth time as a finalist.\n\nGradishar, the face of the \"Orange Crush\" defense for the Denver Broncos during the 1970s, was NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1978. A seven-time Pro Bowl linebacker, he never missed a game during his 10-year career.\n\nMcMichael is the fourth member of the '80's-era Bears defense chosen to the Hall, following Mike Singletary, Richard Dent and Dan Hampton. Although he earned just two Pro Bowl selections in 15 seasons, his 95 sacks rank fourth all-time for defensive tackles.\n\nNFL DRAFT HUB: Latest NFL Draft mock drafts, news, live picks, grades and analysis.\n\nGates, however, was a notable omission as the only other first-ballot finalist besides Peppers. The former San Diego Chargers star, who blossomed after transitioning from a college basketball career, caught more touchdowns (116) than any tight end in NFL history.\n\nOther finalists bypassed included seniors candidate Art Powell, who starred at receiver in the AFL for the New York Titans and Oakland Raiders; and Buddy Parker, who coached the Detroit Lions to consecutive NFL titles during the 1950s.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/08"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/12/31/nfl-week-18-schedule-game-times-revealed-saturday-sunday/72073373007/", "title": "NFL Week 18 schedule: Game times revealed for Saturday, Sunday", "text": "The final puzzle pieces for the 2023 NFL regular-season schedule are now in place, with plenty of playoff scenarios still to be determined.\n\nOn Sunday night, the league revealed times for the Week 18 NFL schedule, which will feature 16 games – all divisional matchups – taking place next weekend.\n\nThe slate will kick off with two games on Saturday: the Pittsburgh Steelers facing the top-seeded Baltimore Ravens in the afternoon, followed by the Houston Texans taking on the Indianapolis Colts in what amounts to a win-and-in scenario\n\nThen, the action will wrap up with 14 contests on Sunday, with the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins clashing on \"Sunday Night Football\" in a winner-take-all battle for the AFC East division crown and No. 2 seed in the conference.\n\nHere's a full look at the full program for Week 18:\n\nNFL DRAFT HUB: Latest NFL Draft mock drafts, news, live picks, grades and analysis.\n\nNFL Week 18 game times, TV info\n\nSaturday, Jan. 6, 2024\n\nPittsburgh Steelers at Baltimore Ravens, 4:30 p.m. ET, ESPN/ABC\n\nHouston Texans at Indianapolis Colts, 8:15 p.m. ET, ESPN/ABC\n\nSunday, Jan. 7, 2024\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers at Carolina Panthers, 1:00 p.m. ET, FOX\n\nCleveland Browns at Cincinnati Bengals, 1:00 p.m. ET, CBS\n\nMinnesota Vikings at Detroit Lions, 1:00 p.m. ET, FOX\n\nNew York Jets at New England Patriots, 1:00 p.m. ET, FOX\n\nAtlanta Falcons at New Orleans Saints, 1:00 p.m. ET, CBS\n\nJacksonville Jaguars at Tennessee Titans, 1:00 p.m. ET, CBS\n\nSeattle Seahawks at Arizona Cardinals, 4:25 p.m. ET, FOX\n\nChicago Bears at Green Bay Packers, 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS\n\nDenver Broncos at Las Vegas Raiders, 4:25 p.m. ET, FOX\n\nKansas City Chiefs at Los Angeles Chargers, 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles at New York Giants, 4:25 p.m. ET, CBS\n\nLos Angeles Rams at San Francisco 49ers, 4:25 p.m. ET, FOX\n\nDallas Cowboys at Washington Commanders, 4:25 p.m. ET, FOX\n\nBuffalo Bills at Miami Dolphins, 8:20 p.m. ET, NBC", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/12/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/sec/2023/12/14/alabama-football-qb-jalen-milroe-decision-2024-nfl-draft/71920596007/", "title": "Alabama football QB Jalen Milroe bypasses 2024 NFL Draft, stays ...", "text": "Alabama football quarterback Jalen Milroe intends to return to the Crimson Tide for the 2024 season rather than declaring early eligibility for the 2024 NFL Draft.

Here's a look at some other uniform controversies:\n\nTHE GOOD, THE BAD, THE UGLY:Here's a look at the worst (and best!) alternate jerseys in sports\n\nNFL DRAFT HUB: Latest NFL Draft mock drafts, news, live picks, grades and analysis.\n\nMLB's jerseys, 'see-through' pants look 'cheap'\n\nThe MLB unveiled its new Nike uniforms last week and they received less than stellar reviews. The jerseys, manufactured by Fanatics, are \"engineered to improve mobility, moisture management and fit,\" MLB said, but the threads have drawn criticism over the cheap look, small lettering and limited customization options.\n\n\"It’s something that players have earned the right to work their entire life to get to this point and now just to be kind of a jersey off of the rack,\" Hill added. \"There’s no difference between the average consumer buying that uniform and the major league player wearing that uniform, especially when it comes to certain measurements that the player should have.”\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies veteran reliever Jeff Hoffman compared the new jerseys to “a T-shirt or a gym shirt.”\n\n“It looks like a replica,” Los Angeles Angels outfielder Taylor Ward added, per The Athletic. “It feels kind of like papery. It could be great when you’re out there sweating, it may be breathable. But I haven’t had that opportunity yet to try that out. But from the looks of it, it doesn’t look like a $450 jersey.\"\n\nMLB JERSEY CONTROVERSY:MLBPA says players are 'frustrated' and want it fixed before season\n\nMORE FRUSTRATION: MLBPA says players concerned with see-through pants\n\nIt's not just the top half of the uniform that is drawing controversy. Another layer — or lack thereof — was added when players began to sport the full uniform for photo days, where it was easy to see the tucked in part of the jersey through the pants.\n\n\"A lot of the rhetoric is confirmation that the pants are see-through,\" MLBPA executive director Tony Clark said Thursday. \"It's been an ongoing conversation where each day has yielded something new that doesn't seem to make as much sense as you would like it.\"\n\nNBA's sleeved jerseys 'ugly,' 'awful,' 'not good'\n\nThe NBA rolled out sleeved jerseys in 2013, but the new uniforms didn't have the support of the league's biggest star. Lebron James said he's \"not a big fan of the jerseys\" because they limited his range of motion and restricted his shot.\n\n\"Every time I shoot it feels like it's just pulling right up underneath my arm. I already don't have much room for error on my jump shot. It's definitely not a good thing,\" James said in March 2014 following an off-night in the Heat's 111-87 loss to the San Antonio Spurs, where he shot 6-for-18 from the field and 0-for-three from three.\n\nHis displeasure for the sleeved jerseys carried into the next season after he returned to the Cleveland Cavaliers. This time, however, James didn't need words. After missing a three-point shot during the Cavaliers' home matchup against the New York Knicks in November 2015, James ripped the sleeves off his form-fitting jersey. Cleveland went on to win 96-86, but James shot 9-for-23 from the field and 1-for-5 from three.\n\nLEBRON JAMES tears open sleeves on too-tight jersey\n\nJames isn't the only one who took issue with the sleeved jerseys.\n\nGolden State Warriors star Stephen Curry said they were \"ugly jerseys\" in 2013. Dirk Nowitzki didn't hold back on social media, writing on Christmas Day 2013, \"Call me old school but these jerseys with sleeves are awful.\" Later that night, Robin Lopez said there \"needs to be a mass burning of these sleeved nba jerseys.\"\n\nThe sleeved jerseys, which were created to boost merchandise sales by appealing to fans who opted for a comfortable, T-shirt feel versus a sleeveless jersey, were phased out in 2017 after the NBA's partnership with Adidas expired and the league signed with Nike.\n\nNFL's contoured jerseys give lineman 'big ole love handles'\n\nThe NFL signed a partnership with Nike in 2012 to supply jerseys and apparel for the league following the league's deal with Reebok. Nike created a \"body-contoured fit\" jersey, which featured fabric with \"four-way stretch capability providing players with a shrink-wrap type fit,\" a Buffalo Bills press release said.\n\nAlthough the new jerseys were designed to increase speed, they didn't go over well with NFL lineman.\n\n\"There's not too much you can do with a tight jersey and tight pants,\" Green Bay Packers' DT B.J. Raji said at the time.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers guard Alex Boone added, \"I hate them. They are built for thin guys. It makes me look like I have big old love handles. It makes me look fat, and I'm not fat.\"", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/02/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2023/12/27/pro-football-hall-fame-finalists-2024/72039977007/", "title": "2024 Pro Football Hall of Fame finalists: Meet the 15 candidates", "text": "Fifteen modern-era finalists for the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2024 were announced Wednesday.\n\nThe selection committee will meet Jan. 16-17 in Atlanta to whittle down the names and choose the Hall’s next class, which will be announced Feb. 8 during the \"NFL Honors\" ceremony.

Also played for the New Orleans Saints and then-Oakland Raiders. Named All-Pro in 1989 and selected to six Pro Bowls.\n\nNFL DRAFT HUB: Latest NFL Draft mock drafts, news, live picks, grades and analysis.\n\nJared Allen\n\nTwice led the league in sacks (2007, 2011) and came one-half sack away from tying the single-season record of 22½ in ‘11 with the Minnesota Vikings. Started career with the Kansas City Chiefs and made first of four All-Pro lists in 2007 before enjoying his prime in Minnesota. Twelfth on all-time sack list with 136.\n\nWillie Anderson\n\nPlayed all but one of his 13 seasons with the Cincinnati Bengals as an offensive tackle, earning three consecutive All-Pro bids from 2004-06.\n\nJahri Evans\n\nSpent 11 of his 12 seasons as a right guard with the New Orleans Saints, four times being named All-Pro (2009-2012). Won Super Bowl with Saints and was named to the Hall of Fame’s All-2010s team.\n\nDwight Freeney\n\nMember of Super Bowl-winning Indianapolis Colts team and finished career 18th on all-time sacks list (125½). Played for the Colts from 2002-2012 and retired after 2017 campaign. Three-time All-Pro who was named to the Hall of Fame’s All-2010s team.\n\nAntonio Gates\n\nEnded 16-year career – all with the Chargers, from San Diego to the team’s move to Los Angeles – with most touchdowns for a tight end in NFL history (116). Three-time All-Pro and made eight straight Pro Bowls from 2004-11.\n\nRodney Harrison\n\nTwo-time Super Bowl champ during the first iteration of the New England Patriots dynasty after starting career with Chargers. Hard-hitting safety made receivers think twice about crossing middle of the field, had 34 career interceptions and made two All-Pro teams.\n\nDevin Hester\n\nOne of the greatest returners the game has ever seen – nobody has returned more punts for touchdowns (14). Also took five kickoffs to the house, none more memorable than his touchdown on the opening kickoff of Super Bowl 41 for the Chicago Bears.\n\nTorry Holt\n\nRookie receiver for “The Greatest Show on Turf” St. Louis Rams who went on to have six straight 1,300-yard seasons, twice leading league (2000, 2003) and was All-Pro in 2003. Finished with 74 touchdowns and played all but one of 11 years with Rams.\n\nAndre Johnson\n\nFour 100-catch seasons. Seven 1,000-yard campaigns. Led the league in receiving yards in 2008 and 2009, his two All-Pro years. Had 70 touchdowns, all without above-average quarterback play his entire career.\n\nJulius Peppers\n\nNamed to both the All-2000s and All-2010s teams with three All-Pro nods. His 159½ career sacks is fourth all time. Began career with Carolina Panthers, where he won Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2002. Also had stints with the Bears and Green Bay Packers.\n\nFred Taylor\n\nLone running back on the list who played 11 of 13 seasons with Jacksonville Jaguars. From 1998-2007, he rushed for at least 1,100 yards in seasons in which he played 13 games or more. Had league’s highest average rushing yards per game in 2000 (107.6) and finished with 66 rushing touchdowns.\n\nReggie Wayne\n\nOne of Peyton Manning’s favorite weapons in Indianapolis, he also was part of the Colts’ Super Bowl win. Led the league in receiving in 2007 with 1,510 and averaged 1,240 yards per season between 2004-2012. Played all 14 seasons with the Colts.\n\nPatrick Willis\n\nA dominant middle linebacker who retired after eight seasons with the San Francisco 49ers but has the accomplishments of somebody who played for twice that duration: 2007 Rookie of the Year, five-time All-Pro, led league in tackles twice in first three seasons. Walked away at age 30 following foot injuries that held him to six games in 2014.\n\nDarren Woodson\n\nSafety who won three Super Bowls as part of the Dallas Cowboys’ dynasty of the 1990s.

The Jaguars are in contention for the No. 1 seed in the AFC.

They should sail smoothly against the Bengals without Joe Burrow.\n\nVictoria Hernandez: Jaguars 27, Bengals 17\n\nThe Bengals are not the same team without Joe Burrow and have dropped three straight. The Jaguars have impressed with seven wins in eight games. Quarterback Trevor Lawrence continues to utilize the tools at his disposal.

For the latest news on NFL free agency moves, check our live updates page for Tuesday, March 12.\n\nNFL free agency started Monday with a flurry of deals – even if nothing is set to become official until Wednesday, which marks the start of the new league year.\n\nBut Monday at noon marked the opening of the negotiating period or \"legal tampering window, during which impending free agents are allowed to contact and enter into negotiations with teams. And if history is any indicator, it won't take long for deals to start flying, as some of the biggest names set to hit the market won't last long before they come to terms with their new team.\n\nUSA TODAY Sports will have updates on all the latest deals and buzz throughout the day, so check back often for up-to-the-minute news from our staff and around the USA TODAY Network on the start of NFL free agency:\n\nVikings set to sign QB Sam Darnold\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings appear to have their contingency plan after losing Kirk Cousins to the Atlanta Falcons.\n\nNFL DRAFT HUB: Latest NFL Draft mock drafts, news, live picks, grades and analysis.\n\nSam Darnold is set to join the team on a one-year deal worth $10 million, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe move could mark Darnold's possible return to starting status after the former New York Jets and Carolina Panthers quarterback spent last season as a backup for the San Francisco 49ers. With the Vikings potentially in the market for a rookie signal-caller, Darnold could serve as a bridge starter.\n\nJets add backup QB\n\nWoody Johnson got his wish.\n\nThe New York Jets have their backup quarterback to serve as insurance behind Aaron Rodgers, as the team reached a two-year deal worth up to $18 million with veteran signal-caller Tyrod Taylor, according to multiple reports.\n\nJohnson had made clear that his team needed to bring on a stable No. 2 after the Jets' season was undone by poor quarterback play. The team has also given Zach Wilson permission to seek a trade.\n\nTaylor stepped in to start five games for the New York Giants last season, throwing for 1,341 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nPanthers continue to overhaul interior offensive line\n\nMany assumed that the Carolina Panthers' focus this offseason would be at wide receiver as the team tries to boost the supporting cast for No. 1 pick Bryce Young. Instead, the team has made it clear that the interior line needed to be upgraded.\n\nHours after the team reached a five-year, $100 million deal with offensive guard Robert Hunt, the Panthers also came to an agreement on a four-year, $53 million contract with Carolina.\n\nThe moves give some semblance of consistency to a front that used 11 different combinations of starting offensive linemen last season. Young had the second-most sacks of any quarterback (62) last season, and the additions of Hunt and Lewis - along with a potential move to center for Austin Corbett - could help provide a more stable pocket for the signal-caller.\n\nJets add more help for Aaron Rodgers\n\nThe New York Jets are still formulating a full-fledged protection plan for Aaron Rodgers, but the team added a key piece to its front.\n\nFormer Baltimore Ravens offensive guard John Simpson agreed to a two-year deal with the Jets worth $18 million, according to multiple reports.\n\nSimpson, 26, was a fourth-round pick out of Clemson by the Raiders in 2020 but was waived by the team in 2022. He latched on with the Ravens and managed to secure a starting spot last season, helping pave the way for the league's top-ranked rushing attack.\n\nBengals releasing RB Joe Mixon, to sign RB Zack Moss\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals shook up their running back room on the first day of free agency.\n\nOn Monday night, NFL Network's Tom Pelissero and Mike Garafolo reported that the franchise released Pro Bowler Joe Mixon.\n\nThe running back spent seven seasons with the Bengals after they picked him up in the second round of the 2017 NFL draft. He had four 1,000-yard seasons, including last year when he racked up 1,034 yards and nine touchdowns. He was named to the Pro Bowl in 2021 after having a 1,205-yard season with 13 touchdowns.\n\nESPN's Adam Schefter added that the Bengals signed Zack Moss to a two-year, $8 million deal. While All-Pro running back Jonathan Taylor sat out the beginning of last year with injury, Moss had two 100-yard games. In a win over the Tennessee Titans, he had 165 rushing yards and two touchdowns.\n\nSeahawks re-sign DL Leonard Williams\n\nAfter surrendering a second-round pick for versatile D-lineman Leonard Williams at last year's trade deadline, the Seattle Seahawks are making him more than a half-season rental.\n\nWilliams, a nine-year veteran comfortable in even and odd fronts who is adept both as a run stuffer and pass rusher, gets a three-year deal worth $64.5 million (per multiple reports) to stay in the Pacific Northwest with new coach Mike Macdonald. Williams played 18 games, split between the Giants and Seahawks, in 2023, finishing with 5½ sacks and 23 pressures.\n\nPatriots add a quarterback\n\nA day after agreeing to trade Mac Jones to the Jacksonville Jaguars, the New England Patriots are backfilling their quarterback room with a familiar face.\n\nJacoby Brissett, who launched his itinerant NFL career in Foxborough in 2016, will return on a one-year, $8 million deal, per NFL Network. He'll join a roster where Bailey Zappe and Nathan Rourke are currently the only other QBs. Of course, New England owns the third overall pick of the 2024 draft, and Jones' departure could be a major signal that new personnel boss Eliot Wolf intends to pick a passer.\n\nIn 48 career starts, Brissett is 18-30, though he didn't start for Washington in 2023. He has 10,574 career passing yards and 51 touchdowns. The Patriots traded him to the Indianapolis Colts before the start of the 2017 season.\n\nSeahawks re-sign TE Noah Fant\n\nAmid what has been an expectedly quiet start to free agency for the Seattle Seahawks, general manager John Schneider and Co. have made their first significant move.\n\nTight end Noah Fant is re-signing with the team on a two-year, $21 million contract, according to multiple reports.\n\nFant, 26, was one of the pieces the Seahawks received in the Russell Wilson trade with the Denver Broncos. He has not reached 500 receiving yards in either of his seasons in Seattle, but he could be in for a more significant role under first-year head coach Mike Macdonald after Will Dissly was cut and Colby Parkinson departed for the Los Angeles Rams in free agency.\n\nTexans poach former Titans LB\n\nLinebacker Azeez Al-Shaair will not be coming back for a second season with the Tennessee Titans but, like one of his former Titans teammates, he isn't going far.\n\nAl-Shaair is expected to sign with the Houston Texans in NFL free agency, per NFL Network and The Athletic. Al-Shaair led the Titans and finished fifth in the NFL with 163 combined tackles in 2023, his first season with the franchise. Al-Shaair came to Nashville after spending his first four professional seasons with the San Francisco 49ers, but Al-Shaair made nearly as many tackles in his first season with the Titans as he did in his previous four combined. In addition to his 163 tackles, Al-Shaair also logged two sacks, nine tackles for loss and four pass breakups.\n\nAl-Shaair is the second Titans defender who's reportedly defected to the division rival Texans on Monday. Defensive lineman Denico Autry has also reportedly agreed to terms with Houston. Al-Shaair played for Texans coach DeMeco Ryans when Ryans was the defensive coordinator in San Francisco.\n\n- Nick Suss, The Tennessean\n\nMichael Onwenu re-ups with Patriots\n\nThe New England Patriots are keeping one of their offensive staples in place.\n\nOffensive lineman Michael Onwenu is re-signing with the team on a three-year, $57 million contract, according to NFL Network.\n\nOnwenu has proven to be a versatile and reliable piece along the Patriots' front, seeing time both at guard and offensive tackle. At 26, he was expected to be one of the most highly sought-after blockers in free agency.\n\nAustin Ekeler finds landing spot with Commanders\n\nLast offseason, Austin Ekeler organized a Zoom meeting among the NFL’s best running backs to discuss their sunken market in recent years.\n\nSo it was fitting Ekeler signed his new deal on a day several other notable backs found new homes.\n\nThe Washington Commanders and Ekeler agreed to a two-year deal, according to multiple reports. Per NFL Network, it is worth up to $11.43 million.\n\nIn Washington, Ekeler will once again play for his former head coach with the Los Angeles Chargers, Anthony Lynn, who is the team’s running backs coach. He’ll also join a backfield that includes Brian Robinson Jr.\n\nEkeler, 28, has never eclipsed the 1,000-yard mark but scored 25 touchdowns between the 2021 and 2022 regular seasons before injuries, a career-worst 3.5 yards per carry and overall Chargers dysfunction marred the 2023 campaign.\n\nThe Commanders are quickly spending their way through the $96 million in cap space they had entering free agency.\n\nGiants land star pass rusher Brian Burns in trade\n\nOn a day when the New York Giants lost one star player in Saquon Barkley, the team now is set to welcome another.\n\nThe Giants agreed to a trade with the Carolina Panthers for Brian Burns, according to multiple reports. The Panthers will receive second- and fifth-round picks in the deal, per reports. Meanwhile, Burns landed a five-year, $150 million extension as part of the swap. That deal leaves him behind only the San Francisco 49ers' Nick Bosa for the title of highest-paid edge rusher.\n\nBurns, who turns 26 next month, had been seeking a long-term deal but had not received one, instead getting the franchise tag from the Panthers earlier in March.\n\nA two-time Pro Bowl selection, Burns has recorded 46 sacks in five seasons. In New York, he joins a defensive front that includes two-time Pro Bowler Dexter Lawrence and edge rusher Kayvon Thibodeaux, who notched 11½ sacks last season.\n\nLions trade for CB Carlton Davis in deal with Bucs\n\nTo address a problem area at cornerback, the Detroit Lions looked to the trade market rather than free agency or the draft.\n\nThe Lions are acquiring Carlton Davis from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, according to multiple reports. The Buccaneers will receive the Lions' 2024 third-round pick while the Lions will also get two sixth-round picks as part of the deal.\n\nDavis, 27, has been a staple of the Buccaneers' defense since he was selected in the second round out of Auburn in the 2018 NFL draft. He is in the final year of his contract and due a base salary of $14 million.\n\nThe move serves as the first major personnel loss for the Buccaneers after the team re-signed Baker Mayfield and Mike Evans and franchise-tagged Antoine Winfield Jr.\n\nGardner Minshew on the move\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders have added another quarterback to the mix, agreeing to a two-year, $25 million deal, per multiple reports, with Pro Bowler Gardner Minshew II.\n\nMinshew went 7-6 in 13 starts last season for the Indianapolis Colts, passing for 3,305 yards and 15 TDs in an offense that skewed run-heavy.\n\nAt the moment, it appears he'll compete with Aidan O'Connell and Jimmy Garoppolo in Sin City, though it appears the latter is likely on his way out of town. The Silver and Black are also currently slotted 13th in the draft and could target a younger, longer-term passer.\n\nGeno Stone joins Ravens' AFC North rival\n\nGeno Stone's breakout season has led him to one of the Baltimore Ravens' rivals.\n\nThe safety agreed to a two-year, $15 million contract with the Cincinnati Bengals, according to multiple reports.\n\nA seventh-round pick in 2020, Stone seized on his opportunity this season by recording seven interceptions.\n\nEx-Ravens RB Gus Edwards teams up with Jim Harbaugh\n\nThe “Gus Bus” route evidently runs from Harbaugh to Harbaugh.\n\nFormer Baltimore Ravens running back Gus Edwards reached an agreement with the Los Angeles Chargers on a two-year deal, according to ESPN.\n\nWith the Chargers, Edwards will be reunited with offensive coordinator Greg Roman and will play for head coach Jim Harbaugh after playing for John Harbaugh in Baltimore from 2018-2023.\n\nEdwards, who will be 29 next month, saw the most action of his professional career last season as the Ravens did not have a primary back once J.K. Dobbins went down with a season-ending injury.\n\nEdwards missed the entire 2021 season with a torn ACL he suffered in practice.\n\nGiants fill running back void with a veteran\n\nThe New York Giants are moving on after Saquon Barkley's departure to the rival Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nThe team agreed to a three-year, $16.5 million with Devin Singletary, according to multiple reports.\n\nSingletary, 26, had career highs in both rushing yards (898) and carries (216) after taking over the lead back role from Dameon Pierce.\n\nPackers get their big-name safety in Xavier McKinney\n\nThe Green Bay Packers have made another significant foray into free agency with a major name.\n\nSafety Xavier McKinney agreed to a four-year, $68 million contract with the team, according to multiple reports.\n\nMcKinney, 24, was viewed by many as the top free-agent safety available in a crowded market at the position. Despite the ample supply, McKinney was able to net a deal near the top of the market, as only Derwin James, Minkah Fitzpatrick and franchise-tagged Antoine Winfield Jr. are set to have higher annual average values at the position.\n\nMcKinney adds instant stability to the back end of a defense that is in transition under new coordinator Jeff Hafley. Darnell Savage Jr. agreed to a deal earlier Monday with the Jacksonville Jaguars, and Jonathan Owens and Rudy Ford are both free agents.\n\nPatriots to release WR DeVante Parker\n\nThe expected overhaul of the Patriots' receiving corps is underway.\n\nThe team will release veteran wideout DeVante Parker, according to multiple reports.\n\nParker, 31, agreed to a three-year extension with the team last June. But he recorded just 33 catches for 394 yards as he struggled to gain consistent separation.\n\nRobert Hunt reels in five-year, $100 million contract from Panthers\n\nRobert Hunt wasn't widely considered a candidate to land a nine-figure contract.\n\nBut amid a booming market for offensive guards, the former Miami Dolphins standout secured a five-year, $100 million contract from the Carolina Panthers, according to multiple reports.\n\nHis addition serves as a substantial investment by new general manager Dan Morgan in protecting No. 1 pick Bryce Young, whose 62 sacks trailed only the Washington Commanders' Sam Howell for most in the league.\n\nVikings keep adding to defense with LB homecoming\n\nThe Vikings continue to add to their defense on the first day of free agency, this time bringing aboard former Houston Texans linebacker Blake Cashman on a three-year, $25.5 million contract, according to multiple reports.\n\nCashman, who turns 28 in May, is a native of Eden Prairie, Minnesota. He recorded 106 tackles last season.\n\nHe stands as the latest defensive imports after the team also reached deals with Jonathan Greenard and Andrew Van Ginkel earlier in the day.\n\nVikings land another pass rusher in Andrew Van Ginkel\n\nEdge rusher Andrew Van Ginkel, one of the most productive late-round picks in recent memory for the Miami Dolphins, is finally cashing in, accepting a two-year deal Monday to join the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nESPN reported that Van Ginkel's deal is worth $20 million, with $14 million guaranteed.\n\nVan Ginkel was drafted in the fifth round in 2019, 151st overall, but is coming off a final season in Miami in which he graded as the NFL’s seventh-best edge defender, according to Pro Football Focus.\n\nVan Ginkel proved to be a bargain for the Dolphins, not only in the low draft pick they spent on him, but in paying him $7.9 million over his five seasons. All the while, he earned respect as the personification of a lunchpail-type player.\n\nHe joins a new-look Vikings edge rush led by Jonathan Greenard, who agreed to terms with Minnesota earlier in the day.\n\n- Hal Habib, Palm Beach Post\n\nSaquon Barkley leaves Giants to link up with Eagles\n\nSince the New York Giants took him with the No. 2 overall pick of the 2018 NFL draft, Saquon Barkley maintained a public position that he wanted to spend his entire career with the team.\n\nHe'll see them on the opposing sideline twice a year now instead.\n\nBarkley and the Philadelphia Eagles agreed to a three-year, $37.75 million contract that could be worth up to $46.75M and includes $26M fully guaranteed, a person with knowledge of the deal told USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose terms of the deal.\n\nESPN was first to report the agreement.\n\nThe two-time Pro Bowl back will remain in the NFC East and will go closer to where he played collegiately at Penn State.\n\nBarkley joins Philadelphia as a rare big-money running back for a franchise that has typically avoided them under executive vice president and general manager Howie Roseman's watch.\n\nEarlier Monday, former Eagles running back D'Andre Swift signed a three-year deal with the Chicago Bears.\n\nJosh Jacobs in, Aaron Jones out for Packers\n\nJosh Jacobs' payday did not come in Sin City. Instead, he'll head to the Green Bay Packers to cash out.\n\nThe former Las Vegas Raiders running back agreed to an undisclosed deal with the team, according to multiple reports.\n\nAs a result of the move, lead back Aaron Jones will be released, according to multiple reports. His former backfield partner AJ Dillon became a free agent this offseason.\n\nJacobs led the league in rushing in 2022 and racked up 393 touches in the process while earning first-team All-Pro honors. After that season, the Raiders placed the franchise tag on Jacobs, who held out until close to the start of the season; the two sides eventually agreed on a one-year deal worth almost $12 million.\n\nKirk Cousins chooses Falcons over Vikings\n\nKirk Cousins is leaving the Minnesota Vikings for the Atlanta Falcons, bringing an end to his six-year run with the franchise and drastically altering the short-term outlook for two NFC playoff hopefuls.\n\nThe veteran quarterback agreed to terms on a four-year deal with the Falcons, his agent Mike McCartney confirmed Monday.\n\nWith Cousins not re-signing with the Vikings prior to the expiration of his contract on March 13, the Vikings will now incur a $28.5 million dead cap hit for 2024.\n\nThe four-time Pro Bowl selection steps in as the long-awaited answer for a franchise that has been dogged by poor play behind center ever since trading organizational mainstay Matt Ryan to the Indianapolis Colts two years ago. In 2022, Marcus Mariota was benched late in the season for rookie Desmond Ridder. Rather than pursue Lamar Jackson or another established veteran passer, the Falcons opted to stand behind Ridder as their starter for 2023. But his spate of turnovers and red zone woes led to a late-season benching, and coach Arthur Smith was fired after a third consecutive 7-10 season.\n\nSaid new coach Raheem Morris at the NFL scouting combine: \"If we had better quarterback play, I’m probably not standing here at this podium.\"\n\nEagles add intrigue to pass-rush group with Bryce Huff\n\nOne pass rusher in, another out?\n\nThat could be the eventual upshot for the Philadelphia Eagles after they agreed Monday on a three-year, $51.1 million contract with Bryce Huff.\n\nAn undrafted free agent out of Memphis in 2020, Huff latched on with the Jets and broke out last season as a designated pass rusher, tallying 10 sacks despite playing in just 42% of the team's defensive snaps. Huff proved to be a remarkably efficient threat, ranking eighth in pass-rush win rate among all edge rushers, according to ESPN. But he also benefited from being kept fresh with little work on run downs.\n\nHe joins a deep pass-rushing group that includes Haason Reddick, Josh Sweat, Brandon Graham and 2023 first-round pick Nolan Smith. His arrival could signal a possible trade for either Reddick or Sweat.\n\nRams bolster line with Jonah Jackson\n\nThe interior of the offensive line was clearly a priority for the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nAfter re-signing guard Kevin Dotson last week, the Rams signed guard Jonah Jackson to a three-year, $51 million deal with $34 million guaranteed.\n\nJackson, 27, was with the Detroit Lions for the first four seasons of his career. He made the Pro Bowl in 2021.\n\nDan Quinn brings over two former Cowboys player to Commanders\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys to Washington Commanders pipeline expanded during the first hours of free agency.\n\nIn addition to new head coach Dan Quinn, most recently the defensive coordinator for his former NFC East rival, the Commanders agreed to terms on deals with center Tyler Biadasz and defensive end Dorance Armstrong Jr.\n\nArmstrong enjoyed the most productive seasons of his career in 2022 and 2023 with a combined 16 sacks.\n\nBiadasz made the Pro Bowl in 2022 and was a three-year starter for Dallas.\n\nWashington entered free agency with by far the most cap space in the league at $96 million, giving first-year general manager Adam Peters the capacity to rebuild the roster.\n\nRaiders shake up NFL free agency with Christian Wilkins deal\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders announced themselves as a major player in free agency on Monday by agreeing to terms on a four-year, $110 million contract with former Miami Dolphins defensive tackle Christian Wilkins.\n\nThe deal also includes $84.75 million guaranteed.\n\nThat payout puts Wilkins behind only the Kansas City Chiefs' Chris Jones and the Los Angeles Rams' Aaron Donald in a booming defensive tackle market. Baltimore Ravens defensive tackle Justin Madubuike, for example, never hit free agency but last week agreed to a four-year, $98 million contract after receiving the franchise tag.\n\nIn Las Vegas, Wilkins will make for a formidable inside-outside tandem with three-time Pro Bowl defensive end Maxx Crosby. Tyree Wilson, the No. 7 overall pick in 2023, is also looking to make a leap after recorded 3 ½ sacks as a rookie.\n\nJaguars add a target in WR Gabe Davis\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars and wide receiver Gabe Davis have agreed to terms on a three-year deal worth $39 million, according to multiple reports.\n\nDavis spent the first four seasons of his career with the Buffalo Bills, the team that drafted him in the fourth round in 2020. He had 27 touchdowns in the regular season during that time and became the de facto No. 2 wide receiver behind Stefon Diggs for quarterback Josh Allen. While he delivered splash plays as a downfield target, averaging 16.7 yards per catch, he struggled with consistency and was held without a catch in five games last season.\n\nThe Jaguars still face an uncertain future with top wide receiver Calvin Ridley, who is set to become a free agent after leading the team with 1,016 receiving yards after his first season back from a one-year gambling ban. The Athletic's Jeff Howe reported Jacksonville still hopes to bring back Ridley, but there could be strong competition for the receiver, especially given the shortage of top-tier pass catchers on the open market.\n\nTitans continue to build up front with Lloyd Cushenberry\n\nTennessee Titans general manager Ran Carthon has made it known he wants to fortify his team's offensive line. In free agency, he took a significant step toward that goal.\n\nLloyd Cushenberry, widely considered the top center available, agreed to a deal with the team on Monday, according to multiple reports.\n\nCushenberry should step in alongside 2023 first-round pick Peter Skoronski to help stabilize the interior for second-year quarterback Will Levis. With the No. 7 pick in this year's draft, the Titans still could be in the market for their left tackle of the future.\n\nDavid Bakhtiari out in Green Bay\n\nIt was a move that appeared inevitable for some time, but David Bahktiari's time with the Packers finally appears to be over.\n\nThe 32-year-old left tackle posted his farewell on social media amid his expected release.\n\nA two-time All-Pro, Bakhtiari has played just 13 games in the last three seasons - including one last year - while dealing with lingering knee issues. His $40 million cap hit for 2024 was set to be the largest of any non-quarterback.\n\nNow, could a reunion with Aaron Rodgers be in the cards given the Jets' need for a blind-side protector?\n\nTony Pollard to Titans\n\nThe running back market is quickly coming into focus, Tony Pollard set to join the Tennessee Titans shortly after the Chicago Bears and D'Andre Swift struck a deal. Pollard's move to Nashville all but officially brings an end to Derrick Henry's momentous tenure – his 9,502 rushing yards the most ever by a Titan (though ex-Oiler/Titan Eddie George is the franchise's all-time leading rusher by 507 yards).\n\nPollard, whose move was first reported by KPRC2's Aaron Wilson, had more than 1,300 yards from scrimmage each of the past two seasons for the Dallas Cowboys. However his yards per touch dipped by 1.6 in 2023, when he played on the franchise tag as the lead back following the departure of Ezekiel Elliott. Pollard will now team with Tyjae Spears (838 yards in 2023) in Tennessee.\n\nJonathan Greenard links up with Vikings\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings faced a potential exodus from an already suspect pass rush. Now, they have wrapped up one of the top edge threats on the market.\n\nJonathan Greenard agreed to a four-year, $76 million deal with the team Monday, his agent told ESPN.\n\nGreenard, who turns 27 in May, had a breakout season last year for the Houston Texans, racking up 12 ½ sacks opposite Defensive Rookie of the Year Will Anderson Jr.\n\nIn Minnesota, he'll play a vital role in Brian Flores' blitz-happy defense, which looks set to lose standout edge rusher Danielle Hunter. Marcus Davenport and D.J. Wonnum are also on track to be free agents.\n\nD'Andre Swift bolts to Bears on three-year contract\n\nThe first big domino of NFL free agency has fallen.\n\nFormer Philadelphia Eagles running back D'Andre Swift agreed to a three-year, $24.5 million deal with the Chicago Bears, according to NFL Network.\n\nSwift, 25, should take on a leading role in a Bears backfield that also returns Khalil Herbert and Roschon Johnson. After being acquired by the Eagles via trade last offseason, Swift tallied career highs of 229 carries and 1,049 rushing yards.\n\nChicago could be in for a nearly full-scale skill-position overhaul outside of wide receiver DJ Moore, as the team is expected to select Caleb Williams No. 1 overall in the NFL draft and could be in the market for another wideout with the No. 9 pick.\n\nSwift's departure creates more uncertainty for the Eagles, who could be involved in the market for Saquon Barkley.\n\nMichael Pittman Jr. gets a long-term deal with Colts\n\nAdd Indianapolis Colts wide receiver Michael Pittman Jr. to the growing list of franchise-tagged players who won't be playing on the one-year tender in 2024 after getting a long-term deal completed.\n\nPittman and the Colts agreed to a three-year, $70 million contract, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe agreement keeps in place the top target for Colts quarterback Anthony Richardson. Pittman recorded 109 catches for 1,152 receiving yards last season.\n\nKickers not getting the boot\n\nA couple of specialists are staying home rather than test the free agent market.\n\nPer NFL Network, the New York Jets are re-signing K Greg Zuerlein, arguably their most valuable player in 2023, to a two-year contract worth $8.4 million. The veteran connected on 35 of 38 field-goal tries in 2023, one of the best seasons of his 12-year career.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers remain in run-it-back mode, reaching a three-year agreement to retain K Chase McLaughlin a day after keeping QB Baker Mayfield in the building. McLaughlin was 29-of-31 in the FG department for the 2023 NFC South champs and hit all 33 of his extra-point tries.\n\nEagles extend Landon Dickerson\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles’ offensive line will look different next season without Jason Kelce, but the organization is bringing back a key part of the interior.\n\nLeft guard Landon Dickerson agreed to a four-year extension, the Eagles announced Monday.\n\nAccording to NFL Media, the deal is worth $84 million in base salary with $50 million guaranteed and a $20 million signing bonus. The $21 million annual average value is the highest for a guard in NFL history. The Atlanta Falcons' Chris Lindstrom previously held the title.\n\nDickerson, 25, has been the Eagles’ starter at left guard since Week 3 of the 2021 season, his rookie year. He is a back-to-back Pro Bowl selection and one of the key pieces behind the efficiency and success of the Eagles’ patented “Tush Push” short-yardage run play.\n\nThe Eagles selected Dickerson, who started his college career at Florida State before transferring to Alabama, in the second round (37th overall) of the 2021 draft.\n\nJaguars add Pro Bowler to offensive line\n\nAfter a season in which QB Trevor Lawrence was consistently beaten up physically, the Jacksonville Jaguars have already made a move to upgrade their O-line. Per NFL Network, C Mitch Morse – another \"street free agent\" after getting released by the Buffalo Bills last week – has agreed to a two-year, $10.5 million deal ($7 million guaranteed). The 2022 Pro Bowler will likely displace Luke Fortner, the Jags' starting center the past two seasons.\n\nTee Higgins landing spots: Which teams could be interested in Bengals WR?\n\nMaybe the Bengals won't be running back their receiving corps after all.\n\nFranchise-tagged wide receiver Tee Higgins is requesting a trade amid frustration with the team regarding the lack of progress toward a long-term contract, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon. The person spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.\n\nESPN was first to report the news.\n\nHiggins, 25, would immediately become the best wide receiver that could be within teams' reach - although at a potentially significant cost. Beyond what a team would have to give up in compensation in order to sway the Bengals to part with arguably the league's top No. 2 receiver, a franchise would need to cough up a significant contract amid a booming receiver market.\n\nStill, several teams could be potential buyers. Among them:\n\nCarolina Panthers: Their interest in finding top-tier pass-catching help is well-established, and there's likely no bigger instant-impact contributor available than the Clemson product. Strong chance that the Panthers are looking for a receiver when they're first up with the initial pick of the second round.\n\nTheir interest in finding top-tier pass-catching help is well-established, and there's likely no bigger instant-impact contributor available than the Clemson product. Strong chance that the Panthers are looking for a receiver when they're first up with the initial pick of the second round. Tennessee Titans: Homecoming time for the Oak Ridge, Tennessee, native? Outside of 31-year-old DeAndre Hopkins, the receiving corps behind Will Levis is severely underwhelming. Higgins could form a dynamic downfield connection with Levis, and the Titans have ample cap space to swing such a move.\n\nHomecoming time for the Oak Ridge, Tennessee, native? Outside of 31-year-old DeAndre Hopkins, the receiving corps behind Will Levis is severely underwhelming. Higgins could form a dynamic downfield connection with Levis, and the Titans have ample cap space to swing such a move. New England Patriots: Eliot Wolf spoke of the need to \"weaponize the offense.\" Well, here you go. No better quick fix for a team that has been woefully lacking in support for its quarterback, and Higgins would be a major asset to any young passer who takes the reins behind center. And a big-money deal isn't a problem for a team that enters Monday with the second-most cap space (more than $82 million) at its disposal.\n\nWhy are some free agents already signing deals?\n\nThe tampering window doesn't open until noon ET, however some players have already switched teams. Why?\n\nIn the case of S Kevin Byard, who's already reportedly agreed to a two-year deal with the Chicago Bears, for example, the Philadelphia Eagles terminated his contract early. That made Byard a \"street free agent\" and thus eligible to sign elsewhere immediately as opposed to waiting for Wednesday. Former Denver Broncos Pro Bowl FS Justin Simmons is in a similar situation, already eligible to join another club.\n\nEarly termination of contracts not only kickstarts the process of clearing cap space, but it's often a sign of good faith as clubs give veterans a head start on the free agent process.\n\nIn the case of QB Russell Wilson, he can't officially sign with the Pittsburgh Steelers until later this week as the Broncos have only announced his impending release, but it's not yet official.\n\nColts bring back LB Zaire Franklin\n\nINDIANAPOLIS — The first move the Colts made in free agency this offseason was one they did not have to make.\n\nBut it was a chance to reward a player who has outplayed the last deal he signed by leaps and bounds.\n\nIndianapolis signed middle linebacker Zaire Franklin to a three-year extension, a person with knowledge of the situation told IndyStar and the USA TODAY Network on Monday morning. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they had not been authorized to disclose the deal, which is worth up to $31.3 million.\n\nFranklin signed a three-year, $10 million deal in free agency two years ago, a deal that reflected his place at the time as a critical special teamer and rotational linebacker, and he was headed into the final year of that deal in 2024, a deal that would have paid him more than $3 million this season.\n\nHe has been a tackling machine the past two seasons, breaking the Indianapolis record with 167 tackles in his first season as a full-time starter, then setting a new bar again in 2023 by piling up 179 tackles. Franklin also has 4.5 sacks and 12 passes defended over the past two seasons.\n\n- Joel A. Erickson, Indianapolis Star\n\nLions solidify interior line with Graham Glasgow\n\nThe Detroit Lions will keep at least one of their starting guards in 2024.\n\nThe Lions and veteran offensive lineman Graham Glasgow agreed to a new three-year contract worth a maximum of $20 million before the start of the free agent negotiating period Monday. The deal, which is still being finalized, includes $9.5 million guaranteed.\n\nOriginally a third-round pick by the Lions in 2016, Glasgow returned to the team on a one-year deal last spring after spending the previous three seasons with the Denver Broncos. He started games at both guard spots and center last year and was one of the Lions’ most consistent linemen.\n\nGlasgow ranked second in the NFL in run block win rate among interior lineman in 2023, according to ESPN, and allowed four sacks last season according to the Free Press’ charting of plays.\n\n- Dave Birkett, Detroit Free Press\n\nRussell Wilson to sign with Steelers\n\nSix days proved to be enough for Russell Wilson to find his landing spot.\n\nAfter the Denver Broncos revealed last Monday their intention to cut Wilson after the start of the new league year on Wednesday, the nine-time Pro Bowl quarterback met with the Pittsburgh Steelers on Friday. By Sunday night, reports emerged that Wilson was planning to sign with the Steelers, with the signal-caller seemingly confirming the news on social media.\n\nWilson's addition adds immediate intrigue for a Steelers offense already undergoing changes with the arrival of new coordinator Arthur Smith. While both coach Mike Tomlin and general manager Omar Khan have backed incumbent starter Kenny Pickett, each stated their desire to bring in competition ahead of the former first-round draft pick's third season.\n\nThe move comes at little cost to the Steelers, as Wilson was due $39 million guaranteed from the Broncos.\n\nWhile starting is hardly a given for Wilson, the opportunity seemingly stands out as the 12-year veteran's best chance to push for playing time - and on a team that has never had a losing season in Tomlin's 17 years at the helm.\n\nArik Armstead set to hit NFL free agency as a cut\n\nIn an offseason in which the San Francisco 49ers look to be bringing back a sizable number of their key contributors from last year's Super Bowl team, at least one piece will be headed elsewhere.\n\nDefensive lineman Arik Armstead was unable to agree to a restructured contract with the team and is now expected to be released, according to multiple reports.\n\nArmstead, 30, played in 12 games last season, missing time after suffering a torn meniscus in December. He has spent all nine years of his career with the 49ers and signed a five-year, $85 million contract with the team in 2020 after a 10-sack season.\n\nThis season, Armstead was set to have a massive $28.3 million cap hit.

Ashley Biden’s public debut is unfolding without the usual tight choreography of a White House production, and she has appeared in public without political staffers in attendance or reaching out eagerly to reporters with the customary spin. The White House declined to comment for this story, as did Ashley Biden.\n\nBut Biden is making it clear she’s ready to tell her own story, no small matter for a person whose personal diary was once stolen and peddled for sale to her father’s political detractors.\n\n“I finally feel like I’m in a place where I really know who I am, I know my worth, I know my family – who are honestly some of the most incredible, kind, compassionate humans, who have given up their life, really, for service to the American people,” said Biden, speaking on the record last week to a small group of invited guests at a question-and-answer event at a hip DC hotel.\n\nThe public confessions come at a moment important for Ashley Biden, whose father and mother, Dr. Jill Biden, continue to weigh a reelection run in a country that remains roiled by political division. The gloves-off campaign style of the last several years has not gone unnoticed by Ashley Biden.\n\n“I grew up with Dad kind of always – I always saw him work with the other side of the aisle,” said Biden last week. “Now, since (former President Donald) Trump, I’m sorry, but this is just a whole disgusting ballgame. It is like nothing I’ve ever seen because he gave air to hate. And it’s always been there, right? But it was not as visible as it is today.”\n\nAshley Biden’s most recent remarks are the most forthcoming, lengthy and personal since her father took office, but her public momentum has been building. Last month, she stepped out at a splashy magazine party in Washington, headlined by supermodel Christy Turlington; several days later, Biden was in San Francisco, hosting a roundtable on mental health and traumatic recovery centers, and participating in an interview with the Bay Area NPR station.\n\nOn October 24, Biden joined her parents at the White House for a reception to celebrate the Indian holiday Diwali, standing beside the first lady as she made remarks. Jill Biden wore a green, printed dress; Ashley Biden wore a three-piece, peach-colored sari.\n\nOctober 24, 2022, Washington, District of Columbia, USA: First lady Dr. Jill Biden introduces her daughter Ashley Biden at a reception to celebrate Diwali in the East Room in the White House in Washington, DC, October 24, 2022 Chris Kleponis/CNP/Zuma Press\n\nShe had previously popped up from time to time – that was her this summer on the beach in Rehoboth, Delaware, pulling her father away from the press during a walk with a sharp, “Nope, like, no more – no more questions.” Biden joked, “That’s my press secretary daughter.”\n\nBut she is not a ubiquitous West Wing presence like her presidential first daughter predecessor, nor is she consistent tabloid fodder, like her older brother, Hunter Biden.\n\n“When I was growing up, kids were off limits, right?” said Biden at last week’s event, discussing an earlier time when campaigns practiced more civility. “You weren’t allowed. It was kind of a mutual understanding that you just didn’t really go after people’s children. You know? … I-I- don’t – that’s not what I signed up for.”\n\nA ‘strategic’ public emergence\n\nFour people familiar with Ashley Biden and her family told CNN it’s not clear to them why she is choosing now to make a more public emergence with politically charged statements.\n\n“She has had periods of being more vocal,” says one person who worked with the Bidens for several years. “But she has also had times of being almost reclusive, and not participating.”\n\nAnother person added that while Ashley Biden’s parents are supportive of her and her convictions, there is always a “bit of stress” when either of their children are in the public eye.\n\nAsked whether the recent comments from Biden are being sanctioned, or even monitored, by the White House – as is the tendency for most administrations when presidential family members make public speaking engagements – another person was doubtful. “She has always been her own person,” said the source.\n\n“I’m authentic, I’m kind, I’m honest. I care, I’m compassionate. And I’m really strategic,” Biden said last week, exaggerating the Ls in “really.”\n\nA third person who has known Ashley Biden and the Biden family for more than a decade said it is typically not like the Biden family to “restrict” or “censor” their children. However, a presidential daughter discussing, for example, the ongoing Department of Justice investigation into her brother’s contacts and financial dealings is not exactly the kind of going rogue an administration would feel comfortable with, said a political strategist who has worked with White House Democrats.\n\nFederal prosecutors are weighing possible charges for Hunter Biden related to tax violations, as well as for making a false statement related to a gun purchase, CNN has previously reported.\n\n“They’re not going to find anything,” she said at the Q&A last week, talking about Hunter Biden, and the investigation. “They’re just trying to do whatever they can, but that’s,” she said, pausing to shrug, “so when that started to happen, when people started to attack me, and I was like, ‘Whoa.’ It just became a widespread thing.”\n\nAshley Biden said the brouhaha over the Hunter Biden allegations of wrongdoing and influence peddling has become little more than a family inside joke. “I still look at my brother and I’m like, ‘do you know you impeached Donald Trump, basically?’”\n\nFrom a ‘humble’ home to embracing the spotlight\n\nAshley Biden was raised, she says, in a “humble” home.\n\n“Growing up, I lived a very normal, down-to-earth life,” she said last week. She was an athlete, excelling at both field hockey and lacrosse during her Wilmington, Delaware, school years.\n\nShe took an interest in her father’s grassroots-style of politicking, often accompanying him at campaign events, parades and on the door-to-door visits that were once a hallmark of gathering votes.\n\n“I would travel with him everywhere and I would always question the inequity. I also went to a Quaker school and learned about racism from a very young age,” said Biden during an October 20 interview with KQED in San Francisco. “And it was my mission to tackle structural violence and institutional racism. Why aren’t people healing? Why are the most marginalized the most harmed, yet the least healed?”\n\nBiden became a social worker, working hands-on with cases, mostly in underserved areas of Delaware and parts of Philadelphia. She got her master’s degree in social work from the University of Pennsylvania – a Biden-family favorite for higher education. She eventually became executive director for the Delaware Center for Justice, where she worked until 2019.\n\nIn 2016, Biden launched a hooded sweatshirt line dubbed “Livelihood,” and marketed as a socially conscious fashion label. The hoodies retailed for $80-$100, and according to Biden, profits went to various charities in support of social justice and minority entrepreneurship.\n\nAs Joe Biden campaigned for the presidency, Ashley would appear from time to time on the campaign trail, stumping beside him, the only daughter of Jill and Joe Biden. When her parents moved into the White House, Ashley Biden sometimes did, too, said two people familiar with the Bidens’ living situation, most recently last winter and early spring.\n\nShe had been scheduled to travel on two foreign trips with the first lady – in May, to Romania, Slovakia and Ukraine, and Ecuador, Panama and Costa Rica – but pulled out of the trips last-minute. The East Wing cited Covid-19-related issues for both of the cancellations.\n\n‘We are not letting them win’\n\nBiden admits she has shied from the spotlight, which she says got uglier and uglier during the last presidential campaign, when opponents made a frequent target of her and her brother.\n\n“I have to be honest with you, I started to really have a lot of resentment,” said Biden last week in Washington. “It’s cruel, like, honestly, it’s dehumanizing. And so, I have a lot of anger around that.”\n\nShe paused and added, “I’m also like, screw this, we are not letting them win.”\n\nThe flare of anger is personal for Ashley Biden. She had her own brush with the exposure of her personal life, motivated by political opponents of her father. In August, two people pleaded guilty to stealing her belongings, including her journal, and selling them to a conservative media outlet.\n\nBiden said this month she is now a consultant for the National Alliance of Trauma Recovery Centers, which teaches and assists with building centers around the country with the specific aim of helping victims of traumatic events. Biden recently said she is also “teaching a trauma class for 25 women who are coming out of incarceration.”\n\nWith midterm elections less than a week away, a second run for the White House by her father remains undetermined; the president’s age, approval ratings and performance being hammered regularly by critics.\n\nEven still, Ashley Biden appears willing to test some of her own boundaries of vulnerability. She speaks with a sense of urgency around socio-economic and health care issues – as the daughter of a lifelong politician, she knows first-hand the partisan stakes when funding, congressional support, health care and power all come into play.\n\n“Dad is dedicated,” she said during her public radio interview from San Francisco. “We’re going to have some real issues if we don’t win the House and Senate. I mean, it’s over, right? It’s over in the sense of what’s to come. Our rights. Mental health care. All of it.”\n\nOn the dais last week in Washington, answering the handful of questions with responses that went on for several minutes, Biden sounded almost like a certain politician.\n\n“I believe we can come to the same results, we can work together, but I think it’s the how we kind of go about it. I’m not saying to not scream from the mountaintops of injustice, but I also think if we really want, I mean, you have to work with the other side,” she said.\n\nBiden said she was sorry to the interviewer, and the audience, for her lengthy answers.\n\n“So, really long-winded. I apologize,” she added. “This is why they don’t let me do interviews.”", "authors": ["Kate Bennett"], "publish_date": "2022/11/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/02/07/biden-state-of-the-union-sotu-address-updates/11204405002/", "title": "State of the Union 2023 address recap: Biden lays out ambitious ...", "text": "WASHINGTON, D.C — President Joe Biden took credit Tuesday for what he said was the country's economic revival while pushing an agenda of reducing prescription drug costs, protecting abortion rights and banning assault weapons.\n\nThe economy was reeling two years ago, Biden said in his second State of the Union address delivered in a packed House chamber.

Turn more cancers from death sentences to treatable diseases. Provide more support for patients and their families.” The issue is also deeply personal to Biden, as one of his sons, Beau Biden, passed away due to brain cancer. “It’s personal to so many of us.”\n\nBiden also singled out Maurice and Kandice Barron, a pair of guests invited by First Lady Jill Biden. Their daughter, Ava Barron, was diagnosed with a form of kidney cancer when she was one year old. “She turns four next month,” Biden said to wide cheers from the audience. “They just found out Ava’s beating the odds and is on her way to being cured from cancer.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nCancer treatment:New cancer therapy takes personalized medicine to a new level\n\nBiden says US stood up to China\n\nFacing Republicans who’ve accused him of being too soft on China, Biden said he responded clearly last week when a Chinese surveillance balloon floated over the United States.\n\nChina knows that if U.S. sovereignty is threatened, Americans will act to protect the country.\n\n“And we did,” Biden said, an apparent reference to his decision to shoot down the balloon.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nChinese spy balloon:Chinese spy balloon went over other US missile and nuclear weapons sites, lawmaker says\n\nBiden: Stop production, trafficking of fentanyl\n\nCiting Americans’ growing dependence on prescription drugs, Biden called for a major campaign to stop the production, sale and trafficking of fentanyl.\n\nBiden noted that fentanyl is killing more than 70,000 Americans a year.

Among them: expanding access to preschool and raising teacher pay.\n\nIn 2021, teachers made less than 77 cents on the dollar compared with other college graduates. Yet surveys show teachers work more than 50 hours a week on average. Close to 1 in 5 work elsewhere at another job. It's no surprise that nearly half of U.S. schools are short teachers. Some states and districts have proposed or enacted pay bumps but they've been modest at best.\n\nFederal legislation again before Congress this session would set a teacher salary floor of $60,000. While raising teacher pay has garnered the support of some Republicans, the American Teacher Act is unlikely to get far.

It’s time we do the same as well,” Biden said. “Ban assault weapons once and for all.”\n\nMass shootings typically lead lawmakers to call for such actions but it’s unlikely that a ban will pass in a divided Congress with many Republican lawmakers who have vowed that they will not waver on gun control.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\n'Still too high':Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin orders independent panel to study military suicide\n\nMarjorie Taylor Greene yells at Biden multiple times\n\nRep.

This year it will go back to $2,000 for qualifying children of all ages.\n\nIn his remarks, Biden vowed to “restore the full Child Tax Credit which gave tens of millions of parents some breathing room and cut child poverty in half, to the lowest level in history.”\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nChild tax credit this year:How much is the Child Tax Credit for 2023?

The deficit’s cut was partly a result of higher tax revenues that Biden touted but also the end of spending related to the pandemic.\n\nBiden also took a jab at former President Donald Trump for increases in the federal deficit under Trump’s administration. “Under the previous administration, the American deficit went up four years in a row,” Biden said, to boos and jeers from Republican lawmakers.\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhat happens if the US hits the debt ceiling?:Here's what to expect if we reach debt limit.\n\nBiden says Republicans want to ‘take the economy hostage’ in debt ceiling talks\n\nBiden accused Republicans of wanting to “take the economy hostage” unless he agrees to their demands for spending cuts during debt ceiling talks.\n\nBiden demanded Republicans show “what their plans are.” House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has not specified what Republicans want axed.\n\n“Some Republicans want Medicare and Social Security to sunset every five years,” Biden said, prompting loud boos from Republicans in Congress.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nMedicare and debt ceiling fight:How Medicare and Social Security benefits factor into the Kevin McCarthy debt ceiling fight\n\nBiden defends Inflation Reduction Act\n\nPresident Biden touted the Inflation Reduction Act which he signed into law, saying he was taking on powerful interest to bring health care costs down.\n\n“You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on earth,” he said. “Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars – and making record profits.”\n\nHaving capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare, Biden said it was time to help Americans not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives. “Let’s cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it,” he said.

Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich.\n\nHe also had plenty of jeers from the Republican side of the chamber when he slammed former President Donald Trump’s fiscal record and accused the House GOP of trying to cut Social Security and Medicare. The latter attracted loud boos.\n\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., stood up and yelled, “Liar!” from the back of the chamber.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nTalkative Biden:On average, Biden is most talkative president in six decades of State of Union addresses\n\nBiden repeats call for ‘billionaire’s tax’\n\nBiden used his speech to call again for Congress to pass a so-called “billionaire’s tax,” saying some of the biggest corporations in the country are raking in billions of dollars in profits but paying no federal income taxes.\n\n“That’s simply not fair,” he said.\n\nBiden did not spell out the specifics of his proposal. But in the past, he has called for a 20% levy on households with a net worth of more than $100 million.\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nWhat are the tax brackets?:What are the 2022 US federal tax brackets? What are the new 2023 tax brackets? Answers here\n\nBiden calls climate crisis ‘an existential threat’\n\nBiden said “the climate crisis doesn't care if you're in a red or blue state” as he touted his administration’s work to take on what he called “an existential threat.”\n\nHe pointed to the Inflation Reduction Act, which included the largest climate package ever, and investments from his infrastructure law.\n\nHe later went off-script, saying, “We’re still going to need oil and gas for a while.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nUN Secretary-General::'No more baby steps' on climate change\n\nBiden to Congress: Continue insurance subsidies that lowered uninsured rates\n\nBiden celebrated the fact that a record number of Americans have health insurance while calling on Congress to continue expanded insurance subsidies that helped boost that rate.\n\nThose enhanced subsidies for people who purchase insurance on their own, instead of getting coverage from the government or an employer, expire after 2025.\n\n“Let’s finish the job and make the savings permanent,” Biden said as he also called for extending expanded Medicaid coverage to all states.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nBiden takes made in America a step further\n\nBiden touted American manufacturing gains and a campaign promise to move more production to the U.S. from foreign countries. Biden then announced, “new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.”\n\n“American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables,” he said. “And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.”\n\nBiden’s message echoes former President Donald Trump’s prior State of the Union addresses where he boasted about initiatives to bring back manufacturing jobs that have been lost over the years.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nInsulin costs:Medicare caps insulin costs at $35 a month. Can Biden get that price for all Americans?\n\nBiden touts legislative victories in infrastructure and manufacturing\n\nBiden championed his series of legislative victories that ranged from tackling the country’s supply chain shortage and sweeping investments in domestic manufacturing and infrastructure.\n\n“We’re gonna make sure the supply chain for America begins in America,” Biden said, touting a bipartisan bill he signed that made investments to boost domestic manufacturing of semiconductors.\n\n“To maintain the strongest economy in the world, we need the best infrastructure in the world,” said Biden, pointing to the bipartisan infrastructure bill. “Folks, we’re just getting started.”\n\n– Ken Tran\n\nWhy Bono is at SOTU:Here's why musician, advocate Bono is at Biden's State of the Union address\n\nBiden appeals to middle and working class people on manufacturing\n\nIn an appeal to middle class and working class people, Biden said he ran for president “to make sure the economy works for everyone” so that everyone can have pride in what they do for a living.\n\n“For decades, the middle class was hollowed out,” he said. “Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down. Once-thriving cities and towns that many of you represent became shadows of what they used to be.”\n\nBiden then spoke about his administration’s accomplishments in the manufacturing sector.\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhat is fentanyl poisoning?:These State of the Union guests lost their son to it\n\nMore:As Biden prepares 2024 reelection run, Dems worry blue-collar voters are slipping away\n\nBiden: ‘COVID no longer controls our lives’\n\nBiden said the nation’s economy is roaring back from the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n“Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much,” he said. “Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.”\n\nBiden said his administration has created 12 million jobs, “more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nA full House – literally – for State of the Union\n\nPresident Joe Biden entered a full House chamber Tuesday.\n\nThe capacity crowd included House and Senate members, current and former Supreme Court justices, family and honored guests.\n\nBiden’s first words were met with a standing ovation, as he honored Republican and Democratic leaders – but also as he described the state of the union.\n\nThe applause came from Democrats and Republicans, and the standing ovations were sometimes led by a row of powerful Senate moderates, including Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Kyrsten Sinema, who recently changed her party affiliation to independent.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nBiden: Pelosi is 'greatest speaker’ ever\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t sitting behind Biden for his address but she got a special call-out from the president anyway.\n\n“I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest speaker in the history of the House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi,” Biden said.\n\nPelosi stepped down from Democratic leadership after the midterm elections.

Toxic fumes, medical risks explained.\n\nBiden begins speech telling McCarthy he looks forward to ‘working together’\n\nBiden began his remarks congratulating Kevin McCarthy, the new Republican House speaker, and saying he looks forward to “working together.”\n\nBiden also congratulated Democratic Leader Hakeem Jefferies, the first African American man to lead a party, and gave shout outs to Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.\n\n“The story of America is a story of progress and resilience.

But they do have something in common.

That closely matches the FiveThirtyEight average of polls.\n\nBiden’s job performance has stayed below since August 2021 in most polls. Even more troubling for Biden, most Americans can’t identify his achievements. Sixty-two percent of Americans said Biden has accomplished \"not very much\" or “little or nothing,\" in the same Washington Post-ABC News poll, while only 36% said he has accomplished \"a great deal\" or \"a good amount.\"\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nWhat to watch for:The State of the Union is Tuesday: Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris chats with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ahead of speech\n\nVice President Kamala Harris shook hands with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and the two chatted, as they stood behind the rostrum waiting for Biden to enter the House chamber.\n\nThis will be the first State of the Union with McCarthy as speaker since Republicans took control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden heads to the Capitol\n\nBiden left the White House at 8:30 p.m. en route to the Capitol. Vice President Kamala Harris arrived ahead of him along with the majority of his Cabinet.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nPaul Pelosi arrives at State of the Union\n\nPaul Pelosi, the 82-year-old husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, arrived at the State of the Union about 8:30 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nThis marks his first visit to a joint session of Congress since a video release of a brutal October attack that left him with head and hand injuries requiring surgery.\n\n– Candy Woodall\n\nLawmakers arrive for State of the Union\n\nIf handshakes across the aisle are any reliable indication, there was a hint of bipartisanship in the air as lawmakers arrived for President Joe Biden’s first State of the Union before a divided Congress.\n\nThere was also the smell of cigars in the House gallery hallways on the third floor, a sign of the changing guard and new House rules.\n\nSeveral guests and congresswomen were wearing white, as a nod to the suffragettes. That included Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who despite earlier posts did not bring a white balloon into the chamber to troll Biden about what she describes as a delayed response in taking down the Chinese spy balloon.\n\n- Candy Woodall\n\nBiden traveling to Wisconsin and Florida after speech\n\nBiden administration officials will hit the road this week, holding events in at least 20 states to highlight parts of the president’s message.\n\nBiden himself will talk about his economic agenda in Wisconsin Wednesday and will discuss Social Security and Medicare in Florida Thursday.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris is heading to Georgia and Minnesota. Multiple other cabinet members are also fanning out across the country.\n\n- Maureen Groppe\n\nHow would Biden’s billionaire tax work?\n\nTonight Biden will resurface his plan to levy more taxes on the ultra-wealthy. But how would that work?\n\nUnder the current tax system, you don’t have to pay taxes on assets like stocks, homes and artwork that can appreciate over time until you sell it. But if you hold onto them until you die, you won’t have to pay any taxes. And on top of that, heirs that inherit your assets won’t have to pay taxes if they sell them.\n\nThe Biden Administration refers to this as a tax loophole, as billionaires benefit the most since they’re more likely than working-class Americans to get compensated via stocks or other assets that appreciate over time or inherit them.\n\nTo end the practice, Biden is proposing “minimum income tax” on American households worth more than $100 million. His plan calls for the wealthiest Americans to pay a tax rate of at least 20% on their full income, including unrealized gains from assets that have increased in value since their purchase.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nTaxing billionaires:Should the wealthy pay taxes on expensive art and wine? Joe Biden thinks so. Here's how it would work\n\nOcasio-Cortez lays out expectations for Biden’s speech, working with Republicans\n\nAhead of Biden’s address, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D.-N.Y., said she’s hoping to “hear a really strong vision” from Biden and explained how Democrats and Republicans could find common ground after the GOP gained control of the House during the midterm elections.\n\nThe New York lawmaker told CNN she hopes to hear “about not just what we've done so far, but also our plans on executing on the enormous bills and successes that we've had in the last one to two years,\" saying “There still is implementation and execution on these plans to address our priorities around climate, taxing the rich and so much more.”\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nBiden's 'finish the job' call in State of the Union echoes FDR\n\nHistorian Michael Beschloss hears echoes of Franklin D. Roosevelt in Biden’s State of the Union address.\n\nBiden will call on Republicans to work with him to “finish the job” of rebuilding the economy and uniting the country, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Finish the job” was used as a rationale for FDR's reelection, Beschloss tweeted about the phrase’s historical lineage. It was also a slogan for the World War I effort. And in a famous radio address during World War II, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill vowed to “finish the job.”\n\nAt the start of Biden’s administration, many comparisons – not all of them favorable – were made between the size and scope of Biden’s ambitions, Roosevelt’s programs and the World War II spending that lifted the nation out of the Great Depression.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders: Biden is more interested in 'woke fantasies' than concerns of everyday Americans\n\nIn delivering the Republican response to the State of the Union, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sander plans to attack Biden and the Democrats over a panoply of issues that include inflation, taxes, education and so-called \"culture wars.\"\n\n\"And while you reap the consequences of their failures, the Biden administration seems more interested in woke fantasies than the hard reality Americans face every day,\" Sanders plans to say, according to speech excerpts released by her office.\n\nAnother excerpt: \"Most Americans simply want to live their lives in freedom and peace, but we are under attack in a left-wing culture war we didn’t start and never wanted to fight.\"\n\n– David Jackson\n\nState of the Union guests:Lawmakers highlight policing, abortion, wrongful imprisonment\n\nHow long does the State of the Union last? What it will take for Biden to set a SOTU record\n\nBiden’s first State of the Union address in 2022 was somewhere between the longest and shortest speeches ever given, according to The American Presidency Project. Will he keep his second address tonight short and sweet, or will he be long-winded?\n\nIf he intendeds to break the record for the shortest speech ever, he’d have it keep it under 28 minutes and 55 seconds. That was the time Richard Nixon took to deliver his address in 1972. To beat the longest address ever, he’d have to outdo his fellow Democrat former President Bill Clinton, who went on for 1 hour, 28 minutes and 40 seconds for his final State of the Union speech in 2000. Clinton also claims the spot for the second longest address, clocking in at 1 hour, 24 minutes and 58 seconds in 1995.\n\n– Swapna Venugopal Ramaswamy\n\nBiden to promise investment in ‘places and people that have been forgotten’\n\nBiden will spend part of his address promoting his economic plan and assuring Americans that he wants to invest in “places and people that have been forgotten.”\n\nAmid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they’re invisible, he will say, according to excerpts of the speech released by the White House.\n\n“Maybe that’s you watching at home,” Biden will say. “You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away. I get it. That’s why we’re building an economy where no one is left behind. Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.”\n\n– Michael Collins\n\nBiden to praise recovery from Jan. 6 riot, COVID\n\nPresident Joe Biden will say “the story of America is a story of progress and resilience” in his State of the Union address as he touts a rebounding economy, COVID-19 recovery and democracy that survived the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol attack, according to excerpts of the speech provided by the White House.\n\nBiden will tout 12 million new jobs created under his presidency – many that came back following the pandemic – to claim economic progress. And he will reflect on a period two years ago when businesses and schools closed at the height of the pandemic.\n\n“Today, COVID no longer controls our lives,” Biden plans to say. “And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War. Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.”\n\n– Joey Garrison\n\nBiden to ask Republicans to work with him in SOTU speech\n\nPresident Joe Biden will make a plea to Republicans in Congress to work with him. He said after the November elections that Americans sent a divided Congress to Washington because they want them to work together.\n\n“The people sent us a clear message,” Biden will say, according to excerpts released from the White House. “Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.”\n\n– Erin Mansfield\n\nWhy Sen. Patty Murray and other lawmakers will be wearing crayons at State of the Union\n\nWashington Sen. Patty Murray and some of her Democratic colleagues will be wearing crayon pins to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address Tuesday to signal their support for greater investments in child care. Such care now costs more than $10,000 a year on average, and roughly half of Americans live in a child care desert. Insufficient child care takes a toll on America's economy, recent research shows, costing taxpayers $122 billion annually.\n\nPartisan gridlock has prevented progress on major child care reforms, such as Murray's Child Care for Working Families Act, which would generally cap child care expenses at 7% of a family's household income. Biden, who alluded to that cap in his last State of the Union, has also struggled to gain traction on his child care proposals.\n\n– Alia Wong\n\nLawmakers to highlight key social issues through guests\n\nTuesday night’s State of the Union address will be the first year since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic where lawmakers are allowed to bring their own guests. As part of tradition, lawmakers tend to invite guests that draw attention to issues important to them.\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have invited guests to champion abortion access such as Roslyn Roger Collins, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Metropolitan New Jersey, who will attend the address alongside Rep. Bob Mendendez, D-N.J., according to Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the brutal beating and subsequent death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee, members of the Congressional Black Caucus are bringing guests who have been impacted by police violence. House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has invited Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who died at the hands of a New York police officer in 2014.\n\n– Christine Fernando and Ken Tran\n\nRepublican response: Sarah Huckabee Sanders follows in historic footsteps with her State of the Union response\n\nArkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the first former White House press secretary to deliver a formal State of the Union response – she is not, however, the first governor of Arkansas to do the honors.\n\nBack in 1985, the Democrats picked a young governor of Arkansas to deliver their response to President Ronald Reagan.\n\nHis name? Bill Clinton ... then-future President Bill Clinton.\n\nSanders will give the Republican rebuttal after Biden's speech.\n\n– David Jackson\n\n5 big questions for the SOTU:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden and China: Spy balloon likely to be addressed\n\nThe speech is a chance for Biden to respond to those who have criticized how he handled the suspected Chinese spy balloon that drifted over the United States last week – and to send a public message to China. Republicans have accused Biden of showing weakness by not shooting down the balloon sooner.\n\nTensions have been rising with China, which the U.S. considers its biggest strategic and economic competitor. The nations have clashed over Taiwan, technology, human rights, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and other disputes.\n\nThe Biden administration has been trying to stabilize the relationship, building what it’s called “guardrails” as it normalizes interaction. But one effort to do that – sending Secretary of State Antony Blinken to China – was postponed because of the balloon incident.\n\n– Maureen Groppe and Michael Collins\n\nIntel chair: China balloon flew over nuke sites\n\nBiden to lay out 'forceful approach’ to combatting fentanyl\n\nThe Biden administration will launch a national campaign to educate young people on the dangers of fentanyl, part of the “forceful approach” for going after fentanyl trafficking and reducing overdose deaths.\n\nOther steps include:\n\nUsing new large-scale scanners to improve efforts to stop fentanyl from being brought into the U.S. through the southern border.\n\nWorking with package delivery companies to catch more packages containing fentanyl from being shipped around the country.\n\nWorking with Congress to make permanent a temporary tool that that’s helped federal agents crack down on drugs chemically similar to fentanyl.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\n5 big questions on Biden's speech:Is he running? 5 big questions Joe Biden will answer in the State of the Union\n\nBiden to plug job market as recession looms\n\nPresident Joe Biden is expected to take credit for a booming job market and easing inflation when he speaks to the nation Tuesday night.\n\nBut he’ll likely leave out a litany of trouble spots, including a slumping housing market, a monthslong manufacturing downturn and elevated recession risk this year. Meanwhile, inflation is still high and economists pin at least some of the blame on Biden for showering Americans with cash in early 2021 while the economy was already healing.\n\n– Paul Davidson\n\nState of the economy:A look at economy's strengths, weaknesses as Biden sets to boast of record job growth in State of Union\n\nWho is Sarah Huckabee Sanders? Arkansas governor to giver Republican response to Biden's State of the Union address\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, one-time White House press secretary for former President Trump and current governor of Arkansas, will deliver the Republican rebuttal to Biden’s State of the Union address tonight.\n\nSanders, the youngest governor in the U.S., hails from a prominent political family. Her father Mike Huckabee was the 44th governor of Arkansas, serving from 1996 to 2007 before launching an unsuccessful presidential bid during the 2008 election. The younger Sanders has since cut out her own place in GOP politics, emerging as one of the more high-profile members of the Trump administration.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nBono, Tyre Nichols’ family members among guests sitting with first lady Jill Biden Tuesday night\n\nThe lead singer for the rock group U2, Bono, and Ukraine’s ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, are among the White House guests attending President Joe Biden’s State of the Union address Tuesday.\n\nGuests are chosen to highlight themes of the president’s speech or because they represent his policy initiatives.\n\nBono is the cofounder of the ONE campaign to fight poverty and preventable diseases, and (RED), which fights HIV/AIDS in Africa. Other guests who will be sitting with first lady Jill Biden during the speech include:\n\nThe mother and stepfather of Tyre Nichols, the 29-year-old Black man who died after being beaten by Memphis police officers.\n\nBrandon Tsay, the man who disarmed the Monterey Park gunman who killed 11 people and injured 10 others during a Lunar New Year celebration.\n\nA Texas woman who almost died because doctors were concerned that intervening when her pregnancy ran into difficulties would violate the state’s abortion ban.\n\nOne of the Massachusetts same-sex couples who sued the state for the right to marry in 2001.\n\n– Maureen Groppe\n\nWhat to expect from tonight's speech:Here's what you can expect from Joe Biden's speech\n\nBiden's speech comes amid job gains\n\nOne accomplishment Biden is sure to bring up tonight is the level of job gains under his presidency. Since he took office the unemployment rate went from 6.3% to 3.4%, per the latest jobs data.\n\nDespite recession fears and massive tech layoffs, U.S. employers added 517,000 new jobs last month, well exceeding economists' expectations of around 180,000 new jobs.\n\nThe blowout jobs report paved the way for the Federal Reserve to pass more rate hikes aimed at lowering inflation, Fed Chairman Powell said in remarks he delivered earlier today. But the rate hikes could push the economy closer to a recession, which the central bank has avoided so far.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nBiden’s student loan forgiveness plan remains stalled\n\nBiden has yet to fulfill his campaign promise of canceling at least $10,000 in student loan debt. Last year he unveiled a plan to make good on his promise.\n\nHowever the plan is being stalled by legal challenges. Six states – Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Iowa, Kansas and South Carolina – formed a coalition to fight the proposal. They argue that canceling student loan debt extends beyond the administration’s legal authority.\n\nThe Supreme Court is set to hear arguments for the case later this month. The Biden administration claims it is well within their legal realm to proceed with its plan. It cannot do so unless the Court rules in its favor, however.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nStock market under Biden\n\nSince President Joe Biden took office in January 2021, the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 10%. Last year the index fell into a bear market, meaning it dropped 20% below a market peak set last January.\n\nDuring former President Donald Trump's time in office, the Dow gained 56%. That represents an annualized gain of close to 12%, one of the best stock market performances under a Republican president according to data from LPL Financial.\n\n– Elisabeth Buchwald\n\nWhat time is the State of the Union speech tonight?\n\nBiden’s State of the Union speech is Tuesday at 9 p.m. EST.\n\nHow to stream the SOTU\n\nThe speech will be livestreamed by USA TODAY.\n\nWho is the designated survivor tonight?\n\nThe State of the Union address, delivered to a joint session of Congress and a crowd that includes all nine Supreme Court justices, poses a unique scenario in which every key member of the nation’s leadership is in one room.\n\nThat makes it both a momentous affair, and a significant national security risk. For this reason, each year one member of the president’s Cabinet dubbed the \"designated survivor\" hangs back.\n\nThe practice dates back to the Cold War, during which fears of a Soviet Nuclear attack abounded and a fresh urgency surrounded protocols for the order of presidential succession. The designated survivor for 2023 has not yet been announced, but heads of the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Energy have most frequently been chosen.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat channel is the State of the Union on?\n\nThe major TV networks and other news outlets, such as Fox News, MSNBC, CNN and PBS, are providing live coverage of the address.\n\nWhat is the State of the Union address?\n\nThe State of the Union address isn’t just a tradition in the nation’s capital. It's rooted in the Constitution.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution says the president shall “from time to time give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union.\"\n\nThat doesn’t mean the president has to give a speech – as they often do today.\n\n\"From that very general mandate in the Constitution has evolved into what we recognize today as a yearly event, with lots of pomp and circumstance,\" Claire Jerry, a curator of political history at the National Museum of American History, told USA TODAY.\n\n– Marina Pitofsky\n\nWhen did the annual message become known as State of the Union address?\n\nFrom 1790 to 1946, the speech delivered by the president to Congress was known simply as the \"Annual Message.\"\n\nIn 1947 is became the ‘State of the Union’ and has since been referred to by that name.\n\n– Anna Kaufman\n\nWhat is the origin of the state of the union address?\n\nArticle II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution states that the president will “give to the Congress Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient.”\n\nThis language birthed the practice, allowing the executive to deliver to a joint session of Congress and the American people.\n\nIn the modern era, the speech has become a vehicle for administrations to roll out their policy priorities for the coming year and spotlight key agenda issues.\n\n– Anna Kaufman", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/02/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/04/28/joe-bidens-speech-congress-read-full-transcript/4883244001/", "title": "Read the full transcript from President Joe Biden's address to a joint ...", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nWednesday night, approaching his 100th day in office, President Joe Biden addresses the joint session of Congress for the first time. The full text of his prepared speech below was released by the White House.\n\nMadame Speaker. Madame Vice President. No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it’s about time.\n\nThe First Lady. The Second Gentleman. Mr. Chief Justice. Members of the United States Congress and the Cabinet – and distinguished guests.\n\nMy fellow Americans,\n\nWhile the setting tonight is familiar, this gathering is very different – a reminder of the extraordinary times we are in. Throughout our history, Presidents have come to this chamber to speak to the Congress, to the nation, and to the world.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nTo declare war. To celebrate peace. To announce new plans and possibilities.\n\nTonight, I come to talk about crisis — and opportunity. About rebuilding our nation — and revitalizing our democracy. And winning the future for America.\n\nAs I stand here tonight — just one day shy of the 100th day of my administration. 100 days since I took the oath of office, lifted my hand off our family Bible, and inherited a nation in crisis.\n\nThe worst pandemic in a century. The worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. The worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.\n\nNow, after just 100 days, I can report to the nation: America is on the move again. Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength.\n\nLife can knock us down. But in America, we never stay down. In America, we always get up. And today, that’s what we’re doing: America is rising anew. Choosing hope over fear. Truth over lies. Light over darkness.\n\nAfter 100 Days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff. We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America.\n\n100 days ago, America’s house was on fire. We had to act. And thanks to the extraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Schumer – and with the overwhelming support of the American people – Democrats, Independents, and Republicans – we did act.\n\nTogether — we passed the American Rescue Plan. One of the most consequential rescue packages in American history. We’re already seeing the results.\n\nAfter I promised 100 million COVID-19 vaccine shots in 100 days – we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in 100 days. We’re marshalling every federal resource. We’ve gotten the vaccine to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 community health centers. We’re setting up community vaccination sites, and are deploying mobile units into hard-to-reach areas.\n\nToday, 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over the age of 16, everyone – is now eligible and can get vaccinated right away. So get vaccinated now.\n\nWhen I was sworn in, less than 1% of seniors were fully vaccinated against COVID-19. 100 days later, nearly 70% of seniors are fully protected. Senior deaths from COVID-19 are down 80% since January. Down 80%. And, more than half of all adults in America have gotten at least one shot.\n\nAt a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked a nurse what it’s like. She looked and said every shot feels like a dose of hope. A dose of hope for the educator in Florida who has a child who suffers from an auto-immune disease. She wrote to me that she was worried about bringing the virus home. When she got vaccinated, she sat in her car and just cried. Cried out of joy, cried out of relief.\n\nParents are seeing smiles on their kids’ faces as they go back to school because teachers and school bus drivers, cafeteria workers have been vaccinated. Grandparents hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing their hands against a window to say goodbye. It means everything to both of them.\n\nThere’s still more work to do to beat this virus. We can’t let our guard down now. But tonight, I can say because of you — the American people – our progress these past 100 days against one of the worst pandemics in history is one of the greatest logistical achievements our country has ever seen.\n\nWhat else have we done these first 100 days? We kept our commitment and we are sending $1,400 rescue checks to 85% of all American households. We’ve already sent more than 160 million checks out the door. It’s making a difference. For many people, it’s making all the difference in the world.\n\nA single mom in Texas wrote to me. She said when she couldn’t work, this relief check put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction. A grandmother in Virginia told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor — something she put off for months because she didn’t have the money.\n\nOne of the defining images of this crisis has been cars lined up for miles waiting for a box of food to be put in the trunk. Did you ever think you’d see that in America? That’s why the American Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of Americans facing hunger – and hunger is down sharply already.\n\nWe’re also providing: Rental assistance to keep people from being evicted from their homes. Providing loans to keep small businesses open and their employees on the job.\n\nDuring these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act because I established a special sign up period to do that. We’re making one of the largest one-time investments ever in improving health care for veterans. Critical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we are on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year.\n\nIn the process, the economy created more than 1.3 million new jobs in 100 days. More new jobs in the first 100 days than any president on record. The International Monetary Fund is now estimating our economy will grow at a rate of more than 6% this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four decades. America is moving. Moving forward. And we can’t stop now.\n\nWe’re in a competition with China and other countries to win the 21st Century. We have to do more than just build back. We have to build back better.\n\nThroughout our history, public investments and infrastructure have transformed America. The transcontinental railroad and interstate highways united two oceans and brought us into a totally new age of progress. Universal public school and college aid opened wide the doors of opportunity. Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon and now to Mars, discovered vaccines, and gave us the Internet and so much more.\n\nThese are the investments we make together, as one country, and that only government can make. Time and again, they propel us into the future. That’s why I proposed The American Jobs Plan — a once-in-a-generation investment in America itself. The largest jobs plan since World War II.\n\nIt creates jobs to upgrade our transportation infrastructure. Jobs modernizing roads, bridges and highways. Jobs building ports and airports, rail corridors and transit lines. It’s clean water.\n\nToday, up to 10 million homes and more than 400,000 schools and child care centers have pipes with lead in them, including for drinking water. A clear and present danger to our children’s health.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100% of the nation’s lead pipes and service lines so every American, so every child – can turn on the faucet and be certain to drink clean water. It creates jobs connecting every American with high-speed internet, including 35% of rural Americans who still don’t have it. This will help our kids and businesses succeed in a 21st Century economy. And I am asking the Vice President to help lead this effort.\n\nIt creates jobs by building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, and catastrophic failures – with tragic results as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during winter storms.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan will create jobs to lay thousands of miles of transmission lines needed to build a resilient and fully clean grid. The American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and their careers.\n\n2 million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic, too often because they couldn’t get the care they need for their family, their children. 800,000 families are on a Medicaid waiting list right now to get homecare for their aging parent or loved one with a disability. This plan will help these families and create jobs for our caregivers with better wages and better benefits.\n\nFor too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis. Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think about climate change, I think jobs.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more energy efficient buildings and homes. Electrical workers installing 500,000 charging stations along our highways. Farmers planting cover crops, so they can reduce carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it.\n\nThere’s no reason the blades for wind turbines can’t be built in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason why American workers can’t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan will create millions of good paying jobs – jobs Americans can raise their families on. And all the investments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: “Buy American.” American tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in America that create American jobs. The way it should be.\n\nNow – I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. You feel left behind and forgotten in an economy that’s rapidly changing. Let me speak directly to you.\n\nIndependent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions of dollars in economic growth for years to come. These are good-paying jobs that can’t be outsourced. Nearly 90% of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require a college degree. 75% do not require an associate’s degree.\n\nThe American Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America. And, it recognizes something I’ve always said. Wall Street didn’t build this country. The middle class built this country. And unions build the middle class. And that’s why I’m calling on Congress to pass the Protecting the Right to Organize Act – the PRO Act — and send it to my desk to support the right to unionize.\n\nBy the way – let’s also pass the $15 minimum wage. No one should work 40 hours a week and still live below the poverty line. And we need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. Let’s get the Paycheck Fairness Act to my desk for equal pay. It’s long past time.\n\nFinally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in non-defense research and development on record. We will see more technological change in the next 10 years – than we saw in the last 50 years. And we’re falling behind in that competition.\n\nDecades ago we used to invest 2% of our GDP on research and development. Today, we spend less than 1%. China and other countries are closing in fast. We have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, biotechnology, computer chips, and clean energy.\n\nThe Defense Department has an agency called DARPA – the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency – that’s there to develop breakthroughs to enhance our national security – which led to the internet and GPS and so much more. The National Institutes of Health, the NIH – should create a similar Advanced Research Projects Agency for health. To develop breakthroughs – to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer’s, diabetes, and cancer.\n\nThis is personal to so many of us. I can think of no more worthy investment. And I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. Let’s end cancer as we know it. It’s within our power.\n\nInvestments in jobs and infrastructure like the ones we’re talking about have often had bipartisan support. Vice President Harris and I meet regularly in the Oval Office with Democrats and Republicans to discuss the American Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican Senators who just put forward their proposal. So, let’s get to work.\n\nWe welcome ideas. But, the rest of the world isn’t waiting for us. Doing nothing is not an option. We can’t be so busy competing with each other that we forget the competition is with the rest of the world to win the 21st Century.\n\nTo win that competition for the future, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families – in our children. That’s why I’m introducing the American Families Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families today.\n\nFirst, access to a good education. When this nation made 12 years of public education universal in the last century, it made us the best-educated and best-prepared nation in the world. But the world is catching up. They are not waiting.\n\n12 years is no longer enough today to compete in the 21st Century. That’s why the American Families Plan guarantees four additional years of public education for every person in America – starting as early as we can. We add two years of universal high-quality pre-school for every 3- and 4- year-old in America.\n\nThe research shows that when a young child goes to school—not day care—they are far more likely to graduate from high school and go on to college. And then we add two years of free community college. And we will increase Pell Grants and investment in Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal colleges, and minority-serving institutions.\n\nJill is a community college professor who teaches today as First Lady. She has long said any country that out-educates us is going to outcompete us – and she’ll be leading this effort.\n\nSecond, the American Families plan will provide access to quality, affordable child care. We guarantee that low- to middle-income families will pay no more than 7% of their income for high-quality care for children up to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won’t have to spend a dime.\n\nThird, the American Families Plan will finally provide up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave. No one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and a loved one – a parent, spouse, or child.\n\nAnd fourth, the American Families Plan puts money directly into the pockets of millions of families. In March we expanded a tax credit for every child in a family. Up to a $3,000 Child Tax Credit for children over 6 — and $3,600 for children under 6.\n\nWith two parents, two kids, that’s up to $7,200 in your pocket to help take care of your family. This will help more than 65 million children and help cut child poverty in half this year. Together, let’s extend the Child Tax Credit at least through the end of 2025.\n\nThe American Rescue Plan lowered health care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy their coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Let’s make that provision permanent so their premiums don’t go back up.\n\nIn addition to my Families Plan, I will work with Congress to address – this year – other critical priorities for America’s families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions of Americans –protecting people with pre-existing conditions, protecting women’s health.\n\nAnd the pandemic has demonstrated how badly it is needed. Let’s lower deductibles for working families on the Affordable Care Act, and let’s lower prescription drug costs. We all know how outrageously expensive they are.\n\nIn fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices in the world right here in America – nearly three times as much as other countries. We can change that.\n\nLet’s do what we’ve always talked about. Let’s give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower prices for prescription drugs. That won’t just help people on Medicare – it will lower prescription drug costs for everyone.\n\nThe money we save can go to strengthen the Affordable Care Act – expand Medicare coverage and benefits – without costing taxpayers one additional penny. We’ve talked about it long enough – Democrats and Republicans. Let’s get it done this year.\n\nThis is all about a simple premise: Health care should be a right, not a privilege in America. So how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plans?\n\nI’ve made clear that we can do it without increasing deficits. Let’s start with what I will not do.\n\nI will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year. It’s time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1% of Americans to pay their fair share. Just pay their fair share.\n\nA recent study shows that 55 of the nation’s biggest corporations paid zero in federal income tax last year. No federal taxes on more than $40 billion in profits. A lot of companies evade taxes through tax havens from Switzerland to Bermuda to the Cayman Islands. And they benefit from tax loopholes and deductions that allow for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. That’s not right.\n\nWe’re going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share – and help pay for the public investments their businesses will benefit from. And, we’re going to reward work, not wealth.\n\nWe take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1% of Americans – those making $400,000 or more – back up to 39.6%. That’s where it was when George W. Bush became president.\n\nWe’re going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than $1 million a year pay a lower rate on their capital gains than working Americans pay on their work. This will only affect three tenths of 1% of all Americans. And the IRS will crack down on millionaires and billionaires who cheat on their taxes. That’s estimated to be billions of dollars.\n\nLook, I’m not out to punish anyone. But I will not add to the tax burden of the middle class of this country. They’re already paying enough. What I’ve proposed is fair. It’s fiscally responsible.\n\nIt raises the revenue to pay for the plans I’ve proposed that will create millions of jobs and grow the economy. When you hear someone say that they don’t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1% and on corporate America – ask them: whose taxes are you going to raise instead, and whose are you going to cut?\n\nLook at the big tax cut in 2017. It was supposed to pay for itself and generate vast economic growth. Instead it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a huge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.\n\nInstead of using the tax savings to raise wages and invest in research and development – it poured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their workers is now among the largest in history.\n\nAccording to one study, CEOs make 320 times what their average workers make. The pandemic has only made things worse.\n\n20 million Americans lost their jobs in the pandemic – working- and middle-class Americans. At the same time, the roughly 650 Billionaires in America saw their net worth increase by more than $1 Trillion. Let me say that again. Just 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 Trillion during this pandemic. They are now worth more than $4 Trillion.\n\nMy fellow Americans, trickle-down economics has never worked. It’s time to grow the economy from the bottom up and middle-out.\n\nA broad consensus of economists – left, right, center – agree that what I’m proposing will help create millions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest value investments we can make as a nation.\n\nI’ve often said that our greatest strength is the power of our example – not just the example of our power. And in my conversations with world leaders – many I’ve known for a long time – the comment I hear most often is: we see that America is back – but for how long?\n\nMy fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we are back, but that we are here to stay. And that we aren’t going it alone – we’re going to be leading with our allies.\n\nNo one nation can deal with all the crises of our time alone – from terrorism to nuclear proliferation to mass migration, cybersecurity, climate change – and as we’re experiencing now, pandemics. There’s no wall high enough to keep any virus away.\n\nAs our own vaccine supply grows to meet our needs – and we are meeting them – we will become an arsenal of vaccines for other countries – just as America was the arsenal of democracy in World War 2.\n\nThe climate crisis is not our fight alone, either. It’s a global fight. The United States accounts for less than 15% of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for 85%. That’s why – I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement on my first day in office. And I kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America, with all of the major economies of the world – from China and Russia to India and the European Union in my first 100 days.\n\nI wanted the world to see that there is consensus that we are at an inflection point in history. And the consensus is if we act, we can save the planet – and we can create millions of jobs and economic growth and opportunity to raise the standard of living for everyone in the world.\n\nThe investments I’ve proposed tonight also advance a foreign policy that benefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the global economy, including China.\n\nIn my discussion with President Xi, I told him that we welcome the competition – and that we are not looking for conflict. But I made absolutely clear that I will defend American interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and industries, like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technologies and intellectual property.\n\nI also told President Xi that we will maintain a strong military presence in the Indo—Pacific just as we do with NATO in Europe – not to start conflict – but to prevent conflict. And, I told him what I’ve said to many world leaders – that America won’t back away from our commitment to human rights and fundamental freedoms.\n\nNo responsible American president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated. A president has to represent the essence of our country. America is an idea – unique in the world. We are all created equal. It’s who we are. We cannot walk away from that principle.\n\nWith regard to Russia, I made very clear to President Putin that while we don’t seek escalation, their actions have consequences.\n\nI responded in a direct and proportionate way to Russia’s interference in our elections and cyber— attacks on our government and businesses – and they did both of those things and I did respond. But we can also cooperate when it’s in our mutual interests.\n\nAs we did when we extended the New START Treaty on nuclear arms – and as we’re working to do on the climate crisis. On Iran and North Korea’s nuclear programs that present a serious threat to America’s security and world security – we will be working closely with our allies to address the threats posed by both of these countries through diplomacy and stern deterrence.\n\nAnd American leadership means ending the forever war in Afghanistan. We have the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. And I’m the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have had a child serving in a warzone.\n\nToday we have service members serving in the same war as their parents once did. We have service members in Afghanistan who were not yet born on 9/11. War in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi—generational undertaking of nation—building.\n\nWe went to Afghanistan to get the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11. We delivered justice to Osama Bin Laden and we degraded the terrorist threat of al Qaeda in Afghanistan. After 20 years of American valor and sacrifice, it’s time to bring our troops home.\n\nEven as we do, we will maintain an over—the—horizon capability to suppress future threats to the homeland. But make no mistake – the terrorist threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan since 2001 and we will remain vigilant against threats to the United States, wherever they come from. Al Qaeda and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, and other places in Africa and the Middle East and beyond.\n\nAnd, we won’t ignore what our own intelligence agencies have determined – the most lethal terrorist threat to the homeland today is from white supremacist terrorism.\n\nAnd my fellow Americans, we must come together to heal the soul of this nation. It was nearly a year ago before her father’s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd’s young daughter. As I knelt down to talk to her so we could talk eye—to—eye, she said to me, “Daddy changed the world.”\n\nAfter the conviction of George Floyd’s murderer, we can see how right she was – if we have the courage to act. We have all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black America. Now is our opportunity to make real progress.\n\nMost men and women in uniform wear their badge and serve their communities honorably. I know them. I know they want to help meet this moment as well.\n\nMy fellow Americans, we have to come together. To rebuild trust between law enforcement and the people they serve. To root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system. And to enact police reform in George Floyd’s name that passed the House already. I know the Republicans have their own ideas and are engaged in productive discussions with Democrats.\n\nWe need to work together to find a consensus. Let’s get it done next month, by the first anniversary of George Floyd’s death. The country supports this reform. Congress should act.\n\nWe have a giant opportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe toward justice. Real justice. And with the plans I outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues American life in many other ways.\n\nA chance to deliver real equity. Good jobs and good schools. Affordable housing. Clean air and clean water. Being able to generate wealth and pass it down through generations. Real opportunities in the lives of more Americans – Black, white, Latino, Asian American, Native American.\n\nI also want to thank the Senate for voting 94—1 to pass the COVID—19 Hate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders from the vicious hate crimes we’ve seen this past year – and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk as soon as possible.\n\nI also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect the rights of LGBTQ Americans. To all the transgender Americans watching at home – especially the young people who are so brave – I want you to know that your president has your back.\n\nAnd another thing. Let’s reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law in this country for 27 years since I first wrote it. It will close the so—called “boyfriend” loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers.\n\nIt’s estimated that more than 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner – every month in America. Pass it and save lives.\n\nAnd I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is an epidemic in America. Our flag at the White House was still flying at half—staff for the 8 victims of the mass shooting in Georgia, when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado.\n\nIn the week between those mass shootings, more than 250 other Americans were shot dead. 250 shot dead. I know how hard it is to make progress on this issue.\n\nIn the 1990s, we passed universal background checks and a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds that can be fired in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined.\n\nBut in the early 2000’s, that law expired and we’ve seen the daily bloodshed since. More than two weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I know – the survivors and families who lost loved ones to gun violence – I laid out several steps the Department of Justice is taking to end this epidemic. One of them is banning so—called “ghost guns.”\n\nThey are homemade guns built from a kit that includes the directions on how to finish the firearm. The parts have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can't be traced. The buyers of ghost gun kits aren't required to pass a background check. Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist could buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a lethal weapon. But not anymore.\n\nI will do everything in my power to protect the American people from this epidemic of gun violence. But it’s time for Congress to act as well.\n\nWe need more Senate Republicans to join with the overwhelming majority of their Democratic colleagues, and close loopholes and require background checks to purchase a gun. And we need a ban on assault weapons and high—capacity magazines again. Don’t tell me it can’t be done. We’ve done it before … and it worked.\n\nTalk to most responsible gun owners, most hunters – they’ll tell you there’s no possible justification for having 100 rounds – 100 bullets – in a weapon. They will tell you that there are too many people today who are able to buy a gun, but who shouldn’t be able to. These kinds of reasonable reforms have the overwhelming support of the American people – including many gun owners. The country supports reform, and the Congress should act. This shouldn’t be a Red vs. Blue issue. It’s an American issue. And here’s what else we can do.\n\nImmigration has always been essential to America. Let’s end our exhausting war over immigration.\n\nFor more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform and done nothing about it. It’s time to fix it.\n\nOn day one of my Presidency, I kept my commitment and I sent a comprehensive immigration bill to Congress. If you believe we need a secure border – pass it. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship – pass it. If you actually want to solve the problem – I have sent you a bill, now pass it.\n\nWe also have to get at the root of the problem of why people are fleeing to our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador. The violence. The corruption. The gangs. The political instability. Hunger. Hurricanes. Earthquakes.\n\nWhen I was Vice President, I focused on providing the help needed to address these root causes of migration. It helped keep people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. Our plan worked. But the last administration shut it down.\n\nI’m restoring the program and asked Vice President Harris to lead our diplomatic efforts. I have absolute confidence she will get the job done.\n\nNow, if Congress won’t pass my plan – let’s at least pass what we agree on. Congress needs to pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for the Dreamers – the young people who have only known America as their home.\n\nAnd, permanent protections for immigrants on temporary protected status who come from countries beset by man—made and natural made violence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our tables.\n\nImmigrants have done so much for America during the pandemic – as they have throughout our history. The country supports immigration reform. Congress should act. And if we are to truly restore the soul of America – we need to protect the sacred right to vote.\n\nMore people voted in the last presidential election than ever before in our history – in the middle of one of the worst pandemics ever. That should be celebrated. Instead it’s being attacked.\n\nCongress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send them to my desk right away. The country supports it. Congress should act.\n\nAs we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this Capitol—desecrating our democracy—remain vivid in our minds. Lives were put at risk. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned.\n\nThe insurrection was an existential crisis—a test of whether our democracy could survive. It did. But the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is both ancient and urgent. As old as our Republic. Still vital today.\n\nCan our democracy deliver on its promise that all of us – created equal in the image of God – have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility? Can our democracy deliver on the most pressing needs of our people? Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate and fears that have pulled us apart?\n\nAmerica’s adversaries – the autocrats of the world – are betting it can’t. They believe we are too full of anger and division and rage. They look at the images of the mob that assaulted this Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. They are wrong. And we have to prove them wrong. We have to prove democracy still works. That our government still works – and can deliver for the people.\n\nIn our first 100 Days together, we have acted to restore the people’s faith in our democracy to deliver. We’re vaccinating the nation. We’re creating hundreds of thousands of jobs. We’re delivering real results people can see and feel in their own lives. Opening the doors of opportunity. Guaranteeing fairness and justice. That’s the essence of America. That’s democracy in action.\n\nOur Constitution opens with the words, “We the People”. It’s time we remembered that We the People are the government. You and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force we have no control over. It’s us. It’s “We the people.”\n\nIn another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us—In America: we do our part. That’s all I’m asking. That we all do our part. And if we do, then we will meet the central challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. The autocrats will not win the future. America will. The future will belong to America.\n\nI stand here tonight before you in a new and vital hour in the life of our democracy and our nation. And I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or more optimistic about America. We have stared into an abyss of insurrection and autocracy — of pandemic and pain — and “We the People” did not flinch.\n\nAt the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart and fail. We came together. United. With light and hope, we summoned new strength and new resolve. To position us to win the competition for the 21st Century. On our way forward to a Union more perfect. More prosperous. More just. As one people. One nation. One America.\n\nIt’s never been a good bet to bet against America. And it still isn’t. We are the United States of America. There is nothing – nothing – beyond our capacity – nothing we can’t do – if we do it together.\n\nMay God bless you all. May God protect our troops.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/04/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/03/07/state-of-the-union-2024-transcript/72890173007/", "title": "State of the Union Address 2024: Read the full text of Biden's speech", "text": "USA TODAY\n\nThe White House released the transcript to President Joe Biden's State of the Union address shortly after the speech started on Thursday night. Below is the full transcript of the address:\n\nThe United States Capitol\n\nGood evening.\n\nMr. Speaker. Madam Vice President. Members of Congress. My Fellow Americans.\n\nIn January 1941, President Franklin Roosevelt came to this chamber to speak to the nation.\n\nPrep for the polls: See who is running for president and compare where they stand on key issues in our Voter Guide\n\nHe said, “I address you at a moment unprecedented in the history of the Union.”\n\nHitler was on the march. War was raging in Europe.\n\nPresident Roosevelt’s purpose was to wake up the Congress and alert the American people that this was no ordinary moment.\n\nFreedom and democracy were under assault in the world.\n\nTonight I come to the same chamber to address the nation.\n\nNow it is we who face an unprecedented moment in the history of the Union.\n\nAnd yes, my purpose tonight is to both wake up this Congress, and alert the American people that this is no ordinary moment either.\n\nNot since President Lincoln and the Civil War have freedom and democracy been under assault here at home as they are today.\n\nWhat makes our moment rare is that freedom and democracy are under attack, both at home and overseas, at the very same time.\n\nOverseas, Putin of Russia is on the march, invading Ukraine and sowing chaos throughout Europe and beyond.\n\nIf anybody in this room thinks Putin will stop at Ukraine, I assure you, he will not.\n\nBut Ukraine can stop Putin if we stand with Ukraine and provide the weapons it needs to defend itself. That is all Ukraine is asking. They are not asking for American soldiers.\n\nIn fact, there are no American soldiers at war in Ukraine. And I am determined to keep it that way.\n\nBut now assistance for Ukraine is being blocked by those who want us to walk away from our leadership in the world.\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago when a Republican President, Ronald Reagan, thundered, “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.”\n\nNow, my predecessor, a former Republican President, tells Putin, “Do whatever the hell you want.”\n\nA former American President actually said that, bowing down to a Russian leader.\n\nIt’s outrageous. It’s dangerous. It’s unacceptable.\n\nAmerica is a founding member of NATO the military alliance of democratic nations created after World War II to prevent war and keep the peace.\n\nToday, we’ve made NATO stronger than ever.\n\nWe welcomed Finland to the Alliance last year, and just this morning, Sweden officially joined NATO, and their Prime Minister is here tonight.\n\nMr. Prime Minister, welcome to NATO, the strongest military alliance the world has ever known.\n\nI say this to Congress: we must stand up to Putin. Send me the Bipartisan National Security Bill.\n\nHistory is watching.\n\nIf the United States walks away now, it will put Ukraine at risk.\n\nMy message to President Putin is simple.\n\nWe will not walk away. We will not bow down. I will not bow down.\n\nHistory is watching, just like history watched three years ago on January 6th.\n\nInsurrectionists stormed this very Capitol and placed a dagger at the throat of American democracy.\n\nMany of you were here on that darkest of days.\n\nWe all saw with our own eyes these insurrectionists were not patriots.\n\nThey had come to stop the peaceful transfer of power and to overturn the will of the people.\n\nJanuary 6th and the lies about the 2020 election, and the plots to steal the election, posed the gravest threat to our democracy since the Civil War.\n\nBut they failed. America stood strong and democracy prevailed.\n\nBut we must be honest the threat remains and democracy must be defended.\n\nMy predecessor and some of you here seek to bury the truth of January 6th.\n\nI will not do that.\n\nThis is a moment to speak the truth and bury the lies.\n\nAnd here’s the simplest truth. You can’t love your country only when you win.\n\nAs I’ve done ever since being elected to office, I ask you all, without regard to party, to join together and defend our democracy!\n\nRemember your oath of office to defend against all threats foreign and domestic.\n\nRespect free and fair elections! Restore trust in our institutions! And make clear –political violence\n\nhas absolutely no place in America!\n\nHistory is watching.\n\nAnd history is watching another assault on freedom.\n\nJoining us tonight is Latorya Beasley, a social worker from Birmingham, Alabama. 14 months ago tonight, she and her husband welcomed a baby girl thanks to the miracle of IVF.\n\nShe scheduled treatments to have a second child, but the Alabama Supreme Court shut down IVF treatments across the state, unleashed by the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\nShe was told her dream would have to wait.\n\nWhat her family has gone through should never have happened. And unless Congress acts, it could happen again.\n\nSo tonight, let’s stand up for families like hers!\n\nTo my friends across the aisle, don’t keep families waiting any longer. Guarantee the right to IVF nationwide!\n\nLike most Americans, I believe Roe v. Wade got it right. And I thank Vice President Harris for being an incredible leader, defending reproductive freedom and so much more.\n\nBut my predecessor came to office determined\n\nto see Roe v. Wade overturned.\n\nHe’s the reason it was overturned. In fact, he brags about it.\n\nLook at the chaos that has resulted.\n\nJoining us tonight is Kate Cox, a wife and mother\n\nfrom Dallas.\n\nWhen she became pregnant again, the fetus had a fatal condition.\n\nHer doctors told Kate that her own life and her ability to have children in the future were at risk if she didn’t act.\n\nBecause Texas law banned abortion, Kate and her husband had to leave the state to get the care she needed.\n\nWhat her family has gone through should never have happened as well. But it is happening to so many others.\n\nThere are state laws banning the right to choose, criminalizing doctors, and forcing survivors of rape and incest to leave their states as well to get the care they need.\n\nMany of you in this Chamber and my predecessor are promising to pass a national ban on reproductive freedom.\n\nMy God, what freedoms will you take away next?\n\nIn its decision to overturn Roe v. Wade the Supreme Court majority wrote, “Women are not without –\n\nelectoral or political power.”\n\nNo kidding.\n\nClearly, those bragging about overturning Roe v. Wade have no clue about the power of women in America.\n\nThey found out though when reproductive freedom\n\nwas on the ballot and won in 2022, 2023, and they will find out again, in 2024.\n\nIf Americans send me a Congress that supports the right to choose, I promise you, I will restore Roe v. Wade as the law of the land again!\n\nAmerica cannot go back. I am here tonight to show the way forward. Because I know how far we’ve come.\n\nFour years ago next week, before I came to office, our country was hit by the worst pandemic and the worst economic crisis in a century.\n\nRemember the fear. Record job losses. Remember the spike in crime. And the murder rate.\n\nA raging virus that would take more than 1 million American lives and leave millions of loved ones behind.\n\nA mental health crisis of isolation and loneliness.\n\nA president, my predecessor, who failed the most basic duty. Any President owes the American people the duty to care.\n\nThat is unforgivable.\n\nI came to office determined to get us through one of the toughest periods in our nation’s history.\n\nAnd we have. It doesn’t make the news but in thousands of cities and towns the American people are writing the greatest comeback story never told.\n\nSo let’s tell that story here and now.\n\nAmerica’s comeback is building a future of American possibilities, building an economy from the middle out and the bottom up, not the top down, investing in all of America, in all Americans to make sure everyone has a fair shot and we leave no one behind!\n\nThe pandemic no longer controls our lives. The vaccines that saved us from COVID are now being used to help beat cancer.\n\nTurning setback into comeback.\n\nThat’s America!\n\nI inherited an economy that was on the brink. Now our economy is the envy of the world!\n\n15 million new jobs in just three years – that’s a record!\n\nUnemployment at 50-year lows.\n\nA record 16 million Americans are starting small businesses and each one is an act of hope.\n\nWith historic job growth and small business growth for Black, Hispanic, and Asian-Americans.\n\n800,000 new manufacturing jobs in America and counting.\n\nMore people have health insurance today than ever before.\n\nThe racial wealth gap is the smallest it’s been in 20 years.\n\nWages keep going up and inflation keeps coming down!\n\nInflation has dropped from 9% to 3% – the lowest in the world!\n\nAnd trending lower.\n\nAnd now instead of importing foreign products and exporting American jobs, we’re exporting American products and creating American jobs – right here in America where they belong!\n\nAnd the American people are beginning to feel it.\n\nConsumer studies show consumer confidence is soaring.\n\nBuy American has been the law of the land since the 1930s.\n\nPast administrations including my predecessor failed to Buy American.\n\nNot any more.\n\nOn my watch, federal projects like helping to build American roads bridges and highways will be made with American products built by American workers creating good-paying American jobs!\n\nThanks to my Chips and Science Act the United States is investing more in research and development than ever before.\n\nDuring the pandemic a shortage of semiconductor chips drove up prices for everything from cell phones to automobiles.\n\nWell instead of having to import semiconductor chips, which America invented I might add, private companies are now investing billions of dollars to build new chip factories here in America!\n\nCreating tens of thousands of jobs many of them paying over $100,000 a year and don’t require a college degree.\n\nIn fact my policies have attracted $650 Billion of private sector investments in clean energy and advanced manufacturing creating tens of thousands of jobs here in America!\n\nThanks to our Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, 46,000 new projects have been announced across your communities – modernizing our roads and bridges, ports and airports, and public transit systems.\n\nRemoving poisonous lead pipes so every child can drink clean water without risk of getting brain damage.\n\nProviding affordable high speed internet for every American no matter where you live.\n\nUrban, suburban, and rural communities — in red states and blue.\n\nRecord investments in tribal communities.\n\nBecause of my investments, family farms are better be able to stay in the family and children and grandchildren won’t have to leave home to make a living.\n\nIt’s transformative.\n\nA great comeback story is Belvidere, Illinois. Home to an auto plant for nearly 60 years. Before I came to office the plant was on its way to shutting down.\n\nThousands of workers feared for their livelihoods. Hope was fading.\n\nThen I was elected to office and we raised Belvidere repeatedly with the auto company knowing unions make all the difference.\n\nThe UAW worked like hell to keep the plant open and get those jobs back. And together, we succeeded!\n\nInstead of an auto factory shutting down an auto factory is re-opening and a new state-of-the art battery factory is being built to power those cars.\n\nInstead of a town being left behind it’s a community moving forward again!\n\nBecause instead of watching auto jobs of the future go overseas 4,000 union workers with higher wages will be building that future, in Belvidere, here in America!\n\nHere tonight is UAW President, Shawn Fain, a great friend, and a great labor leader.\n\nAnd Dawn Simms, a third generation UAW worker in Belvidere.\n\nShawn, I was proud to be the first President in American history to walk a picket line.\n\nAnd today Dawn has a job in her hometown providing stability for her family and pride and dignity.\n\nShowing once again, Wall Street didn’t build this country!\n\nThe middle class built this country! And unions built the middle class!\n\nWhen Americans get knocked down, we get back up!\n\nWe keep going!\n\nThat’s America! That’s you, the American people!\n\nIt’s because of you America is coming back!\n\nIt’s because of you, our future is brighter!\n\nAnd it’s because of you that tonight we can proudly say the State of our Union is strong and getting stronger!\n\nTonight I want to talk about the future of possibilities that we can build together.\n\nA future where the days of trickle-down economics are over and the wealthy and biggest corporations no longer get all the breaks.\n\nI grew up in a home where not a lot trickled down on my Dad’s kitchen table.\n\nThat’s why I’m determined to turn things around so the middle class does well the poor have a way up and the wealthy still does well.\n\nWe all do well.\n\nAnd there’s more to do to make sure you’re feeling the benefits of all we’re doing.\n\nAmericans pay more for prescription drugs than anywhere else.\n\nIt’s wrong and I’m ending it.\n\nWith a law I proposed and signed and not one Republican voted for we finally beat Big Pharma!\n\nInstead of paying $400 a month for insulin seniors with diabetes only have to pay $35 a month!\n\nAnd now I want to cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it!\n\nFor years people have talked about it but I finally got it done and gave Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for prescription drugs just like the VA does for our veterans.\n\nThat’s not just saving seniors money.\n\nIt’s saving taxpayers money cutting the federal deficit by $160 Billion because Medicare will no longer have to pay exorbitant prices to Big Pharma.\n\nThis year Medicare is negotiating lower prices for some of the costliest drugs on the market that treat everything from heart disease to arthritis.\n\nNow it’s time to go further and give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prices for 500 drugs over the next decade.\n\nThat will not only save lives it will save taxpayers another $200 Billion!\n\nStarting next year that same law caps total prescription drug costs for seniors on Medicare at $2,000 a year even for expensive cancer drugs that can cost $10,000, $12,000, $15,000 a year.\n\nNow I want to cap prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for everyone!\n\nFolks Obamacare, known as the Affordable Care Act is still a very big deal.\n\nOver one hundred million of you can no longer be denied health insurance because of pre-existing conditions.\n\nBut my predecessor and many in this chamber want to take that protection away by repealing the Affordable Care Act I won’t let that happen!\n\nWe stopped you 50 times before and we will stop you again!\n\nIn fact I am protecting it and expanding it.\n\nI enacted tax credits that save $800 per person per year reducing health care premiums for millions of working families.\n\nThose tax credits expire next year.\n\nI want to make those savings permanent!\n\nWomen are more than half of our population but research on women’s health has always been underfunded.\n\nThat’s why we’re launching the first-ever White House Initiative on Women’s Health Research, led by Jill who is doing an incredible job as First Lady.\n\nPass my plan for $12 Billion to transform women’s health research and benefit millions of lives across America!\n\nI know the cost of housing is so important to you.\n\nIf inflation keeps coming down mortgage rates will come down as well.\n\nBut I’m not waiting.\n\nI want to provide an annual tax creditthat will give Americans $400 a month for the next two years as mortgage rates come down to put toward their mortgage when they buy a first home or trade up for a little more space.\n\nMy Administration is also eliminating title insurance fees for federally backed mortgages.\n\nWhen you refinance your home this can save you $1,000 or more.\n\nFor millions of renters, we’re cracking down on big landlords who break antitrust laws by price-fixing and driving up rents.\n\nI’ve cut red tape so more builders can get federal financing, which is already helping build a record 1.7 million housing units nationwide.\n\nNow pass my plan to build and renovate 2 million affordable homes and bring those rents down!\n\nTo remain the strongest economy in the world we need the best education system in the world.\n\nI want to give every child a good start by providing access to pre-school for 3- and 4-year-olds.\n\nStudies show that children who go to pre-school are nearly 50% more likely to finish high school and go on to earn a 2- or 4-year degree no matter their background.\n\nI want to expand high-quality tutoring and summer learning time and see to it that every child learns to read by third grade.\n\nI’m also connecting businesses and high schools so students get hands-on experience and a path to a good-paying job whether or not they go to college.\n\nAnd I want to make college more affordable.\n\nLet’s continue increasing Pell Grants for working- and middle-class families and increase our record investments in HBCUs and Hispanic and Minority-serving Institutions\n\nI fixed student loan programs to reduce the burden of student debt for nearly 4 Million Americans including nurses firefighters and others in public service like Keenan Jones a public-school educator in Minnesota who’s here with us tonight.\n\nHe’s educated hundreds of students so they can go to college now he can help his own daughter pay for college.\n\nSuch relief is good for the economy because folks are now able to buy a home start a business even start a family.\n\nWhile we’re at it I want to give public school teachers a raise!\n\nNow let me speak to a question of fundamental fairness for all Americans.\n\nI’ve been delivering real results in a fiscally responsible way.\n\nI’ve already cut the federal deficit by over one trillion dollars.\n\nI signed a bipartisan budget deal that will cut another trillion dollars over the next decade.\n\nAnd now it’s my goal to cut the federal deficit $3 trillion more by making big corporations and the very wealthy finally pay their fair share.\n\nLook, I’m a capitalist.\n\nIf you want to make a million bucks – great!\n\nJust pay your fair share in taxes.\n\nA fair tax code is how we invest in the things –\n\nthat make a country great, health care, education, defense, and more.\n\nBut here’s the deal.\n\nThe last administration enacted a $2 Trillion tax cut that overwhelmingly benefits the very wealthy and the biggest corporations and exploded the federal deficit.\n\nThey added more to the national debt than in any presidential term in American history.\n\nFor folks at home does anybody really think the tax code is fair?\n\nDo you really think the wealthy and big corporations need another $2 trillion in tax breaks?\n\nI sure don’t. I’m going to keep fighting like hell to make it fair!\n\nUnder my plan nobody earning less than $400,000 will pay an additional penny in federal taxes.\n\nNobody. Not one penny.\n\nIn fact the Child Tax Credit I passed during the pandemic cut taxes for millions of working families and cut child poverty in HALF.\n\nRestore the Child Tax Credit because no child should go hungry in this country!\n\nThe way to make the tax code fair is to make big corporations and the very wealthy finally pay their share.\n\nIn 2020 55 of the biggest companies in America made $40 Billion in profits and paid zero in federal income taxes.\n\nNot any more!\n\nThanks to the law I wrote and signed big companies now have to pay a minimum of 15%.\n\nBut that’s still less than working people pay in federal taxes.\n\nIt’s time to raise the corporate minimum tax to at least 21% so every big corporation finally begins to pay their fair share.\n\nI also want to end the tax breaks for Big Pharma, Big Oil, private jets, and massive executive pay!\n\nEnd it now!\n\nThere are 1,000 billionaires in America.\n\nYou know what the average federal tax rate for these billionaires is? 8.2 percent!\n\nThat’s far less than the vast majority of Americans pay.\n\nNo billionaire should pay a lower tax rate than a teacher, a sanitation worker, a nurse!\n\nThat’s why I’ve proposed a minimum tax of 25% for billionaires. Just 25%.\n\nThat would raise $500 Billion over the next 10 years.\n\nImagine what that could do for America. Imagine a future with affordable child care so millions of families can get the care they need and still go to work and help grow the economy.\n\nImagine a future with paid leave because no one should have to choose between working and taking care of yourself or a sick family member.\n\nImagine a future with home care and elder care so seniors and people living with disabilities can stay in their homes and family caregivers get paid what they deserve!\n\nTonight, let’s all agree once again to stand up for seniors!\n\nMany of my Republican friends want to put Social Security on the chopping block.\n\nIf anyone here tries to cut Social Security or Medicare or raise the retirement age I will stop them!\n\nWorking people who built this country pay more into Social Security than millionaires and billionaires do. It’s not fair.\n\nWe have two ways to go on Social Security.\n\nRepublicans will cut Social Security and give more tax cuts to the wealthy.\n\nI will protect and strengthen Social Security and make the wealthy pay their fair share!\n\nToo many corporations raise their prices to pad their profits charging you more and more for less and less.\n\nThat’s why we’re cracking down on corporations that engage in price gouging or deceptive pricing from food to health care to housing.\n\nIn fact, snack companies think you won’t notice when they charge you just as much for the same size bag\n\nbut with fewer chips in it.\n\nPass Senator Bob Casey’s bill to put a stop to shrinkflation!\n\nI’m also getting rid of junk fees those hidden fees added at the end of your bills without your knowledge. My administration just announced we’re cutting credit card late fees from $32 to just $8.\n\nThe banks and credit card companies don’t like it.\n\nWhy?\n\nI’m saving American families $20 billion a year with all of the junk fees I’m eliminating.\n\nAnd I’m not stopping there.\n\nMy Administration has proposed rules to make cable travel utilities and online ticket sellers tell you the total price upfront so there are no surprises.\n\nIt matters.\n\nAnd so does this.\n\nIn November, my team began serious negotiations with a bipartisan group of Senators.\n\nThe result was a bipartisan bill with the toughest set of border security reforms we’ve ever seen\n\nin this country.\n\nThat bipartisan deal would hire 1,500 more border security agents and officers.\n\n100 more immigration judges to help tackle a backload of 2 million cases.\n\n4,300 more asylum officers and new policies so they can resolve cases in 6 months instead of 6 years.\n\n100 more high-tech drug detection machines to significantly increase the ability to screen and stop vehicles from smuggling fentanyl into America.\n\nThis bill would save lives and bring order to the border.\n\nIt would also give me as President new emergency authority to temporarily shut down the border when the number of migrants at the border is overwhelming.\n\nThe Border Patrol Union endorsed the bill.\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce endorsed the bill.\n\nI believe that given the opportunity a majority of the House and Senate would endorse it as well.\n\nBut unfortunately, politics have derailed it so far.\n\nI’m told my predecessor called Republicans in Congress and demanded they block the bill. He feels it would be a political win for me and a political loser for him.\n\nIt’s not about him or me.\n\nIt’d be a winner for America!\n\nMy Republican friends you owe it to the American people to get this bill done.\n\nWe need to act.\n\nAnd if my predecessor is watching instead of playing politics and pressuring members of Congress to block this bill, join me in telling Congress to pass it!\n\nWe can do it together. But here’s what I will not do.\n\nI will not demonize immigrants saying they “poison the blood of our country” as he said in his own words.\n\nI will not separate families.\n\nI will not ban people from America because of their faith.\n\nUnlike my predecessor, on my first day in office I introduced a comprehensive plan to fix our immigration system, secure the border, and provide a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and so much more.\n\nBecause unlike my predecessor, I know who we are\n\nas Americans.\n\nWe are the only nation in the world with a heart and soul that draws from old and new.\n\nHome to Native Americans whose ancestors have been here for thousands of years. Home to people from every place on Earth.\n\nSome came freely.\n\nSome chained by force.\n\nSome when famine struck, like my ancestral family in Ireland.\n\nSome to flee persecution.\n\nSome to chase dreams that are impossible anywhere but here in America.\n\nThat’s America, where we all come from somewhere, but we are all Americans.\n\nWe can fight about the border, or we can fix it. I’m ready to fix it.\n\nSend me the border bill now!\n\nA transformational moment in our history happened 59 years ago today in Selma, Alabama.\n\nHundreds of foot soldiers for justice marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, named after a Grand Dragon of the KKK, to claim their fundamental right to vote.\n\nThey were beaten bloodied and left for dead.\n\nOur late friend and former colleague John Lewis was at the march.\n\nWe miss him.\n\nJoining us tonight are other marchers who were there including Betty May Fikes, known as the “Voice of Selma”.\n\nA daughter of gospel singers and preachers, she sang songs of prayer and protest on that Bloody Sunday,\n\nto help shake the nation’s conscience. Five months later, the Voting Rights Act was signed into law. But 59 years later, there are forces taking us back in time.\n\nVoter suppression. Election subversion. Unlimited dark money. Extreme gerrymandering.\n\nJohn Lewis was a great friend to many of us here. But if you truly want to honor him and all the heroes who marched with him, then it’s time for more than just talk.\n\nPass and send me the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act!\n\nAnd stop denying another core value of America our diversity across American life.\n\nBanning books.\n\nIt’s wrong!\n\nInstead of erasing history, let’s make history!\n\nI want to protect other fundamental rights!\n\nPass the Equality Act, and my message to transgender Americans: I have your back!\n\nPass the PRO Act for workers rights! And raise the federal minimum wage because every worker has the right to earn a decent living!\n\nWe are also making history by confronting the climate crisis, not denying it.\n\nI’m taking the most significant action on climate ever in the history of the world.\n\nI am cutting our carbon emissions in half by 2030.\n\nCreating tens of thousands of clean-energy jobs, like the IBEW workers building and installing 500,000 electric vehicle charging stations.\n\nConserving 30% of America’s lands and waters by 2030.\n\nTaking historic action on environmental justice for fence-line communities smothered by the legacy of pollution.\n\nAnd patterned after the Peace Corps and Ameri Corps, I’ve launched a Climate Corps to put 20,000 young people to work at the forefront of our clean energy future.\n\nI’ll triple that number this decade.\n\nAll Americans deserve the freedom to be safe, and America is safer today than when I took office.\n\nThe year before I took office, murders went up 30% nationwide the biggest increase in history.\n\nThat was then.\n\nNow, through my American Rescue Plan, which every Republican voted against, I’ve made the largest investment in public safety ever.\n\nLast year, the murder rate saw the sharpest decrease in history, and violent crime fell to one of the lowest levels in more than 50 years.\n\nBut we have more to do.\n\nHelp cities and towns invest in more community police officers, more mental health workers, and more community violence intervention.\n\nGive communities the tools to crack down on gun crime, retail crime, and carjacking.\n\nKeep building public trust, as I’ve been doing by taking executive action on police reform, and calling for it to be the law of the land, directing my Cabinet to review the federal classification of marijuana, and expunging thousands of convictions for mere possession, because no one should be jailed for using or possessing marijuana!\n\nTo take on crimes of domestic violence, I am ramping up federal enforcement of the Violence Against Women Act, that I proudly wrote, so we can finally end the scourge of violence against women in America!\n\nAnd there’s another kind of violence I want to stop.\n\nWith us tonight is Jasmine, whose 9-year-old sister Jackie was murdered with 21 classmates and teachers at her elementary school in Uvalde, Texas.\n\nSoon after it happened, Jill and I went to Uvalde and spent hours with the families.\n\nWe heard their message, and so should everyone in this chamber do something.\n\nI did do something by establishing the first-ever Office of Gun Violence Prevention in the White House that Vice President Harris is leading.\n\nMeanwhile, my predecessor told the NRA he’s proud he did nothing on guns when he was President.\n\nAfter another school shooting in Iowa he said we should just “get over it.”\n\nI say we must stop it.\n\nI’m proud we beat the NRA when I signed the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years!\n\nNow we must beat the NRA again!\n\nI’m demanding a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines!\n\nPass universal background checks!\n\nNone of this violates the Second Amendment or vilifies responsible gun owners.\n\nAs we manage challenges at home, we’re also managing crises abroad including in the Middle East.\n\nI know the last five months have been gut-wrenching for so many people, for the Israeli people, the Palestinian people, and so many here in America.\n\nThis crisis began on October 7th with a massacre by the terrorist group Hamas.\n\n1,200 innocent people women and girls men and boys slaughtered, many enduring sexual violence.\n\nThe deadliest day for the Jewish people since the Holocaust.\n\n250 hostages taken.\n\nHere in the chamber tonight are American families whose loved ones are still being held by Hamas.\n\nI pledge to all the families that we will not rest until we bring their loved ones home.\n\nWe will also work around the clock to bring home Evan and Paul, Americans being unjustly detained all around the world.\n\nIsrael has a right to go after Hamas.\n\nHamas could end this conflict today by releasing the hostages, laying down arms, and surrendering those responsible for October 7th.\n\nIsrael has an added burden because Hamas hides and operates among the civilian population. But Israel also has a fundamental responsibility to protect innocent civilians in Gaza.\n\nThis war has taken a greater toll on innocent civilians than all previous wars in Gaza combined.\n\nMore than 30,000 Palestinians have been killed.\n\nMost of whom are not Hamas.\n\nThousands and thousands are innocent women and children.\n\nGirls and boys also orphaned.\n\nNearly 2 million more Palestinians under bombardment or displaced.\n\nHomes destroyed, neighborhoods in rubble, cities in ruin.\n\nFamilies without food, water, medicine.\n\nIt’s heartbreaking.\n\nWe’ve been working non-stop to establish an immediate ceasefire that would last for at least six weeks.\n\nIt would get the hostages home, ease the intolerable humanitarian crisis, and build toward something more enduring.\n\nThe United States has been leading international efforts to get more humanitarian assistance into Gaza.\n\nTonight, I’m directing the U.S. military to lead an emergency mission to establish a temporary pier in the Mediterranean on the Gaza coast that can receive large ships carrying food, water, medicine and temporary shelters.\n\nNo U.S. boots will be on the ground.\n\nThis temporary pier would enable a massive increase in the amount of humanitarian assistance getting into Gaza every day.\n\nBut Israel must also do its part.\n\nIsrael must allow more aid into Gaza and ensure that humanitarian workers aren’t caught in the cross fire.\n\nTo the leadership of Israel I say this.\n\nHumanitarian assistance cannot be a secondary consideration or a bargaining chip.\n\nProtecting and saving innocent lives has to be a priority.\n\nAs we look to the future, the only real solution is a two-state solution.\n\nI say this as a lifelong supporter of Israel and the only American president to visit Israel in wartime.\n\nThere is no other path that guarantees Israel’s security and democracy.\n\nThere is no other path that guarantees Palestinians can live with peace and dignity.\n\nThere is no other path that guarantees peace between Israel and all of its Arab neighbors, including Saudi Arabia.\n\nCreating stability in the Middle East also means containing the threat posed by Iran.\n\nThat’s why I built a coalition of more than a dozen countries to defend international shipping and freedom of navigation in the Red Sea.\n\nI’ve ordered strikes to degrade Houthi capabilities and defend U.S. Forces in the region.\n\nAs Commander in Chief, I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and military personnel.\n\nFor years, all I’ve heard from my Republican friends and so many others is China’s on the rise and America is falling behind.\n\nThey’ve got it backward.\n\nAmerica is rising.\n\nWe have the best economy in the world.\n\nSince I’ve come to office, our GDP is up.\n\nAnd our trade deficit with China is down to the lowest point in over a decade.\n\nWe’re standing up against China’s unfair economic practices.\n\nAnd standing up for peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait.\n\nI’ve revitalized our partnerships and alliances in the Pacific.\n\nI’ve made sure that the most advanced American technologies can’t be used in China’s weapons.\n\nFrankly for all his tough talk on China, it never occurred to my predecessor to do that.\n\nWe want competition with China, but not conflict.\n\nAnd we’re in a stronger position to win the competition for the 21st Century against China or anyone else for that matter.\n\nHere at home I’ve signed over 400 bipartisan bills.\n\nBut there’s more to do to pass my Unity Agenda.\n\nStrengthen penalties on fentanyl trafficking.\n\nPass bipartisan privacy legislation to protect our children online.\n\nHarness the promise of A.I. and protect us from its peril.\n\nBan A.I. voice impersonation and more!\n\nAnd keep our one truly sacred obligation, to train and equip those we send into harm’s way and care for them and their families when they come home, and when they don’t.\n\nThat’s why I signed the PACT Act, one of the most significant laws ever, helping millions of veterans who were exposed to toxins and who now are battling more than 100 cancers.\n\nMany of them didn’t come home.\n\nWe owe them and their families.\n\nAnd we owe it to ourselves to keep supporting our new health research agency called ARPA-H and remind us that we can do big things like end cancer as we know it!\n\nLet me close with this.\n\nI know I may not look like it, but I’ve been around a while.\n\nAnd when you get to my age certain things become clearer than ever before.\n\nI know the American story.\n\nAgain and again I’ve seen the contest between competing forces in the battle for the soul of our nation.\n\nBetween those who want to pull America back to the past and those who want to move America into the future.\n\nMy lifetime has taught me to embrace freedom and democracy.\n\nA future based on the core values that have defined America.\n\nHonesty. Decency. Dignity. Equality.\n\nTo respect everyone. To give everyone a fair shot. To give hate no safe harbor.\n\nNow some other people my age see a different story.\n\nAn American story of resentment, revenge, and retribution.\n\nThat’s not me.\n\nI was born amid World War II when America stood for freedom in the world.\n\nI grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania and Claymont, Delaware among working people who built this country.\n\nI watched in horror as two of my heroes, Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy, were assassinated and their legacies inspired me to pursue a career in service.\n\nA public defender, county councilman, elected United States Senator at 29, then Vice President, to our first Black President, now President, with our first woman Vice President.\n\nIn my career I’ve been told I’m too young and I’m too old.\n\nWhether young or old, I’ve always known what endures.\n\nOur North Star.\n\nThe very idea of America, that we are all created equal and deserve to be treated equally throughout our lives.\n\nWe’ve never fully lived up to that idea, but we’ve never walked away from it either.\n\nAnd I won’t walk away from it now.\n\nMy fellow Americans the issue facing our nation isn’t how old we are it’s how old our ideas are?\n\nHate, anger, revenge, retribution are among the oldest of ideas.\n\nBut you can’t lead America with ancient ideas that only take us back.\n\nTo lead America, the land of possibilities, you need a vision for the future of what America can and should be.\n\nTonight you’ve heard mine.\n\nI see a future where we defend democracy not diminish it.\n\nI see a future where we restore the right to choose and protect other freedoms not take them away.\n\nI see a future where the middle class finally has a fair shot and the wealthy finally have to pay their fair share in taxes.\n\nI see a future where we save the planet from the climate crisis and our country from gun violence.\n\nAbove all, I see a future for all Americans!\n\nI see a country for all Americans!\n\nAnd I will always be a president for all Americans!\n\nBecause I believe in America!\n\nI believe in you the American people.\n\nYou’re the reason I’ve never been more optimistic about our future!\n\nSo let’s build that future together!\n\nLet’s remember who we are!\n\nWe are the United States of America.\n\nThere is nothing beyond our capacity when we act together!\n\nMay God bless you all.\n\nMay God protect our troops.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/03/07"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/21/slavery-reckonings-radio-citys-return-marijuana-movements-news-around-states/117129826/", "title": "Slavery reckonings, Radio City's return: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: Descendants of the white Alabama businessman who financed the voyage of the last slave ship to land in the United States more than 160 years ago have agreed to sell a building that will become a hub for Africatown USA, the community settled by the freed Africans after the Civil War. A long-closed credit union building owned by relatives of Timothy Meaher will open within weeks as a food bank and as home of the Africatown Redevelopment Corp., officials told a news conference Thursday. The family sold the brick building to the city for $50,000, well below its appraised value of $300,000. The family, which tax records show owns millions of dollars’ worth of land around Mobile, issued a statement that described selling the building as a way “to give back to the community.” Mayor Sandy Stimpson said he contacted a representative of the family about acquiring the property in Africatown, located just a few miles north of downtown Mobile. Large parts of the once-vibrant community are blighted, but the area has received new attention since the wreckage of the slave ship, Clotilda, was found in 2018. Community leaders are now trying to revitalize the area with a museum and other attractions that could bring visitors and an infusion of money into the area.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: A special legislative session limped toward a bitter end Friday, with the threat of a partial government shutdown looming and Gov. Mike Dunleavy and House majority leaders sharply disagreeing over the adequacy of the budget passed by lawmakers last week. Dunleavy called the budget “defective,” pointing in particular to the House’s failure to get the two-thirds support for a procedural effective-date vote. His office said notices were sent to thousands of state workers warning of possible layoffs with the new fiscal year beginning July 1. He called another special session, set to begin Wednesday and again focus on the budget, shortly after the House held a brief floor session for which attendance was not mandatory Friday afternoon. House majority leaders were among those who criticized Dunleavy’s stance on the budget. House Speaker Louise Stutes characterized it as a needless choice and said Dunleavy has tools available to prevent shutting down parts of the government, including asking minority Republicans to change their votes to support the effective-date clause. Minority Republicans, who say they have felt marginalized and want to be included in talks on what pieces should be considered as part of a broader fiscal plan, take responsibility for their votes, House Minority Leader Cathy Tilton told reporters Friday.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: Researchers at the University of Arizona will be launching a study of how prone Hispanic children are to asthma in Tucson compared with their peers on the other side of the U.S.-Mexico border in Nogales, Sonora. The study will follow 500 pregnant women of Mexican descent in both cities and their newborns for the next five years to see how prevalent asthma is. Dr. Fernando Martinez, a principal investigator of the project and director of the University of Arizona Health Sciences Asthma and Airway Disease Research Center, said there is four times less asthma in Nogales, Sonora, than in Tucson, which is about an hour’s drive away. A study of teenagers in Nogales, Arizona, showed 16% had asthma compared with 4% to 6% of teens in the same age range just across the border in Nogales, Sonora. Mexicans who come to the United States also have less asthma than Mexican Americans, researchers have found. The Arizona Daily Star reports the University of Arizona study will look into how the risk of asthma is affected by the “hygiene hypothesis,” which suggests that a child’s reduced exposure to germs stunts the immune system’s ability to fight infectious organisms. The study was delayed due to COVID-19, but researchers plan to begin enrolling pregnant women in August and finish by August 2023.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A federal judge Friday refused to allow a man arrested after he was photographed sitting at a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s office during the Jan. 6 U.S. Capitol riot to travel for a classic-car swap meet. U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper rejected the request by Richard Barnett to loosen the 50-mile restriction on how far he can travel from his residence while he’s on home detention awaiting trial. Barnett’s attorney said the Gravette, Arkansas, man needed to be able to travel to make a living buying and selling classic cars. Petit Jean Mountain, where the car show was being held over the weekend, is 200 miles from Gravette. “The Court is not persuaded that the defendant cannot pursue gainful employment within a 50-mile radius of his home as permitted by the current conditions,” Cooper’s order said. Barnett, 61, was among supporters of President Donald Trump who stormed the Capitol as lawmakers assembled to certify Joe Biden’s victory over Trump. Prosecutors say Barnett was carrying a stun gun when he entered the building. Federal prosecutors opposed Barnett’s request and said his conduct while awaiting trial – including an interview with Russian State Television – indicated more conditions, not fewer, were needed.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Attorney General Rob Bonta launched new anti-human trafficking teams to apprehend perpetrators and support survivors Friday amid an alarming increase in labor and sexual exploitation statewide amid the coronavirus pandemic. California’s lockdown exacerbated problems with human trafficking, officials said Friday, and made it much harder for victims to escape and find housing and other services. Kay Buck, the chief executive officer for Los Angeles-based nonprofit Coalition to Abolish Slavery and Trafficking, called it “the most unforgettable and heart-wrenching year” as advocates saw a huge demand in services combined with a shortage of resources. In LA alone, the nonprofit saw a spike of 185% in urgent human trafficking cases during the pandemic, Buck said. Advocates in LA County see victims – many who come from Mexico and the Philippines – who were duped into thinking they would have a job in the U.S. but are instead sold into “modern-day slavery.” Actors and activists Mira Sorvino and Alyssa Milano; state Assemblyman Miguel Santiago; and Angela Guanzon, who escaped her trafficker and aided law enforcement in their prosecution, joined Bonta on Friday to implore Newsom and lawmakers to approve another $30 million in new grants over the next three years, doubling the funding level for the efforts.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra visited a mobile vaccine clinic near the city Friday to promote COVID-19 shots among underserved communities of color that have some of the nation’s lowest vaccination rates. He also met with Democratic Gov. Jared Polis, getting briefly interrupted by the governor’s dog, Gia, and another dog dashing through their closed-door session, giving the two a laugh. They discussed the state’s pandemic response and a new law creating a state-administered health insurance plan designed to reduce premiums and costs of care as well as get more people covered. Later, Becerra, the agency’s first Latino leader, and Democratic members of Colorado’s congressional delegation toured a mobile vaccine clinic focused on underserved communities in the Denver suburb of Aurora, which is nearly 30% Hispanic. It’s one of nine mobile units made from converted buses. While Hispanic people make up 20% of Colorado’s population, less than 10% have been vaccinated, according to the state’s vaccine dashboard. Democratic U.S. Rep. Jason Crow said many minorities and immigrants have trouble finding the time to get vaccinated while working multiple jobs, highlighting the need for the mobile resources. “Where you are, we will go. Donde tú estás, iremos nosotros,” Becerra said.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The state has become the first in the nation to make all prison phone calls free, addressing one of the biggest emotional and financial burdens faced by incarcerated men and women and their families as they try to stay in touch. The state has a prison contract with phone vendor Securus Technologies, which charges up to $5 for a 15-minute call – some of the highest phone rates in the country. Gov. Ned Lamont signed a bill into law Wednesday that allows incarcerated men, women and juveniles a minimum of 90 minutes a day of free calls. Supports said the change could go into effect as early as next month. “We’re on the right side of history,” said Democratic state Rep. Josh Elliott, one of the legislation’s supporters. “Corporations can no longer be allowed to exploit the love between incarcerated people and their families – not in our state, not on our watch.” Several more local jurisdictions in the U.S. have also taken steps to make prison and jail phone calls free, including New York City, San Francisco, San Diego and Los Angeles. “This historic legislation will change lives,” said Bianca Tylek, executive director of Worth Rises, which has been working with local advocates to slash prison phone costs. “It will keep food on the table for struggling families, children in contact with their parents, and our communities safer.”\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: President Joe Biden announced Saturday that Champ, the older of the family’s two dogs, had died “peacefully at home.” The German shepherd was 13. “He was our constant, cherished companion during the last 13 years and was adored by the entire Biden family,” Biden and first lady Jill Biden said in a statement posted to the president’s official Twitter account. The Bidens, who were spending the weekend at their home in Wilmington, got Champ from a breeder after Joe Biden was elected vice president in 2008. Champ was a fixture both at the vice president’s residence at the Naval Observatory and at the White House. In their statement, the Bidens said when Champ was young, “he was happiest chasing golf balls on the front lawn of the Naval Observatory,” and more recently he enjoyed “joining us as a comforting presence in meetings or sunning himself in the White House garden.” “In our most joyful moments and in our most grief-stricken days, he was there with us, sensitive to our every unspoken feeling and emotion,” the Bidens said. Champ’s passing leaves the Bidens with their younger German shepherd, Major, whom the family adopted from the Delaware Humane Society in 2018.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Residents getting their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine at select sites through the end of July will receive $51 gift cards and be entered for a chance to win free flights and other incentives, WUSA-TV reports. Mayor Muriel Bowser said Washington has reached 70% of adults having received at least one dose. While anyone can get a COVID-19 shot at district vaccination sites, the gift cards are only available to D.C. residents. Those between the ages of 12 and 17 must be accompanied by a guardian. Residents will receive the gift card after getting their shot. Additionally, Washingtonians getting their shots at Anacostia High School, Ron Brown High School or RISE Demonstration Center will be entered to win two round-trip American Airlines tickets to anywhere the airline flies, including international locations. Other prizes offered in a series of drawings starting Saturday include a new car, a year’s worth of groceries, and a one-year Metro pass. More information about the giveaways can be found at coronavirus.dc.gov/incentives. A full schedule of the days and hours of the current walk-up sites can be found at taketheshotdc.com.\n\nFlorida\n\nSt. Petersburg: A federal judge on Friday ruled for the state in a lawsuit challenging a U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention order making it difficult for cruise ships to resume sailing due to the coronavirus pandemic. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday wrote in a 124-page decision that Florida would be harmed if the CDC order, which the state said effectively blocked most cruises, were to continue. The Tampa-based judge granted a preliminary injunction that prevents the CDC from enforcing the order pending further legal action on a broader lawsuit. “This order finds that Florida is highly likely to prevail on the merits of the claim that CDC’s conditional sailing order and the implementing orders exceed the authority delegated to the CDC,” Merryday wrote. Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody praised the decision in a statement. “Today’s ruling is a victory for the hardworking Floridians whose livelihoods depend on the cruise industry,” said Moody, a Republican. “The federal government does not, nor should it ever, have the authority to single out and lock down an entire industry indefinitely.” While the CDC could appeal, Merryday ordered both sides to return to mediation to attempt to work out a full solution – a previous attempt failed – and said the CDC could fashion a modification in which it would retain some public health authority.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Georgia’s secretary of state is making public a list of nearly 102,000 voters who will be removed from the rolls unless they act to preserve their registration. Republican Brad Raffensperger announced the list Friday, part of an every-other-year bid to remove voters who may have died or moved away. The state has about 7.8 million voters, and his office said the removals include about 67,000 voters who submitted a change-of-address form to the U.S. Postal Service, plus about 34,000 voters who had election mail returned. Voter purges in Georgia became a hot-button issue during the 2018 governor’s race between Democrat Stacey Abrams and Republican Brian Kemp. As secretary of state before being elected governor, Kemp oversaw aggressive voter purges during his tenure. More than 1.4 million voter registrations were canceled in Georgia between 2012 and 2018. In the current purge, election officials said, cancellation notices will be mailed, and those who respond within 40 days will have their registration switched back to active. Anyone who is removed could register again. On a monthly basis, the secretary of state been removing voters who were convicted of felonies or who died.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Civil rights activist the Rev. Al Sharpton is condemning the Honolulu Police Department for the fatal shooting of a Black man as various versions of what led to the death continue to emerge. “Lindani Myeni’s killing is yet another sensational racialization and criminalization of an innocent, unarmed black man at the hands of police not following the law and proper police procedures,” Sharpton said in a statement Thursday. Interim Honolulu Police Chief Rade Vanic said the police department is committed to public service, and these “are challenging times for police departments everywhere.” Sharpton weighed in on the April 14 shooting of Myeni after lawyers representing his widow in a wrongful-death lawsuit made public last week a doorbell video showing the 29-year-old arriving at a house, taking off his shoes and quickly leaving after his presence confused the occupants. Myeni repeatedly apologized to the couple. The lawsuit said he likely mistook the home for a temple next door that’s open to the public. Police responding to a 911 call shot him a short time later outside the house, with body camera footage showing an officer fired several gunshots before saying, “Police!” An attorney representing the homeowner and the tourists who were staying in the house said Myeni’s presence wasn’t as innocuous as lawyers for his wife portrayed.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The Northwestern Band of the Shoshone Nation is suing Gov. Brad Little and state wildlife officials in federal court, contending Idaho has wrongly denied the tribe hunting rights guaranteed by the 1868 Treaty of Fort Bridger. The lawsuit, filed in Idaho’s U.S. District Court last week, asks a judge to declare that the Northwestern Band is protected under the treaty. On its surface, the legal case could come down to whether one of the Native American leaders who signed the treaty was representing the Northwestern Band along with other bands of the Shoshone Nation and whether the Northwestern Band itself has remained a cohesive unit in the time since. But at the heart of the dispute is a dilemma faced by many Native American governments across the U.S. who sometimes find themselves at odds with game wardens, mining companies, water users or other groups as they try to preserve their use of the land they were promised in treaties signed centuries ago. Some Northwestern Band tribal members have faced criminal convictions after Idaho game wardens said they were hunting without tags. In 1997, two brothers were found guilty for hunting out of season in Idaho, though they had hunting tags issued by the Northwestern Band. Shane and Wayde Warner appealed their convictions, claiming rights under the Fort Bridger treaty.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The state is dangling millions of dollars in cash prizes and scholarships to encourage residents to get vaccinated, Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Thursday. Illinois will offer $7 million in cash prizes and $3 million in scholarships through a new lottery open to all residents who have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. Pritzker made the announcement at a community health center in Chicago’s Back of Yards neighborhood. Prizes will range from $100,000 to $1 million, and children can win a college savings plan worth $150,000. Names in Illinois’ vaccination database will be automatically eligible for the lottery. Participants will be required to have a shot by July 1. Weekly drawings will begin July 8. “ ‘All In For The Win’ is yet another way we’re working to ensure every single resident is protected from COVID-19,” Pritzker said. Nearly 67% of Illinois’ residents have received at least one vaccination dose, and a little over 50% have received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIndiana\n\nBristol: A grain mill that opened more than 180 years ago in northern Indiana saw a sales boom during the pandemic after it opened a drive-thru for customers eager to buy freshly milled grains. The historic Bonneyville Mill was closed to visitors during the COVID-19 pandemic, like many Indiana businesses. But staff at the 1830s mill converted its original horse and wagon bay that farmers once used to deliver freshly harvested grain into a drive-thru for automobiles, which helped the mill along the Little Elkhart River rack up its most profitable year on record for grain sales, said Ronda DeCaire, director of the Elkhart County Parks system. “This was one of the few places in the Midwest where you could still buy flour and other freshly milled grains,” she told The Elkhart Truth. To prevent spreading the coronavirus, the mill’s staff used a pole with a bucket on its end to accept payments from drive-thru customers. Packages of flour and other milled grains were then handed to those customers through their car windows. “For the first time in over a hundred years, that wagon bay was busy again,” said Courtney Franke, the mill’s manager. DeCaire said the Bonneyville Mill is the oldest continuously operating grist mill in Indiana. It’s located just south of the Michigan border about 25 miles east of South Bend.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: A divided state Supreme Court on Friday banned police from searching people’s uncollected trash without a warrant, outlawing an investigative technique that had been used for decades. The court ruled 4-3 that officers commit an unreasonable search and seizure under the Iowa Constitution when they look for evidence of crimes in trash left for collection outside homes. The tactic amounts to an unconstitutional trespass on private property and violates citizens’ expectations of privacy, especially in cities that have ordinances barring residents from accessing others’ trash, Justice Christopher McDonald wrote for the majority. “We do not question the utility of warrantless trash grabs for the purposes of law enforcement, but the utility of warrantless activity is not the issue under our constitution,” he wrote, adding that “garbage contains intimate and private details of life.” The ruling overturned Iowa courts’ long adherence to a 1988 U.S. Supreme Court decision that found the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the search of garbage outside one’s home. Just a small number of other states have limited trash searches by holding that their state constitutions provide greater protections than the U.S. Constitution against warrantless searches.\n\nKansas\n\nShawnee: A judge is beginning to evict tenants who are behind on rent in advance of the expiration of a federal moratorium that some experts predict will bring a tide of people being forced from homes nationwide. Johnson County Magistrate Judge Daniel Vokins said during a Zoom eviction hearing last week that he doesn’t think the moratorium, which was issued last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and expires at the end of the month, is enforceable. Eric Dunn, director of litigation for the National Housing Law Project, said he has heard of judges elsewhere – including in Florida, Georgia and North Carolina – ignoring the CDC moratorium but couldn’t say whether it’s been a widespread practice. The federal moratorium has kept many tenants owing back rent housed. More than 4 million people nationally say they fear being evicted or foreclosed upon in the months following its expiration, census data shows. Making matters worse, the tens of billions of dollars in federal emergency rental assistance that was supposed to solve the problem has not reached most tenants. “We thought 2021 was going to be better, and it is turning out to be just as bad,” said Denise Wall, 31, of the Kansas City suburb of Shawnee, who applied for rental aid in March but is still trying to find out whether she qualifies.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: With tourists flocking to distilleries, concerns about a pandemic hangover for the state’s world-famous bourbon industry are quickly evaporating. A $19 million tourist center that Heaven Hill Distillery opened just days ago in the heart of the state’s bourbon country is already overflowing, with reservations filling up quickly to learn about whiskey-making and sample its spirits, including its flagship Evan Williams whiskey. It’s a similar story for the numerous other distilleries in the region that last spring were temporarily closed to visitors because of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than a year later, the businesses are facing such overwhelming demand for tours that one industry official has started encouraging people to call ahead or check tour availability online before pulling off the highway. Starting last summer, some distilleries began allowing limited numbers of visitors in accordance with coronavirus restrictions. With capacity limits now lifted, the attractions are gearing up for a full resurgence of guests, many from outside Kentucky. “We saw it coming, but I don’t think we saw it coming this quick,” said Kentucky Distillers’ Association President Eric Gregory, who predicted bourbon tourism will quickly rebound to pre-pandemic levels.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The iconic bald cypress trees will be protected on state-owned property, after Gov. John Bel Edwards signed a new law banning the trees’ harvesting on more than 1million acres of state land. Rep. Neil Riser said he sponsored the bill – which won unanimous passage in the state House and Senate – to give nature time to reestablish dense stands of cypress that once covered vast tracts of land. “The cypress tree symbolizes Louisiana and the Mississippi Delta,” said Riser, R-Columbia. “I hope this new law will help people have a true appreciation of these trees’ majesty.” The new law doesn’t apply to cypress trees growing on privately owned land. Cypress trees grow throughout Louisiana’s swamps and can have lifespans of more than 1,000 years. The bald cypress was named the official Louisiana state tree in 1963. Riser said the forests will return on state-owned lands with protection, though it will take almost a century for the slow-growth trees to mature. “They will come back with Mother Nature as the manager and forester,” he said. In a twist, Riser was involved in harvesting the trees as a teenage logger in the 1970s when forests were being cleared for farmland. “I remember my dad telling me, ‘Take a look at this forest; one day it will all be gone,’ and it was,” he said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The Legislature has approved an initial proposal that would allow four Native American tribes to build gambling businesses on their lands, in a reversal from years of resistance and laws that opposed Native ownership of casinos in the state. Breaking years of opposition against the bill, the House and Senate approved it with an overwhelming majority Thursday, the Portland Press Herald reports. Rep. Rena Newell, a nonvoting member of the Legislature who represents the Passamaquoddy Tribe, gave a speech following the approval of the bill, which she had pushed legislators to advance. The bill was only a small part of what the state could do for the tribes in Maine, she said. “Our ancestors watched from inside the bounds of our reservation as nontribal members got rich from cutting down our trees on our land, leaving us with little,” Newell said. The gambling legislation is one part of a series of changes the Legislature wants to amend the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act. If these amendments are enacted, the revisions would restore some of the sovereignty that tribal leaders say they lost years ago, according to the Press Herald. Maine voters have rejected tribes’ past proposals but approved referendum questions that led to the establishment of two corporate-owned casinos.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: The state is awarding $10million to entertainment venues that struggled during the pandemic, including the Delmarva Shorebirds, the Maryland Theatre and the Maryland Symphony Orchestra, among others. The money will help stabilize businesses that had to shut down or drastically reduce their capacity as COVID-19 surged. As the state begins to emerge from the pandemic, the money will also help venues prepare for the busier fall arts season, said Nicholas Cohen, the executive director of Maryland Citizens for the Arts. “The arts season is a little quiet in the summer. It comes back in the fall,” Cohen said. “What this does is it helps float these venues until then, to really be like, ‘Here we are; we’re back; we’re maybe close to full capacity.’ ” The additional $10 million in state grants will go to more than 60 venues and organizations. For the nearly century-old Potomac Playmakers, the money will help maintain the nonprofit’s new home, which volunteer grant writer Greg Berezuk said the group moved into just before the pandemic shut everything down. “We got in there just before COVID. It’s a wonderful facility for an audience to enjoy a live performance, and we couldn’t use it,” Berezuk said. Fixed costs, such as the mortgage and utilities, had to be paid even without shows, he said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A union that represents about 800 city employees who have been working remotely during the pandemic has filed an unfair labor practices claim against acting Mayor Kim Janey’s administration for unilaterally ordering them back to the office. The Service Employees International Union Local 888 filed the complaint with the state Thursday, the Boston Herald reports. “The City refused in good faith to bargain about health and safety issues, family and childcare issues (especially single and low wage employees), and productivity issues (as the evidence will show that many of the job tasks have been accomplished at a higher rate due to the use of virtual meetings and technology),” the union wrote in the complaint. Janey this month ordered remote workers back in phases in late June and early July. “The city did not explain why the return to physical work locations was necessitated on the dates picked for reopening other than they have the right to do it,” the SEIU wrote. In response to the complaint, a city spokesperson said in a statement: “Mayor Janey remains committed to flexibility, as we fully restore vital services to Boston residents. We do not have further comment at this time on the pending litigation.”\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: People with a disability or a positive HIV test could not be discriminated against during the organ transplant process under legislation passed by the state House. Though the federal Americans with Disabilities Act bans discrimination on the basis of disability during the organ transplant process, organizations such as the National Down Syndrome Society say certain disability designations affect where a person sits on a transplant list, if they even get on a list at all. One bill passed by the House puts Michigan on the same path several states have taken, outlawing the denial of a transplant or lowering a person’s place on an organ waiting list because of their disability. However, no penalty for discrimination is listed in the bill. The other bill would allow patients with HIV to donate their organs to HIV-positive recipients. Both bills must be passed by the state Senate and signed by the governor in order to become law. Nationally, in 2013 the HIV Organ Policy Equity Act lifted a decades­long ban on transplanting HIV-infected organs into recipients. Current state law doesn’t allow Michigan residents to receive organs from individuals who test positive for HIV, so organs that test positive get shipped off to out-of-state recipients.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Staunch conservatives and advocates of legal marijuana have formed an unlikely alliance to pressure the Legislature to allow medical cannabis patients to own guns. The more than 35,000 patients in Minnesota’s program can’t own guns as the law now stands because the federal government classifies marijuana as an illicit drug, on par with heroin, and prohibits anyone who uses an “unlawful” substance from purchasing a firearm. So some gun-rights supporters and pro-legalization groups and legislators are lobbying during the special session to allow the Minnesota Department of Health to petition the federal government for an exemption. The change is being debated as part of the state’s public safety and health and human services budget bills. If their effort is successful, the Star Tribune of Minneapolis reports, Minnesota would be the first of 36 states that allow medical marijuana in some form to appeal directly to the federal government on behalf of its enrollees. The ranks of the state’s medical marijuana patients are expected to triple or quadruple over the next few years under a new law that liberalizes the state’s restrictive program to allow smokable marijuana instead of more expensive pills or liquid extracts.\n\nMississippi\n\nNatchez: The National Park Service on Friday accepted the city’s donation of land at a site that was once one of the largest slave markets in the United States. The federal agency eventually will develop exhibits that tell the history of Forks of the Road, where Black people were sold to work in slavery in Southern plantations from 1833 to 1863. The site in Natchez has had a sign and a small monument made of concrete and shackles. Officials have been working since 2005 on proposals to create a detailed memorial. More than 100 people watched Friday as the city donated nearly 3 acres to the park service in a ceremony that took place a day after President Joe Biden signed legislation to create a federal holiday for Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery in the U.S. on the date when enslaved people in Texas got word of the Emancipation Proclamation. “As we commemorate the celebration of liberty, Juneteenth, and we gather to remember the system of enslavement and the oppression the proceeded this freedom, we acknowledge the tragic story of what happened here at Forks of the Road and within the city of Natchez,” said Lance Hatten, deputy regional director for the National Park Service. “When that truth is told and heard, the journey to healing and unity begins.”\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: Frustrated health officials in the area are imploring residents to get COVID-19 vaccinations as the faster-spreading delta variant of the coronavirus pushes case numbers and hospitalizations higher. Random testing of virus samples has determined that the delta variant, which is more infectious and potentially more deadly than other strains, has become dominant around Springfield and in much of southwest Missouri, said Kendra Findley, administrator of community health and epidemiology with Greene County. Administrators at the two largest hospitals serving the state’s southwestern region – Mercy and CoxHealth – are pleading with residents to get inoculated because COVID-19 patient loads are increasing at a rate they have not previously seen during the pandemic, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. In Greene County, 36% of the population has begun the vaccination process. In most surrounding counties, the figure is below 30%. Erik Frederick, chief administrative officer at Mercy Hospital Springfield, said hospitalizations averaged in the teens a month ago but reached 72 by Thursday. CoxHealth has seen similar numbers. Many of the new patients are young, healthy adults and pregnant women, he said. The delta variant “has become prevalent” across Missouri, state health officials said last week.\n\nMontana\n\nBozeman: Wildlife officials are seeking feedback on a proposal to expand fishing restrictions to protect declining brown trout populations. Biologists with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks and the U.S. Geological Survey have tracked declining numbers of juvenile brown trout in southwest Montana rivers, including the Big Hole, Ruby, Boulder, Beaverhead, upper Yellowstone and upper Stillwater rivers, the Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports. Eric Roberts, fish management bureau chief with Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks, said the trend is concerning because low numbers of younger fish indicate that older fish are not being replaced. Biologists are now gathering public comments on the proposed changes, which include seasonal fishing closures from September to May, catch-and-release requirements, and evening fishing restrictions from 2 p.m. to midnight daily. The changes could also apply to the rivers’ tributaries. Residents can submit comment online, by mail or by attending public meetings Tuesday and Wednesday. Department officials will then develop proposals to be considered in August. Roberts attributed the trout population decline, in part, to changing water temperatures and habitat alterations. He said there are long-term plans in place to address stream flows and enhance habitat.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Amtrak trains are once again rumbling through the state capital on a daily basis. The California Zephyr, which runs from Chicago to San Francisco, has resumed its pre-pandemic schedule of one eastbound and one westbound train stopping in Lincoln in the early hours of each day. ProRail Nebraska, a group of citizens that supports the continuation of passenger train service in the state, met the westbound train at the Lincoln Amtrak station on the first day of resumed daily service, May 24. According to ProRail’s District 1 director, Richard Schmeling, ProRail opposed the pause in daily service, lobbying Nebraska’s federal representatives to support Amtrak through the pandemic. Amtrak spokesman Marc Magliari said daily service was halted on many routes after the Senate declined to pass funding for the service during the pandemic. Now that legislation providing the funding has been passed and signed by the president, he said, Amtrak has resumed service at full capacity. “It enables us to be a better service in the 500 places we serve,” he told the Lincoln Journal Star. It also enabled Amtrak to recall more than 2,000 workers nationally that it put on furlough while service was decreased, Magliari said, including conductors, engineers and service people.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A new kind of jackpot is coming to the Silver State, Gov. Steve Sisolak said Thursday, but only for residents who’ve gotten a COVID-19 shot. The Democratic governor announced a broad effort to encourage reluctant or forgetful residents to get shots, adding his state to a growing list offering unconventional incentives to revive flatlining vaccination programs amid waning demand. Sisolak didn’t call it a lottery, instead terming the “Vax Nevada Days” prize program a raffle because entrants aren’t paying to participate, and vaccines are free. The program makes all residents who have received at least one dose of vaccine since December – along with military members and their dependents – automatically eligible to receive part of $5 million in prize money. Winners will be announced every Thursday for eight weeks beginning July 8. Students ages 12 to 17 can get college tuition credits worth $5,000 to $50,000. People 18 and up are eligible for prizes from $1,000 to $250,000. Among almost 2,000 winners, a $1 million grand prize winner will be announced Aug. 26. “If people are looking for reasons not to get vaccinated, they’re going to come up with one. I’m trying to give people 5 million reasons to get vaccinated,” Sisolak said, referencing the total cash prizes being offered.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHanover: Dartmouth College is providing up to $1 million to encourage students to move off campus to ease a housing crunch this fall. Students can opt to have their names included in a one-time lottery for $5,000 to encourage as many as 200 returning students to live off campus, Mike Wooten, associate dean of residential life, said in an email to students who are on a housing waitlist. Dartmouth is shifting some of its larger doubles to triples and converting lounges to student rooms where possible, but that isn’t enough to alleviate the housing crunch, Wooten said in the email. “As expected, demand has exceeded our capacity,” he wrote. “Although this has been the case in prior years, interest in living on campus has understandably surged following the easing of COVID-19 restrictions.” Some students said the school should be trying harder to house them – or at least better communicate why it can’t. “It hasn’t been made clear of what actions they’ve taken to mitigate this other than the lottery,” David Millman, a sophomore, told WMUR-TV.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nPaterson: Landlords won’t be able to inquire about potential renters’ criminal histories under a new law Gov. Phil Murphy signed Friday. The Democratic governor signed the Fair Chance in Housing Act on what was the state’s first official celebration of Juneteenth as a paid holiday for state workers. “We must commit to both remembering the past and continuing to take action to ensure communities of color, especially Black Americans, achieve the full equity they deserve,” Murphy said in a statement. He also signed legislation making the third Friday in June a state holiday. June 19 – or Juneteenth – commemorates when word reached enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, that slavery had been abolished. President Joe Biden signed similar nationwide legislation Thursday. The new housing measure aims to eliminate housing instability that contributes to recidivism, according to the governor. The new law won’t apply in cases where federal law permits landlords to ask about certain criminal convictions.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said Friday that all remaining pandemic-related public health restrictions on commercial and day-to-day activity in the state will be lifted July 1, clearing the way for restaurants and other venues to operate without any capacity limits and for cities to plan in-person Fourth of July celebrations and other summer festivals. The Democratic governor made the declaration as state health officials continued to crunch the vaccination numbers following a push that included a multimillion-dollar sweepstakes, other cash incentives and offers that included free child care for those who needed it in order to get their shot. Lujan Grisham wanted at least 60% of residents 16 and up to be vaccinated two weeks ahead of the reopening. Her office said that vaccinations stood at 59.4% on Thursday but that health officials were waiting for more federal data to come in that would push the state closer to its goal. Still, the governor said in a statement that she had hoped the numbers would be higher by now. “The variants across the globe and in the U.S. present very serious risks to unvaccinated people, even young people,” she said. “We all, each of us, have the power to stop the serious illnesses and deaths: Get your shot. It’s safe. It works. It’s that simple.”\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Fifteen months after shuttering for the pandemic, Radio City Music Hall reopened its doors Saturday for the Tribeca Festival premiere of a new Dave Chappelle documentary for a full-capacity, fully vaccinated audience. The debut of “Dave Chappelle: This Time This Place,” which chronicles Chappelle’s pandemic stand-up series held in rural Ohio cornfields, marked the first time the hallowed hall was packed since closing in March 2020. The premiere Saturday evening, the closing night gala for the 20th Tribeca Festival, was seen as a symbolic reawakening of the arts in New York, where many of the world’s most famous stages – Carnegie Hall, Lincoln Center, Broadway theaters – remain dark. On Sunday, Madison Square Garden hosted its first full-capacity concert with the Foo Fighters. “Springsteen on Broadway” is set to resume performances June 26. After the Tribeca screening, Chappelle took the stage and paused for a moment to apologize for those who lost someone during the pandemic before signaling a note of revival. “But, man, let’s get up,” he said, before introducing a New York feast of hip-hop acts who performed according to their native borough, including Q-Tip, Talib Kweli, Fat Joe, A$AP Ferg, Redman, Ghostface Killah and De La Soul.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed gun-rights legislation Friday that would allow parishioners at more churches to be armed, marking the second year in a row that he’s blocked the idea. The legislation affirms that people going to religious services at a location where private schools or some charter schools also meet can carry handguns in full view or under clothing if they have a concealed weapons permit. There would be other limits. The Democratic governor said the measure, which cleared the Legislature this month, would endanger educators and children. State law otherwise prohibits guns on educational property for nearly everyone. “For the safety of students and teachers, North Carolina should keep guns off school grounds,” Cooper wrote in his veto message. The bill’s supporters contend these houses of worship where K-12 schools also are located are at a security disadvantage for their congregants compared to stand-alone churches. There are no such blanket prohibitions in these churches on carrying a pistol, provided the person has a purchase permit or concealed weapons permit. The bill also contains another provision that allows additional law enforcement employees – such as a civilian front desk worker at a police station – to carry a concealed weapon on the job if the police chief or sheriff allows.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: State regulators have again extended a deadline for Meridian Energy Group to begin construction on its $1 billion oil refinery near Theodore Roosevelt National Park or risk losing its permit. Meridian’s permit from the state Department of Environmental Quality was set to expire June 12 unless construction had begun on the Davis Refinery. Earlier this month the company asked for an extension on that deadline, citing delays related to the coronavirus pandemic and litigation. Recent lawsuits against Meridian have called into question the company’s ability to pay workers, the Bismarck Tribune reports. Regulators granted an extension until Sept. 12 to start construction, a month short of what Meridian had requested. “The reasons seemed to make sense, and we thought, ‘We’ll give you guys the summer to hopefully work out your stuff and then start construction,’ ” state Environmental Engineer David Stroh said. “We requested an update from them in a little over a month so we could get a better feel for how things are progressing out there, knowing there’s a lot of attention to this facility.” Refinery opponents are concerned in part about its proximity to the national park. The North Dakota Supreme Court issued a pair of rulings last year clearing the way for the refinery to move forward.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: Some casinos and racinos could be left with losing tickets if the state Senate’s sports betting legislation giving professional teams priority for obtaining brick-and mortar sports book licenses is ultimately enacted. A bill approved Wednesday by the Senate and sent to the House for consideration assigns the 30 total sports books to counties based on population. If professional sports teams in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati all decided to apply for licenses, casinos and racinos in Cuyahoga, Franklin and Hamilton counties would be shut out at the sports betting window of opportunity in the Senate’s bill. Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland, for example, has three professional sports teams as well as a downtown casino and a racino in the suburbs. Dan Reinhard, a senior vice president for the JACK Cleveland casino and a spokesperson for the casino and racino group Get Gaming Right Ohio, said Friday that the Senate bill “disrespects” casino employees. “An artificial cap that locks out gaming companies in the biggest, most populous counties doesn’t make a lot of sense,” he said. “We know how to do this. This is the business we’re in. We’re going to work with all parties to make sure this cap is dealt with.” The original Senate bill introduced in May excluded casinos and racinos altogether.\n\nOklahoma\n\nPryor: Electric vehicle company Canoo announced Thursday it has selected Pryor for its U.S. manufacturing facility, which is expected to employ 2,000 people. The Los Angeles-based company plans to build its factory on a 400-acre campus at the MidAmerica Industrial Park near Tulsa. It will include a paint and body shop, along with a general assembly plant, and is targeted to open in 2023. “Oklahoma has always been a pioneer in the energy industry, and this partnership with Canoo shows that our state is an innovation leader in electric vehicle technology,” Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement. “We are thrilled to partner with Canoo and Chairman and CEO Tony Aquila to provide high-paying jobs for Oklahomans and position America as the global leader for vehicle manufacturing for decades to come.” Aquila cited Oklahoma’s strategic location and business-friendly policies as reasons Oklahoma was selected. Tulsa was in the running last year for a Tesla electric vehicle manufacturing facility that ultimately went to Austin, Texas.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: A second Republican in the state Senate is facing a recall effort after showing up to oppose a gun-control bill earlier this year. Oregon Public Broadcasting reports a Mount Vernon resident named Patrick Kopke-Hales has initiated a petition process that, if successful, could force a recall election against state Sen. Lynn Findley, R-Vale. Findley was one of six Republicans to attend a March 25 floor session, granting quorum to supermajority Democrats against the wishes of many gun-rights supporters. Though Findley spoke forcefully against Senate Bill 554 that day, Democrats passed the proposal to create new gun storage laws, ban guns in the Capitol and Portland International Airport, and allow Oregon schools and universities to implement their own bans. Senate Majority Leader Fred Girod is also facing a prospective recall because of SB 554’s passage, reflecting increasing pressure on Republicans to flee the Capitol over controversial bills after doing so to block climate change legislation in 2019 and 2020. The gun-control bill is currently the subject of a referendum effort that could give voters a final say on the law in November 2022. Findley said in a statement that “fighting for conservative values in Salem is my priority, not playing political games.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Consuewella Dotson Africa, a longtime member of the Black organization MOVE and mother of two children killed in the 1985 bombing of the group’s home, has died at age 67. A member of the MOVE family, Janine Africa, said Consuewella Africa had tested positive for the coronavirus when she went to a hospital around the beginning of the month but had largely recovered when doctors said last week that she was not getting enough oxygen. “Through the stress with everything that was happening, her body just could not fight to get the air in her lungs because she was too burnt out and tore down from the stress,” Janine Africa said. Africa’s death follows painful revelations in the past few months about the treatment of the remains of her two daughters who were killed in the police bombing of the organization’s Philadelphia home, where 11 members – including five children – were killed, and more than 60 homes were burnt to the ground. Her daughters, 14-year-old Katricia “Tree” and 12-year-old Zanetta “Netta,” died in the bombing while Consuewella Africa was in prison serving a 16-year-sentence for simple assault related to the city’s 1978 attempt to evict the group during which a police officer was killed. Consuewella Africa held the title “Minister of Confrontation” for MOVE, which identifies as both a family and an organization.\n\nRhode Island\n\nBristol: A town that was a center of the trans-Atlantic slave trade commemorated Juneteenth by unveiling a new marker recognizing its role in slavery. Officials on Saturday placed the first of two planned slavery markers in town at the Linden Place Museum, a mansion built in the 1800s by General George DeWolf, a prominent merchant and slave trader. Another medallion will be placed later this month at DeWolf Tavern. The markers are being installed at sites around the state connected to the trans-Atlantic slave trade by the Rhode Island Slave History Medallion project. They’ve been placed at Smith’s Castle in North Kingstown, Bowen’s Wharf in Newport, and Patriot’s Park in Portsmouth, according to organizers. Students and faculty from Roger Williams University planned to discuss their original research into the town’s slavery legacy. University officials say the work includes new information about the town’s lesser-known slave-trading families, as well as stories of enslaved Africans who lived and worked in town, such as Bristol Finney, a 19-year-old enslaved African who ran away from his owners. Saturday’s ceremony featured music and dance from a local African performance group, and the museum offered tours.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nDarlington: Historians are trying to shed light on five forgotten cemeteries in the state’s Pee Dee region. WMBF-TV reports the Darlington County Historical Commission and Clemson Professor Jim Frederick located the five graveyards near Dargan’s Pond on current Clemson property. The experts identified two African American cemeteries, two Native American burial grounds and a graveyard that dates back to the Revolutionary War. One of the sites is the cemetery of Cpt. William Standard, who was deeded land in Darlington County for his heroic service during the Revolutionary War. The pair of Native American burial grounds could date back more than 500 years. And one of the African American cemeteries is linked to one of the county’s oldest African American church congregations, the historians said. It started shortly after emancipation and was connected to the Pleasant Grove Baptist Church, where it was active until the church moved locations in the 1950s. “It relates to an African American congregation that is one of the oldest congregations in Darlington County,” he said. “They lost their connection in a very unique way, and I believe there’s three factors to that.” The historians say they are now working to identify individuals in the old church cemetery.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The union representing workers at a Smithfield Foods plant said Friday that its members have voted in favor of a new contract. Union leaders say the deal sends a message to the meatpacking industry that companies need to recognize the sacrifices its employees made during the coronavirus pandemic. The Smithfield plant was the nation’s most active hot spot for COVID-19 cases in the early weeks of the pandemic. Nearly 1,300 workers at the Sioux Falls pork processing plant tested positive for the virus, and four workers died. B.J. Motley, president of the Union Food and Commercial Workers Local 304A, said in a statement that the new contract includes fair pay, benefits and safety protections that workers have earned and deserve. “Ensuring these jobs continue to provide the good pay and benefits working families need is the best way for us to honor our country’s essential workers,” Motley said. The contract includes a base rate of $18.75 an hour, up from $17, and a $520 bonus. The union had voted earlier this month to authorize a strike after Motley said that Smithfield wanted the workers to pay more for health care and refused to increase pay to comparable rates of other meatpacking plants in the region.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A development that organizers say “is poised to become the second-largest Black-owned film studio in the United States” moved one step closer to fruition this month when the Land Use Control Board approved the zoning adjustments necessary to build BLP Film Studios, an 85-acre production facility in the Whitehaven neighborhood. “Our goal is to make Memphis the international epicenter for producing films and projects led by Black and brown creators on the production and directing side of those projects,” said Jason A. Farmer, 52, a former Marine and business executive who for the past few several years has been working to launch BLP, which he said would be eclipsed only by Tyler Perry’s facilities in Atlanta. Farmer said he believes BLP – the name is an acronym for Black Lens Productions – will attract investors as film and TV companies work to address the “diversity, equality and inclusion” concerns that have sparked debate within the entertainment industry. “Black and brown consumers are becoming more savvy,” he said, “and we find ourselves with none of the legacy production companies” that produce most of the high-profile content that brings customers to move theaters, cable channels and streaming service. He said groundbreaking is scheduled to begin in the fall.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott followed through on a threat Friday and vetoed the new state budget’s line item providing for legislative staff pay. The Republican governor had threatened the veto after a walkout by House Democrats in the final hours of the regular legislative session. The walkout denied a House quorum to vote on controversial voting restrictions that Abbott had prioritized. “Texans don’t run from a legislative fight, and they don’t walk away from unfinished business,” Abbott said in Friday’s veto message. “Funding should not be provided for those who quit their job early, leaving their state with unfinished business and exposing taxpayers to higher costs for an additional legislative session.” However, a summer special session already was expected so that the Legislature can redraw district lines for congressional, legislative and other government offices. The budget is to take effect Sept. 1. Abbott is expected to push the voting-restrictions bill again during the summer special session. Rep. Chris Turner, who chairs the House Democratic Caucus, engineered the walkout. In a statement Friday, he called Abbott’s veto “tyrannical” and the latest indication the Republican governor “is out of control.” The caucus is considering all of its options, Turner said, “including immediate legal options.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Home prices around the capital city jumped a staggering 31% over the past year in the latest sign of Utah’s housing crisis. Wasatch Front real estate agents have decried the dire lack of homes on the market as prices climb and sales bog down, the Salt Lake Tribune reports. Salt Lake County’s median price on a single-family home inched past the eye-catching $500,000 mark sometime in March and then reached $535,000 last month, new data shows. Average new home listings now draw 30 to 40 offers and sell in five days, the Salt Lake Board of Realtors said. The group said more construction is desperately needed to fill the gap. Nationwide, there’s a housing deficit of roughly 5.5 million units, according to an industry study that calls for ramping up the rate of U.S. homebuilding to add 2 million homes yearly over the next decade, compared with last year’s 1.3 million units built. In Utah, the shortfall is between 45,000 and 50,000 single-family homes, apartments and other housing types, with an especially serious need for more affordable homes accessible to residents making average wages.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The University of Vermont Food Systems Research Center is getting $11 million in federal funding to support its work researching the regional food system, from production agriculture to food security, UVM and U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy announced Friday. The center is a collaboration between the university and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Agricultural Research Service, officials said. Vermonters turned to their local farms for food security when the pandemic struck, Leahy said in a statement. “Farms are an economic driver for our rural communities and local food is a defining feature of Vermont,” Leahy said. “We must continue to cultivate our food systems so our state can thrive and weather future emergencies.” USDA scientists are now being picked to work on campus with university researchers. “This is the first and only ARS research unit designed specifically to study diversified food systems and the smaller farms that contribute to those systems,” said UVM College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Dean Leslie Parise. “We are proud to be leading this work at UVM and believe there is much the rest of the world can learn from the successful small- and medium-sized farms that characterize Vermont agriculture.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: After twists and turns on the road to legalizing simple possession of marijuana, advocacy groups have been flooded with calls from people trying to understand exactly what will be allowed under state law as of July 1. Legislators initially voted in February to legalize possession of up to an ounce of cannabis for adult recreational use – but not until 2024, when retail sales would begin. An outcry ensued over the three-year wait before ending pot possession penalties, so in April the Legislature voted to move up legalization to this July 1. Adding to the confusion: Lawmakers included a “reenactment clause,” which means the General Assembly will have to vote again next year on major portions of the law, mainly to establish a regulatory framework for the legal pot marketplace. The process has resulted in some contradictions that may not get resolved until years after legalization begins. Sen. Adam Ebbin, one of the lead sponsors, said people “still need to be careful.” Possession of up to one ounce with no intent to distribute will become legal for those 21 and older. Adults will also be allowed to grow up to four plants per household. But not much else will change. Buying and selling marijuana will remain illegal until 2024, when retail sales are expected to begin. Smoking marijuana in public also remains against the law.\n\nWashington\n\nMount Vernon: The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed listing a bird found in the North Cascades as threatened under the Endangered Species Act due to the likelihood that climate change will shrink its high-elevation habitat throughout the state. The Mount Rainier white-tailed ptarmigan is found in the Cascade Mountains from southern British Columbia to southern Washington, the Skagit Valley Herald reports. It is one of few animals that spend their entire lives on mountaintops. White-tailed ptarmigans move seasonally between snow-covered habitat and summer alpine meadows. As temperatures continue to warm, the region’s snowpack will decline. Alpine meadows may also be at risk as conditions move tree lines to higher elevations. “As the iconic alpine meadows of Washington diminish with climate change, this alpine bird … will be pushed out of the home it is specially adapted to,” U.S. Fish and Wildlife spokesperson Andrew LaValle said. The state Department of Fish & Wildlife lists the Mount Rainier white-tailed ptarmigan as a species of greatest concern and as highly vulnerable to climate change. The Fish and Wildlife Service proposal includes rules to protect the birds from types of intentional and unintentional harm and says a species recovery plan will be written after the listing becomes official.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice declared an end to the state’s indoor mask requirement Sunday as a $1 million winner was revealed in a drawing for residents who have received COVID-19 vaccines. Karen Foley of Mineral Wells won the top prize announced on a sweltering Father’s Day at the Capitol Complex during a celebration of the state’s 158th birthday. “Now we’re going to probably change somebody’s life in lots of ways,” Justice said before Foley’s name was announced. Prizes in separate drawings also held Sunday included custom pickup trucks, state park weekend trips, lifetime hunting and fishing licenses, and hunting rifles and shotguns. Two younger vaccinated residents won college scholarships, including tuition, room and board, and books. Justice announced a series of random drawings May 27. The deadline for Sunday’s drawing was last Wednesday, and the winners were drawn Thursday. More than 246,000 West Virginians had registered. The names of entrants who don’t win will be carried over week to week. Residents can still sign up for six other drawings, which will be held on Wednesdays from June 30 to Aug. 4. The final drawing will include a $1.588 million grand prize and a $588,000 second prize.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson joined in a Juneteenth Day celebration in his home state only to see his speech drowned out by a chorus of boos. Johnson made an appearance Saturday at a Republican Party booth in Milwaukee, where he drew a growing crowd once people recognized him. Some people swore at him and said: “We don’t want you here.” Last year Johnson blocked legislation to make Juneteenth a national holiday. Last week he relented while saying that “it still seems strange” that taxpayers should fund time off for federal employees to celebrate the end of slavery. The bill was quickly passed and signed by President Joe Biden. When asked what he thought of the boos Saturday, Johnson said: “This is unusual for Wisconsin. Most people in Wisconsin say, ‘You are in our prayers; we are praying for you.’ … But you got some people here that are just sort of nasty at some points.” One attendee, Robert Agnew, said he thought the reason for the taunting was that “Ron Johnson’s politics are not for us.”\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Supporters of two new marijuana ballot petitions say they’re optimistic about getting pot questions before voters next year, especially with growing support from conservatives in the deep-red state. Even so, they face daunting odds because of the difficulty of getting such initiatives on the ballot and failing to do so four years ago. The Legislature legalized hemp and hemp oil in 2019, but Wyoming is among a dwindling number of states that haven’t approved marijuana in some form. Thirty-six states now allow medical marijuana, and 17 have approved recreational marijuana, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. This time around, some Republicans are finding common cause with Democrats and others on marijuana. “It’s well past due,” state Rep. Mark Baker said. “If they’re successful in reaching the ballot and putting the question to the people, I do think it is going to be successful.” Baker, R-Green River, stepped down as director of the state chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws after being elected last year. Other outspoken supporters include a state representative who last year became the first Libertarian Party candidate elected to a U.S. statehouse in 20 years. One petition would seek to legalize marijuana for medical use. The other would decriminalize it.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/21"}]}

He surveyed the damage Monday morning as Neenah-Menasha firefighters extinguished hot spots in the ruins.\n\n\"It's just a shame that it's gone,\" Thompson told The Post-Crescent. \"It really is. I had a lot of blood, sweat and tears in that place.\"\n\nThe cause of the fire wasn't immediately known. Neenah-Menasha Fire Rescue said it will take several days to conclude its investigation.\n\nRELATED: No injuries after fire at former Whiting Paper Mill in Menasha\n\nRELATED: Fire crews are battling a fire at the Whiting Mill in Menasha\n\nIn 2018, a fire caused massive damage to the historic Brin Building at 1 Main St. The damage was so extensive that the iconic structure was razed for redevelopment.\n\nLosing two landmarks in less than three years is not unprecedented.\n\n\"There have been plenty of times in the history of the Twin Cities when there has been a series of catastrophes,\" Neenah-Menasha historian Peter Adams said. \"It just sometimes happens.\"\n\nThe Whiting mill was known as the George A. Whiting Paper Co. for most of its history.\n\nAccording to the 1958 book \"History of Neenah\" by S.F. Shattuck, the mill was built by George A. Whiting and the Gilbert Brothers — Theodore and William. It had one 76-inch paper machine for the manufacture of rag-content paper. The mill operated as Gilbert and Whiting until 1886, when Whiting bought the Gilberts' interest.\n\nOn Aug. 23, 1888, a fire started in the mill's engine house and led to a catastrophic explosion that killed 16 people.\n\n\"The firemen hosed the building down, and the cold water hit the hot steel of the bleaching drum, which then exploded,\" Adams said.\n\nAccording to an Aug. 25, 1951, anniversary story in the Appleton Post-Crescent, the rotary drum shot through the mill and into the air like a missile and smashed into a group of spectators, who had gathered on an elevated railroad track to watch the fire. \"Several hit by the bleacher were decapitated,\" the paper said. The tragedy became known as \"Menasha's Woe\" due to a headline in the Menasha Saturday Evening Press.\n\nWhiting used an insurance payment to rebuild the mill after the fire and explosion.\n\n\"The present, oldest section of the mill was rebuilt later that same year,\" Adams said. \"The offices were added in 1894, and the other outbuildings were early 20th century.\"\n\nAdams said Whiting was a major player in the Wisconsin paper industry but is perhaps less known in the Fox River Valley because he invested in operations in the Wisconsin River Valley.\n\n\"Whiting himself has a history that ties all of the major paper companies together,\" Adams said. \"He was originally supposed to be part of Kimberly-Clark, but because he had no money to put in, he was dropped.\"\n\nIn 1893 Whiting organized the Plover Paper Co. at the junction of the Plover and Wisconsin rivers, according to the Wisconsin Historical Society. The town that grew up around the mill was called Whiting, and the offices of the firm eventually were moved to Stevens Point as the Whiting-Plover Paper Co.\n\nWhiting died in 1930. The company continued under the leadership of Frank B. Whiting and George A. Whiting II. It was run by Brock Whiting when Thompson worked at the mill.\n\n\"It was a family-owned business,\" Thompson said. \"Mr. (Brock) Whiting cared about the Fox River Valley and the employees. He treated the employees real good.\"\n\nThe company stayed in the family until 2014, when Tom Danz, who had been Whiting's president since 1999 and CEO since 2011, bought the company.\n\nDanz hoped to survive as a specialty papermaker but closed the company in 2016. It had 28 employees at the time.\n\n\"We made a high-quality product, but we just couldn't achieve the sales we needed,\" Danz said at the time.\n\nThe mill, located on a strip of land between the Menasha navigational canal and the Fox River near the Fox Cities Trestle Trail, has been vacant since. Danz still owns it.\n\nContact Duke Behnke at 920-993-7176 or dbehnke@gannett.com. Follow him on Twitter at @DukeBehnke.

The toll will probably surpass 60 and make the disaster the deadliest since Hawaii became a state in 1959, Gov. Josh Green said.\n\nThe death count continues to climb and parts of coastal communities have been largely destroyed, including the historic town of Lahaina. He referenced the 1960 tsunami that hit the Big Island, killing 61 people, and said: \"This time it's very likely that our death totals will significantly exceed that, I'm afraid.''\n\nGreen also said \"maybe upwards of 1,700 buildings'' were destroyed by the fires, which now appear to be mostly under control. Roughly 1,000 people remain missing, according to Maui County Police Chief John Pelletier.\n\nBut some fires are still burning in Lahaina and surrounding areas. “Lahaina, with a few rare exceptions, has been burned down,” the governor said.\n\nAt an afternoon press briefing, Green said damage to the area is in the billions of dollars and that it will take years to bring about repair. “It’s a profound change of landscape,” Green said of the massive fire damage to the area. He said that footage from the fires will be released late Thursday.\n\nHe pleaded with local hotels and others to come forward and help with the unprecedented need for temporary housing for people in need. He said the state is initially seeking 2,000 rooms for people displaced in the fires.\n\n“If you have additional space in your home, if you have the capacity to take someone in from West Maui, please do,” Green said.\n\nMaui County reported the most damaging of the three blazes, the one in Lahaina on the western part of the island, was 80% contained by Thursday morning, and that another one in Pulehu in central Maui was at 70% containment. There was no assessment yet about the fire in the mountainous Upcountry.\n\nLater in the day, Maui County Fire Chief Brad Ventura said none of the fires are “100% contained right now,” and there are several small fires in between the large fires. There is still potential for “rapid fire behavior” with the weather and told people to remain out of the area.\n\nRescue crews searched for survivors Thursday amid the devastation left behind in Maui by the deadliest U.S. wildfire in five years, which injured dozens.\n\nEntire blocks of homes, businesses and a 200-year-old church were destroyed or damaged in Lahaina Town. In less than two days, neighborhoods from a community that dates to the 1700s turned into smoky rubble, with charred bodies inside burned-out cars and scorched boats in the harbor as the grim remnants.\n\nThe fires − fueled by wind from passing Hurricane Dora and exacerbated by overly dry vegetation from the ongoing drought − were so intense that the Coast Guard rescued 14 people who fled into the ocean to escape flames and smoke, including two children.\n\n“We are still in life-preservation mode. Search and rescue is still a primary concern,” said Adam Weintraub, a spokesperson for Hawaii Emergency Management Agency. Officials said they will provide daily updates on all AM and FM radio channels at 9 a.m., noon, and 3 p.m. Hawaii time.\n\nNot since the 2018 Camp Fire in California, which killed at least 85 and wiped out the town of Paradise, had a U.S. community endured such a deadly wildfire. The Hawaii toll is expected to rise as rescuers get to parts of the island that have been been unreachable because of fires or obstructions.\n\nWildfires were also still burning on the Big Island, but no injuries or destroyed homes had been reported, Mayor Mitch Roth said.\n\nMaps, before-and-after images of the destruction in Hawaii caused by Maui fires\n\n“We are still in life-preservation mode.

Before delivering a speech in Salt Lake City, Biden addressed the catastrophic fires and said: “We’ll get aid into the hands of people who desperately need the help. Anyone who’s lost a loved one or whose home has been damaged is going to get help immediately.’’\n\nFederal aid will be available to support state and local recovery efforts after Biden made the declaration.\n\n\"Assistance can include grants for temporary housing and home repairs, low-cost loans to cover uninsured property losses and other programs to help individuals and business owners recover from the effects of the disaster,\" according to a statement from the White House.\n\nBiden said he instructed FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell, who is expected to arrive in the state Friday, to streamline help processes. He encouraged those who want to find out if they're eligible for federal help to get information at disasterassistance.gov.\n\nCrowdsourcing effort helps friends, relatives reconnect\n\nTwo days after rapidly spreading wildfires began tearing through areas of Maui, some families and friends still haven't heard from loved ones believed to be living or traveling there. They’ve taken to a crowdsourced online effort to locate hundreds of people as of Thursday morning because power outages and loss of cellphone signal have left them out of contact.\n\nA spreadsheet created by resident Ellie Erickson and shared widely on social media showed people from around the globe trying to reach those they know on the island, local station KHON2 reported.\n\n“I really hope that it can be kind of a place where if people are wondering about their friends, their loved ones, if they know somebody is safe they can come onto here and hopefully just give people peace of mind,” Erickson told the station.\n\nMany of the names on the list had been accounted for, scattered at emergency shelters, the airport or turning up with family members. But hundreds of people were still marked “not located” Thursday, and more were being added.\n\nAlexis Plume, a resident of Haiku – about 34 miles from Lahaina – was finally able to call her brother’s best friend in Lahaina Thursday morning. Plume said communication had not been possible with them because of disrupted cell phone service in the area.\n\n‘It’s a real big relief,” Plume said. “Everything is really hard to watch and we’re all just sort of trying to figure out what we can do.”\n\nNetblocks, a cybersecurity company, has been monitoring the network connectivity and found Lahaina still remains largely disconnected as of Thursday.\n\n“It's crucial to remain patient if you're trying to reach loved ones in the region,” Alp Toker, founder and director of the company, said on X, formerly known as Twitter. “Connectivity challenges may make communication sporadic but rescue efforts are ongoing so don't lose hope.”\n\n− Jeanine Santucci & Itzel Luna\n\nFamilies with nowhere else to go; concerns for the homeless\n\nOn Thursday, Leomana Turalde was at Maui's Maalea Harbor, about 16 miles east of the worst damage at Lahaina, where he was headed to help find missing people. “In every parking lot on the island” it seemed there were families sleeping in their rental cars Thursday morning with nowhere else to go, he said.\n\nThere were still some small fires burning throughout Maui on Thursday, Turalde, 36, told USA TODAY. There was also heavy traffic around National Guard checkpoints and chain stores are shut down, he said.\n\nTuralde said he's most worried about friends and one cousin who are homeless.\n\n“They’re all devastated,” he said. “If I can help out those people, that’s kind of my main concern because nobody really cares about the homeless person with no ID.”\n\n− Claire Thornton\n\nWhat travelers should know about the Maui wildfires\n\nHawaii's tourism arm is encouraging travelers with trips planned to areas impacted by the wildfires to reschedule if possible.\n\n“All nonessential travel to the Island of Maui is strongly discouraged,” acting Hawaii Gov. Sylvia Luke wrote in an emergency proclamation Wednesday, which extended the emergency period until Aug. 31.\n\nThe state of emergency is in effect for the entire state, though so far the fires have been limited to Maui and the northwest part of the Big Island of Hawaii.\n\nTravel to other parts of the Big Island is still welcome, as well as to Kauai, Oahu, Molokai and Lanai. Travelers can check with their specific hotels and airlines for special waiver policies amid the wildfires.\n\n− Eve Chen\n\nOfficials work to suppress fire, restore power\n\nEvacuation efforts have been complicated by power blackouts, a lack of cell service, the loss of 911 service and downed power lines in different parts of the islands. More than 11,000 customers remained without power Thursday according to Poweroutage.us.\n\nMaj. Gen. Kenneth Hara, commander general of the Hawaii Army National Guard, said Wednesday night that officials were working to restore communication, distribute water and possibly add law enforcement personnel. He said National Guard helicopters had flown for 13 hours and dropped 150,000 gallons of water on the fires.\n\nCounty officials said three active fires on Maui remained unchanged at the end of the day Wednesday. Firefighters have been dealing with multiple flareups and have requested additional personnel from Honolulu.\n\nSen. Mazie Hirono said the priorities include fire suppression and restoring telephone access and electrical power as search and rescue efforts continue.\n\n“This is truly an all hands on deck situation,” Hirono said.\n\nTourists and residents fleeing to Maui airport\n\nAbout 11,000 visitors flew out of Maui on Wednesday, and at least another 1,500 expected to leave Thursday, according to Ed Sniffen, state transportation director. The Hawaii Convention Center in Honolulu was being prepared to accommodate up to 4,000 people displaced by the wildfires.\n\nLahaina resident Jordan Saribay saw homes burst into flames “as tall as the buildings because they were engulfing them.’’ Debris turned into dangerous projectiles as people whose cars had run out of gas tried to flee while carrying their prized possessions, he said.\n\n“While driving through the neighborhood, it looked like a war zone,’’ Saribay said. “Houses throughout that neighborhood were already on fire. I’m driving through the thickest black smoke, and I don’t know what’s on the other side or what’s in front of me.’’\n\nFirefighters could see some relief with winds letting up\n\nThe high winds fueling wildfires began to wane late Wednesday and will continue to ease during the day Thursday and into Friday, providing some much needed relief for firefighters battling the blazes, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Heather Zehr told USA TODAY.\n\nZehr said wind gusts Thursday could occasionally get to 30-35 mph; local peaks of 40 mph were possible. Later in the day and into Friday, that should ease further with gusts not getting over about 20 mph.\n\n“It should be better conditions now for today, easier for the firefighters to be able to do what they need to do and hopefully get some better control over these fires,” Zehr said.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nWhy devastated Lahaina Town is such a cherished place on Maui\n\nResidents and visitors are mourning the loss of cultural and religious sites in Lahaina Town that trace their roots back centuries.\n\nLahaina, which was once the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii, has a population of around 13,000, according to the 2020 U.S. Census. Lahaina Town has also long claimed home to the largest banyan tree in the U.S., which was scorched by the fires.\n\nFor Francine Hollinger, a 66-year-old Native Hawaiian, losing Lahaina was \"like losing a family member.\"\n\nIn just a few hours, the wind-driven blaze tore through popular Front Street and decimated the town center, which traces its roots to the 1700s and was on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n“Lahaina Town is now burned down to ashes, the whole entire town − hotels, buildings, the historic sites,'' said Leomana Turalde, who said his mother worked for years as a dancer at Old Lahaina Luau, considered a \"well-preserved epicenter of Hawaiian culture and storytelling,\" according to its website.\n\nHow drought helped fuel Hawaii wildfires\n\nMuch of the state is in varying levels of drought, and parts of Maui are affected by moderate and severe drought conditions, including some areas around Lahaina, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. An estimated 263,948 Hawaii residents are living in drought areas, the Drought Monitor said Thursday.\n\nThe duration and severity of droughts in Hawaii have increased over the last century, the National Integrated Drought Information System has warned.\n\nA drought dries out vegetation, adding power to a wildfire, AccuWeather senior meteorologist Heather Zehr told USA TODAY. That risk could continue, as there’s no rainfall expected soon for the part of Maui impacted by fire.\n\n“As long as you’re stuck in this pattern when you’re not getting a lot of rainfall, you’re going to continue to have these problems where it doesn’t take much to start a fire and it takes even less to make it spread,” Zehr said.\n\n− Jeanine Santucci\n\nAerial photos show damage in Lahaina, Banyan Court\n\nSatellite imagery and photos from the ground revealed the devastating damage wildfires have done to Maui landmarks including Lahaina's iconic banyan tree, Front Street and Waiola Church.\n\nThe banyan tree, planted in 1873 after being imported from India, was threatened by the fires and suffered damage to trunks and limbs but remains standing, the Honolulu Civil Beat reported.\n\nWhat caused the Maui fires?\n\nHigh winds and low humidity likely contributed to the fires, but officials know little else, Hara said at a briefing Wednesday. Hurricane Dora, a Category 4 storm in the Pacific Ocean, fueled the strong winds overnight in Maui, with gusts of 60 mph damaging homes and knocking out power.\n\nBut some experts said they suspect human development on the island is at least partly to blame for the destruction.\n\nWildfires have quadrupled in Hawaii in recent decades, and many scientists say the culprit is unmanaged, non-native grasslands planted by plantations and ranchers and others unfamiliar with the island's native ecosystems. The grass is dry and prone to fires.\n\n“There is no doubt that fire-prone grasses have invaded drier Hawaiian ecosystems and brought larger, more intense fires,” said Peter Vitousek, a professor of earth sciences at Stanford University in Palo Alto, California.\n\n− Marc Ramirez\n\nMaui death toll climbs\n\nAt least 36 people have died in the Lahaina fire in Hawaii, Maui County wrote in a statement posted to the county website Wednesday evening.\n\nSix patients were flown from Maui to the island of Oahu on Tuesday night, said Speedy Bailey, regional director for the air-ambulance company Hawaii Life Flight. Three of them had critical burns and were taken to Straub Medical Center’s burn unit in Honolulu, he said. The others were taken to other Honolulu hospitals. At least 20 patients were taken to Maui Memorial Medical Center, said Bailey.\n\nMaui fire map\n\nMaui wildfire map: A look at how Hurricane Dora and low humidity are fueling Hawaii fires\n\n'Maui Strong': Here's how to help Hawaii fire victims\n\nMaj. Gen. Kenneth Hara, from the Hawaii State Department of Defense, asked those who want to donate supplies or volunteer to do so through the Hawaii Emergency Management Agency. James Kunane Tokioka, director of the department of business, economic development and tourism, said the governor has also asked people with vacant homes or vacation rentals to provide shelter for those in need.\n\nSeveral shelters are open to assist those on the islands and several local organizations are collecting donations. USA TODAY compiled resources for Americans to help people and animals in Hawaii here.\n\nBy Wednesday, the Hawaii Community Foundation said its Maui Strong Fund had raised more than $1 million to support residents affected by the wildfires. Funding will be used for \"evolving needs, including shelter, food, financial assistance and other services as identified by our partners doing critical work on Maui,\" the foundation said in a statement.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press; Ashley Lewis and Kayla Jimenez, USA TODAY", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/08/10"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2018/08/21/fire-landmark-mercantile-feed-store-mesquite-causes-250-k-damage/1053692002/", "title": "Fire near Landmark Mercantile feed store in Mesquite causes $250K ...", "text": "MESQUITE - A fire engulfed 800 tons of hay and a shed adjacent to Landmark Mercantile in Mesquite on Tuesday morning — the second blaze in the vicinity of the business in less than a year's span.\n\nAnd the fire could keep burning for several days.\n\nAccording to the mercantile's owner, the fire is burning on a property immediately adjacent to the store that belongs to a family member of the mercantile's owners.\n\nQuarter-million dollars in damage\n\nAbout 6:10 a.m., Doña Ana County fire departments received a report of a fire near the mercantile, 12000 Stern Drive in Mesquite, according to a county fire official.\n\nWhen crews arrived at 6:27 a.m., the shed and hay — valued at $250,000 — were fully engulfed in flames.\n\nThe fire department's focus was to make sure the fire didn't spread to another nearby hay shed, as well as the main mercantile building, located just east of the building on fire, said Doña Ana County Fire Department Capt. Arturo Herrera.\n\n\"The wind was in our favor this morning,\" Herrera said. \"It was pushing everything to the west.\"\n\nDozens of animals, including two camels, live in pens outside the mercantile — an estimated 50 feet from the fire.\n\n\"There were no injuries reported to responders or the public or to any of the animals,\" Herrera said.\n\nAbout 10 a.m., flames were still visible in the large, blackened haystack.\n\nPassersby on the nearby Interstate 10 captured photos and videos of the fire, as well as abundant plumes of smoke it was emitting.\n\nLast year:Landmark Mercantile a total loss after fire\n\nFire to burn for days\n\nHerrera and an owner of the mercantile said the fire will likely burn for days because of the amount of fodder involved. The county's approach will be to periodically monitor the blaze, making sure it doesn't spread to other structures, and let the fire burn itself out, Herrera said.\n\nThe cause of the fire is under investigation, Herrera said.\n\n\"We're still in the early stages,\" he said. \"We have ruled out it being intentional.\"\n\nA business owner who didn't give a name told the Sun-News the mercantile is hoping to review security camera footage for clues. While moist hay can sometimes catch fire, the owner said the burning haystack didn't fit that description.\n\nFirefighters from fire Districts 3, 4, 10, 15 and 16 responded to the fire. By 10:30 a.m., the last fire officials had left the scene. Firefighters planned to rely on information from the owner and carry out checks every 90 minutes to make sure the fire's direction and size hadn't changed.\n\nOn Aug. 29, 2017, the mercantile building burned in a fire that caused nearly $1.4 million in damage. The building had to be demolished as a result, and the company rebuilt its store.\n\nA grand opening of the new mercantile, the occupancy for which was granted in early August, is set for Saturday, Aug. 25. In a grand opening bash starting at 8 a.m., the store plans to give away ice cream and host special sales.

Parts of the first floor could house retail bays while parts of the second and third floors could be converted to office space, Sullivan said.\n\nAccording to TWG, the renovation would be complete in late 2015. But at least two other development groups have had the building under contract and have failed to close.\n\nIf completed, the project would give new life to the building at 715 Locust St., which has sat empty for nearly a year since the Register and its parent company Gannett moved their offices three blocks east to Capital Square.\n\n\"It would repopulate that part of downtown and would allow us to reuse a landmark building,\" said Andrea Hauer, an economic development coordinator with the city of Des Moines.\n\nThe project could also help fill the void left by the Younkers building, which was engulfed in a massive fire in March. The former department store was being converted to 120 apartments, part of a wave of new housing in the center of downtown. Its owners are still trying to determine whether anything can be salvaged.\n\nAlso included in that wave are the Equitable Building, the Des Moines Building and the Fleming Building, which are each within a few blocks of the Register building and together promise to add more than 350 apartments downtown.\n\n\"One project can start things, but it's that second, third and fourth that start to make it feel like a city,\" Hauer said.\n\nLike many of the historic renovations downtown, the Register building will likely rely on a cocktail of financial incentives, including historic tax credits, property tax abatements, workforce housing tax credits and possibly tax-increment financing incentives from the city, Hauer said.\n\nThe 13-story Register building opened in 1918. A four-story addition along Eighth Street that housed the printing presses, the newsroom and other offices was built in 1947.\n\nCovering half of a city block, the addition presents a challenge to redevelopment. The wide footprint makes it more difficult to build apartments that each have window access.\n\nBut Sullivan said it's possible. The fourth floor, which was home to the Register's newsroom for decades, will be converted to housing. The second and third floors could be offices or apartments, depending on demand.\n\nDevelopers have shied away from building new offices downtown in recent years. Vacancy rates for competitive office space remain relatively high at about 18 percent, although they are improving as more old offices like the Register building are converted to housing.\n\nFor TWG, the Register building project won't sink or swim on the ability to fill office space, Sullivan said. Less than 10 percent will be dedicated to office space.\n\nSullivan said TWG recently began a second environmental analysis of the building, with a specific focus on the pressroom. The two studies show a need for some cleanup, but nothing that should derail the project, Sullivan said.\n\nThe Register building was listed for $1.6 million. The amount of TWG's offer was not disclosed.\n\nTWG outbid two other developers for the property. One wanted to convert the building to apartments and the other envisioned a hotel, said Tyler Dingel, a real estate agent with CBRE/Hubbell Commercial.\n\nThe Register building would be TWG's second in Iowa. The company is renovating a senior housing complex in Cedar Rapids.\n\nTWG is also involved in a project to convert the Indianapolis Star's former offices into apartments. The newspaper is also owned by Gannett, which helped lead TWG to the Register's property, Sullivan said.\n\n\"These newspaper buildings are interesting,\" he said. \"They're well used, and some, like the Register building and the Indy Star, were built in multiple phases over time. But the bones of the Register building are pretty solid.\"\n\nAbout the column\n\nThe Growth column is a weekly look at how greater Des Moines is growing as developers break ground throughout the metro.

But all of our churches are required to have extinguishers, alarms systems and clear means of egress.”\n\nTake, for example, the birthplace of American democracy: Independence Hall in Philadelphia, where construction began in 1732.\n\n“All of our historic buildings have modern fire suppression,” said Adam Duncan, a park ranger at that World Heritage Site. “Sprinklers, alarms, pretty much anything that you would find in a modern office building, you would find at Independence Hall.”\n\nHe noted that Independence Hall, as part of the National Park Service, is subject to strict federal regulations that dictate building standards and any renovations. Although it’s not clear yet what started the fire at Notre Dame, it was under renovation and some fear that work, through a spark from equipment or some other incident, may have caused the fire.\n\nDuncan said Independence Hall has a 15-person cultural resource team – with architects, designers, and other staff – involved in determining what kind of repairs and upgrades should to be done and what can’t be done. A slew of other experts are involved in any work that goes forward, he said.\n\n“Independence Hall has been renovated several times without issue,” he said. “It’s not something that we undertake very lightly.”\n\nWhat about the 2.2 million historic artifacts that are part of Independence Hall’s museum collection, including books, manuscripts and portraits of prominent American revolutionaries?\n\nDuncan said they have a protocol for saving those, but he can’t discuss it.\n\n“It’s just not something that we would want to expose in case someone gets any grand ideas about pulling the fire alarm and taking this or that,” he said. “We have a collection that’s priceless.”\n\nAt the Smithsonian – a vast complex of 19 museums with more than 155 million historic objects and specimens – all the buildings have been retrofitted with sprinkler systems, said spokeswoman Linda St. Thomas.\n\n“We have a special air handling system that sucks oxygen out of a room – such as the Star-Spangled banner exhibit – that has an artifact that cannot be touched by water,” St. Thomas said.\n\nMore:What's next for Notre Dame? Resurrection. But it could take decades to rebuild\n\nMore:Day after devastating Notre Dame Cathedral fire, millions in donations pour in\n\nEric Gentry, the Smithsonian’s director of emergency management, said each building also has special monitoring technologies – such as heat and smoke detectors. And they conduct regular walk-throughs with local firefighters in Washington, D.C., so the first responders are familiar with the layout and collections of each building, whether it’s the American Indian Museum or the Hirshhorn.\n\nSmithsonian officials train the firefighters on the various collections and what the best extinguishing methods are for different works of art. And it's not just fires they're worried about.\n\n“Each hazard has its own set of procedures,” Gentry said, whether it’s fires, floods, earthquakes or theft.\n\nAll that planning is aimed at preventing disasters from occurring – and then containing them when that fails. Does that mean a catastrophe on the scale of the Notre Dame fire could never happen at an American treasure like the Smithsonian?\n\n“I would never say never, but every precaution that can be taken generally is,” Gentry said.\n\nAt Washington’s National Cathedral, Shepherd has an inkling of what will face Notre Dame officials as they turn toward the arduous task of rebuilding and repairing.\n\n“We are almost eight years out from the earthquake, and we are only halfway done with our work,” he said. That magnitude-5.8 quake hit Mineral, Virginia, on Aug. 23, 2011, and sent tremors 90 miles northeast to nation’s capital, opening cracks in the Washington Monument and seriously damaging a series of pinnacles on the Washington National Cathedral’s tower.\n\nAs the cathedral repairs that damage, they’re also making fire and life safety upgrades, Shepherd said, including new emergency lighting and augmented fire alarms. But he said the cathedral is already more protected from fire than Notre Dame simply because of its age and its building materials.\n\n“We are a modern cathedral, unlike Notre Dame that has heavy timber wood structure in their attic that dates to 800 years ago,” he said. “We are only 111 years old. We used steel, concrete, brick and limestone to build our cathedral.”\n\nShepherd said the biggest challenge facing the Notre Dame renovation crew will probably be money. Work on Washington's cathedral is currently at a standstill as church officials struggle to raise the $2-plus million needed to finish the repairs, he said.\n\nMore immediately, though, Shepherd said Notre Dame needs a team of conservationists on site Paris to prevent more damage as officials sift through the rubble. “You’re talking about things that might be 700-800 years old that … might have been partially burned, partially damaged by water,” he said.\n\nIf Notre Dame’s renovation team calls, Shepherd said he will be at the ready.\n\n“We are a community of cathedrals that have unique problems,” he said. “And we like to make sure we’re being as magnanimous as possible with our lessons learned and help each other out with such crises.”\n\nNotre Dame fire:Paris Fire Brigade chaplain braved the blaze to rescue cathedral treasures\n\nMore:Trump calls French President Emmanuel Macron to offer condolences for Notre Dame fire", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/04/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2019/04/15/notre-dame-fire-arlington-students-france-school-trip-safe/3476771002/", "title": "Notre Dame fire: Local students in France on school trip are safe", "text": "Though a massive fire devastated the famed Notre Dame cathedral in Paris, local students who traveled to France on field trips are safe, school officials said.\n\nGroups of students from high schools in at least two area districts — Arlington and Spackenkill — are in France on field trips during spring break this week.\n\n\"We have heard from our chaperones and all are safe,\" said Arlington Superintendent Brendan Lyons. \"They had visited Notre Dame on Friday and are heading to Barcelona tomorrow (Tuesday).\"\n\nTwenty-eight students who take French classes at Arlington are on the trip, Lyons said.\n\nSpackenkill Superintendent Mark Villanti said he and the high school principal heard from a trip chaperone, who reassured them all of the students were safe.\n\nA combination of sophomores, juniors and seniors — 17 French students in all — are on the trip, said Spackenkill mom Stephanie Mulcahy, whose son is among them.

In a few hours, the wind-driven blaze tore through popular Front Street and decimated the town center, which traces its roots to the 1700s and was on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\n“Lahaina Town is now burned down to ashes, the whole entire town − hotels, buildings, the historic sites,'' said Leomana Turalde. He told USA TODAY his mother, Jon Ho’okano, 56, worked for years as a dancer at Old Lahaina Luau, considered a \"well-preserved epicenter of Hawaiian culture and storytelling,\" the venue says on its website.\n\nLahaina has a population of around 13,000, according to the 2020 U.S. Census.\n\nHow old is Lahaina Town?\n\nMore than 1,000 years ago, long before the U.S. was founded, people were living on the Hawaiian islands and leaving their mark. From the years 1,000-1,200, people from Polynesia traveled about 2,500 miles north and settled on the islands of Hawaii, the National Park Service says on its website.\n\nThroughout history, different Hawaiian rulers vied for power over the islands, and Lahaina was consistently a site of royal and religious importance with its cemeteries and historic churches.\n\nWaiola Church, which burned in the fire, was the site of the start of Christianity in Hawaii in the early 1800s, according to the church's website.\n\nThe church crumbled, but the loss will be temporary, Anela Rosa, the church's lay minister of 13 years told USA TODAY. She said the church will bring people together for the next service, even if they have to use pop-up tents.\n\n\"This church, this congregation, has a resiliency unlike any other,\" Rosa said. \"That's why I know we will rebuild and be better than ever.\"\n\nBefore Hawaii became a U.S. territory in 1898, King Kamehameha I made Lahaina the capital of the Kingdom of Hawaii.\n\nAlso in the 1800s, Hawaii's royal leaders built a brick palace in Lahaina, along with other royal residences, according to one of the town's tourism websites.\n\nLahaina Banyan Court Park is home to the famous banyan fig tree planted in 1873 after being imported from India. It was threatened by the fires and suffered damage to trunks and limbs but remains standing, the Honolulu Civil Beat reported.\n\nFires destroy 'cultural heritage' in Lahaina\n\nLocals say losing so much of Lahaina is painful because the culture the place represents connects to a time with revered roots.\n\nFor Francine Hollinger, a 66-year-old Native Hawaiian, losing Lahaina was \"like losing a family member.\"\n\n“Because they’ll never be able to rebuild it, like we wouldn’t be able to bring back our mother or father,” she said.\n\nWhile it’s still difficult to assess the damage, state Sen. Gilbert Keith-Agaran told USA TODAY various landmarks have reportedly been lost – historic businesses and cemeteries where royal figures were buried.\n\n“It’s a real loss. Hawaii and Maui have tried really hard to preserve and protect those places for many, many years … not for the sake of tourism but because it’s part of our cultural heritage,” said Keith-Agaran, whose district includes Kahului in central Maui.\n\n“We just lost a large part of our heritage,” he said.\n\nIn addition to being a historic area, Lahaina Town is a residential and tourist area with a commercial district. For decades, it has been considered the west side of Maui's main downtown area.\n\nThe area is also known for two longtime beach resorts, Kaanapali and Kapalua.

The road had been closed since Tuesday night as crews worked to put out the blaze.\n\nOriginal story:\n\nCOCOA BEACH — Firefighters from several agencies fought a major fire Tuesday night at an iconic Cocoa Beach estate once owned by Al Neuharth, the founder of FLORIDA TODAY and USA TODAY.\n\nHundreds of bystanders converged along State Road A1A and the nearby beach to watch as the Pumpkin Center fire was engulfed in flames.\n\nCocoa Beach Fire Department Chief Ryan Duckworth said no one was injured in the blaze, the cause of which has yet to be determined. He described the property as a \"total loss.\"\n\n\"We did a quick preliminary search,\" Duckworth said. \"We did not find any people. We're going to do a secondary once we get close enough to it. We're still actively putting out the fire right now and then we're going to try to find if there's any victims which we don't believe there is and then try to find the cause of the fire.\"\n\nPumpkin Center loss marks end of an era\n\nCrews first responded before 9 p.m. Along with Cocoa Beach Fire Department units, Cape Canaveral Fire-Rescue, Brevard County Fire-Rescue and Patrick Air Force Base Fire Department crews were on the scene at Third Street South and Atlantic Avenue. The fire was put out by 1 a.m.\n\nDuckworth added that the fire presented \"special challenges\" noting that they had to deal with \"driving winds\" along with issues with respect to water supply.\n\n\"Very distinct landmark especially from the ocean,\" said Bruce Reynolds, who lives a block south. \"We raze a lot of really nice things to the ground to build new, and that thing had lasted a long time. and it was a visible landmark to people that walked the beach and used the beach.\"\n\n\"It's devastating,'' said Teresa Skare, who lives in a nearby apartment complex. \"It hits too close for me 'cause I only live right there. All I know (is) it's a beautiful place. I love going by there and looking at it.\"\n\nThe property recently sold for nearly $5 million, the highest price ever paid for a house in Brevard County. Property owner Jeffery Wells told FLORIDA TODAY earlier this month his intent was to allow people to hold weddings at the Pumpkin Center – once renovations were complete – so they could enjoy the ocean and beach as a backdrop. Wells said he does that with another beachfront property owns in the Cocoa Beach area, allowing military families to hold their ceremonies there for free.\n\nThe estate, built in 1975, is massive with 10,000 square feet of living space, 11 bedrooms and 12 bathrooms. It has tennis and basketball courts, 200 feet of beach, plus a treehouse with running water, electricity and an ocean view.\n\nAfter Neuharth died in April 2013, his wife, Dr. Rachel Fornes lived there with her children until the estate was sold.Neuharth reportedly had named his estate the Pumpkin Center after a bar and grill in South Dakota where he once worked. The Pumpkin Center was the site of meetings where Neuharth and his team came up with the concept for USA Today.\n\nInvestigators search for cause of Pumpkin Center fire\n\nDonna and Ray McMahon have spent their winters in Cocoa Beach since 1993. They live about two blocks from the Pumpkin Center and have walked by the place daily during their time here for over two decades. They, like so many in Cocoa Beach, have always been fascinated by the property and the stories about its’ owners. Shey Anderson, who lives on 8th Street, said the fire grew rapidly. \"We saw the embers in the air and everything. It's really sad. It's been an iconic part of Cocoa Beach for a while now. I know that everybody knows the Pumpkin Center,\" she added.\n\n“We knew a little bit about who owned the place, but have always been curious to know more, Donna said. \"Recently, we’ve started seeing piles of lumber and other signs of construction out front. Since (the City of Cocoa Beach) added the new sidewalk (that runs from 1st street south to 20th street south), people passing by can see a lot more of the Pumpkin Center than they’ve ever been able to see.''\n\nDuckworth also reflected on how sad the fire was for the community.\n\n\"It's pretty sad. It's a famous building. There's a lot of history, Mr. Neuharth recently passing and it hurts,\" Duckworth added. \"It hurts all of us in Cocoa Beach so we're going to do everything we can to save what we can of it. We'll do our best.\"\n\nSandra Gaines, who has been spending winters in Cocoa Beach since 1986 and lives a couple of blocks from the Pumpkin Center.\n\n“This is a sad sight.

But when pressed on whether it violates the code of ethics, she replied that “it can be, depending on the context.\n\nMagill responded to the same question by saying, “If the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment. Yes.”\n\nKornbluth also drew a distinction between speech and conduct, suggesting that calling for the genocide of Jews would violate the college’s rules “if targeted at individuals,” USA TODAY previously reported.\n\n\"As an American, as a Jew, and as a human being, I abhor antisemitism, and my administration is combatting it actively. Since October 7th, my campus communications have been crystal clear about the dangers of antisemitism and about the atrocity of the Hamas terror attack,\" Kornbluth said at the hearing.\n\n\"Let me repeat what I said in my very first message to campus.

She will remain at Harvard as a tenured faculty member, and will be succeeded by interim president Alan Garber, the university's provost and chief academic officer.\n\nHere is the full letter, published Tuesday from Harvard's Office of the President.\n\nDr. Claudine Gay resignation letter from Harvard\n\nDear Members of the Harvard Community,\n\nIt is with a heavy heart but a deep love for Harvard that I write to share that I will be stepping down as president. This is not a decision I came to easily. Indeed, it has been difficult beyond words because I have looked forward to working with so many of you to advance the commitment to academic excellence that has propelled this great university across centuries. But, after consultation with members of the Corporation, it has become clear that it is in the best interests of Harvard for me to resign so that our community can navigate this moment of extraordinary challenge with a focus on the institution rather than any individual.\n\nIt is a singular honor to be a member of this university, which has been my home and my inspiration for most of my professional career. My deep sense of connection to Harvard and its people has made it all the more painful to witness the tensions and divisions that have riven our community in recent months, weakening the bonds of trust and reciprocity that should be our sources of strength and support in times of crisis. Amidst all of this, it has been distressing to have doubt cast on my commitments to confronting hate and to upholding scholarly rigor—two bedrock values that are fundamental to who I am—and frightening to be subjected to personal attacks and threats fueled by racial animus.\n\nI believe in the people of Harvard because I see in you the possibility and the promise of a better future. These last weeks have helped make clear the work we need to do to build that future—to combat bias and hate in all its forms, to create a learning environment in which we respect each other’s dignity and treat one another with compassion, and to affirm our enduring commitment to open inquiry and free expression in the pursuit of truth. I believe we have within us all that we need to heal from this period of tension and division and to emerge stronger. I had hoped with all my heart to lead us on that journey, in partnership with all of you. As I now return to the faculty, and to the scholarship and teaching that are the lifeblood of what we do, I pledge to continue working alongside you to build the community we all deserve.\n\nWhen I became president, I considered myself particularly blessed by the opportunity to serve people from around the world who saw in my presidency a vision of Harvard that affirmed their sense of belonging—their sense that Harvard welcomes people of talent and promise, from every background imaginable, to learn from and grow with one another. To all of you, please know that those doors remain open, and Harvard will be stronger and better because they do.\n\nAs we welcome a new year and a new semester, I hope we can all look forward to brighter days. Sad as I am to be sending this message, my hopes for Harvard remain undimmed. When my brief presidency is remembered, I hope it will be seen as a moment of reawakening to the importance of striving to find our common humanity—and of not allowing rancor and vituperation to undermine the vital process of education. I trust we will all find ways, in this time of intense challenge and controversy, to recommit ourselves to the excellence, the openness, and the independence that are crucial to what our university stands for—and to our capacity to serve the world.\n\nSincerely,\n\nClaudine Gay", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/12/21/house-committee-harvard-president-claudine-gay/71997364007/", "title": "House GOP expands investigation of Harvard President Claudine Gay", "text": "WASHINGTON - House Republicans are expanding their investigation into Harvard President Claudine Gay following allegations of plagiarism surrounding her work.\n\nIt is the latest salvo in a Capitol Hill fight with college presidents, as the House Education and Workforce Committee ramps up backlash against Gay and other leaders who were grilled earlier this month about antisemitism on campus.\n\nRep.

Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., to get them to answer.\n\nGay responded that hateful speech is at odds with Harvard’s values and that calling for the genocide of Jews is antisemitic. But when pressed on whether it violates the code of ethics, she replied that “it can be, depending on the context.”\n\nMagill responded to the same question by saying, “If the speech turns into conduct, it can be harassment. Yes.”\n\nKornbluth also drew a distinction between speech and conduct, suggesting that calling for the genocide of Jews would violate the college’s rules “if targeted at individuals.”\n\nStefanik called the presidents’ response “unacceptable and antisemitic.”\n\n“They all must resign immediately today,” she wrote on X.\n\nAt the White House, press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said calls for genocide are \"vile\" and \"counter to everything this country stands for.\"\n\n\"Statements that advocate for the systemic murder of Jews are appalling, and we should all stand against them,\" she said. \"...We should be calling out this type of hate.\"\n\nShe declined to say whether the university presidents should resign, saying, \"They have to speak for themselves on this.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, the federal government has opened investigations into several universities − including Penn and Harvard − regarding antisemitism and Islamophobia on campus.\n\nChoosing a college is hard:The Israel-Hamas war is making it harder\n\nLior Alon, a postdoctoral associate at MIT, said the presidents’ response was embarrassing.\n\n“None of them was able to say calling for genocide of the Jewish people is bad and it's harassment – that we don't want it on our campus,” said Alon, who is from Israel. “For me, it was a shock. I cannot express how unwelcome I feel now.”\n\nLiyam Chitayat, a Ph.D. student at MIT, said she also found the presidents’ testimony alarming.\n\n“It was really good proof that these university administrators are the main enablers, sympathizing with terrorism on college campuses,” said Chitayat, also from Israel. “Their inability to protect Jewish students is systematic.”\n\nAt the University of Pennsylvania, the leaders of Penn Hillel, a Jewish campus organization, condemned Magill for refusing to characterize calls for the genocide of Jews as a breach of the school’s code of conduct and for saying the offense “depends on the context.”\n\n“We are appalled by the need to state the obvious: Calls for genocide against Jews do not depend on the context,” the group said in a statement.\n\nHarvard Hillel said Gay’s refusal to draw a line around threatening antisemitic speech as a violation of Harvard’s policies “is profoundly shocking given explicit provisions within the conduct code prohibiting this kind of bullying and harassment.”\n\n“President Gay’s failure to properly condemn this speech calls into question her ability to protect Jewish students on Harvard’s campus,” the group said in a statement.\n\nInsults and Molotov cocktatils:Jews live in fear as antisemitism rages\n\nAppearing on CNN, former Harvard President Larry Summers, who held key positions in the administrations of Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, noted what he called “a double standard” in the way university leaders have responded to racism and other forms of prejudice and the way they’ve responded “to what is pretty clearly antisemitism.”\n\nAsked if she felt safe on the MIT campus, Chitayat said, “It’s not that Jewish and Israeli students don’t feel unsafe. They are unsafe.”\n\n“When you have administrators that, instead of finding ways to protect Jewish life, tell us to enter through the back door onto campus, when you have students that continuously, time and time again, invite the leading antisemites of Boston to come and terrorize us on campus – it's not about feeling unsafe, it’s about being unsafe,” she said. “This is one of the biggest failures of higher education in the U.S.”\n\nWednesday afternoon, she said, a man who had been harassing Jewish students showed up at the Hillel and urinated on the windows of the Jewish prayer room while students were inside.\n\nContributing: Associated Press\n\nMichael Collins covers the White House.

Last month, the University of Pennsylvania’s Liz Magill announced she was stepping down shortly after botching testimony about antisemitism before Congress.\n\nThen came the news Tuesday that Harvard’s Claudine Gay has also resigned, similarly following her testimony on that topic. The political scientist, who had become the college’s first Black president, quickly became the president with the shortest tenure; she’d only been on the job for six months.\n\nObservers predict the scrutiny – and resignation pressure – is coming for others too. The result could be a chilling effect on how and when college leaders engage in public discourse, if at all.\n\n“The campaign against me was about more than one university and one leader,” Gay warned in a New York Times op-ed published late Tuesday. “For the opportunists driving cynicism about our institutions, no single victory or toppled leader exhausts their zeal.”\n\nGay and Magill both resigned after a much-discussed congressional hearing last month where they were grilled about their handling of student activism on campus related to the Israel-Hamas war. Republicans asked whether they condoned some activists’ calls for the genocide of Jews. The then-presidents’ responses, often circumventing the questions, were leveraged by critics to challenge diversity, equity and inclusion efforts and what they framed as selective enforcement of free speech. Gay then moved further into the spotlight over plagiarism accusations.\n\nNow, those same critics are turning their attention to Massachusetts Institute of Technology President Sally Kornbluth, who also testified at that December hearing but remains in her post.\n\n“I wouldn’t exactly envy university presidents in the current environment,” said Greg Lukianoff, the president of the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. The nonpartisan organization, whose advocacy focuses on college campuses, has challenged the suppression of free speech by people of varying political beliefs. But with 2024 being an election year, Lukianoff anticipates a particularly tumultuous time for leaders who have espoused progressive ideals. “We are likely going to see an uptick in cancel culture coming from the right,\" he said.\n\nClaudine Gay:How plagiarism claims at Harvard add fuel to GOP feeding frenzy on higher education\n\nCollege presidents don’t last long\n\nThe college presidency is an all but impossible job. That reality is largely reflected in how little time the average college president in the U.S. remains in that role.\n\nEvery few years, the American Council on Education conducts a survey of college presidents about their jobs. The most recent survey, published last year, shows that presidents stay in their jobs for an average of 5.9 years, and most say they don’t anticipate remaining for another five. In 2016, it was 6.5 years, and a decade before that the average stood at 8.5 years.\n\nWhat’s more, the presidents aren’t leaving their posts for similar leadership roles at other institutions; they’re heading into nonprofits or back into faculty positions. At the same time, fewer and fewer provosts express an interest in being promoted to president. Stanford's Tessier-Lavigne, who served as president for roughly seven years and was eventually cleared of committing any wrongdoing personally, remains a tenured biology faculty member at the elite college.\n\nThe difficulties that came with the COVID-19 pandemic are one major factor behind the declining appeal of running a university. But there are other ingredients at play as well.\n\nIs the government interfering too much in higher ed?\n\nIt’s a time marked by growing government interference in higher education, leaders said, including new laws restricting campus diversity, equity and inclusion programs, professors’ tenure protections and instruction about LGBTQ+ issues or race.\n\n“The strength of American higher education is derived, in part, from the fact that what's taught inside and outside of the classroom is protected from direct to government control and undue political influence,” said Lynn Pasquerella, president of the American Association of Colleges and Universities. “And yet, the hearings on the Hill showed that we are not adhering to those principles.”\n\n“There are multiple constituencies calling upon presidents to act in particular ways, and they’re often at odds,” she said. “Students, faculty, staff, alumni, community members, donors, politicians might have different perspectives on the correct course of action. … No matter what one does in the presidency today, it will be criticized.”\n\nIrene Mulvey, a mathematician and president of the American Association of University Professors, agreed. College presidents, she said, have traditionally served as a firewall between the campus community and the public, including board members and lawmakers; they've been tasked with protecting the academic freedom and free speech interests of their community while appealing to, negotiating with and justifying decisions to funders and governing bodies.\n\nBut that’s been changing: With evolving politics and funding circumstances, that firewall has begun to dissipate, Mulvey said. That phenomenon includes private universities, once thought to be mostly immune from outside forces.\n\n“I would imagine college presidents are shaken up by what's happened and feel threatened – and not just personally threatened or professionally threatened,” Mulvey said. “The threat is also against the autonomy that higher education needs to be a public good in a democracy.\n\n“If the government is dictating what protests can happen on campus, what words can be said on campus, what student groups are allowed on campus – if the government's dictating what we what we can research, where we can study where our work can go – then I think that higher education is dead.”\n\nAmericans question worth, direction of higher education\n\nThe public’s confidence in higher education, meanwhile, has dropped to historic lows, and growing numbers of today’s young people are deciding not to pursue further schooling. Students who will be graduating high school this spring were in middle school when the pandemic hit in March 2020. The disruptions to schooling and learning, for many kids, fueled a detachment from education.\n\nBeyond that, though, are the partisan divides. A minority of Republicans – who often frame colleges as bastions of liberal politics – say in surveys that college is worth the investment. Lukianoff's research, he said, has revealed that many elite colleges have a poor track record when it comes to protecting the freedom of speech across the political spectrum; Harvard for its part has come in last in his group's rankings of which campuses adequately promote that right.\n\nThe sector has also been dealt several political blows in recent years that have further undermined that confidence. The U.S. Supreme Court last year rejected not only the use of race-based affirmative action by colleges but also President Joe Biden’s plan to provide broad student loan forgiveness.\n\nThe decisions bolstered the perception that access to and the value of higher education are in decline. More recently, the launch of an updated Free Application for Federal Student Aid has been beset by technological difficulties, leaving many prospective college-goers in the lurch.\n\n“I worry … there will be an exacerbation of the racial and economic segregation in higher education that's already taking place in America,” Pasquerella said. “Those who are most marginalized – those who are most disenfranchised – will be dissuaded from attending college at a time when a college education is more important than ever for socio-economic mobility.”\n\n“Somebody who can get a job immediately out of high school might say, ‘Well, you know, it's not worth the money that you spend to go to college and they're all corrupt anyway or they don't teach real-world skills or they're liberals,” Pasquerella said.\n\nData continues to show that a college degree can significantly improve a person’s earning potential from what it would be had education stopped at high school.\n\nValue of college:Student loan debt is hard to avoid in pursuit of a career. Here's what 5 people tried\n\nAmid creation of ‘plagiarism hunting fund,’ leaders feel chilling effect\n\nHigher education leaders told USA TODAY these realities, more than ever, call for a greater commitment by colleges to principles such as DEI. They feel compelled to double down on their advocacy for greater access, to promote a deeper sense of belonging among students both current and prospective.\n\nYet the same leaders said the chilling effect of recent developments is very real. Contributing to the chill is the announcement Tuesday of a “plagiarism hunting fund” by Christopher Rufo, the conservative activist who has spearheaded efforts to eliminate critical race theory and DEI from institutions including schools.\n\nMichael Roth, the president of Wesleyan University, said this is an especially critical time for leaders such as himself to encourage open inquiry and civic engagement. But \"I do worry that many of my colleagues will retreat further from the public sphere. ... I'm afraid this kind of thing will make people gun-shy.\"\n\nPasquerella, who before her current post served as president of Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts, said she herself has been chilled by the vitriol, especially upon receiving emailed death threats on Wednesday following some commentary she shared with reporters the day prior. She pointed to Rufo’s usage, in separate tweets, of the word “scalped” to describe the takedown of Gay, promising not to stop his efforts until diversity, equity and inclusion in higher education are deemed obsolete.\n\n“These same people who criticized higher education for chilling speech and for cancel culture are now engaging in those very tactics to chill speech to cancel people like Claudine Gay,” the American Association of Colleges and Universities’ Pasquerella said. “That weaponization of speech and the using of accusations of plagiarism are just one component of the culture wars that fueled the attacks on higher education. And the fact that these attacks often include misinformation and disinformation campaigns has made campus leadership much more difficult.”", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2024/01/04"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/11/28/college-presidents-testify-congress-campus-antisemitism/71730873007/", "title": "Antisemitism at Harvard, MIT, UPenn: College presidents to testify", "text": "Republican lawmakers asked three college presidents to testify at a congressional hearing next week about how they've handled a rise in antisemitic incidents on their campuses since the Israel-Hamas war began Oct. 7.\n\nThe presidents of Harvard, the University of Pennsylvania and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology agreed to testify on Tuesday before the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, the committee said. The universities have faced public backlash, student demonstrations and alumni revolts since the war began.\n\nThe college presidents' testimony in Washington, D.C., could lead to blowback on their campuses, because the stated focus of the hearing does not include a discussion of the Islamophobia that is also roiling colleges.\n\nFaculty and administrators have expressed a broad spectrum of opinions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict at these high-profile campuses, and students and alumni have challenged the administrators' response to protests and their approaches to student safety.\n\nNick Barley, spokesperson for the House committee, said the presidents were invited, not subpoenaed. Their willingness to face tough questions from the GOP-led committee, whose conservative members tend to be critical of institutions of higher education, comes amid pressure on college leaders to address an escalating climate of discrimination on campuses, particularly at urban and more selective schools where protests and hate crimes have been more pervasive, according to active Education Department investigations.\n\nThe Education Department has said it has received dozens of complaints related to antisemitism, Islamophobia or anti-Arab sentiment since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. Investigations launched in the past few weeks involve New York City schools; Clark County, Nevada, public schools; and Hillsborough County, Florida, public schools, as well as Harvard, Columbia, Cornell, the University of Tampa and others.\n\nIsrael-Hamas protests roiled campuses.Now, the feds are investigating colleges and schools\n\nIncidents of anti-Muslim harassment are also on the rise, an issue that has become a top concern among many Democrats. In an attack that is being investigated as a possible hate crime, three college students of Palestinian descent were shot Saturday night in Burlington, Vermont, while they were speaking Arabic. One of the victims, a student at Brown University in Rhode Island, suffered a gunshot wound to the spine and is facing a long recovery, his uncle said Monday.\n\nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona said earlier this month that the Education Department received more complaints related to antisemitic and anti-Muslim harassment in the first month of the war than in all of last year. The department has opened a number of investigations into such incidents, including one at the University of Pennsylvania prompted by a complaint from the Brandeis Center, a Jewish civil rights group, which accuses administrators of allowing the campus to become a \"magnet for anti-Semites.\"\n\nChoosing a college is hard.The Israel-Hamas war is making it harder\n\nColleges contend with balancing free speech, safety\n\nThe hearing next week hints at a renewed focus by Republican leaders on certain aspects of the war. As many Democrats and younger voters find themselves upset with conservatives for failing to speak out about Palestinians' rights, GOP lawmakers are expressing frustration that in their view some colleges have allowed antisemitism to flourish.\n\nIn the early days of the conflict, there was a perception among some alumni, faculty and students at a number of selective American colleges – especially the three involved in next Tuesday's hearing – that administrators were slow to condemn Hamas' attack on Israeli civilians Oct. 7. As campus protests escalated and allegations of discrimination grabbed headlines, that perception only worsened, causing some donors to cut off financial support.\n\nThe schools now face existential questions about the importance of free speech on campus and how it measures up against the importance of safety and the colleges' own bottom lines.\n\nAntisemitism at Harvard, MIT, UPenn\n\nThe Republican House committee explicitly seeks to highlight how that inner turmoil from college administrators looks from the outside.\n\n“Over the past several weeks, we’ve seen countless examples of antisemitic demonstrations on college campuses,” Rep. Virginia Foxx, a North Carolina Republican who chairs the committee, said in a statement Tuesday. “Meanwhile, college administrators have largely stood by, allowing horrific rhetoric to fester and grow.”\n\nShe said the hearing is meant to shine a \"spotlight” on campus leaders and demand they “take the appropriate action to stand strong against antisemitism.”\n\nIn a hearing before the committee earlier this month, Rep. Bobby Scott of Virginia, the ranking Democrat, lauded the Biden administration's efforts to protect college students from all forms of discrimination.\n\n\"While the Biden administration has taken an active role in helping institutions protect students, regrettably, many of my colleagues have spent this Congress fueling divisive and baseless culture wars,\" he said.\n\nUniversity leaders say they welcome chance to be heard\n\nHarvard spokesperson Jason Newton said in an email that President Claudine Gay “looks forward to sharing updates and information on the university's work to support the Harvard community and combat antisemitism.” He declined to comment further.\n\nSteve Silverman, a spokesperson for the University of Pennsylvania, said in an email that President Liz Magill also was looking forward to the hearing and she \"understands the critical importance of fighting antisemitism and other forms of hate on Penn’s campus.”\n\nKimberly Allen, a spokesperson for MIT, said in an email that President Sally Kornbluth \"welcomes the opportunity\" to engage with the committee.\n\nZachary Schermele is a breaking news and education reporter for USA TODAY.

And certainly, I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong.\"\n\nTrump later blamed his hesitancy to answer on a bad earpiece.\n\n\"I love Hispanics!\"\n\nIn a tweet from May 2016, Trump posted with a taco salad, his thumbs up.\n\n\"Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!\"\n\nClaiming an American judge was biased because \"he's a Mexican.\"\n\nAt a rally in California, also in May 2016, candidate Trump referenced U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curie, the judge in the class action lawsuit against Trump University.\n\n“The judge, who happens to be, we believe, Mexican…I think the Mexicans are going to end up loving Donald Trump.”\n\nCurie, an American citizen, was born in Indiana.\n\nAt the same rally, Trump said, “I really like when they put up ‘Latinos for Trump.’ ‘Latinos for Trump.’ I love it. We’re going to do great with Latinos.”\n\nIn an interview with CNN the following month, Trump again referenced Curie, saying he would not rule impartially on a class action suit involving Trump University because \"he's a Mexican.\"\n\n\"He's a Mexican,\" Trump said. \"We’re building a wall between here and Mexico. The answer is, he is giving us very unfair rulings — rulings that people can’t even believe.\"\n\n\"My African American\"\n\n“Oh look at my African American over here,” Trump proclaimed at a California rally in June 2016. “Are you the greatest?\"\n\nThe man, who told the New York Times he was not a Trump supporter, said he was not offended by the remark.\n\nComments on a Gold Star family\n\nKhizr Khan, father of the late Army Captain Humayun Khan, spoke at the Democratic National Convention in July 2016, questioning Trump's knowledge of the Constitution. Khan's wife, Ghazala, stood beside him.\n\nThe family is Muslim and Ghazala wears a headscarf.\n\nIn an interview with ABC News, Trump responded to Khan's speech, questioning why Ghazala Khan didn't speak.\n\n“If you look at his wife, she was standing there,\" Trump said. \"She had nothing to say. She probably, maybe she wasn’t allowed to have anything to say. You tell me.\"\n\n\"Barack Obama was born in the United States.\"\n\nIn September 2016, Trump read a written statement that contradicted years of his birther conspiracy theories that questioned whether or not former president Barack Obama was born in the United States. Obama was born in Hawaii.\n\n\"African Americans and Hispanics are living in hell.\"\n\nIn a presidential debate in September 2016, Trump said “We need law and order. If we don’t have it, we’re not going to have a country.\n\n“African Americans and Hispanics are living in hell. You walk down the street and you get shot.”\n\nFortune quoted Trump as warning of “gangs roaming the street,\" saying, “African American communities are being decimated by crime.”\n\n\"Anti-semitism is horrible\"\n\n\"Whether it's anti-semitism or racism, anything you want to think about having to do with the divide, anti-semitism is, likewise, it's just terrible...I think you've maybe had it longer than people think and it maybe gets brought up more but I will tell you anti-semitism is horrible and it's going to stop and it has to stop.\"\n\n\"They shook up the world\"\n\nIn a weekly address in February, Black History Month, President Trump mostly spoke about the National Museum of African American History and Culture in D.C.\n\nThe museum serves as a \"shining example of African Americans incredible contribution to our culture, our society and our history,\" he said.\n\n\"It also tells of the great struggle for freedom and equality that prevailed against the sins of slavery and the injustice of discrimination.\"\n\nReferencing Mohamed Ali, Sojourner Truth, Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington and Martin Luther King, Trump said, \"They shook up the world for the better because they inspired our nation to march towards justice and freedom for all.\"\n\n\"Today, and every day, I pledge to continue that march so that every American, no matter his background, no matter her background, has the chance to climb that great ladder of success.\n\n\"I want every African American child, family and worker to have access to great schools, safe communities and good paying jobs. I want every disadvantaged child in America to have a choice about where they go to school, so important. I also want to honor and promote the achievements of historically black colleges and universities throughout our nation. They do a fantastic job. They're not given the credit that they deserve and they're going to start getting that credit.\"\n\n\"Blame on both sides\"\n\nAfter white nationalists rallied in Charlottesville, North Carolina, in October to protest the removal of a Confederate statue, resulting in the death of a peaceful protestor, Trump blamed the violence on \"hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides.”\n\nThe New York Times quoted Trump calling for the “swift restoration of law and order,” as he offered a plea for unity among Americans of “all races, creeds and colors.\"\n\nThen, at a press conference two days later, Trump spoke out against racism, saying, \"Racism is evil. And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the K.K.K., neo-Nazis, white supremacists and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.\"\n\nThe following day, Trump doubled down on blaming those protesting the white nationalists, referring to them as the \"alt-left.\"\n\n\"What about the alt-left,\" Trump asked. \"Do they have any semblance of guilt? They came charging, as you say, the alt-right. Do they have any semblance of guilt?\"\n\nThen, referencing the group of white people who carried torches and yelled racial slurs, Trump said, \"I've condemned many different groups but not all of those people were neo-Nazis, believe me. Not all of those people were white supremacists, believe me, by any stretch. Those people were also there because they wanted to protest the taking down of a statue, Robert E. Lee.\"\n\n\"Pocahontas\"\n\nPresident Trump hosted the Native American Code Talkers at the White House in November, honoring their contribution during WWI and WWII.\n\nWhile honoring the two men present, Trump referred to Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, as \"Pocahontas.\"\n\n\"You're very, very special people,\" Trump said. \"You were here long before any of us were here. Although we have a representative in Congress who they say was here a long time ago. They call her Pocahontas. But you know what. I like you. Because you are special.\"\n\nWarren claimed to have Native American heritage as part Cherokee. Pocahontas was a member of the Pamunkey Tribe.\n\nAnti-Muslim retweets\n\nAt the end of November, Trump retweeted three anti-Muslim videos from the deputy leader of Britain First, Jayda Fransen. Fransen has been convicted of a 2016 incident where she harassed a Muslim woman wearing a hijab.\n\nOne of the videos showed a boy in crutches being attacked by a \"Muslim migrant.\" The perpetrator in the video was born and raised in the Netherlands, according to a tweet from the Netherlands Embassy.\n\nTrump did not comment on the posts.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/06"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/29/nightmare-roof-fire-starting-drones-pennywise-jeep-news-around-states/40468927/", "title": "'Nightmare' roof, fire-starting drones: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: An animal expert says fencing erected by the Alabama Department of Transportation is helping to protect an endangered turtle species. University of South Alabama herpetologist David Nelson tells AL.com the number of Alabama red-bellied turtles killed on the Mobile Bay Causeway dropped by more than 80% after fencing went up alongside it in 2008. In 2001, Nelson counted 580 Alabama red-bellies that were killed while crossing the causeway. Most of those were females traveling to or from nest sites or hatchlings. Transportation officials have also put up signs during the turtle’s peak nesting and hatching seasons that encourage drivers to be cautious.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Opponents of petroleum drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge are preparing for a response to a possible petroleum lease sale. The Interior Department hopes to conduct a lease sale by the end of the year. More than 30 groups have joined the Arctic Refuge Defense Campaign, which is a coalition dedicated to protecting the refuge that provides breeding habitat to polar bears, migratory birds and the Porcupine Caribou Herd shared with Canada. Campaign director Desiree Sorenson-Groves says the environmental review for the sale was rushed and has flaws and will be challenged in court. Her group is also warning potential bidders that companies will face damage to their reputations if they bid on leases within the refuge because it will harm polar bears and other Arctic species.\n\nArizona\n\nTucson: A new report by an Arizona State University think tank questions whether the state can find enough water to replenish aquifers for pumping to new homes in fast-growing suburban areas without access to Colorado River water. The Arizona Daily Star reports that the Kyl Center for Water Policy report also suggests that the state revamp a landmark 1980 setting current policy on groundwater management. The report warns that some suburbs of Tucson and Phoenix will struggle to find enough water to keep growing without damaging underground aquifers by overpumping. According to the report, the result could be land subsidence, including ground fissures, lower water quality and even the possibility of wells drying up.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A woman woke up to find that her trailer filled with rare and ancient fossils, including dinosaur eggs that are 70 million-year-old dinosaur eggs, was gone. The trailer was taken late last month after Rodger Perkins, Gwynn Shafer and Paul Yumlu packed fossils in it for this month’s Greater Little Rock Gem, Mineral and Jewelry Show, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Perkins says the trailer had skulls of the perchoerus, a piglike mammal that is one of the rarest of fossils; the doglike cynodictis; the marine reptile keichousaurus; and a pair of baby rabbits that died nearly 15 million years ago. He says the fossils were worth nearly $20,000. Perkins doubts that whoever stole the trailer knew what was inside but says the thieves likely know how expensive the fossils are because they had price tags on them.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSanta Clarita: Freshman Rep. Katie Hill, a rising Democratic star in the House, announced her resignation amid an ethics probe, saying explicit private photos of her with a campaign staffer had been “weaponized” by her husband and political operatives. The California Democrat, 32, had been hand-picked for a coveted leadership seat. But in recent days, compromising photos of Hill and purported text messages from her to a campaign staffer surfaced online in a right-wing publication and a British tabloid. The House ethics committee had launched an investigation into whether Hill had an inappropriate relationship with an aide in her congressional office, prohibited under House rules. Hill, one of the few openly bisexual women in Congress, has vowed to fight a “smear” campaign waged by a husband she called abusive.\n\nColorado\n\nLoveland: Planning is in the works to build a new Veterans Affairs clinic that will give veterans in northern Colorado better access to health care. The Cheyenne Veterans Affairs Health Care System announced that the Loveland clinic is expected to open by the winter of 2022. VA spokesman Sam House tells the Loveland Reporter-Herald that more than half of the population that is served in the Cheyenne system area comes from northern Colorado. House says the facility will more than double the space of the current Loveland and Fort Collins clinics combined and serve more than 200 veterans a day. Construction should start by next summer and take two years to complete. When the new facility opens in 2022, the VA will close its Fort Collins clinic.\n\nConnecticut\n\nEast Haddam: Hundreds of acres in eastern Connecticut are in the process of being acquired by the state to expand existing parks and wildlife conservation areas, but thousands more need to be attained or protected in order to meet a fast-approaching goal of protecting 21% of Connecticut land as open space by 2023. Eric Hammerling, executive director of the Connecticut Forest and Park Association, says the state still has “a ways to go” and hopes officials will keep pushing to reach the goal. Last week, Democratic U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney announced $560,000 in federal funds to protect more than 400 acres in eastern Connecticut, including nearly 100 acres that will be added to the Devil’s Hopyard State Park in East Haddam.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: The state’s only NASCAR racetrack continues to shrink. Reflecting waning attendance nationwide for the popular motor sport, Dover International Speedway, also known as the Monster Mile, will reduce seating at its grandstands to 54,000 from 83,000. It is at least the third time that track owner Dover Motor Sports has removed thousands of seats at the facility in the past decade. Prior to 2009, capacity stood at 135,000. Rebuilding the grandstand with fewer seats will cost the publicly traded company $1.5 million. The project is underway and is scheduled to be complete before the racetrack’s spring NASCAR event.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The Smithsonian’s National Zoo has announced the birth of one lesser kudu and the death of another. The Washington Post reports the male calf was born Oct. 14, just weeks after his grandmother died. Citing a news release, news outlets report the zoo says the healthy calf may make his public debut this fall. The calf was born to a kudu named Rogue, who was the daughter of a kudu named Shirley. The 9-year-old Shirley died late last month after what the zoo described as complications during the birthing process. Her calf was stillborn. The International Union for Conservation of Nature says the lesser kudu is a type of antelope considered to be “near threatened,” with a declining wild population of about 100,000.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: Homeless people living with HIV now have secure locations in the city where they can store their expensive medications. Through the IDEA Exchange, patients can store their medicine in lockers at a converted shipping container office. They also can choose to have social workers deliver small quantities of the medicine to them. The program is run by the University of Miami. Prescriptions are paid for by Medicaid or a federal drug assistance program for low-income people living with HIV. Storing medication for the homeless has long been encouraged by public health experts. Washington, D.C., New York, Boston and other cities offer similar services. University of Miami physician Hansel Tookes, who directs the Miami program, says the initiative began in 2018 after an HIV outbreak among the city’s homeless.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: The National Park Service says crews will spend several months cleaning out years of accumulating storm debris and dead wood around a Civil War-era fort on the Georgia coast. Fort Pulaski National Monument east of Savannah still has a large debris pile left over from the passing of hurricanes Matthew and Irma, as well as a tornado, in 2016 and 2017. Dead and damaged trees remain in the woods outside the fort. The Park Service says in a news release that a cleanup project will remove the debris and dead wood to reduce wildfire risks. Work began in October and is expected to continue until spring. Officials say the work may require temporary closure of some areas of the park outside Fort Pulaski.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Researchers have found the majority of plastic marine debris washing up on the state’s shores is from abroad. The Star-Advertiser reports the study conducted at Hawaii Pacific University revealed that pollution from north and east island beaches is washing ashore where there are fewer residents and tourists. Researchers say it is possible the debris swept in from as far as 3,000 miles away from the coasts of Asia, as well as the Americas. Researchers say more than 4,600 pieces of plastic debris were collected for the study from three sea surface areas, three seafloor dive sites and 11 shorelines. Researchers say based on weathering and chemical composition, the debris could tell experts where it came from and how it got to island shores.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: State officials have made it more difficult for young transgender people to change the sex listed on their birth certificates despite a U.S. court ruling that appears to ban such obstacles. The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare released comments from the public last week on a temporary rule requiring people younger than 18 to get approval from medical or mental health professionals before requesting the change. Many of the comments said they wanted the conservative state to go back to banning all gender changes on birth certificates. A federal judge ruled last year that an Idaho law barring transgender people from changing their birth certificates violated the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Health and Welfare’s board of directors complied with the order and changed the state’s rules last year. But this May, the board approved the temporary rule requiring anyone under 18 to get approval before requesting the change.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Gov. J.B. Pritzker is endorsing legislation that would allow college athletes in the state to make money from endorsements. During a Sunday interview on WGN-Radio, Pritzker said college athletes deserve the same opportunity as everyone else to earn compensation based on the use of their name and their image and likeness. Democratic state Rep. Emanuel Welch of Hillside has introduced legislation that would put Illinois in line with California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a law this year allowing athletes at the state’s universities to use their names and likenesses to make money. The law also bans schools from kicking athletes off the team if they get paid. Illinois House Republican leader Jim Durkin of Western Springs said Sunday that he would urge his GOP colleagues to oppose Welch’s proposed legislation.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The state will change the vendor of its teacher licensing exams following complaints about low pass rates under the current program. Test administrator ETS will replace Pearson starting in September 2021. The move comes after Republican state Sen. Jean Leising of Oldenburg introduced legislation this year requiring the state to adopt a national teacher licensing program to replace Pearson’s, which customizes exams to Indiana standards. The Tribune-Star reports Leising says the change will help address the state’s teacher shortage. Some people have said Pearson’s exams are too difficult. Tim McRoberts, associate executive director of the Indiana Association of School Principals, says Pearson doesn’t provide adequate study materials, which makes it difficult for students to prepare. He says there’s no doubt testing changes could be helpful.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City: An eastern Iowa school district has secured federal grant funding to monitor students’ social media accounts for possible warning signs that students might harm themselves or their peers. The Iowa City Community School District received the grant from the U.S. Department of Justice. A portion of the $187,000 grant is earmarked to contract with a company that will scan social media posts. It’s part of a districtwide push to improve safety across the school district. School officials have not yet determined what all the monitoring will entail. School officials note that the district already has the right to look at the emails and Google Drive accounts of students who are using district technology.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Kris Kobach has acknowledged in a diversion agreement that he failed to properly supervise his staff while representing himself as the then-Kansas secretary of state during federal court proceedings. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports the confidential agreement resolves complaints made to the Kansas Disciplinary Administrator’s Office about Kobach’s conduct in a voter registration case. Details of the findings aren’t disclosed under Kansas rules, but a public notice of the agreement says Kobach stipulates he didn’t properly supervise lawyers and non-lawyers during the litigation. The lawsuit involved a challenge to a Kansas law requiring voters to show proof of citizenship to register to vote. The disciplinary administrator’s office says there was no finding of dishonest conduct by Kobach, who is seeking the Republican nomination for an open U.S. Senate seat.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: Pennywise the clown has returned to terrorize Derby City, and he’s driving a 2005 Jeep Wrangler. The monster at the heart of the new “It: Chapter Two” film and the shape-shifting villain of Stephen King’s classic horror novel now sits in the driver’s seat next to Andrew Johnson, the owner of a modified SUV with a passenger-side steering wheel and a whole collection of creepy props and decals. The Louisville resident and self-employed auto mechanic has spent the past six years dressing up his two SUVs to fit certain themes. The “It” Jeep, though, has been his biggest hit yet. It has decals with popular phrases and references to the movie. It has theatrical blood sprayed across its white exterior – “if it gets wet,” Johnson says, “it actually drips.” It has two arms pulling poor Georgie’s yellow rain jacket into the Jeep’s grill. And it has a 6-foot-3 clown with glowing eyes and trademark red balloons in the driver’s seat.\n\nLouisiana\n\nCameron: What used to be Louisiana’s largest state wildlife refuge is celebrating its centennial. The Rockefeller Wildlife Refuge was 86,000 acres when the land was bought in 1914 and donated to the state in December 1919. Officials say it’s now down to about 71,500 acres. That’s about a 17% loss. The southwest Louisiana refuge has been a site for research to reduce coastal erosion, such as finding ways to build stone breakwaters light enough not to sink in the soft silt near what remains of the shore. There’s also been a great deal of wildlife research, including studies that helped alligators and bald eagles get off the endangered list. Wildlife and Fisheries Secretary Jack Montoucet describes the refuge as a giant outdoor laboratory.\n\nMaine\n\nGeorgetown: An environmental group is working with shellfish farmers to grow more of a species of clam it thinks can better stand up to predators that have plagued the state’s harvest of bivalves. Seafood lovers have sought Maine’s softshell clams for decades, but the state’s harvesters are collecting fewer of those clams, in part because of the spread of crabs and worms that prey on them. Massachusetts-based group Manomet thinks the answer might lie in the aquaculture of quahogs, which are a harder species of clam associated more with Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The group is working with four shellfish farmers to grow quahogs in Maine and study the results. The federal government’s NOAA Sea Grant has taken notice and provided $65,000 to give the project a boost.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The State Department of Education has responded to concerns about Holocaust instruction by announcing plans to enhance and expand how it’s taught. A statement released by the department says the changes include teaching middle schoolers about anti-Semitism and strengthening Holocaust education for high schoolers. News outlets report advocates and elected officials had raised concerns about state curriculum guidelines. Baltimore Jewish Council executive director Howard Libit says the council thought the guidelines didn’t do enough to ensure students learn about the Holocaust. State Superintendent Karen B. Salmon said in the statement that the education department plans to provide teachers with tools to help them teach the Holocaust with confidence.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: Worcester Polytechnic Institute has received a five-year, nearly $1.9 million grant from the National Institutes of Health to develop a robotic system to detect and monitor prostate cancer. Grant recipient Haichong Zhang, a biomedical engineer at the school, says his surgical imaging robot will be safer and more accurate than current tests, including ultrasounds and biopsies. Zhang tells The Telegram & Gazette he wants to create a minimally invasive, easily accessible and cost-effective way to better detect prostate cancer, which will affect one-fifth of all men at some point in their lives. Zhang is working on the project with Gregory Fischer, a professor of robotics and mechanical engineering at WPI.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: A local museum will begin charging patrons from outside the Motor City area an admissions fee for the first time in seven years to remedy an increasing budget deficit. The Detroit News reports that the Detroit Historical Museum will charge adults $10, while seniors, students, active-duty military and first responders will pay $8. Children ages 6 to 17 will pay $6. Museum executive director Elana Rugh says the museum lost $297,000 in 2018. The museum’s 2019 operating budget is about $4.5 million. Residents of Detroit, Highland Park and Hamtramck will be able to enter at no cost. Detroit historian Ken Coleman says he worries the fee will prevent low-income people from other places from visiting the museum.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Clergy and immigration activists are trying to remove the name of a revered bishop from a federal building where hundreds of deportation orders are issued every year, calling the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown an affront to his memory. The Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building at Fort Snelling houses the Minneapolis-area offices of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security. It’s named for the first Episcopal bishop of Minnesota, who persuaded President Abraham Lincoln to pardon most of the 303 Dakota Indians sentenced to death after the U.S.-Dakota War of 1862, though 38 were still hanged in the largest mass execution in U.S. history. Now the Episcopal Church in Minnesota, the Minnesota Council of Churches and others want Whipple’s name taken off the building – or the eviction of ICE and its immigration courts. They’re planning a vigil and news conference outside it Tuesday to launch the “What Would Whipple Do?” campaign. They’ll also call on the Legislature to declare Minnesota a sanctuary state.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Gov. Phil Bryant says the state’s cash reserves are at their highest level ever. The Republican said Friday that the state Department of Finance and Administration has transferred just over $205 million into the state rainy day fund. The money was the unspent surplus for state government for the budget year that ended June 30. With the transfer, the rainy day fund has hit its limit, by law, of $554.8 million. Bryant said on Twitter that the amount of money in the fund is “the most in Mississippi’s history.” Republicans who lead the budget-writing process in the Legislature say conservative spending practices led to the surplus that filled the rainy day fund. Critics say Mississippi government is underfunding education, health care and other core services.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A state panel wants a test track for an ultra-high-speed Hyperloop system to be built in the Show-Me State. The group of elected officials and business leaders made the recommendation Monday as part of a study commissioned by the House speaker. Hyperloop technology involves a tubular track through which a train-like pod carries passengers at speeds of more than 600 mph. Advocates want to connect Kansas City to St. Louis with the high-speed system. The report says Missouri first would need to apply to be the site for a roughly 15-mile test track that could cost between $300 million and $500 million. The estimated cost to build a full hyperloop system across Missouri ranges from $30 million to $40 million per mile, or about $7.3 billion to $10.4 billion total.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: National Weather Service meteorologists say snowfall in the state has broken a 35-year-old record. Through Monday afternoon, more than 35 inches of snow has been recorded in Great Falls in September and October. Scientists say the amount sets a record for the timeframe beginning July 1, blasting past the previous record of 18.1 inches in 1984. Meteorologists say that is well over half of the 60 inches that routinely falls during an entire snow season. Meteorologists say snow is expected to continue with record-breaking cold through mid-November. Scientists say the average temperature in October has been 40.3 degrees, about 5.9 degrees below normal. Scientists say residents should be prepared as current weather continues to behave more like December or January.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: University of Nebraska-Lincoln researchers have launched a university-backed startup company to help prevent and fight wildfires with drones. The university on Monday announced the new business venture, Drone Amplified, which is headed by Carrick Detweiler, an associate professor of computer science and engineering. The company’s drone-mounted technology carries chemical spheres the size of pingpong balls. At the press of a button, the spheres ignite, intentionally sparking small fires to burn vegetation and deprive incoming wildfires of potential fuel. The drones can also be equipped with thermal cameras to help spot hotspots, and they can be used in situations that are unsafe for manned aircraft, such as low-visibility nighttime operations. University researchers tested the technology in 2016 with a controlled fire at the Homestead National Monument of America near Beatrice.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: A developer who grew up going to the Huntridge Theater is poised to get city approval to buy the shuttered former movie house in central Las Vegas, renovate its damaged roof and convert it to an arts hub. J Dapper tells the Las Vegas Sun the architecture won’t change, but the building dating to 1943 could be converted into a concert venue, a performance auditorium or a community arts space. Dapper says he also hopes to put restaurants, condominiums or office space on the 4-acre parcel at Charleston Boulevard and Maryland Parkway to make the venture more profitable. Dapper needs city approval because the property has been listed since 1993 on the National Register of Historic Places. A City Council vote is scheduled Nov. 6.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: New Hampshire Attorney General Gordon MacDonald is telling residents to be aware of scammers targeting personal information through the use of popular phone-based word games, such as Words with Friends. The game’s app is downloaded for players to take turns building words in a crossword-style fashion, similar to Scrabble. Authorities say scammers use the app’s communication function to ask users questions to gain personal information that’s used to exploit the individual. They say scammers also try to seek a personal or romantic connection and urge the user to send gift cards, money and valuable property. Scammers also will send harmful links and ask users to switch to other platforms that make it easier for the scammer to access the user’s personal information. Authorities say players should only communicate with people known to them.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nAsbury Park: Jersey rock royalty was onstage Sunday night in the state’s musical cradle as rocker Jon Bon Jovi brought crooner Southside Johnny Lyon with him into the New Jersey Hall of Fame. The two rockers played a duet at Asbury Park’s Convention Hall, where both had performed many times on their way up from Jersey shore local bar bands to worldwide stars. Pop rock band The Smithereens was also inducted this year. In the performing arts category, Jason Alexander, who played George Costanza on “Seinfeld,” made the cut. Inductees in the category of arts and letters included “Jaws” author Peter Benchley, longtime Star-Ledger sports columnist Jerry Izenberg, “Game of Thrones” author George R. R. Martin and photographer Timothy White.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: State wildlife officials are rejoining direct efforts to manage endangered Mexican gray wolf populations in cooperation with the federal government and counterparts including Arizona. The New Mexico State Game Commission voted unanimously with one absence Friday to become a cooperating agency in the recovery program after leaving a pact in 2011. Wildlife Division Chief Stewart Liley says the agreement will make New Mexico a lead player in the program with greater discretion over management decisions amid concern among ranchers about livestock falling prey to wolves. The Mexican wolf is the rarest subspecies of gray wolf in North America and has struggled since releases into the wild in 1998. Surveys show at least 131 in the wild in the southern mountain ranges of New Mexico and Arizona.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The eastern hellbender will get more protection and the bald eagle and peregrine falcon will get less under proposed changes to New York’s list of endangered and threatened species. The Department of Environmental Conservation is proposing removal of 19 species from the state’s endangered and threatened list. Those species including the bald eagle and peregrine falcon show significant population growth, making them no longer threatened. There are now 390 pairs of breeding bald eagles in New York, compared to one pair when they were listed as endangered in 1973. The agency is proposing to add 18 other species as threatened or endangered. They include several species of freshwater mussels, the common nighthawk and the eastern hellbender salamander. Public comments on the list proposals are being taken until Dec. 24.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Parts of the state’s textile, agricultural and railroad past have been recognized as national historic places, a designation that can help preserve them. The state Department of Natural and Cultural Resources said in a news release that seven North Carolina properties have been added to the National Register of Historic Places. They include Caromount Mills in Rocky Mount; Sanford Tobacco Co. redrying plant and warehouse in Sanford; Carolina and Northwestern Railway freight depot in Lenoir; and Taylorsville Milling Co. roller mill in Taylorsville. Also added to the list were the T. Austin and Ernestine L. Finch house in Thomasville; the Gem Theatre in Kannapolis; and the Bunyan S. and Edith W. Womble house in Winston-Salem. Federal and state incentives are created to help preserve National Register places.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWillow City: Wildlife officials say a state game warden escaped serious injuries when he was attacked by a bull moose. Game & Fish Department Chief Game Warden Robert Timian tells KFGO radio that District Game Warden Jonathan Toftland was in the Willow City area Wednesday to investigate a report of an injured or sick bull moose. As Toftland approached the animal, it stood up and charged him, knocking him to the ground. The moose was killed. Timian says the outcome could have been “far worse” and credits help from others who were in the area for helping Toftland. The game warden was treated for minor injuries at a local hospital and released. Timian says investigators are trying to determine if the bull moose was sick.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Some state lawmakers say they hope to prevent numerous vehicle crashes by gradually installing rumble strips down the center of some roads. Ohio Rep. Timothy E. Ginter, a Salem Republican, is chief sponsor of a bill to require the state Department of Transportation to add rumble strips on all undivided, two-way highways with speed limits higher than 45 mph. The Dayton Daily News reports the House passed the bill unanimously in June, and the Senate Transportation Committee held a hearing on it last week. State Highway Patrol data shows more than 500 people have died in the past five years due to drivers crossing over the center of undivided Ohio highways. The Federal Highway Administration says rumble strips have reduced rural two-lane road crashes by about 45% nationwide.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A group trying to prevent partisan gerrymandering of Oklahoma’s legislative and congressional districts is seeking a public vote on whether to create a new bipartisan commission to redraw district boundaries. A group that includes the president of the Oklahoma League of Women Voters and Let’s Fix This, an organization aimed at helping Oklahomans engage politically, filed its petition Monday with the Oklahoma Secretary of State’s Office. The group is seeking to gather enough signatures to place the proposed constitutional amendment on a statewide ballot. Under the plan, the power to draw both legislative and federal congressional districts would be transferred from the Legislature to a bipartisan commission. The commission would include an equal number of Republicans, Democrats and representatives unaffiliated with either party selected by a group of retired judges.\n\nOregon\n\nEugene: A group of wine industry interests in the state have formed a new trade group. The Eugene Register-Guard reports the new coalition is called the Oregon Wine Council, and it has an agenda that differs from the Oregon Wine Association. Members of the new group earlier this year opposed wine legislation they viewed as anti-competitive. They claim to represent the interests of the entire state. Board member Sam Tannahill says the majority of large, taxpaying wine growers as well as many of small producers around the state don’t have a say in how their tax money is spent. A board member of the Oregon Wine Association, Justin King, says the argument that his organization is made up of selfish people from one area of the state is patently false.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: The front of a city bus was up in the air Monday after a sinkhole opened under it during rush hour downtown. The Port Authority of Allegheny County says only the driver and one passenger were aboard the bus when it plunged into the hole. The passenger was taken to a hospital for a minor injury Monday, and the driver was not injured. The agency tweeted that the bus was at a red light when the street gave way, and the rear half plunged into the hole. A photo shows the front of the bus pitched into the air and the front wheels of a car that was behind it dangling over the sinkhole’s edge. A tow truck was brought in late Monday to remove the bus.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The governor and public school superintendents are trying to raise awareness about the importance of regularly reading to children. “SUPERS Read,” a statewide reading event, began Monday and continues through Nov. 8. Superintendents and other guest readers will read to infants and toddlers enrolled in local child care and Early Head Start programs. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo and education leaders will kick off the event Monday at the Children’s Workshop in Warren. Raimondo also plans to unveil an updated website that makes accessing state programs for young children and families more straightforward. The Rhode Island Association for the Education of Young Children, United Way of Rhode Island and Rhode Island KIDS COUNT organized the reading celebration to highlight the importance of reading to children to promote school readiness.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The director of the state’s prisons says his agency will begin classifying inmates by their behavior behind bars, not the crime they committed. Corrections Director Bryan Stirling says the reclassification could reduce the number of maximum-security inmates by 4,000. There are currently about 7,000 inmates in maximum security in South Carolina prisons. Stirling told The Post and Courier of Charleston moving inmates from maximum security will let them move in prison more freely, take more classes and go on work-release programs. They also can become eligible for parole quicker. To get out of maximum security, prison officials say inmates must not be in gangs and must follow the rules. Stirling says consolidating maximum security will allow his chronically short staff to concentrate on the worst behaved inmates.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Entrance and camping fees to state parks will likely cost more next year. The South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission has approved fee increases for 2020. An annual state park pass will be $36, an increase of $6. A day pass will be $8, a $2 increase. Camping fees for prime sites will increase $5 to $26, and preferred sites will increase from $19 to $23. The commission says a wet spring made 10% of campsites temporarily unavailable this year, and revenue is down by $1.9 million compared to last year. And it’s estimated that repairs to campsites, roads and boat ramps damaged by flooding will cost $8 million. The Rapid City Journal says the fee increases still need approval from the Legislature’s Interim Rules Committee.\n\nTennessee\n\nMemphis: A psychiatrist whose license was suspended last year for using riding crops on patients may now lose her license again over allegations that she violated her professional probation. The state Board of Medical Examiners says Dr. Valerie Augustus didn’t participate in therapy sessions or reimburse the state $50,000 for the cost of the case. The newspaper recently obtained new charges the state Department of Health filed against Augustus last month, accusing her of misconduct and violating a board order. The board has said the 57-year-old Christian Psychiatric Services operator used a crop or whip on at least 10 patients. Augustus appealed the ruling, saying the whipping was done jokingly. A hearing is set for January.\n\nTexas\n\nHouston: The Houston Police Department has unveiled a new crime lab in a move to accelerate service and shed its scandal-ridden past linked to a backlog of rape kits. Police and city officials several years ago started the process of untangling the lab from the department and into an independent agency, the Houston Forensic Science Center. In 2014, the department transferred management of its crime lab to the center even though the physical lab remained in the Police Department’s downtown headquarters. The Houston Chronicle reports that authorities said the new facility was revealed last week and features state-of-the-art labs, ventilation systems and a consolidated design. The center’s president, Dr. Peter Stout, says the 83,000-square-foot space will serve as a model for the rest of the U.S.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: A college professor has completed a massive project decorating the exterior of his house in an elaborate Halloween tribute to Disneyland’s Haunted Mansion and the “Nightmare Before Christmas.” Dixie State University professor Josh Pedersen studied more than 200 images of the attraction to model the design as close to the original as possible. He started by creating digital plans for an intricate pattern along his roofline, then printed the design using a large-format laser printer available at a university Makerspace. Once the pattern was cut out and attached to a base, he added 168 electric candles and 66 fake pumpkins. Many people pitched in to help with the installation, which took about a week. Pedersen says he’s wanted to do the project for years.\n\nVermont\n\nSouth Burlington: The Vermont National Guard has received 14 noise complaints since the first two F-35 fighter planes arrived at the Burlington International Airport last month. Capt. Mike Arcovitch, whose office tracks noise complaints, says the complaints came from eight people, and two were anonymous. The F-35s are louder than the F-16s the guard used to fly. He says officials had expected more noise complaints when the new jets started flying from the South Burlington airport that is home to the Vermont Air National Guard. The guard took delivery last month of the first two of what will be 20 F-35s, all due in the state by summer. Arcovitch says the guard used to receive noise complaints about the F-16s as well, but he did not have a comparison.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State health regulators are asking lawmakers to greenlight a licensing system for music therapy. The Daily Press reports that regulators want to set credentialing standards for therapists as well as set up a system for the state to look into any complaints. Music therapy is used to help people with various medical conditions develop everything from language skills to motor coordination. It can provide a drug-free way to regulate moods in people with depression or foster socialization in those with limited means of communication. It gained popularity in veterans’ hospitals in World War II as doctors became interested in music’s ability to heal soldiers with both physical and mental problems.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: An anti-tax activist is again bringing a $30 car-tab initiative to voters that would cut a major source of funding for transportation projects across the state. Sponsored by Tim Eyman, Initiative 976 would lower most taxes paid through annual vehicle registration to $30 and largely revoke the authority of state and local governments to add taxes and fees without voter approval. The measure would also repeal taxes and fees already in place, a move the state Office of Financial Management says could cost the state and local governments more than $4 billion in revenue over the next six years. Eyman says the November ballot measure is a chance for voters to tell their government that they voted years ago for $30 car tabs, and they meant it.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nBluefield: Officials have pulled off a creative rescue of a malnourished German shepherd that was stuck in a dam. The Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports an animal control officer said the dog had probably been trapped in the Ada dam for several days before the rescue. The effort began Friday afternoon when a 911 call came in for an injured and skinny dog in the spillway. But rescuers couldn’t get into the dam, and its tall, steep walls made it impossible for the dog to climb out. So officials used a rope to lower a trap baited with food into the spillway. After about 2 1/ 2 hours, the dog finally went into the trap, and the rescue workers brought him to a shelter. There, they named him Lucky.\n\nWisconsin\n\nJanesville: Former House Speaker Paul Ryan has launched a new nonprofit organization he says will be focused on fighting poverty, increasing economic opportunities and advancing evidence-based public policies. Ryan announced the launch of the American Idea Foundation on Monday. He moved more than $7 million from his congressional account into the nonprofit when he announced its formation earlier this year. The foundation will be based in Ryan’s hometown, Janesville, though he moved his family to Maryland this year. Ryan decided against seeking re-election last year, ending his 20-year career in the House. The Republican from Janesville has kept a mostly low profile since then.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: The Federal Communications Commission is expected to provide $12.1 million to expand broadband coverage to rural parts of the state over the next decade. The Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports three companies are expected to receive funds to extend service to more than 4,700 homes and businesses lacking high-speed internet access. The FCC says Inventive Wireless of Nebraska, Tri County Telephone and Union Telephone will receive funding. Officials say service will be expanded in seven counties: Albany, Big Horn, Niobrara, Park, Platte, Sublette and Uinta. A Wyoming State Broadband Program survey of more than 2,400 residents found 26.9% of respondents lacked reliable broadband.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/29"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2021/06/16/holocaust-survivor-concert-tiger-king-auction-crab-meat-shortage-news-around-states/117044680/", "title": "Holocaust survivor concert, Tiger King auction: News from around ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: A production line that makes many of Hyundai’s North American vehicles is being halted this week due to a parts shortage. The shutdown will leave about 1,000 regular workers temporarily unemployed for seven days. The problem is that Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama hasn’t been able to get enough parts because of a semiconductor shortage. As a result, production at the plant will be suspended until June 21. “No other downtime for this reason is expected,” said Robert Burns, vice president of human resources and administration. The company “will continue to work with Hyundai Motor Group’s global purchasing team to allocate microchips to its U.S. manufacturing plant to optimize production in the coming weeks and months,” Burns said. About 3,000 people work at the Montgomery plant. Most of them will continue to work this week. That includes maintenance workers, employees processing completed vehicles, and engine shop employees building engines to be delivered to Kia’s plant in Georgia. The plant produces the Sonata and Elantra sedans as well as the Santa Fe and Tucson SUVs. It began rolling out the new Santa Cruz pickup earlier this month after finishing a $410 million expansion. The company will help workers file unemployment claims, Burns said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Alaska Wildlife Troopers do not intend to issue a citation to a man recently seen lifting a baby moose over a guardrail in south-central Alaska, though it is illegal to “handle any wild animal in a similar fashion,” an Alaska State Troopers spokesperson said Thursday. Spokesperson Austin McDaniel said Alaska Wildlife Troopers “strongly advise people to stay a safe distance from all wildlife, including moose calves, as the animal may react aggressively towards humans.” Anyone who sees a wild animal that may need help should call the nearest law enforcement agency or the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, McDaniel said in an email. Alaska’s News Source reports an Anchorage man, Joe Tate, was driving home Sunday from a fishing trip with friends when he saw a line of cars and a moose in the road on the Kenai Peninsula. Tate said a mother moose was pacing in the road, and a young calf struggled to scale a guardrail to join her. He estimated watching for about 30 minutes. He said he considered calling wildlife officials or law enforcement but worried an accident could occur in the time it would take for them to arrive. Friends with a trailer got between the mother and the calf, breaking the line of sight, Tate said. Another vehicle positioned itself similarly on the opposite side of traffic.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: The Arizona Worm Farm, focused on “turning garbage into food,” is growing produce sustainably in the desert. Worms eat food waste produced by the south Phoenix farm and elsewhere, including a brewery, diverting organic scraps from landfills. The invertebrates turn that into nutrient-rich compost that goes back into the ground and helps plants grow. The farm produces 40,000 to 50,000 worms a week and eliminates 1,000 pounds of waste from Phoenix landfills alone. The food it grows can feed its 10 employees with enough to donate to St. Mary’s Food Bank each week. All branches of the farm form a circle of life. “I’m trying to produce the garden of Eden,” Zach Brooks said. He was in the middle of his second master’s degree in sustainability at Arizona State University when he decided to start the farm, realizing he could put what he was learning into practice as easily as he could buy the materials online. “We didn’t invent anything that’s here on the farm,” he said. “Everything that’s necessary to live a zero-waste life is just a matter of doing it.” The site was the remnants of a cotton farm, its soil difficult for growing fruits and vegetables. “We couldn’t even get weeds to grow,” Brooks said. Nowadays, the soil is wet just beneath the surface, even after days without watering. “I dare you to go any place in Arizona and dig up a square of soil, and you won’t find that kind of life,” he said.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Abortion rights supporters asked a federal judge Monday to prevent the state’s near-total ban on the procedure from taking effect while the groups challenge its constitutionality. The American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood asked the judge to issue a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction against the ban, set to take effect July 28. The groups filed a lawsuit last month challenging the ban, which prohibits abortions except those to save the life of the mother. The groups filed the lawsuit on behalf of Little Rock Family Planning Services, a Little Rock abortion clinic, and Planned Parenthood’s Little Rock health center. The groups are also representing a doctor who works at the Planned Parenthood clinic. “Absent an order from this Court, (the ban) will inflict on plaintiffs’ patients significant and irreparable harm for which there is no adequate remedy at law,” Monday’s filing said. Amanda Priest, a spokeswoman for Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, said the groups’ motion “should not come as a surprise to anyone.” “Attorney General Rutledge will be reviewing the latest action and will proceed,” she said.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSan Francisco: A popular trail in Big Sur flanked by redwood trees that leads down through a gorge to a 60-foot waterfall is set to open to the public this week after a 13-year restoration needed when a wildfire destroyed access to it, officials announced Monday. After a $2 million renovation that fixed bridges, retaining walls, railings, steps and signage, the Pfeiffer Falls Trail will open Friday for the public to enjoy, said officials with the California State Parks and Save the Redwoods League, a San Francisco conservation group. To protect sensitive habitat, California State Parks and Save the Redwoods League officials replaced more than 4,150 square feet of asphalt and concrete and seven stream crossings, with the newly aligned trail and a 70-foot-long pedestrian bridge that spans the Pfeiffer Redwood Creek ravine and offers dramatic views, officials said. The Basin Complex Fire damaged the 0.75-mile trail, which connects with the Valley View trail to form a 1.5-mile loop that was the most popular hiking trail in Big Sur before the blaze. A subsequent fire, landslides, and a long closure of Highway 1 delayed the renovation and long-awaited reopening, officials said.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has rejected a request by the state’s Republican congressional delegation to stop paying jobless residents $300 extra a week in federal pandemic relief. The GOP representatives argue the payment, scheduled to run through Sept. 6, is hurting business by deterring unemployed workers from seeking jobs. U.S. Reps. Doug Lamborn, Ken Buck and Lauren Boebert noted in a Friday letter to Polis that Colorado restaurants and numerous other firms are struggling to hire workers. Many states led by Republican governors have ended the supplemental benefit. “We have to stop paying people that should be working to sit at home on the couch,” Boebert said in a statement. “It’s well past time for the government to end COVID bonuses and stop disincentivizing work.” Colorado Politics reports that Polis rejected the proposal, arguing in part that the benefit is helping business. “If Colorado ended these benefits prematurely, it would harm individuals, business owners, and the broader economy,” he wrote. Colorado is offering its own cash incentives for job-seekers. A “Jumpstart” program rewards those getting hired by month’s end with up to $1,600 in incentives. The state labor department reports some 3,800 new claims for regular state benefits were filed last week, the lowest level since the pandemic began.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Schools that still use Native American nicknames and mascots could take a financial hit if they continue to use those images without written consent from a state- or federally recognized tribe in their region, according to a provision tucked into a massive state budget implementation bill that’s up for a vote Monday. Municipalities face the prospect of losing their allotment of revenue from the Mashantucket Pequot/Mohegan Fund, an account that’s funded with the state’s 25% share of slot machine revenues generated at the two casinos owned and operated by the federally recognized Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan Tribes. The provision was included in the budget bill by state Sen. Cathy Osten, D-Sprague, the co-chairman of the General Assembly’s Appropriations Committee. “Towns around this state have been told year after year by Connecticut’s Native American tribes that their nicknames and mascots are horribly offensive,” Osten said in a statement. “If certain cities and towns won’t listen to their fellow citizens, then they can certainly do without the tribal money that they are showing such disrespect toward.” It’s estimated that about a dozen schools in Connecticut still use Native American names or images. Some communities have already changed the names of their athletic teams in recent years.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: Crab cake lovers have something to be, well, crabby about this summer: It might be harder and more expensive than ever to fill up on their favorite shellfish. A bevy of Delaware restaurants have begun limiting crab cake sales and even temporarily suspending “crab nights” because of a shortage of picked crab meat, as well as a sharp increase in prices to meet the growing demand. One reason for the shortage is that businesses are having a hard time finding employees to pick the sweet meat out of the crabs’ sharp shells. This year, just like last summer, restaurants and shops in beach resort towns did not get a stream of annual seasonal foreign workers because of travel restrictions in place due to the pandemic. According to Seafood News.com, crab meat prices have been rising and are at a high because of a lack of inventory, exacerbated by supply limitations in Asia due to COVID-19 and logistic constraints. And, locally, another problem, at least for now, could be there are fewer male crabs in the Chesapeake Bay. A survey from the Maryland Department of Natural Resources and Virginia Institute of Marine Science estimates the total abundance of blue crab in the Chesapeake Bay in 2021 was 282 million crabs, a below-average total for the 32 years of survey results.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: The owners of a bar said Monday that they are investigating a weekend incident in which security guards were seen dragging a Black woman down a staircase and throwing her out of the establishment. Nellie’s Sports Bar’s owners also said on Facebook that they have “terminated, with immediate effect, the independent security vendor hired to protect our guests during Pride Week.” Video posted on social media early Sunday shows a bouncer dragging the woman – identified by local media as Keisha Young, 22 – down the stairs as observers scream, “Oh my God!” Some patrons are then seen fighting with the guards. On a video call Monday with her lawyer, Young said: “I feel like, even just separating race from it, no man should ever handle a woman in that way. That should never be OK,” according to Washington’s WRC-TV. A crowd gathered outside Nellie’s Sunday night to protest Young’s treatment. Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday: “Obviously, entrepreneurs enforce rules in their restaurants. But they’re not allowed to assault anybody.” Nellie’s owners said the bar “will be closed this week as we evaluate this regrettable situation,” and they vowed to cooperate with any law enforcement investigation.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis visited a South Florida Jewish temple to denounce anti-Semitism and stand with Israel on Monday as the Republican governor cloaked himself in religion while signing a bill into law that would require public schools in his state to set aside at least one minute of silence for children to meditate or pray. His visit to the Shul of Bal Harbour, a Jewish community center in Surfside, had the air of a campaign event. DeSantis seemed to blush when the Rabbi Sholom Lipskar introduced him as a “great governor and future world leader.” It has been speculated that the governor, who is running for reelection next year, might run for president in 2024. DeSantis visited the temple to sign two bills into law. One would expand the role of volunteer ambulance services, while the other makes Florida one of at least 15 states, according to a legislative analysis, that would compel public schools to hold moments of silence. The state had already been among roughly 18 other states that gave schools the option to do so. “The idea that you can just push God out of every institution and be successful – I’m sorry, our Founding Fathers did not believe that,” DeSantis said. The ambulance bill allows some volunteer first responders, including those run by faith-based groups, to use emergency lights and sirens when responding to emergencies. Some Orthodox Jews rely on these volunteer ambulance services to help overcome religious sensitivities that prevent some people form using traditional emergency services.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is establishing a therapeutic foster care program to provide specialized treatment for children with an assortment of behavioral, mental and developmental challenges. Georgia is providing $6.7 million to begin the program that Tom Rawlings, director of the Division of Family and Children Services, called a pilot initiative that he hopes will expand in the future. A similar program existed over a decade ago, and Rawlings and other advocates see its return as a major step toward strengthening welfare services for children with intense treatment needs. “There is this, I believe, very special population of children with very severe emotional issues, often co-occurring autism spectrum and mental health issues, and we as a state really have to develop a more specialized system,” Rawlings said. “And I think that this is a major step toward that.” Therapeutic foster care differs from traditional foster care in several ways. Children placed in a therapeutic care home have individualized care needs that often arise from past trauma. Foster parents in a therapeutic program are trained to handle these challenges and provide around-the-clock care. Children in this program also receive crucial treatment services, usually involving therapy.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. is giving Native Hawaiians surplus land as compensation for acres that were meant for homesteading but used instead by the federal government. The land transfer also attempts to help right wrongs against the Indigenous people of Hawaii, officials said Monday. The 80 acres in Ewa Beach formerly used for the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center will eventually provide up to 400 homes while helping fulfill terms of a settlement authorized by Congress in 1995 to compensate Native Hawaiians for 1,500 acres that were set aside for homelands but subsequently acquired and used by the federal government for other purposes, officials said. U.S. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland’s voice choked with emotion while making the announcement Monday. “Yes, it’s a happy day, but it’s also a sad day because we remember the tragedy that befell the Native Hawaiians throughout their tumultuous history,” said Haaland, the first Native American woman to lead a U.S. Cabinet agency. “Since that time, our country has learned a great deal. And now we are in an era where we recognize the importance of healing the generational traumas that caused pain and heartache.” The Hawaiian Homes Commission Act of 1920 was meant to provide economic self-sufficiency to Hawaiians by allowing them to use land to live on, with a 99-year lease for $1 a year.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: Four housing organizations in the state are getting coronavirus relief funding to help cover the cost of emergency housing vouchers. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded $2.4 million total to the Housing Authority of the City of Pocatello, the Boise City Housing Authority, the Southwestern Idaho Cooperative Housing Authority, and the Idaho Housing and Finance Association, the Idaho Press reports. The money will cover 217 vouchers and related administrative costs, according to a prepared statement from HUD, and is part of $1 billion being awarded to housing organizations nationwide. As of January 2020, Idaho had about 2,300 people “experiencing homelessness on any given day,” according to the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness. “Addressing our nation’s homelessness crisis is a top priority for HUD,” HUD Secretary Marcia Fudge said in a statement. Deanna Watson, the executive director of the Boise City/Ada County Housing Authority, said increases in rent levels have a lot of people getting priced out of the market. The vouchers will work by subsidizing rents in a place with fair market rents, Watson said. In addition, there’s assistance in some of the fees that come with finding houses, security deposits and case management.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: A cave system closed more than a decade ago is reopening to the public. The state Department of Natural Resources announced last week that Illinois Caverns in Monroe County would reopen Wednesday. Officials closed the southern Illinois cave in 2010 as a precaution for bats who live there due to the spread of a fatal disease called white-nose syndrome. WNS is named after the white fungus found on the muzzle, ears and wings of infected bats. White-nose syndrome cannot be transmitted to humans or other animals, but officials feared humans exploring caves could spread it from one location to another, endangering more bats. Joe Kath, the department’s Endangered Species Program manager, said the disease’s prevalence in bats hibernating within Illinois Caverns has been relatively low since the closure compared to other locations in the state. “The caverns – one of the state’s scenic wonders – attracted visitors from across the state, which is why the decision was made to close them,” Kath said. “Our biologists felt that proactively closing Illinois Caverns, and other state-managed caves across the state, was the best option to protect the state’s bat population from (white-nose syndrome).” Illinois Caverns will be open Wednesdays through Sundays from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. and seasonally from April through October.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Two legal organizations are suing the state to prevent Gov. Eric Holcomb from pulling out of a federal unemployment program that’s paying benefits to hundreds of thousands of residents. Macey Swanson Hicks & Sauer law firm and Indiana Legal Services, an organization that provides legal assistance to low-income Hoosiers, filed a joint civil lawsuit in Marion County Superior Court, claiming the end of the benefits would hurt their clients and people across the state. The organizations argued that Indiana law requires the state to procure federal insurance benefits to its citizens. “These benefits have provided life-sustaining and crucial assistance to many Hoosiers during the pandemic,” Jon Laramore, executive director of Indiana Legal Services, said in a statement. “The legislature passed a law creating a right to these benefits, and we’re asking Governor Holcomb to follow the law.” The Republican governor announced last month he was ending the federal benefits June 19 because many businesses in the service industry are struggling to fill jobs. While economists are skeptical that unemployment benefits are the reason people aren’t returning to low-wage jobs, Holcomb is banking on the benefits cut to drive more people back to work.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Officials at the city’s public water system on Monday asked customers to begin using water wisely and cut lawn irrigation by 25% as water usage reached new highs and drought conditions slowed the flow of rivers. The combination of high demand and low water flow resulted in Des Moines Water Works demand reaching 90% of capacity Friday. The utility that serves 500,000 customers in central Iowa said it delivered nearly 90 million gallons of water that day. “We have taken proactive steps to ensure we have enough water for customers, but the Raccoon River is low enough that you can walk across it. Now, we are asking our customers to do their part and use water wisely,” CEO Ted Corrigan said. The flow rate in the Raccoon River, which is a major water source for the DMWW, is down to less than 300 cubic feet per second compared the median flow of 4,000 cubic feet per second. The average high temperature for Des Moines for the first 13 days of June was 88, significantly above the normal of 79.9, according to the National Weather Service. The city has had 0.02 inches of rain this month. The average is 5.26 inches. In Iowa, 46% of the state is classified as in moderate drought, up from 29% the week before, said the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: The state is going to struggle to vaccinate more residents, a top aide to Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said, and thousands of families will lose extra food aid because top Republican legislators on Tuesday ended a state of emergency for the coronavirus pandemic. Will Lawrence, the governor’s chief of staff, said the state will no longer be able to use its National Guard to distribute vaccines or personal protective equipment, and addressing COVID-19 is “just going to be more difficult.” Senate President Ty Masterson announced the cancellation of a meeting of eight leaders of the GOP-controlled Legislature set for Tuesday afternoon. A law enacted in late March required the legislative leaders to sign off on an extension, and Masterson’s announcement meant the state of emergency was to expire at the end of Tuesday after being in place since March 2020. Kelly accused Republicans of “political obstruction.” She told reporters last week that she wanted the state of emergency to continue at least through August. “A state disaster response has never been, and should not be, political,” Kelly said in a statement. But “it is time for Kansas to return to normal,” Masterson, R-Andover, said in a joint statement with two other GOP leaders, Senate Majority Leader Larry Alley, of Winfield, and Vice President Rick Wilborn, of McPherson.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: State residents now have the option of getting their driver’s license renewed online. The service launched Monday, with Kentucky Transportation Secretary Jim Gray saying it would lead to “greater efficiency, greater security and more choices” for drivers. Online renewal is available for those with standard-issue or Real ID licenses that will expire within six months or have been expired for less than a year, officials said. Renewals must also maintain the same card version as well as the same name and address as their current license. Applications for a replacement license or a license with a name or address change must still be made in person. Online renewal is among the options available due to the phased transfer of licensing services to the Transportation Cabinet’s regional offices from local offices of the circuit court clerks, officials said.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: People caught with small amounts of recreational marijuana will soon face a misdemeanor fine and no possibility of jail time, under a bill that Gov. John Bel Edwards announced Tuesday he has signed into law. The measure sponsored by state Rep. Cedric Glover, D-Shreveport, won narrow, bipartisan support in the legislative session that ended Thursday. With the Democratic governor’s signature, the new law will take effect Aug. 1. Glover’s bill makes possession of up to 14 grams of marijuana – a half-ounce – a misdemeanor crime carrying a fine up to $100 with no possibility of jail time, even for repeat offenses. “This is not a decision I took lightly,” Edwards said in his statement announcing the bill signing. He described the legislation as another step in Louisiana’s “criminal justice reform efforts.” “In addition to carefully reviewing the bill, I also believe deeply that the state of Louisiana should no longer incarcerate people for minor legal infractions, especially those that are legal in many states, that can ruin lives and destroy families, as well as cost taxpayers greatly,” Edwards said. Several municipalities around Louisiana already had switched to fines rather than arrests for possession of small amounts of recreational cannabis, and the state has a legal medical marijuana program.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: The state House voted Monday to eliminate Maine’s secretive “fusion center” created in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks to ensure data is shared among law enforcement agencies. The 88-54 vote followed a whistleblower lawsuit and legislative scrutiny of the center, which was accused of gathering and storing intelligence on gun buyers, power line protesters, and employees of a camp for Israeli and Arab teens. Further votes would be necessary to close the center, which is an arm of the Maine State Police. The proposal provoked fierce debate – and rare bipartisan support – with lawmakers invoking George Orwell’s dystopian novel “1984” and even making comparisons to Joseph Stalin’s Soviet Union. Another lawmaker countered by suggesting the bill was a veiled attempt to defund the police. Rep. Jeffrey Evangelos, an independent from Friendship, said the goal of sharing information about foreign-based terrorism was admirable but said there was “mission creep” beyond the center’s original purpose. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Charlotte Warren, D-Hallowell, said the operator of the fusion center couldn’t demonstrate that it was an effective use of taxpayer dollars or that it offered something new that other law enforcement agencies didn’t already provide.\n\nMaryland\n\nAnnapolis: Maryland’s COVID-19 state of emergency will end July1, more than 15 months after the deadly coronavirus made its first appearance in the state in March 2020. All remaining health restrictions will end on that date, Gov. Larry Hogan said Tuesday, including mask mandates. “The battle’s not over,” Hogan said. “We’re transitioning from a state of emergency to an ongoing operation.” That operation will include continuing to vaccinate thousands of Marylanders who still need COVID-19 shots and caring for the shrinking number of people sickened by the virus. Over the course of the pandemic, Maryland has seen more than 460,000 cases of COVID-19. Nearly 9,500 people have died, many of them elderly and vulnerable. Hogan said Tuesday that Maryland’s health metrics have improved significantly since the worst peak of the pandemic in the winter. “We have finally reached the light at the end of the tunnel,” Hogan said. There will be a 45-day grace period after July 1 to allow Marylanders to adjust to the end of emergency regulations, Hogan said. That includes an extra 45 days to renew driver’s licenses and an extension to the state’s eviction moratorium. Ending the state of emergency does not affect Maryland’s access to federal funds, Hogan said.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is giving away five $1 million cash prizes and five $300,000 college scholarships to residents who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Charlie Baker announced Tuesday. The aim of the so-called VaxMillions Giveaway, modeled after a similar program in Ohio, is to drive up the state’s vaccination rate, already one of the best in the nation, he said. About 4 million Bay Staters are already fully vaccinated, according to the Department of Public Health. “So if you’ve been sitting on the sidelines and thinking about getting vaccinated but for whatever reason haven’t, here’s another reason for you to come forward, protect yourself, your friends, your co-workers and your neighbors by getting vaccinated here in the commonweath,” the Republican governor said at a news conference. All legal residents who have been vaccinated in the state are eligible to register for the lottery prizes by going to mass.gov/VaxMillions starting July 1. Residents ages 18 and older are eligible for the $1 million prizes, while residents ages 12 to 17 are eligible for the scholarships, which are in the form of grants via a 529 College Savings Plan managed by the Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority. The state will hold weekly drawings for five weeks starting July 26.\n\nMichigan\n\nAllendale Township: Community leaders in western Michigan have voted to keep a statue of Confederate and Union Civil War soldiers with a Black child kneeling between them. The Allendale Township board voted 5-2 on Monday, despite a recommendation from a group that the statue be replaced by one with Union soldiers who are Black, Native American and white. “It’s been made very clear to me that the majority of our residents wish for the Civil War statue to remain in the garden of honor,” said Jody Hansen, township clerk and board member. Dozens of people attended the meeting, which was held outdoors at a park bandshell, 15 miles west of Grand Rapids. “What better lesson can we teach our children than by being able to say, ‘We had this thing. We thought it was OK. We have since learned that we were wrong,’ ” said area resident Cathy Seaver, who wants the statue removed. Trustee Barb VanderVeen, who opposed keeping the statue, asked if the child, which represents a slave, could at least be removed. Trustee Candy Kraker said the artist indicated that removing it would damage the structural integrity.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: A group representing landlords announced a lawsuit Tuesday to force an end to the eviction moratorium imposed by Gov. Tim Walz, saying his order makes it all but impossible for property owners to remove disruptive tenants. The Minnesota Multi Housing Association said the governor’s executive order, which was issued in the early days of the pandemic, has become unworkable as it was originally written and is no longer needed. “Over the past year it has become clear that property owners are expected to wait until there is evidence that a person has become so dangerous that other residents have to call the police or move out, or that the rental unit is completely destroyed,” according to the complaint, which was filed in federal court Monday. The association’s CEO, Cecil Smith, told reporters at the Capitol that the lawsuit had been in the works long before legislative leaders agreed Monday to a 15-week “off-ramp” for ending the moratorium. The negotiators said the bipartisan agreement offers strong protections for renters and clear timelines for Minnesotans who owe back rent to secure rental assistance, which is paid directly to landlords. Landlords would be required to send notices to tenants who are behind on their rent 15 days prior to eviction.\n\nMississippi\n\nWater Valley: A former state lawmaker was found shot to death over the weekend in a rural area outside the burned home where her sister-in-law was found dead after Christmas. Ashley Henley, 40, was a Republican who served in the state House from January 2016 to January 2020 from a district in DeSoto County. The North Mississippi Herald was first to report that Henley’s body was found Sunday night in rural Yalobusha County, about 70 miles south of DeSoto County. Her body was outside the home where the body of her sister-in-law Kristina Michelle Jones was found Dec. 26. The Herald published a photo of a homemade sign at the site with photos of Jones under the phrase, “I was murdered.” Yalobusha County coroner Ronnie Stark told the Commercial Appeal on Monday that the time of Henley’s death had not yet been determined. Stark told WMC-TV that Henley had been mowing grass at the home before she was killed. Henley was a teacher before she was elected to the state House, and she often took her young son to the state Capitol during legislative sessions. She sought a second term in November 2019 and lost by 14 votes to a Democrat. Henley challenged the outcome, saying she believed she had found voting irregularities. A committee in the GOP-controlled House held a hearing and denied Henley’s petition.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson enacted a new law Tuesday limiting the duration of local public health restrictions and barring governments from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination to use public facilities and transportation. The law took effect immediately upon Parson’s signature, but it may have little immediate effect because most local officials already lifted their coronavirus restrictions on businesses and public gatherings and have not been checking people’s vaccination status. Parson, a Republican, said the law still is important for the future. “Then next time we do get in a crisis, we’re going to have a little bit more safeguards for the general public to make sure they have more transparency and more of a voice in the process,” he said. When under a statewide emergency declaration, the new law limits local orders restricting businesses, churches, schools or gatherings to 30 days, unless extended by a majority vote of the local governing body such as a city council. If there is no state emergency declaration, then local orders closing entire classifications of entities or activities could last for only 21 days, unless extended by a two-thirds vote of the local governing body.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Public review has begun for a proposal to boost radio and cellphone service in Glacier National Park, park officials said. The deadline to comment is July 11. The proposal calls for upgrades to communications from the National Park Service, which uses outdated technology or can’t reach remote areas of the park, the Missoulian reports. Currently, cellphone service is only available in the western part of the park at Apgar and the eastern part of the park because of commercial cell towers outside the park borders. “While recognizing that national parks provide disconnected space for many visitors, the plan also proposes a strategy for commercial cellular and/or internet access for public and NPS use in certain developed areas,” such as Many Glacier, Rising Sun, Two Medicine and Lake McDonald Lodge, park spokesperson Gina Kerzman said. The proposal would prohibit large-scale cell towers and commercial telecommunications gear in the backcountry, despite visitors and employees alike relying more on internet access. Signal strength would be limited as much as possible to the four developed areas mentioned in the proposal, Kerzman said, although some spillover might be unpreventable.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: The state is approaching having 70% of its adult population vaccinated against COVID-19, but the pace of distribution of the shots continues to slow. The state may be close to President Joe Biden’s goal of having 70% or more of all adults with at least one dose of the vaccine by July 4. About 63% of Nebraskans 18 and older had received at least one shot as of Friday, according to data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That rate ranks 24th among all the states. Nebraska has 57% of its adults fully vaccinated. Vermont leads the nation with 84% of its adults having received at least one shot, and 14 states have exceeded Biden’s goal. The CDC said roughly 31,000 shots were distributed in Nebraska last week, which was down from 37,000 the week before and well below the mid-April peak of 150,000 in a week. The number of new virus cases reported in the state continues to fall. Nebraska reported 234 new cases last week, down from 254 the week before and 378 two weeks ago. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Nebraska also decreased over the past two weeks, going from 44.86 new cases per day May 30 to 28.43 new cases per day Sunday. Nebraska has reported 223,888 virus cases and 2,258 deaths since the pandemic began.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Advocates are building momentum toward setting aside a wide desert area rich with biological diversity and Native American cultural significance for permanent environmental protection. The southern Nevada site would be called Avi Kwa Ame National Monument and encompass a Spanish Colonial Revival house that once belonged to 1920s-era Hollywood actors Clara Bow and Rex Bell on their historic Walking Box Ranch. The rugged and dry landscape is dotted with Joshua trees between mountain ranges west of Searchlight. At more than 594 square miles, it covers an area larger than San Francisco Bay. “There are threats to the sort of peace and the environment that we’re in right now,” Gabriel di Chiara, a Nevada Conservation League organizer, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. “And we believe establishing this monument will preserve this land and this way of life for future generations, and it’s vitally important.” Conservation advocates providing a tour of the 5,000-square-foot homesite June 9 said they saw hope in President Joe Biden’s administration, a federal conservation plan that aims to protect 30% of American lands and water by 2030, and the appointment of Interior Secretary Deb Haaland as the first Native American head of a presidential Cabinet post.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nManchester: As the number of COVID-19 cases has fallen and restrictions have been dropped in the state, drug overdoses are on the rise in some cities. Suspected overdoses in Manchester and Nashua rose by 26% in May, according to American Medical Response. The 72 suspected overdoses was the most in a single month since June 2019, WMUR-TV reports. Overdoses decreased during the pandemic since more people were inside, said AMR Regional Director Chris Stawasz. “It gives us concern that in the summer months, which we typically see as higher overdose months, we’re going to be back probably at levels we have not seen in several years,” he said. More people now have access to the overdose reversal drug Narcan, officials said. There was record use of Narcan in May in Manchester.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Fifteen months after they were shuttered at the height of the pandemic, adult day care centers will be allowed to reopen due to a sharp decline in COVID-19 deaths, hospitalizations and cases, state officials said Monday. The centers, which provide activities for those suffering from dementia, were closed to protect the elderly March 20, 2020, when there were only 890 cases and 11 confirmed COVID deaths in the state. Since then, New Jersey has tallied more than 890,000 cases and 26,000 COVID-19 deaths, the vast majority of which have been among seniors. The adult centers are some of the few facilities that are still closed due to COVID-19, while most other venues have been reopened for more than a year, and mask-wearing and social distancing have been relaxed. Safety guidance on how to return to operations such as requiring screenings for staff was to be sent out to the centers Monday, Health Commissioner Judy Persichilli said. Among the procedures: Staff must wear masks regardless of vaccination status. Participants can engage in close group activities if everyone is vaccinated. An isolation room is needed for a sick participant. And windows and doors should remain open to promote better ventilation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is urging cities and counties to consider banning the sale of fireworks ahead of the July Fourth holiday. She issued an executive order Monday, pointing to the drought that has blanketed much of the state and the fire restrictions that already are in place across New Mexico’s five national forests. While state statutes prevent the governor from imposing a statewide ban, the governor’s office is encouraging municipalities to take action to limit fire danger by adopting fireworks restrictions over the coming weeks. Rio Rancho and Farmington have warned residents that only permissible fireworks will be allowed – such as cone fountains, crackling devices and sparklers – and only in paved or otherwise barren areas. Dona Ana County recently approved restrictions that will span the holiday. “We want to prevent fires in the dangerous conditions we are experiencing,” County Fire Chief Shannon Cherry said, referring to the dry and windy weather. Farmington’s proclamation also will remain in effect for 30 days, but officials said the City Council may extend it if extreme conditions continue.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Dozens of Holocaust survivors clapped, sang and danced Monday at a concert held in their honor in Brooklyn in the first large gathering for New York-area survivors after months of isolation during the coronavirus pandemic. The concert by popular Orthodox Jewish singer Yaakov Shwekey was organized by the Nachas Health and Family Network and other groups that help the more than 35,000 Holocaust survivors estimated to live in the New York City metropolitan area. “It’s extremely good for the soul, for the heart, to see people coming out once again and socializing,” said Dolly Rabinowitz, who sat in the front row of the Yeshivah of Flatbush auditorium joined by other Holocaust survivors and students of the Modern Orthodox Jewish school. The survivors, most now in their 80s and 90s, suffered unspeakable horrors in concentration camps. In the past year, many remained isolated at home because they were at a high risk from the fast-spreading virus. “To be out once again is like reviving ourselves. To sit among our children and grandchildren is heartwarming,” said Rabinowitz, who lived through Auschwitz and the Death March. Some held hands and choked back tears when they heard an instrumental version of “Ani Ma’amin,” sung by many Jews herded into cattle cars on their way to concentration camps.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The Constitution Party of North Carolina and North Carolina Green Party have failed to garner enough signatures to remain official political parties in the state for now, an election official said Monday. The State Board of Elections determined earlier this year that the two small parties had fallen short of candidate support thresholds from last November. But the board said the parties would be recognized again to field candidates starting later this year if each collected about 13,900 signatures of registered voters by Saturday. Neither party reached that goal, board spokesman Noah Grant wrote in an email. That means their parties’ registrants – totaling 9,600 between them – will now be re-designated as unaffiliated voters. The confirmed signatures so far – over 2,800 for the Constitution Party and fewer than 10 for the Green Party – will roll over into petitions to field candidates in the November 2022 election, Grant said. The groups would need to be meet the thresholds by next June 1 to qualify. For now, the state will recognize just three official political parties: Democrats, Republicans and Libertarians.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state’s taxable sales and purchases for the first quarter of 2021 fell nearly 10% over the same period the previous year. Taxable sales and purchases for January, February and March totaled $4.1 billion, a 9.9% decrease over the three-month span in 2020. Tax Commissioner Ryan Rauschenberger said the drop was due to the coronavirus pandemic’s impact on the state’s economy. Despite the decline statewide, Fargo, Bismarck, Grand Forks and Minot all reported increases, led by Fargo at 17.6%. Ten of the 15 major industry sectors reported declines over the year. The mining and oil extraction sector decreased by $438 million, or about 59%. The wholesale trade sector decreased by $250 million, a 23.5% drop. North Dakota’s taxable sales and purchases are a key indicator of economic activity in the state. They also are used to forecast state budgets.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Ohioans receiving food stamps would have to undergo a new “asset test” that measures total worth, including the value of cars owned by anyone in a household, under a provision in the Senate’s version of the state’s upcoming two-year budget. The goal of the test is to be sure needy recipients of SNAP benefits get what they deserve, said Senate President Matt Huffman, R-Lima. “There are a lot of folks who can afford to pay for a variety of things who are still receiving these benefits,” Huffman said this month. The measure incorporates elements of stand-alone legislation introduced earlier this year in the GOP-controlled Senate. Dozens of people representing food banks, legal aid groups and health care advocacy groups have testified against it. Opponents of that bill, pending in the Senate Government Oversight and Reform Committee, say it comes at the worst possible time, as emergency federal benefits enacted during the coronavirus pandemic expire. Those include maximum allotments for food stamp recipients, a $300 weekly unemployment supplement, and a moratorium on evictions. “It will force low-income Ohioans to choose between having food and owning a car to get to work or saving money to prepare for an emergency,” said Kelsey Bergfeld, director of Columbus-based Advocates for Ohio’s Future.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: “Tiger King” Joe Exotic is selling items seen on the hit Netflix series that elevated the big cat handler into a household name. The auction will also include NFT versions – digital “non-fungible tokens” – of those items and artwork. Exotic, real name is Joseph Maldonado-Passage, will be selling 3D renderings of cult collectibles sold alongside real-life tangible items seen on the show, as well as digital artworks for fans. Items include Exotic’s Smith & Wesson revolver, a fringed leather jacket and images autographed from prison. Online auction house Mintable will present the auction Friday at officialtigerkingnft.com. Also up for bid are the Tiger King’s black leather jacket and pants set, a bikini worn by adult film actress Rachel Starr, digital trading cards and artwork, and audio recordings of Exotic made from federal prison, where he’s serving a 22-year sentence for hiring someone to murder nemesis Carol Baskin. He was already somewhat of a celebrity in Oklahoma before Netflix launched the “Tiger King” series last year. For years, he ran an exotic animal park near Wynnewood, offering guests an up-close experience with big cats like his namesake tigers. He unsuccessfully sought the Libertarian Party’s nomination for governor in 2018, two years after campaigning for president.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Nearly 4 in 10 Oregonians strongly or somewhat agree with statements that reflect core arguments of white nationalist and other far-right groups, according to a new statewide survey. DHM Research and the Oregon Values and Beliefs Center, both independent nonpartisan organizations, surveyed 603 Oregon residents in a 15-minute online questionnaire Jan. 8-13. They estimate the margin of error is between 2.4% and 4.0%. To recruit respondents, DHM used a professionally maintained panel. It also set demographic quotas and weighted data to ensure a representative sample. Survey results indicated that, compared to a DHM Research panel in 2018, fewer Oregonians believed in protecting and preserving the country’s multicultural heritage. More agreed America “must protect and preserve its white European heritage.” It’s a “disturbing” revelation, said Lindsay Schubiner, a program director at Western States Center, the progressive nonprofit organization that commissioned the research. She said the 4 in 10 represent a growing population in the state that is vulnerable to messages commonly used by white nationalists like the ones posed in the survey, including the “white heritage” idea and that “white people in America face discrimination and unfair treatment on the basis of their race.”\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A ban on employers mandating vaccines for their workers inched ahead in the state House on Tuesday with a committee vote supported by all Republicans and opposed by every Democrat. The main sponsor, Rep. Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon, called it “a very simple question of workers’ rights.” Diamond has been a fervent opponent of coronavirus mitigation policies and has been publicly skeptical of mask-wearing and vaccines. Labor and Industry Committee Chairman Jim Cox, R-Berks, said lawmakers were responding to increasing reports that employers are requiring COVID-19 vaccines, forcing some workers to choose between the jab or losing a job. An amendment by Cox took out a provision in Diamond’s bill that would have ended employer-mandated tests for marijuana. Diamond said after the meeting that the marijuana testing language lacked support. The bill would let workers or prospective workers avoid workplace-mandated vaccinations by putting into writing that their doctor has concerns it might harm their health; that they have religious or “strong moral or ethical” convictions against a vaccine; that they already contracted COVID-19; or that they are concerned because tge vaccines have not been fully approved by federal regulators.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: State officials are proposing to build a new laboratory to replace the one run by the Health Department, which is the only Level 3 biosafety facility in the state. Director Dr. Nicole Alexander-Scott is advocating for spending $82 million to replace the State Health Lab that she said had limited capacity to expand testing needed during the coronavirus pandemic because the building’s systems are outdated. “When it came to testing, for example, where we were leaders, we ultimately were inhibited by our ability to expand just because of the confines of the building and the electrical supply for the building,” Alexander-Scott said. “With the next pandemic, we are going to need the ability to expand and shift and streamline.” The medical examiner’s office, state crime lab and environmental testing labs are also located in the same building as the State Health Lab in downtown Providence across from the state Capitol. Gov. Dan McKee included the allocation for the new lab in the proposed budget. If the Legislature approves the spending, it would come from the $1.1 billion in federal coronavirus relief that the state is getting. The new fiscal year starts July 1, and a final budget bill is expected this month.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nMyrtle Beach: It may just be loose change, but parking meters are helping to show how tourism is booming along the state’s most popular beach after COVID-19 pandemic restrictions were lifted. Myrtle Beach collected as much in parking fees in May as it does in a typical June, Myrtle Beach Downtown Redevelopment Office Executive Director Brian Schmitt told The Post and Courier of Charleston. “2021 has just been nuts,” Schmitt said. “In March, we did April numbers. In April, we did May numbers. … If that trend continues, then we hit June with July numbers – which July is typically our best month, our $360,000 month – we expect to maybe see that continue.” The city no longer just collects coins from meters. There are parking lot terminals that take debit and credit cards and a mobile app called ParkMobile that allows drivers to stop their cars and pay with a click of a smartphone, officials said. More traditional ways of measuring tourism are also up in Myrtle Beach. The Chamber of Commerce said hotel occupancy rates are up this summer compared to 2019. The officials don’t use 2020 numbers to compare because of COVID-19 restrictions.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nAberdeen: A federal judge on Monday criminally charged three members of the U.S. Marshals Service with contempt of court and obstructing justice after a dispute with a marshal who refused to disclose her COVID-19 vaccination status and removed prisoners from a courthouse. Three supervisory marshals, including the agency’s Chief of Staff John Kilgallon, were accused of allowing a deputy marshal to leave the courthouse in Aberdeen with prisoners in tow May 10, after the marshal refused to tell the judge whether she had been vaccinated against COVID-19, the Aberdeen American News reports. U.S. District Judge Charles Kornmann gave the U.S. Attorney’s Office until Friday to decide whether to charge the marshals, including Daniel Mosteller, the head of the agency in South Dakota, and Stephen Houghtaling, the state’s chief deputy. Kornmann said he was determined to find another prosecutor if the U.S. attorney declined to prosecute the case. Kornmann moved in March to require vaccinations for courthouse employees, but Mosteller told the judge the Marshals Service was not requiring employees to get vaccinated and would not provide their vaccination status to the court.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Federal courts released 18% of Tennessee prisoners who requested compassionate release in 2020, a new report from the federal Sentencing Commission shows. At the height of COVID-19 last year, thousands of motions asking for reduced sentences were filed in courts across the nation, according to the commission. Most of those were filed by the defendants themselves. Combined, 336 federal defendants in Tennessee districts filed motions for compassionate release. The courts released 61 of them. The Sentencing Commission tracks federal sentencing trends and policy, regularly releasing reports on that data. The June 10 report focuses only on compassionate release cases. Nationally, a total of 2,549 defendants were compassionately released, their sentences ending, according to the commission. That number is 21% of those who tried. “Compassionate release” is a broad term, usually related to sentencing laws that allow the court to find “extraordinary and compelling reasons” to warrant an early release. At least 6,654 people in Tennessee Department of Corrections custody had contracted COVID-19 as of last week, and 42 of them are believed to have died from the disease.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: On the cusp of summer, the electric power grid manager for most of the state on Monday issued its second conservation alert since the deadly February blackout, calling on users to dial back energy consumption through Friday to avert an emergency. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas said many forced generation outages and record June demand have squeezed the power supply. It appealed to users to set thermostats no lower than 78 degrees and avoid using large electric appliances until demand decreased late in the day. ERCOT predicted a peak demand load on its system of 73,000 megawatts, far above the June record of 69,123 megawatts set between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. June 27, 2018. However, as of 2:30 p.m. Monday, 12,178 megawatts of the grid’s 86,862 megawatts of generating capacity were offline, ERCOT said, leaving a razor-thin margin of reserve capacity of about 2,000 megawatts. “We will be conducting a thorough analysis with generation owners to determine why so many units are out of service,” Woody Rickerson, ERCOT vice president of grid planning and operations, said in a statement. “This is unusual for this early in the summer season.”\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: Transportation officials have reported nearly twice as many people died in alcohol-involved crashes on the state’s roads last year compared to the year before, despite less commuter traffic during the coronavirus pandemic. The state Department of Transportation said there were 61 fatal crashes involving alcohol last year compared to the 32 crashes in 2019, The Salt Lake Tribune reports. Department officials said there was also an 11% increase in traffic fatalities in the state from 2019 to 2020, which includes fatal alcohol-involved crashes. Nationally, there was a 7% increase in traffic fatalities over the past year and a 9% increase in alcohol-involved fatalities, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Robert Miles, director of traffic and safety for the U.S. Department of Transportation, said it’s too soon to know why fatal crashes increased. He said the pattern has surprised everyone, including traffic experts. “I think … most people thought if there is less traffic on the street there will be fewer fatalities; there will be fewer crashes,” he said. “We saw fewer crashes, but we saw more fatal crashes.” Miles said it is possible people began taking more risks while driving because of extra road space created by reduced traffic. But he also said not every type of fatal crash increased in the past year.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: Now that the state of emergency imposed to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic in Vermont is ending, meetings of public bodies must be held in person, Vermont Secretary of State Jim Condos said. During the pandemic, public boards were authorized to hold those meetings remotely. Condos said boards can still allow people to attend remotely, but a physical meeting location must be provided, and those bodies must physically post notices of the meetings. “Vermont’s public servants have made it clear that our government can still operate and make critical decisions during a public health emergency without sacrificing the right of Vermonters to know how their government is making those decisions and their right to participate in the process,” Condos said in a statement Monday. “As we transition towards our shared ‘new normal,’ it is vital that we use the many successes, best practices, and lessons learned from the last 15 months to improve how we, as trusted public officials, best serve the public.” On Monday, after the state vaccinated just over 80% of the eligible population, Gov. Phil Scott lifted all COVID-19 restrictions. The state of emergency that allowed the remote meetings expired at midnight Tuesday.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: A dental student at Virginia Commonwealth University has been awarded $10,000 by her school to develop a prototype for her invention to help those wearing braces floss between their teeth. Student Christina Gordon first developed her idea for the Proxy-Flosser when she was 10 years old and looking for a better way to complete the tedious task. The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports she put something together akin to a floss pick and didn’t think much else about it until she enrolled in dental school. She said she was shocked to learn that a better product still hadn’t been invented, and she began making inquiries about whether her Proxy-Flosser was marketable. She won $10,000 from VCU’s Innovation Gateway, which helps faculty and students commercialize their innovations. Because her idea has not been patented, she is not publicly disclosing the details of her invention.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The City Council has approved a law that will require meal-delivery apps to sign agreements with restaurants instead of listing restaurants on the apps and taking orders without permission. Council President M. Lorena Gonzalez, who sponsored the law, said it will protect restaurants, simplify work for delivery-app drivers and give customers more reliable service, The Seattle Times reports. The vote was 8-0 on Monday. Mayor Jenny Durkan hadn’t reviewed the law yet to determine whether she’ll sign it or let it become law without her signature, her office said. Council staff noted the law could result in some restaurants paying delivery fees they’re not paying now, possibly less work for drivers and fewer options for customers. Gonzalez said restaurant industry groups such as Seattle Restaurant Alliance backed the measure, and labor groups and delivery apps were consulted. Delivery apps Grubhub, Postmates and Uber Eats didn’t immediately comment. Brianna Megid, a spokesperson for DoorDash, said restaurants should have the power to make choices affecting their businesses. DoorDash removes restaurants, when requested, she said. Under the status quo, delivery apps can use online menus and other information to list restaurants without permission. Restaurants may not even know they’re listed.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Hundreds of demonstrators outraged with Sen. Joe Manchin’s opposition to a sweeping overhaul of U.S. election law marched through the capital city Monday evening. The Rev. William Barber, co-chair of the Poor People’s Campaign, denounced the influential moderate Democratic senator and called for a diverse coalition of working people to apply pressure on Manchin, who recently opposed a $15 minimum wage and the price tag of President Joe Biden’s initial $2 trillion infrastructure plan. “West Virginia needs a real senator,” Barber told the crowd at a Charleston park. Then they marched a mile to Manchin’s office. Unable to meet with the senator – an aide told Barber he was in Washington – leaders of the demonstration affixed a poster-sized protest letter to the front doors of the office building. Rallygoers took turns signing their names on it. When Manchin’s aides offered comment cards to collect protestors’ grievances, Barber waved them away: “We don’t want to talk to the staff.” The protest was spurred by Manchin’s decision to oppose a landmark reform of U.S. election law, a proposal known as For the People Act. Manchin said last week that passing reform on a party-line vote risked further stoking partisan divides.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The superintendents of the state’s five largest school districts told members of the Legislature on Tuesday that they’re “dismayed” that $2.3 billion in federal aid is at risk because of low funding for K-12 schools. Superintendents of the Milwaukee, Madison, Racine, Kenosha and Green Bay school districts urged lawmakers in a letter to set aside partisan differences and do what’s best for schools. The state budget being written by the Legislature’s Republican-controlled Joint Finance Committee does not include enough funding for K-12 schools to ensure that Wisconsin would be able to keep $2.3 billion in federal coronavirus relief money. Republican leaders have repeatedly said they will ensure the funding wouldn’t be lost. The budget committee plans to complete its work this week. As it stands, the new budget would include $128 million more in state funding for K-12 schools than the current one, which is about one-tenth of what Democratic Gov. Tony Evers requested. Evers and Democrats have urged lawmakers to spend more on K-12 schools, especially in light of rosier projections showing the state will collect $4.4 billion more in taxes than originally expected.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: A recycled wooden sculpture of an enormous troll now lounges in Rendezvous Park. It’s the brainchild of Copenhagen artist Thomas Dambo, who has built trolls all over the world. Their whimsical construction beckons spectators to clamber aboard and, in the case of R Park, serves as a bridge to ferry the fun from the park to a nearby miniature island, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Dambo named the Jackson Hole troll “Mama Mimi,” for her motherly guidance – plus, he said, Mimi is a “good, strong” Scandinavian name. “I’m super happy with it,” the artist said of his 80th piece. Mimi is one of the few female trolls in Dambo’s small army, and apart from one tucked in a fjord, she’s the first to interact so closely with water. Mimi’s face and feet were assembled at the artist’s Denmark workshop, but everything else was mapped out and assembled on site. Her hair is made entirely of driftwood roots found washed up on the banks of the Snake River. Rather than buying lumber that’s been shipped across the country, he used leftover pallets from Osprey Beverages, saving them from the dumpster. Mimi’s signature stone necklace was sourced from the river and a team member who offered up an old, oversized rope as a band. Set back a quarter-mile or so from the bridge, Mimi won’t be collecting any toll money from travelers, but she did cost a pretty penny: roughly $50,000 raised by an army of #Trollbackers, plus another $50,000 from private donors.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/06/16"}]}

Kay Ivey on Thursday vetoed legislation to delay next year’s requirement to hold back third graders who aren’t reading at grade level – a postponement lawmakers sought after the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted classrooms. The veto means the promotion requirement will take effect at the end of the 2021-22 school year. The governor said it is “hasty and premature” to delay the requirement before education officials can review the newest test scores. “As a former teacher and even more so as governor, I believe early literacy is the gateway to all learning,” Ivey said in a statement. The Republican governor said she is asking the state superintendent to brief the public on spring test scores when available and for the Alabama Committee on Grade Level Reading to make recommendations regarding any future action. “Everyone agrees that the past 15 months of the COVID-19 pandemic have been hard on all Alabamians, including school personnel, students and parents. However, to establish any delay at all in the Alabama Literacy Act prior to analyzing the 2020-2021 summative assessment data for reading would be hasty and premature,” Ivey said.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The city’s schools will be getting more than $112 million in funding from the latest round of federal coronavirus relief, and officials want the public to weigh in on how to spend it. The Anchorage School District received more $62 million from two prior rounds of federal pandemic aid and expects to get the latest disbursement as early as July, Alaska’s News Source reports. A school board town hall Wednesday night invited residents to offer input, and officials also distributed a survey in an effort to gather feedback.\n\nArizona\n\nFlagstaff: Coconino County and its most populous city are dropping mask mandates they implemented last June to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Flagstaff Mayor Paul Deasy announced Tuesday that the city’s face-covering proclamation that took effect June 20 would end Wednesday, and the county Board of Supervisors voted unanimously Tuesday to rescind the county’s mandate June 1. The county’s action affects only unincorporated areas, and any mask mandates imposed by local and tribal governments may still be enforced, the Arizona Daily Sun reports. Deasy cited wide availability of COVID-19 vaccines and declining case numbers. “We will continue to follow the recommendations of the CDC and our local health departments and urge our residents to do the same,” Deasy said in a city statement. Businesses can still require face coverings and social distancing on private property, the statement said, and face coverings are still required on public transportation, at the airport and in other areas required by federal law.\n\nArkansas\n\nSpringdale: A local business announced Wednesday that it has received federal emergency use authorization for its coronavirus antibody test that uses a drop of blood from a finger. The authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is for use in moderate-complex settings and at the point of care. “The ADEXUSDx COVID-19 Test is literally a lab at the tip of your finger, specifically designed to make diagnostic testing possible at home,” said Kevin Clark, chief executive officer of NOWDiagnostics Inc. “This EUA approval is the first step in making that a reality.” The rapid-results finger-stick test is not meant to find an active infection but can tell if a person has had COVID-19 and might still have some immunity. Because it’s entirely self-contained, the test can be done on the spot without a doctor, pharmacist or other trained professional with specialty equipment. The test would also not need to be sent to a lab for processing. During the emergency use authorization, however, it will only be used by trained professionals. The devices have been sent throughout the nation, and NOWDiagnostics in Springdale is on track to produce 2 million of the ADEXUSDx COVID-19 Test devices per month. The facility now employs about 95 people. The company has 65 patents related to the device.\n\nCalifornia\n\nAnaheim: Disneyland fans won’t need an address in the Golden State to get into the park beginning June15. Disneyland and Disney California Adventure will welcome visitors from outside the state in mid-June, park officials said Wednesday. The park reopened in late April after a 412-day, pandemic-induced shutdown – but only to California residents. Disney’s Paradise Pier Hotel, one of the on-site hotels, will also reopen that day, followed by iconic Disneyland Hotel on July 2. Disney said the state of California “strongly recommends” – but does not require – that all guests be fully vaccinated against COVID-19 or obtain a negative coronavirus test before visiting. Face coverings, however, are required. Travelers need to have a ticket and theme park reservation for the same park on the same date.\n\nColorado\n\nColorado Springs: El Paso County agreed Tuesday to pay $65,000 to settle a federal lawsuit alleging that mismanagement by the sheriff led to a COVID-19 outbreak in the jail last year. The payment approved by county commissioners will cover attorneys’ fees paid by the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit, The Gazette reports. Wellpath of Nashville, Tennessee, the company paid to provide health care in the Colorado Springs jail, will pay an additional $30,000 as part of the deal. In exchange, the ACLU agreed to drop the lawsuit without a finding a fault by Sheriff Bill Elder. Spokespeople for the sheriff’s office and Wellpath declined to comment on the settlement Wednesday. The lawsuit was filed after more than 1,000 inmates at the jail contracted COVID-19 last fall – the largest outbreak among jails and prisons in Colorado. It alleged that inmates were not given masks for months and were punished for making their own, which the ACLU said helped create a “mammoth, preventable” crisis. Jail officials have said they worked with county health officials to manage cases in the jail. They said they could not distribute masks initially because the only ones available had metal staples, which they said created unspecified safety concerns.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A week after lifting most COVID-19 restrictions in the state, Gov. Ned Lamont said Wednesday that his focus is now on getting people back into their offices and back to normal summer activities. Lamont joined other state officials and business leaders at the Connecticut Convention Center in Hartford to tout the state’s high vaccination rate and low coronavirus infection rate. “I have spent the last year-plus saying stay safe, stay home, and today I’m telling you, get out of the damn house, come enjoy Hartford, get on a plane, visit a restaurant, visit an amazing hotel,” he said. Connecticut has seen new cases go from a seven-day average of about 427 cases per day May 10 to just about 167 new cases, according to data from John’s Hopkins University. That’s down from more than 2,000 a day in January. More than 1.8 million residents have been fully vaccinated, and more than 60% have received at least one dose of a vaccine, according to the governor’s office. Connecticut Economic and Community Development Commissioner David Lehman said Connecticut’s economic activity is about 92% of what it was pre-pandemic, which ranks 19th in the nation. “So we are better than average, but we need to get that to 100%, and really we need to get that beyond 100%,” he said.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: While the coronavirus shutdown hit many nonprofit groups and community organizations hard, it also forced them to think of new ways to reach people, and that knowledge could propel them for years to come. “There are so many things we would have never done if it wasn’t for the pandemic,” said Mike Connolly, the executive director of the New Castle Historical Society. Before the shutdown, the group offered tours and programs at the Amstel House, Dutch House and Old Library and operated the Visitor Center at the Arsenal. COVID-19 meant the end to most indoor tours and adjusting other programs for social distancing. “Outdoor walking tours were an easy way to accommodate people during capacity restrictions,” Connolly said. The group was also able to open the historic gardens. But the key to staying relevant was being online. “We had to keep people aware that we’re here, and a lot of that had to go virtual,” Connolly said. “The biggest accomplishment was learning how to do things differently, getting out of our routine. It allowed us to expand the way we do things.” Before the pandemic, the society never held a webinar. “Suddenly we were attracting people from other states and other countries who couldn’t attend before,” Connolly said.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Now that people can more freely travel just in time for Memorial Day weekend, the nonprofit organization Destination D.C. is expecting an increase in travelers to the city, WUSA-TV reports. “There are still free things to do in D.C., so this really has been our opportunity to really deliver that message,” said Theresa Belpulsi, vice president of tourism with Destination D.C. “I feel very confident about what the future is going to hold. Obviously, international travel will be slower to return until we open up the borders, but for the most part, we are focused on domestic visitation, and we look forward to a fantastic summer.” Museums and monuments consistently draw tourists to the D.C. area, and many of them will be back open this weekend. The Smithsonian will reopen 10 of its museums on a staggered schedule throughout the summer, marking a full reopening of the institution since closing to the public in March 2020. The museums will maintain additional COVID-19 safety measures, and many require visitors to reserve free, timed-entry passes before arriving. According to Tourism Economics, visitor spending in the district fell more than $6 billion last year. That meant a loss of about $477 million in tax revenue from visitor spending.\n\nFlorida\n\nMiami: One of the world’s top electronic music festivals is returning to downtown Miami next year with the blessing of neighbors who have complained about the event in the past. Organizers of the Ultra Music Festival on Tuesday announced an agreement to settle tensions with the Downtown Neighbors Alliance, the Miami Herald reports. The association representing 13 downtown condominium towers will no longer seek to remove the event from Bayfront Park. Ultra said in a statement that it would address issues like construction schedules, park closures, noise monitoring and traffic management. Festival organizers and residents found a balance between protecting local lifestyles and hosting large-scale music productions, Ultra spokesman Ray Martinez said. He suggested the event being canceled the past two years might have helped negotiations. “Maybe the COVID pause gave both sides an opportunity to kind of take a breath, if you will, and come to the table without the impending event looming over either side,” Martinez said. Ultra was set to return to downtown Miami in March 2020, but a nationwide coronavirus lockdown going into effect just days before the festival forced its cancellation. The event was postponed for another year this past March, set to return in 2022.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Doctors are seeing an uptick in accidental overdoses in children in the area, said Dr. Brian Coleman, medical director of the pediatric emergency room at the Memorial Health Dwaine & Cynthia Willett Children’s Hospital of Savannah. Coleman said the children’s ER has seen about 15 cases since opening in March – roughly double the normal rate. Commonly ingested drugs are opioids and marijuana-infused foods. “It may be that with the pandemic, and people being in the house more, it just provides more opportunity for kids to explore,” he said. “And you know, kids are like little bloodhounds, and they will find stuff on the floor and under couches.” For some drugs, even “one pill can kill,” Coleman said, though none of the recent accidental overdoses resulted in a fatality. “A dose of a standard oxycodone or Percocet or any type of those opioid medications, one pill is enough to suppress the child’s breathing, suppress their mental status, to where it can be life-threatening,” he said. Sam Wilson, program coordinator of Safe Kids Savannah, urges parents, grandparents and other caregivers to keep all medications in child-proof packaging or a lock box and out of children’s reach. Wilson agreed the pandemic may have played a role in the increase by bringing together caregivers and kids in new settings.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: State officials are preparing to announce new incentives for people to get vaccinated. “It’s going to be big, and it’s going to be generous,” Lt. Gov. Josh Green said. “Probably about a week or two from now, I would expect some of these fun announcements to come.” While details are thin, Hawaii News Now reports officials with the Hawaii Restaurant Association and the Retail Merchants of Hawaii said they were asked to find businesses willing to participate. Green said he is also planning to try to get participation from Las Vegas, often referred to as Hawaii’s ninth island, to join. “My team is going to reach out to some hotels over in Las Vegas and see if they’d be willing to offer some nights over on the ninth island,” Green said. Hawaii has administered about 1.5 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine. Green said the state hopes to get about 2 million shots in arms. “So these last 500,000 doses are going to be a little bit more difficult,” he said. Department of Health spokesperson Brooks Baehr said members of the business community “are taking the lead in this effort to work with the Department of Health and provide incentives that may engage and excite people.” Several other states have already launched incentive programs. Green said Hawaii’s incentive program is being vetted by attorneys.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: With the governor out of the state, Idaho’s lieutenant governor issued an executive order Thursday banning mask mandates in schools and public buildings, saying such directives threatened people’s freedom. Republican Lt. Gov. Janice McGeachin is acting governor while Gov. Brad Little is at the Republican Governors Association conference in Nashville, Tennessee. He was expected to return Thursday evening. Last week, McGeachin announced her run for governor, challenging the first-term incumbent Little. McGeachin is on the far right of the political spectrum in the conservative state, and her order could bolster her support as a candidate for governor. Little’s office said McGeachin did not make him aware that she planned to issue the executive order. The office didn’t say what Little would do when he returned but said residents value local control. “Throughout the pandemic, Gov. Little has been committed to protecting the health and safety of the people of Idaho and has emphasized the importance of Idahoans choosing to protect our neighbors and loved ones and keeping our economy and schools open,” said Little’s spokeswoman, Marissa Morrison. Little has never issued a statewide mask mandate, but some counties, cities and schools did. Many have been lifting the mandates.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: COVID-19 vaccines will be available to Memorial Day weekend travelers up and down Illinois. The state announced clinics at Union Station in Chicago and four TravelCenters of America locations in Mount Vernon, Troy, Effingham and Bloomington. Wally’s and Hy-Vee are also offering a clinic for travelers along Interstate 55 near Pontiac. Travelers will be offered the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. In addition to the weekend clinics, more than 1,000 locations in Illinois offer COVID-19 vaccines. They’re listed at coronavirus.illinois.gov. “Memorial Day weekend travelers will have yet another chance to join the more than 6 million Illinoisans who have gotten vaccinated,” Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Wednesday.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: The governor is directing all state employees to return to their offices by early July. Gov. Eric Holcomb told state workers that the transition from a March 2020 stay-at-home order starts with senior staff, who must return by June 7. Other employees should spend at least 50% of their time at the office by June 21 and return full time by July 6. Staffers for many state agencies have been working remotely, but Holcomb said in a Wednesday email to employees that “it is not the optimal way for us to serve Hoosiers.” “We work better together, and build more solid and collaborative teams, when we can have regular face-to-face conversations,” Holcomb said. “Returning to the office means the impromptu discussions that so often lead to innovation will be happening again with more frequency and energy.” The state will offer a vaccination clinic at the Indiana Government Center in Indianapolis on June 21-22. About 2.4 million Indiana residents were considered fully vaccinated as of Wednesday, although the state’s vaccination rate is the 14th lowest in the country at about 35% of total population, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Most of the state’s counties declined any more COVID-19 vaccine for this week amid a slack in demand, and an official in a county with one of the lowest vaccination rates said Wednesday that she has given up arguing with people to get shots. Iowa Department of Public Health officials said based on demand from counties, the state ordered just 7,850 doses of vaccine for this week, with 81 of its 99 counties ordering none at all. Only Johnson County in eastern Iowa reported more than half of its population fully vaccinated, at 53.2%, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Polk County, the state’s most populous, has fully vaccinated 43.5% of the population. The three counties with the lowest vaccination rates are on the state’s southern border with Missouri, including Wayne County, with 29.7%. Wayne County Public Health Administrator Shelley Bickel said in the past she has tried to convince people to get vaccinated, but she’s stopped those attempts. “They’ll sit and argue with you. We’re just tired of fighting,” she said. “We’re not pushing anyone. We figure if you want it, you can get it.” She attributed resistance to conservative residents, many of whom have long declined to wear masks or get vaccinated.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: After a year of operating virtually because of the pandemic, the city’s Wheelhouse Incubator program is returning full force for a 2021 summer session. The Wheelhouse Incubator, hosted by GO Topeka, is a 12-week course designed to help entrepreneurs scale up their businesses through strategic education, networking and mentoring opportunities. “This spring/summer session will provide established entrepreneurs with the invaluable experiences and connections to take their business to the next level,” said Karen Christilles, the program’s director. According to Christilles, the program expects to enroll about a dozen business owners in the session. It’s expected to kick off June 14 and last through late August, with participants meeting from 5:30 to 8:30 p.m. every other Monday. The cost of the program is $600 and can be spread out over multiple payments. Some scholarships are available, according to the program’s webpage. Topeka last held a Wheelhouse Incubator session in person in 2019 – the same year the program was introduced to the community through 712 Innovations.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: U of L Health announced Wednesday that it will require COVID-19 vaccines for all its workers by Sept.1, becoming the first major health care system in the state to declare it will make the shots mandatory. “We believe it’s time to step up and actually require the vaccine among all of our health care workers,” Tom Miller, CEO of U of L Health, said at a news briefing. Three U of L doctors and two nurses were the first in Kentucky to receive the vaccine when it arrived in December, and health officials said they have worked to make it accessible to employees as well as people throughout the community. LaShawn Scott was among the first five U of L Health workers to get the COVID-19 vaccine. “As a nurse, I think it’s important that we keep ourselves safe as we care for these patients and minimize the risk of transmission to our co-workers and our community,” she said at Wednesday’s briefing. Miller said he sees little difference in requiring a COVID-19 vaccine and an annual flu shot already required for U of L health workers. He said workers without a religious or medical exemption who refuse the vaccine would be subject to disciplinary action but didn’t specify the nature of any such action. U of L estimates more than 70% of its 12,000 workers have already been inoculated.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: All-night alcohol sales are coming back, and a ban on parades is being lifted, as vaccination rates improve and as hospitalizations from COVID-19 stay low, the city announced Wednesday. Current rules require that alcoholic beverage sales end at 1 a.m. That changes under rules that take effect Friday, the city said in a news release. The latest changes mean more money-making opportunities for the tourist-dependent city that saw hotels, restaurants and bars hit hard during the pandemic. The city announced it will begin taking permit applications for large parades and smaller “second line” processions under the new rules. Parades are a vital part of many New Orleans celebrations, most notably during Mardi Gras season. Second lines, smaller processions so named because watchers often join the procession to form a second line behind the band, take place year-round – a familiar scene after weddings, funerals or other events. The city is also allowing gyms to operate at full capacity and removing 6-foot table spacing requirements at restaurants. There remain some restrictions on the number of people allowed at large gatherings. But exceptions are to be made for events where masks are required or where participants provide proof of vaccinations.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Officials are not planning to develop a statewide vaccine passport system for recipients of COVID-19 shots. Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew said such a system would be a challenge because of questions such as how it would work across state lines and how the state would protect residents’ privacy. She said Wednesday that Maine isn’t looking to create one. The state supports private businesses that want to request COVID-19 vaccine verification, Lambrew said. She said businesses should make sure any verification systems they use are in line with state laws. “At this time there are no state of Maine policies that would have one set of rules for people who are vaccinated and another for those who are not,” Lambrew said. Residents who travel this summer are encouraged to bring their immunization record card if they need it, as well as a mask, Lambrew said.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: Baltimore City Schools won’t require tens of thousands of students failing classes this year amid challenges posed by the pandemic to repeat a grade in the fall. Instead, Chief Academic Officer Joan Dabrowski said, schools will give students additional time and customized instruction plans to make up gaps. News outlets report the decision was announced at a school board meeting Tuesday night and in emails to parents and teachers. No school board vote is required. About 65% of secondary students and 50% of elementary students in the system are failing at least one class, according to the school system. Testing will determine what students have missed, and a catch-up plan will be developed. The grading system is also being changed. Elementary students with an “unsatisfactory” grade in a course and middle school students with a failing grade will get a “not completed.” High school students with a failing grade will get a “no credit.” Dabrowksi told the school board that officials want to signal “a hopeful space for our young people and our commitment as educators to wrap around them when we bring them back.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A memorial flag garden on the Boston Common that honors every service member from Massachusetts who has died in war is back in its full glory this year. Fully vaccinated health care workers, military members and other volunteers gathered on the Common on Wednesday to plant 37,000 small U.S. flags, each one representing a fallen service member dating to the Revolutionary War. Last year the flag garden was set up on a limited basis, with about 1,000 flags placed 6 feet apart because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The flag garden, now in its 12th year, is organized by the Massachusetts Military Heroes Fund and Home Base, a partnership of the Red Sox Foundation and Massachusetts General Hospital that supports veterans. Meanwhile, the state’s casinos and slots parlors will be able to welcome gamblers under nearly pre-pandemic conditions beginning this weekend. The Massachusetts Gaming Commission voted unanimously Wednesday to end its COVID-19 restrictions. That means beginning Saturday, every slot machine and gaming table will be allowed to reopen. Visitors who have been fully vaccinated won’t have to wear a mask. The move comes as Gov. Charlie Baker has ordered all remaining COVID-19 restrictions to be lifted Saturday. The state’s face covering order will also be rescinded for most settings.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s reelection campaign – not a nonprofit fund – will pay for her flights to and from Florida, where she visited her ailing father in March. The disclosure Thursday came in a letter to a Republican lawmaker who had asked questions about the pandemic trip. A lawyer for the governor’s campaign and the fund said he learned from Detroit-based PVS Chemicals, which supplied the private jet, that it could not accept the $27,521 payment except from a candidate committee because it is not authorized to operate charter flights. In a letter to House Oversight Committee Chairman Steve Johnson, Christopher Trebilcock said PVS and the fund, Michigan Transition 2019, learned of a “miscommunication” between themselves over the source of payment due to media reports. He said Whitmer flew private, instead of commercial, for security reasons – citing death threats and noting an alleged plot to kidnap her over her COVID-19 restrictions. Her state security detail accompanied her. Their expenses will be covered by the campaign, lessening the burden on taxpayers, he said. “But for her elected office, the governor would not have incurred the security expenses for travel to see her ailing father on short notice,” Trebilcock said.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Gov. Tim Walz hopes giveaways including Minnesota State Fair tickets, fishing licenses and state park passes will help pick up the pace of COVID-19 vaccinations, which has slowed. The Democratic governor on Thursday announced that 100,000 people who are vaccinated between Memorial Day weekend and the end of June will be eligible to choose among nine vaccine reward options. The incentives also include college baseball tickets, amusement park passes and a $25 Visa card, among other options. Walz called the incentive program a “wonderful opportunity” to vaccinate more residents while coronavirus case numbers remain low and as more people head outdoors this summer. “All of those things are the perfect timing to get the last bunch of folks to get in and get vaccinated,” Walz said during a news conference Thursday. “Take advantage of the incentives that we’re offering, and get out and explore Minnesota. You, your family and your community will be safe, and you’ll get to see the great things that we have.” COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations have declined in recent weeks after a bump in cases last month driven by virus variants. State health officials reported zero deaths earlier this week for the third time this month, and daily deaths haven’t totaled more than 22 in months.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state’s second-largest school district is planning on 100% in-person learning during the coming academic year, after having classes online for more than half of the current school year because of the coronavirus pandemic. Jackson Public Schools Superintendent Errick Greene said some students had a harder time learning from home. “Our early learners require more individualized instruction that’s just really difficult to provide virtually,” Greene told WJTV. “Some of our scholars faced serious behavioral, social and emotional challenges due to the long periods of isolation.” To enter any building, people will still have their temperatures taken, and they must wear masks. Sports are expected to pick back up, but the Jackson schools will require each person at indoor events to wear a mask. “I want to see all sports come back,” said Cameron Frank, an upcoming junior at Forest Hill High School. “Football, basketball, everything else for that matter.” Isolation rooms will be set up for any students who arrive with COVID-19 symptoms or get sick during the day. The district has enough laptops to give one to each student if they catch the disease. Classrooms and school buses will also go through deep cleanings daily.\n\nMissouri\n\nSpringfield: The city announced Thursday that Mayor Ken McClure intended to withdraw the civil emergency declaration undergirding Springfield’s COVID-19 health regulations, such as occupancy restrictions and a public masking mandate. The city said in a news release that the withdrawal would be effective at 11:59 p.m. Thursday, just ahead of the 12:01 a.m. Friday effective date for the repeal of the ordinance containing the city’s coronavirus regulations. Missouri’s other larger communities, including Kansas City, Columbia and St. Louis, already dropped their mask mandates when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued more lenient guidance on masking for vaccinated people earlier this month. “I am very proud of our community and grateful that there no longer appears to exist a state of civil emergency,” McClure said in a statement. “We would not be at this point had it not been for our community’s brave, innovative and critical work in the battle against COVID-19. It has not been easy. Thank you.”\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: A local massage therapist recently expanded her business, a move that has freed her up to do something she’s always wanted to do: give back. Olga Hall said she’ll begin scheduling free sessions. And because it’s been a rough pandemic, she’s starting with medical professionals. Once summer hits, she’d like to schedule some teachers, followed by law enforcement, firefighters and child care workers. Hall said her philosophy is that people should not be preoccupied by their pain. So far, Hall has brought on two therapists to Massage Therapy Studios. She’s starting her free massages slowly to avoid overloading them and herself. At first, Hall will have four 30-minute slots. Clients can sign themselves up or nominate someone else starting May 31. At the end of the week, Hall will choose four names and reach out to make appointments for the week of June 14. Sign-ups are online only at massagetherapystudios.com. The site will go live May 31. Those who are chosen can up their session to an hour for an extra $25, and there will be a waiting list in case of cancellations. Four people a month doesn’t seem like much, but Hall said she would like to increase that number once she knows what her staff can handle.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: The state is reporting its lowest level of new coronavirus cases since last April, shortly after the pandemic began. State health officials said 521 virus cases were reported over the past week, which was down from the previous week’s 533 cases. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases also decreased over the past two weeks from 195.43 per day May 11 to 74.43 per day Tuesday. The state said there have now been 223,243 cases and 2,249 deaths linked to the virus in Nebraska since the pandemic began. Over the past week, five new deaths were reported. The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in Nebraska also remains low at 73. Across Nebraska, 807,878 people, or roughly 42% of the state’s population, have been vaccinated against the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: For the second month in a row, the state’s casinos reported $1 billion in house winnings in April, showing signs that tourism business is returning faster to pre-pandemic levels than some experts expected. The state Gaming Control Board said Thursday that last month’s overall “casino win” of nearly $1.04 billion was up a robust 11% compared with $936 million in April 2019. A comparison with a year ago wasn’t relevant because casinos statewide were closed from mid-March to early June 2020 to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Before those closures, casinos had taken in more than $1 billion for three consecutive months. They reached the $1 billion mark again this March. Michael Lawton, senior analyst for the regulatory board, said winnings ticked up slightly in April at properties in the key Las Vegas Strip resort corridor, while casinos in downtown Las Vegas and the remainder of Clark County tallied all-time record winnings for consecutive months. The Reno area recorded its highest casino winnings total since July 2008, and sports bet winnings statewide also set records in April, Lawton said. The state collected more than $79 million in revenue based on the April numbers, up from about $19,000 in April 2020.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: All state-managed COVID-19 vaccination sites will be closing at the end of June, officials said Thursday. The sites will be closed Monday for Memorial Day. They will reopen Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and operate Mondays through Saturdays, only providing second-dose vaccinations, health officials said in a news release Thursday. Those sites will close June 30. “There are more than 350 locations across the state offering first-dose appointments and many locations offer walk-in service without the need for an appointment,” the news release said. Meanwhile, Nashua officials have approved ending the city’s mask ordinance. The Board of Aldermen opted to end the ordinance Tuesday, and it awaited a signature from Mayor Jim Donchess, The Telegraph of Nashua reports. Local businesses could still require workers and patrons to wear masks. The city’s Board of Health voted to recommend that the city lift its mask mandate. The city has had an ordinance in place since May 2020.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Mask mandates may be waived at high schools sooner than elementary and middle schools in the fall because teens have a head start over younger kids on getting vaccinated against COVID-19, Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday. A day after he said all students will likely be required to wear a mask come September, Murphy suggested Wednesday that mask rules for schools and even summer camps are more fluid as coronavirus numbers continue to drop, and federal guidance may change. “If the science suggested it, you can turn your mask guidance on a dime because it’s easy,” Murphy said at a briefing. “You just don’t wear this the next day. So stay tuned.” The remarks came with New Jersey on the cusp of lifting its indoor mask mandate Friday. One major exception is anywhere unvaccinated children congregate in large groups, such as schools, day care centers and camps. Because those 12 and older are eligible to be vaccinated, it would make sense to allow high school students to go maskless in the fall when full in-class instruction resumes, Murphy said. About 202,000 children ages 12 to 17 had been vaccinated in New Jersey as of Wednesday, according to state Health Department data.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nLas Cruces: The Roman Catholic Diocese of Las Cruces has announced its intent to resume regular Mass, including Sunday Eucharist, and reinstate the church’s general obligation to attend Sunday and Holy Days Mass. Services have been disrupted since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. A dispensation from the obligation to attend Sunday Mass has been in place since public health orders and capacity restrictions drove parishioners to celebrate Mass online and in church parking lots. A revised public health order issued by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham in April allowed houses of worship to welcome congregations back at 100% capacity. The move followed U.S. Supreme Court decisions that enjoin states from enforcing capacity limits on churches that are more restrictive than other entities like factories and schools, the governor’s office said at the time. In a memo issued Tuesday, Bishop Peter Baldacchino said the obligation to attend Sunday and Holy Days Mass will take effect Sunday, June 6. However, exceptions to the obligation remain in place for anyone who is sick or symptomatic or has recently been exposed to the coronavirus and for anyone with significant health risk factors or those caring for someone with such risk factors.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday that the state Department of Labor will provide guidance to businesses that taking time off due to side effects from a COVID-19 vaccine shot will be covered under New York’s paid sick leave law. Cuomo said studies have shown some people have been leery of getting a shot because it could require them to take time off from work to recuperate. A recent survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation among unvaccinated Americans showed 48% are concerned they “might need to miss work if the side effects of the vaccine make them feel sick for a day or more.” But he said the state will make sure that any sick time due to recovery from any vaccine will be paid time off. A news release from Cuomo’s office said workers could take “any necessary recovery period” to get back on their feet after their vaccines. During a news conference at Grand Central Terminal, he also noted that New York already has a regulation on the books, enacted as part of this year’s state budget, that requires employers to give workers four hours of time off to get a vaccine shot, one for each dose if needed. “I don’t want to suggest that there are side effects,” Cuomo said of the vaccine. “If that’s an issue for you, that issue is resolved. You won’t miss a day’s pay because of getting a vaccine.”\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: The state House unanimously approved legislation Wednesday that aims to spend $750 million in federal coronavirus relief funds to install high-speed internet in rural and remote areas lacking it. The legislation would set aside $350 million in discretionary American Rescue Plan funds earmarked for North Carolina to expand a relatively new state broadband installation matching-funds program with internet providers and electric cooperatives. The bill also expresses the intent to use $400 million in the funds from Congress on a new program that gives counties the ability to put out bids for broadband expansion in underserved areas. Federal aid going to counties also would pay for those projects. The measure, which now goes to the Senate, meets goals of Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper in his proposal last week to spend $1.2 billion of money from the latest pandemic aid package on improving internet access. But his plan spends half of that money on things like subsidizing service costs, purchasing computer equipment for households lacking it and offering “digital literacy” training. Some Democrats said during floor debate that they wished Wednesday’s bill contained the service subsidies. Still, the legislation passed 109-0.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Corrections officials will ease some coronavirus visitation restrictions in state prisons next week. In-person prison visits had been limited to one adult since they resumed in late March. Beginning Tuesday, visitors will be allowed to bring up to three minors per visit. Visitors must test negative for the virus, and advance scheduling is still required. Visitors 6 years and older must still wear a mask, but it doesn’t have to be an N95 mask, as is required now. The changes come as the number of active coronavirus cases is decreasing in the state along with a slight increase in COVID-19 vaccinations, the Bismarck Tribune reports. The state Health Department confirmed 79 new cases from 2,043 tests completed Monday. No new deaths were reported Tuesday, for a fifth straight day. Forty-two virus patients remained hospitalized, up one from Monday. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s tracking site shows North Dakota’s rate of total vaccine doses administered, at 79,438 people per 100,000 population, ranks 33rd in the nation among states and the District of Columbia. North Dakota had earlier been one of the top states. But the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has reported that the state has some of the highest rates of vaccine hesitancy in the nation.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: After more than 10 months, the state will no longer produce a weekly county map to show how the coronavirus is spreading in all 88 counties. The map was intended as a warning system for communities and has served its purpose, Ohio Department of Health Director Stephanie McCloud said. “We’re in a very different point in this pandemic, and the need for this kind of urgency has passed,” McCloud told reporters Thursday afternoon. The Ohio Public Health Advisory System was rolled out in early July by Gov. Mike DeWine as a tool to help Ohioans make decisions about events and activities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The map shaded each county based on seven metrics, including the number of new cases per 100,000 residents and an increase in hospital admissions for COVID-19 symptoms. The lowest level, yellow, meant “active exposure and spread” of the virus. The highest level, purple, indicated “severe exposure and spread.” Each color came with suggestions such as to “limit activities as much as possible.” But there were no state policies or mandates tied to a color. Some school districts, businesses and other organizations used the map to determine when to allow in-person contact. The map lost some of its usefulness as infections surged in November and December.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Fifty-two people got COVID-19 shots Wednesday outside a Feria Latina Supermarket – a location selected by the Oklahoma City-County Health Department for a pop-up clinic by monitoring several data trends. The store’s ZIP code lagged others in vaccination rates, and sewage surveillance showed the coronavirus was present at higher levels in the area compared with other parts of the county. Coupled with lower vaccine uptake among Hispanic residents, those reasons led health officials to land on the grocery store for a pop-up site. As of Tuesday, about 19% of Hispanic residents in Oklahoma County were fully vaccinated, and 24% had received a first dose. The Oklahoma City-County Health Department has taken COVID-19 vaccines on the road in an effort to bring the shots to those who might not otherwise seek one out or be able to get to a vaccine clinic. At the site Wednesday, some people going to pick up groceries took a detour to get their vaccines on their way in or out, said health department spokeswoman Molly Fleming. They had their pick of whichever shot they’d like: Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson. The Feria Latina site saw a steady pace of vaccine-takers and was one of the department’s most successful pop-up clinics so far, Fleming said.\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The Oregon Employment Department says in July it will start upgrading the obsolete computer system that pays jobless benefits. That would end a 12-year delay that caused a catastrophic breakdown in distributing aid during the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The state’s new system won’t be in place until 2024. Oregon was among the slowest states in the nation at paying jobless benefits amid the pandemic, with laid-off workers frequently waiting weeks or months for aid. The employment department was hindered by a rigid computer system from the 1990s, which was unable to adapt to supplemental benefits Congress added last year. The huge volume of claims – Oregon has paid out more than $9 billion during the pandemic – meant months of delays. The state received $86 million in federal aid to upgrade its technology in 2009, but administrative failures in the employment department stopped the work from happening. The state still has almost all the money the federal government allocated for the upgrade. Past estimates have put the total cost for the project between $80 million and $123 million.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: The state is lifting its mask mandate no later than June 28. The Department of Health announced Thursday that it will no longer require unvaccinated people to wear masks in public June 28 or once 70% of adults are fully vaccinated, whichever comes first. People are considered fully vaccinated once they are two weeks beyond their last required dose of COVID-19 vaccine. According to federal data, 70% of Pennsylvania residents 18 and over have already received at least one dose, with just over half the adult population fully inoculated. “What all of this means is that Pennsylvanians are realizing that they have the power to stop COVID-19 and that they are stepping up to get vaccinated. It also means that we are on track to get to 70% of all adults with second doses by the end of June,” Acting Health Secretary Alison Beam said at a news conference Thursday. Businesses, schools and municipalities may still require people to wear masks, the Health Department said. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also requires them on planes, trains, buses and public transportation hubs. With the pandemic in retreat, the state previously announced plans to lift nearly all mitigation orders on Memorial Day. New infections continue to fall rapidly.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEast Providence: The city has planted a living memorial to the almost 200 residents who have died after contracting the coronavirus. A tree and accompanying plaque were dedicated Monday outside city hall, WPRI-TV reports. “This tree will remain here for generations to come as a reminder of loved ones that are no longer with us,” Mayor Bob DaSilva said. The tree will be decorated during the holidays every year in their honor, he said. The plaque reads: “In memory of East Providence residents whose lives were lost due to the COVID-19 pandemic. May they rest in eternal peace.” The Rhode Island Department of Health on Thursday reported nearly 80 new confirmed cases but no virus-related deaths. The new cases were out of slightly more than 8,000 test results returned the prior day, for a positivity rate of less than 1%. The number of people in the hospital with COVID-19 dropped to 65, according to the latest data, down from 70 the previous day. The number of people fully vaccinated against the disease in the state has now topped 544,000. The seven-day rolling average of daily new cases in Rhode Island has dropped over the past two weeks, from about 151 on May 11 to about 120 on Tuesday, according to Johns Hopkins.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Health officials are working to roll out pop-up vaccination clinics at beaches and festivals this summer, said Dr. Brannon Traxler, the state’s director of public health. One program would bring vaccine clinics to state parks, where people would get a free shot and park admission for the day, she said. Another plan is to partner with breweries to offer free beer for people who get a shot, Traxler said. The incentive effort is based on the success of similar programs in other states that have reached young people, one demographic that is lagging on inoculations. While there has been significant progress, COVID-19 remains a threat to people who have not been vaccinated, Traxler said. Indoor events including churches and movie theaters with lots of people are among the riskiest activities for those who have not been vaccinated while being safe for those who have, she said. For parents of children under 12, who are not eligible for the vaccination, going to places like that poses individual risks that are best assessed by each family, Traxler said. South Carolina has one of the lower vaccination rates in the nation. Only eight states, primarily in the Southeast, have lower rates. The nation recently passed 50% of adults having at least one COVID-19 shot. South Carolina’s rate is 44%.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: Following suit with public schools and universities, officials with the city’s private schools and universities also don’t plan on mandating COVID-19 vaccines for students and staff when they return to classrooms this fall. Augustana University won’t require vaccinations for staff or students, said Suzie O’Meara Hernes, COVID-19 response coordinator for the school. The vaccine is a personal choice, Hernes said. However, in some cases, students will be required to get COVID-19 shots, such as a nursing student who is required by the hospital system for which they work in their clinical placement. Of the Augie community, staff and students, 64% have reported they’re fully vaccinated, Hernes said. Vaccine reporting is voluntary and relies on the individual to report, she noted, adding she believes the percentage is higher than reported. At the University of Sioux Falls, the university doesn’t require vaccines and won’t plan to this fall. USF was “blessed” to remain open for the duration of the 2020-21 academic year and is working toward a full “return to normal” for this fall, said Amy Johnson, USF COVID-19 response team leader. At the K-12 level, officials with Sioux Falls Christian Schools and Bishop O’Gorman Catholic Schools both say they’re not planning to require COVID-19 shots either.\n\nTennessee\n\nMaryville: A woman accused of driving through a COVID-19 vaccine distribution tent as a form of protest has been charged with seven counts of felony reckless endangerment, according to a police report. Virginia Christine Lewis Brown, 36, was arrested after a Blount County deputy witnessed her driving through the tent at a vaccine event Monday at Foothills Mall in Maryville, according to news outlets, which cited an incident report. The report said more than a dozen health department and National Guard personnel were inside the tent. “I had several victims tell me she almost hit them as she fled through the tent at high speeds,” the deputy wrote in the report. “I was advised that they were within inches and feet of the vehicle as it came through the tent. Several victims stated that they thought the driver was going to kill them.” After the deputy stopped Brown, she told him she drove through the site to protest the vaccine and was only traveling 5 miles per hour, the report said. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Brown had an attorney.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Several nursing students are objecting to a policy at Driscoll Children’s Hospital requiring them to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to complete their clinical rotations. Severe reactions to COVID-19 vaccines have been rare; clinical trials have yielded efficacy results beyond what some medical professionals expected; and the mRNA technology used to make the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines has been decades in the making. Yet misinformation and distrust continue to surround the new vaccines, even within the health care field. Most of the students objecting to the requirement said they’re averse to getting a COVID-19 shot because the vaccines so far do not have full approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The vaccines have emergency use authorization from the FDA. One student said she contracted COVID-19 and tested positive for antibodies, suggesting that meant she didn’t need the vaccine. Experts have recommended that people who recovered from COVID-19 be vaccinated because it’s unclear how long immunity from a previous infection lasts. The students also say vaccine requirements run afoul of an order by Gov. Greg Abbott banning entities that receive public funds from requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination under an emergency use authorization.\n\nUtah\n\nSt. George: As the nation inches toward its vaccination goals, “COVID cabin fever” is beginning to lift. But for tourist-based communities like southern Utah, which before the pandemic was expecting its busiest season yet, “post-COVID is a whole world that is just as mysterious as early COVID was,” Washington County Commissioner Gil Almquist said. The effects of overtourism have also returned. Park officials have reported unprecedented levels of vandalism and human waste in Arches and Zion National Parks. Scenes showing long lines of idling traffic clogging up roadways have become commonplace. Officials and advocates statewide have long seen overtourism as a real threat, but the bustling summer crowds brought on by the pandemic have sent them scrambling to figure out ways to manage it while still supporting the locals who depend on tourism dollars. Of the five Utah national parks, Bryce Canyon, Capitol Reef and Arches National Parks all had their highest-ever visitation levels in 2018. Canyonlands National Park made its record in 2016, and Zion National Park, the third most visited park in the country, hit a peak of 4.5 million visitors in 2017. Utah Office of Tourism Director Vicki Varella said travel this summer will mimic trends seen before the pandemic.\n\nVermont\n\nWaterbury: All of Vermont’s state parks will be open for Memorial Day weekend. Some opened in the beginning of May, but by Friday, all 55 will be open, WCAX-TV reports. Following a surge in visitors last year amid the coronavirus pandemic, park officials expect to have one of the busiest seasons ever, said state parks director Nate McKeen. “People understand being outside is one of the safest places to be, and it’s the best place possible for your mental and physical health, and then they get out and see our state parks,” he said. While many campsites are full, and others are going quickly, visiting a state park for the day is also an option, said Vermont Forestry Commissioner Michael Snyder. Day visits make up half of the usage of Vermont State Parks. “We kind of like to think of our parks as everyone’s lake house, remote camp. You don’t have the property taxes, you don’t have to maintain them, you pay a small fee, and you are good to go,” McKeen said.\n\nVirginia\n\nPetersburg: The city reported the highest unemployment rate in the state, according to a new equity dashboard from Virginia’s Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Petersburg’s 14.9% jobless rate in January 2021 was nearly three times the average across Virginia. And it was 4 percentage points higher than second-worst Emporia’s 10.9%. “If you are unemployed, and you don’t have financial resources, then it makes all of those social determinants of health that much more complicated,” said Janice Underwood, chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer for the commonwealth. Unemployment skyrocketed at the start of the pandemic as millions of workers were laid off or furloughed as a result of state-mandated closures. Virginia’s highest statewide unemployment rate in the past 14 months was 11% in April 2020. Fortunately, the state has been in decline, ranking at a rate of 5.7% in January. Following the declaration of racism as a public health crisis, the state embarked on creating two dashboards to provide information in hopes of addressing the various health disparities. The Equity-in-Action dashboard reflects the progress the state has made in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, whereas the Equity-at-a-Glance dashboard focuses on various social disparities, like food distribution and Medicaid.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: The city is shutting down all but one of its mass COVID-19 vaccination sites next month because authorities say more than 76% of Seattle residents eligible have received at least one shot, and 60% are fully vaccinated. Authorities announced Wednesday that the city-run sites at Lumen Field, Rainier Beach, West Seattle and North Seattle College will close in June. The Seattle Times reports the Seattle Fire Department will continue operating its testing and vaccination site in the SODO neighborhood south of downtown through the summer. “Now that the vast majority of Seattleites have begun the vaccination process, we are able to safely reopen and recover as a city – without the need for our fixed sites,” Mayor Jenny Durkan said in a statement. The city’s vaccination efforts got a boost when the Lumen Field Event Center opened more than two months ago. Since March 13, more than 97,000 vaccinations have been administered at the event center near two of the city’s large sports arenas. The city says it will continue to offer mobile vaccinations and spin up vaccination clinics as needed. Seattle is outpacing the state with COVID-19 vaccinations. The state Department of Health’s data dashboard shows nearly 61% of residents 16 and older have gotten at least one shot, and more than 40% are fully vaccinated.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state’s Vital Registration Office has reopened after being closed for more than a year because of the pandemic. Walk-up services now available to the public include certified copies of birth, death and marriage certificates, the West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources said. The office, located in the Diamond building, is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. People who are not vaccinated against COVID-19 are required to wear masks. Certificates are $12 each. Exact change is required if paying in cash, or customers may use a money order or check. Credit and debit cards are not accepted. The Vital Registration Office and Diamond building lobby closed to the public March 20, 2020, as the coronavirus began to spread widely in the United States.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The number of COVID-19 deaths in the state has now surpassed 7,000, but data that shows the number of coronavirus cases declining and more people being vaccinated offer some hope after more than a year of the pandemic. The state Department of Health on Wednesday reported five new deaths and 330 new cases of COVID-19, which has claimed the lives of 7,003 people in Wisconsin. The average number of daily new cases over the past seven days is 307. A week ago the average was 394 daily cases. As coronavirus cases in Wisconsin continue to decline, more residents are being vaccinated against COVID-19. A total of 5,087,871 doses of vaccine have been administered in the state as of Wednesday, with nearly 79% of Wisconsinites ages 65 and older having been fully vaccinated. About 16% of the state’s 12- to 15-year-olds have received their first doses of vaccine, according to health officials. That age group became eligible May 13.\n\nWyoming\n\nLaramie: The University of Wyoming has announced plans to return to full capacity for home football games inside War Memorial Stadium this fall. University of Wyoming Athletic Director Tom Burman told the Casper Star-Tribune that fans, including students, won’t be required to be vaccinated in order to attend games. “It puts a smile on my face. It’s not just about money. It’s about the experience,” Burman said. “I watched the PGA Championship the other day, and I watched people following Phil (Mickelson), and I thought, ‘That’s what it’s all about.’ If we don’t return to that, I worry about the future of our sports. It’s not as appealing when there aren’t fans there.” Last season was shortened because of the coronavirus pandemic, and home attendance was initially capped at 7,000, then further reduced to 5,000, or 17% of the 29,181-seat stadium’s capacity. University officials worked with the state Department of Health to determine attendance figures based on the virus’s local impact at that time. The attendance plan for the fall could change depending on the data between now and the start of the upcoming season in September, Burman said, adding that he does not expect that to be the case.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2021/05/28"}]}

However the center the majority of these reports are misidentifications of explainable phenomenon like planets, aircraft, drones and satellites.\n\n\"On the other hand, there are many, many cases that cannot be explained as something natural or man made,\" Stepien wrote in a statement to USA TODAY. \"The evidence of the last 70 years is incontrovertible in indicating that anomalous craft are flying at will throughout our airspace. Common sense dictates that this should be of extreme interest to the government and the public.\"\n\nWhat states have the most UFO sightings?\n\nThe center tracks data of sightings from all US states. California leads with the most sightings with a total of 16,084. These are the 10 states with the most UAP sightings according to the center (and 2022 state population rank):\n\nCalifornia -16,084 (1st)\n\nFlorida - 8,205 (3rd)\n\nWashington - 7,145 (13th)\n\nTexas - 6,107 (2nd)\n\nNew York - 5,834 (4th)\n\nPennsylvania - 4,984 (5th)\n\nArizona - 4,909 (14th)\n\nOhio - 4,412 (7th)\n\nIllinois - 4,247 (6th)\n\nNorth Carolina - 3,630 (9th)\n\nNASA team calls for more research on UFO sightings\n\nLast month, NASA's Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena Independent Study Team called for deeper data analysis on research on these sightings. The investigative group said that even though most sightings are identified as planes, balloons, drones and weather events, more sophisticated scientific research is needed to fully understand them.\n\n\"The independent study team did not find any evidence that UAP have an extraterrestrial origin,\" NASA Administrator Bill Nelson shared. \"But we don't know what these UAP are.\"\n\nA team published a 36-page report on Sept. 14 showing that the most common form of UAPs reported are orbs or spheres.\n\nOn July 26, Congress held a hearing where three former military members, who have spoken about their firsthand knowledge of reported UAP encounters, discussed the security threats the phenomena could pose. The executive branch of government and the military continues to face bipartisan pressure to be more transparent about information relating to UAPs.\n\nStepien said government agencies are aware of the extreme interest in these anomalous craft but have chosen to \"keep the details hidden from the public.\"\n\n\"The recent disclosure hearings in congress have generated a lot of hope within the UFO community that some of this secrecy may finally be breaking down, but whether any serious disclosure will happen remains to be seen,\" Stepien said.\n\nContributing: George Petras, Janet Loehrke and Eric Lagatta\n\nUFO report comes back empty:but if you see any UAP floating around, give NASA a call", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2023/10/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2021/10/04/fireball-over-colorado-meteor-sighting-lights-up-early-morning-sky/5992304001/", "title": "Colorado fireball causes stir as rare sighting lights up morning sky", "text": "Shots of fireball took on a different meaning early Sunday morning in Colorado.\n\nA fireball lit up the sky for several seconds around 4:30 a.m. and was captured by home security cameras from Colorado Springs to Wellington in Colorado and from New Mexico and Wyoming, resulting in 50 reports by Monday to the American Meteor Society.\n\nA fireball is a very bright meteor. In this case, it appears to have been 100 times brighter than a full moon and lasted 3.5 seconds, according to Chris Peterson, who operates the Cloudbait Observatory near Guffey in a remote area of central Colorado.\n\nSeveral thousand meteors of fireball magnitude occur in the Earth's atmosphere daily, according to the American Meteor Society, but the vast majority occur over oceans and uninhabited areas, are masked by daylight or occur at night when few people are out to notice.\n\n\"What’s rare is you being in the right place and right time to see it,'' said Mike Hankey, operations manager at the American Meteor Society, whose interest in the objects started when one shook his house in 2009. \"It's a rare split second that they happen and you have to be in the geographic area, so they might see them four or five times a year if everything comes together.''\n\nStrange tales:Mysterious emu spotted on Fort Collins trail, survives collision with truck\n\nSecurity cameras in Fort Collins, Loveland and Wellington recorded the event, with many videos posted on social media.\n\n\"We have had cameras up for 20 years and when these things happen every few years, they get a lot more attention in Colorado than elsewhere,'' said Peterson, who has observation cameras set up in various areas of the state. \"I think it's because we are more outdoorsy and and are more likely to be outdoors and more in tune with things like this than other areas.''\n\nHankey said the brighter the fireball the more rare the event.\n\nA meteor is considered a fireball when it reaches the brightness of the planet Venus in the morning or evening sky, the American Meteor Society stated on its website.\n\nPeterson said on his site that Sunday's fireball was a superbolide reaching magnitude 100 times brighter than a full moon. He said fireballs this bright are rare, occurring over a region only once every few years.\n\nHankey said the vast majority of fireballs disintegrate before they reach the Earth. However, he said several have been large enough to cause damage.\n\nThe most recent was in 2013 when an estimated 65-foot fireball exploded above Chelyabinsk, Russia. The explosion when it entered Earth's atmosphere had the energy 20 to 30 times more powerful than the Hiroshima atomic bomb, resulting in broken windows and damage to thousands of buildings.\n\nThe Colorado fireball produced a handful of reports of a sonic boom sound.

An interstellar meteor is a space rock that originates from outside our solar system – a rare occurrence.\n\nThis one is known as CNEOS 2014-01-08, and it crash-landed along the northeast coast of Papua New Guinea on January 8, 2014.\n\nThe finding came as a surprise to Amir Siraj, who identified the object as an interstellar meteor in a 2019 study he coauthored while an undergraduate at Harvard University.\n\nSiraj was investigating ʻOumuamua, the first known interstellar object in our solar system that was found in 2017, with Abraham Loeb, professor of science at Harvard University.\n\nSiraj decided to go through NASA’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies database to find other interstellar objects and found what he believed to be an interstellar meteor within days.\n\nA need for speed\n\nThe meteor’s high velocity is what initially caught Siraj’s eye.\n\nThe meteor was moving at a high speed of about 28 miles per second (45 kilometers per second) relative to Earth, which is moving at around 18.6 miles per second (30 kilometers per second) around the sun. Because researchers measured how fast the meteor was moving while on a moving planet, the 45 kilometers per second was not actually how fast it was going.\n\nThe heliocentric speed is defined as the meteor’s speed relative to the sun, which is a more accurate way to determine an object’s orbit. It’s calculated based on the angle at which a meteor hits the Earth. The planet moves in one direction around the sun, so the meteor could have hit Earth head-on, meaning opposite the direction the planet is moving, or from behind, in the same direction the Earth is moving.\n\nSince the meteor hit the Earth from behind, Siraj’s calculations said the meteor was actually traveling at about 37.3 miles per second (60 kilometers per second) relative to the sun.\n\nHe then mapped out the trajectory of the meteor and found it was in an unbound orbit, unlike the closed orbit of other meteors. This means that rather than circling around the sun like other meteors, it came from outside the solar system.\n\n“Presumably, it was produced by another star, got kicked out of that star’s planetary system and just so happened to make its way to our solar system and collide with Earth,” Siraj said.\n\nDifficulty getting published\n\nLoeb and Siraj have been unable to get their findings published in a journal because their data came from NASA’s CNEOS database, which doesn’t divulge information such as how accurate the readings are.\n\nAfter years of trying to obtain the additional information needed, they received official confirmation that it was, in fact, an interstellar meteor, from John Shaw, deputy commander of the US Space Command. The command is a part of the US Department of Defense and is responsible for military operations in outer space.\n\n“Dr. Joel Mozer, the Chief Scientist of Space Operations Command, the United States Space Force service component of U.S. Space Command, reviewed analysis of additional data available to the Department of Defense related to this finding. Dr. Mozer confirmed that the velocity estimate reported to NASA is sufficiently accurate to indicate an interstellar trajectory,” wrote Shaw in the letter.\n\nSiraj had moved onto other research and almost forgotten about his discovery, so the document came as a shock.\n\n“I thought that we would never learn the true nature of this meteor, that it was just blocked somewhere in the government after our many tries, and so actually seeing that letter from the Department of Defense with my eyes was a really incredible moment,” Siraj said.\n\nA second chance\n\nSince receiving the confirmation, Siraj said his team is working to resubmit their findings for publication in a scientific journal.\n\nSiraj would also like to put a team together to try and retrieve part of the meteor that landed in the Pacific Ocean but admitted it would be an unlikely possibility due to the sheer size of the project.\n\nIf researchers were able to get their hands on the “holy grail of interstellar objects,” Siraj said it would be scientifically groundbreaking in helping scientists discover more about the world beyond our solar system.\n\nNASA and US Space Command did not initially respond for comment.", "authors": ["Megan Marples"], "publish_date": "2022/04/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/04/18/doordash-driver-dashcam-video-meteor/11686663002/", "title": "Doordash driver's dashcam video shows meteor seen from Florida", "text": "PORT ST.

Every day, there are several thousand meteors of \"fireball\" magnitude, which is about as bright as the planet Venus in the morning or evening sky, according to the American Meteor Society.\n\nHowever, seeing them is uncommon because:\n\nThey often occur over the ocean or uninhabited regions\n\nThey can be masked by sunlight during the day\n\nFewer people are outside to see them during the night.\n\n\"It was just perfect.

He’s seen them and even has a website that documents UFO sightings, with data broken down by each state, he said.\n\nDelaware has 294 reports of UFO sightings, compared with 1,300 for neighboring Maryland, according to the National UFO Reporting Center, a nonprofit based in Washington state.\n\nTalk of UFOs and aliens has ramped up recently – and not just among Davenport and his followers.\n\nThe U.S. military is publicly investigating UFOs and is due to issue a highly anticipated report to Congress on June 25 on what it terms “unidentified aerial phenomenon.''\n\nThe New York Times was first to publish some details of the report on June 3.\n\nFighter pilots and stealth ships have reported strange objects off the Atlantic and Pacific coasts in recent years. According to the Times, the report will say the government has not found evidence that the objects were alien spacecraft. But the report also does not definitively say they weren't, The New York Times and other media outlets have reported.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of other phenomena reported overhead remain a mystery, including in the skies above Delaware and Maryland. But many of those claims, some dating back to the 1950s, have been debunked.\n\nFor example, the Pentagon received a report about a sighting by a family of three on May 24, 1957, near the military installation Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. The family had “seen something,” according to Fold3.com, a site that provides access to military records.\n\n“Based on all the information obtained from this investigation, it appears certain that this sighting was caused by an experiment or test of certain types of flares by the U.S. Army and that they originated from Aberdeen Proving Ground, which is located near the subject sighting,'' according to the website.\n\nTwo years later, there was a sighting on Oct. 15, 1959, at Dover Air Force Base.\n\nThe incident lasted 14 seconds, and the report stated there was a \"white fireball w/tail changing white to blue to blue-green. Tail was one to one and one-fourth inches long as measured by holding a pea at arm's length.”\n\nIt was concluded that the sighting was “probably a meteor,” per the report from Fold3.com.\n\nProject Blue Book is a federal program that assess the credibility and potential threat of unidentified flying objects. Hundreds of incidents from around the country are detailed and investigated on the site, many of them determined to be shooting stars, meteors, a planet or an airplane reflecting the light of the sun, a drone or even a paper lantern.\n\nBut even the nation's top experts can't explain away everything reported by those gazing at the night skies.\n\n13 alien stories from Delaware\n\nThere have been three UFO sightings in Delaware this year in Millville, Dover and Lewes, according to NUFORC. The latest was on May 5 in Dover, where a witness claimed to see a massive string of lights in the sky.\n\nSome of the more colorful reports on the website include this Wilmington sighting from 1949: “I was ascending a external staircase from our basement. Suddenly above me in the evening dark sky a very large, wide cylinder appeared.”\n\nThe NUFORC has a disclaimer on its site that it makes no claims to the validity of the information in any of its reports.\n\nMost reports have been posted exactly as received in the author's own words, the site says.\n\nDavenport, who's been director of the nonprofit for 27 years, told Delaware Online/The News Journal that debunked sightings are left posted on his website and they’re labeled as a \"HOAX\" in all caps.\n\nHaving an online database that documents these debunked sightings can help make more sense of these occurrences when people see them, he said.\n\nWhen a UFO makes local news headlines, area residents turn a curious eye to the sky and begin to report more strange objects. Novel skywatchers can see the mysterious in all sorts of things — blimps, drones, weather balloons, satellites.\n\nFelton resident Amanda Sturgeon recently recalled a strange experience she had when she lived at the beach.\n\n“I was living in Lewes, [near] the Par 3 Golf Course in Fairway Village, and there’s a golf course clubhouse there that sits right in front of my porch on the right. I was sitting outside smoking a cigarette really late/early into the morning and I saw lights floating,” she said.\n\nSturgeon said she was scared and didn't know what to think about what she saw.\n\n“I felt like it was really close to me and I was in danger. That’s the one time my brain couldn’t come up with an answer to explain what I was seeing,” she said.\n\nIf you think that's trippy, here are nine other interesting UFO reports from Delaware, per the NUFORC.\n\nJan. 22, 2020, in Bear: “I noticed an elongated blackish triangle shaped object. It seemed to be moving pretty fast. It’s angle was very steep.''\n\nMarch 31, 2016, in Rehoboth Beach: “We spotted an oval-shaped aircraft while driving on route one; did not fly like a helicopter and was too round to be a plane.”\n\nNov. 3, 2015, in North Star: “Loud, low noise near Newark, DE ...then 4 oOo shaped lights in sky above in formation ... then the helios show up.”\n\nSept. 15, 2015, in Deerfield: “25 crafts flying low heading southwest. Very bright but with no sound ... then disappeared in clouds 3 mins tops.”\n\nNov. 11, 2014, in Townsend: “people witnessed this amazing event, 3 sep. objects. HUGE, MAJESTIC, LIGHTS, BRILLIANT, QUIET, LOW.”\n\nOct. 25, 2014, in Wilmington: “8 fireballs following same path traveled northeast.”\n\nJuly 27, 2014, in Dewey Beach: “3 blue in color triangle shaped objects 'dancing' over the Indian River Inlet Bridge, just S of Dewey Beach.”\n\nAug. 26, 2013, in Bear: “a dark mushroom shaped object was seen moving without sound in the sky over Bear Delaware.”\n\nAug. 3, 2008, in Milford: \"Three family members saw a green fireball, about the size of a tennis ball, travel E to W for 3 seconds, with trailing red-orange spark.”\n\n'Magical star' and 'cold fire' spotted in Maryland\n\nThere have been 20 UFO sightings in Maryland this year. The latest was in Clarksburg on May 19, where someone reported a “Triangle UFO,” according to the NUFORC database.\n\nOne incident that stands out occurred on April 11 in Baltimore:\n\n“Pulsating orb, miles in the sky remained still. Broke into multiple lights, then back into 1. Disappeared after 20 minutes.”\n\nHere are nine other reports of weird doings in the skies over Maryland:\n\nJuly 5, 2019, in Ocean City: “Light, size of a distant star, distinct movements in fast horizontal line, stopped, returned to starting point in opposite direction.”\n\nJan. 26, 2016, in Towson: \"2 cigar shaped UFO hovered for about 10-15 minutes above horizon near forest, then immediately jetted directly vertical, into the sky.\"\n\nFeb. 21, 2014, in Stoney Beach: “Three objects over the water with flashing lights.”\n\nJuly 31, 2010, in Ocean City: “Circular lights in 'V' formation that moved very quickly and changed patterns.”\n\nAug. 18, 2009, in Westminster: “A magical star looking thing at a football game, right before 2 [undefeated] teams played!”\n\nSept. 17, 2006, in Havre De Grace: “The object captured in a [photograph] appeared to be a silver disk/saucer above the Chesapeake Bay.”\n\nAug. 15, 2004, in Ocean City: “Object of green, active cold fire traveling at very high speed low above the ground in absolute silence.”\n\nJune 30, 1987, in Crofton: “A saucer circles the moon many times.”\n\nMay 15, 1946, in Chevy Chase: “Man in gray seen in my bedroom when I was a child of around 4 years old.”\n\nAliens are everywhere — at least on TV, film\n\nZombies have fought hard to try to steal attention from aliens, but extraterrestrials have too much pride to bend the knee. Here are just some of the aliens that have captured our collective imaginations.\n\n1. Groot\n\nIt’s impossible to throw shade at Groot because he’s an alien tree. A beloved member from \"Guardians of the Galaxy,'' this special tree can drastically increase his size, which makes him stronger; he can also regenerate.\n\n2. The Coneheads\n\nTheir claim to fame was starring in their 1993 hit film, featuring Dan Aykroyd. The Coneheads are a family with heads shaped like bullets, so that makes them legitimate big shots. If you ask them, they'll tell you they're from France.\n\n3. Gonzo\n\nThe blue and long-nosed Muppet Gonzo hails from outer space. After realizing he had found his true family on Earth, Gonzo declined to go home with his alien brethren, in favor of staying put with his motley friends.\n\n4. Baby Yoda\n\nArguably the most adorable alien is a future Jedi master: Baby Yoda. Even as an adult, Yoda is still baby-sized. Yet his younger relative is undeniably sweeter than cotton candy.\n\n5. Mork\n\nOne of Robin Williams’ early roles was as a red jumpsuit-wearing alien named Mork, who starred in the “Mork and Mindy” sitcom in the late ’70s to early 1980s.\n\n6. Martian Manhunter\n\nA worthy green superhero not named the Incredible Hulk is the Martian Manhunter. He’s a shapeshifter who’s one of the last from his alien race. He’s an important member of the Justice League, alongside Wonder Woman, Batman and Superman (who’s an alien, too).\n\n7. Little green men\n\nThe squeezable, three-eyed green men from the “Toy Story” franchise often are overshadowed by Buzz and Woody, which is no surprise. But these little triclops deserve to have some respect put on their name, after surviving the claw machine.\n\n8. ALF\n\nAlien Life Form, or simply \"ALF,\" also found success on TV in his namesake show. ALF is a furry comedian who looks like an anteater.\n\n9. Xenomorph\n\nThe Mount Rushmore of aliens has to include the Xenomorph from the “Aliens” sci-fi series. Although she’s lovable, she’s the most vicious on this list. The Xenomorph can spit acid and impregnate foes with a baby alien, and she has claws sharper than a bowl of Cap’n Crunch.\n\nBattle of Los Angeles\n\nFor some newcomers, the “Battle of Los Angeles” is merely a 2011 Hollywood blockbuster about an alien invasion. But its origins aren’t fictional, according to lifelong UFO believers like Davenport.\n\nHe said the government has known about aliens for decades and pointed to the Battle of Los Angeles as an example.\n\nThis incident took place on Feb. 25, 1942, during World War II.\n\n“1,433 rounds of anti-aircraft ammunition were fired at a UFO that was hovering over Los Angeles. There’s copious quantities of information about it on the internet,” Daveport said.\n\nAccording to History.com, the U.S. military radar picked up what was thought to be an enemy contact about 120 miles west of Los Angeles.\n\nFollowing reports of an object in the skies, troops in Santa Monica unloaded a barrage of anti-aircraft and .50-caliber machine gunfire.\n\nAs the story goes, there was no enemy attack. While there may never be a conclusion on what happened that night, it is most often explained as a case of mistaken identity involving weather balloons.\n\nA lot of interesting reports emerged, such as one from the Los Angeles Times.\n\n“Powerful searchlights from countless stations stabbed the sky with brilliant probing fingers,” the LA Times wrote, “while anti-aircraft batteries dotted the heavens with beautiful, if sinister, orange bursts of shrapnel.”\n\nFirst experience: 'Lasted all of my life'\n\nDavenport has seen at least five UFOs, he said.\n\nHis first sighting was with his mom and older brother at a drive-in movie theater in July or August of 1954, at the tender age of 6, he said. The theater was located on the edge of the St. Louis Lambert International Airport.\n\nSuddenly a disturbance started brewing in the theater. People were getting out of their cars, slamming their doors and running toward the side of his mom’s 1953 Studebaker car.\n\n“I looked out the right side of the car, looking east, and I saw an intensely bright object about the shape of an English rugby football. It was hovering motionless in the nighttime sky,” he said.\n\nThe object suddenly accelerated, rose up in the sky and went behind the drive-in theater screen and disappeared into the northwest. “All of this took place in about five to 10 seconds,” Davenport said. “It’s left an impression on me that’s lasted all of my life.”\n\nHe knew it wasn’t a plane because his dad worked at the St. Louis airport, and “I prided myself on my ability to identify almost every aircraft that entered the airport.”\n\nWhen he later saw his father after work that night, his dad said he saw the same thing. His mom did, too.\n\nNASA talks about UFOs\n\nIf the government does release a UFO report later this month and it doesn’t confirm that our planet has had visitors from outer space, Davenport won’t be surprised.\n\nHe maintains the government knows some UFOs are not from this planet, but he doesn’t know why they’d hold this info back from the public.\n\nFor those who have spent years examining such cases, recent disclosures by the military come with much apprehension. James Krug serves as a regional director for the Pennsylvania Mutual UFO Network, teaches astronomy and runs the Neil Armstrong Planetarium at Altoona Area High School.\n\nKrug suspects the government has released crumbs of information steadily about unexplained phenomena in order to brace the public for a future disclosure.\n\n\"I am cautious regarding the pending disclosure from the U.S. military regarding UFOs,\" Krug said. \"On one hand, it does seem like the public is in the midst of a multi-year disclosure to make us more comfortable with the idea of UFOs. Some believe this is intentional, designed to avert panic like that shown when many mistook Orson Welles' 1938 Halloween radio broadcast of The War of the Worlds as a genuine alien invasion.\"\n\nThe military is playing a shell game in changing the way it classifies UFOs now as unidentified aerial phenomena, Krug said.\n\n\"Their terminology was recently changed from 'UFO' to 'UAP,' largely to dissuade Freedom of Information Act requests for 'UFOs.' The military could claim they have little to no information on 'UFOs,' when in reality, they've simply changed the terminology to something new.\"\n\nThe News Journal reached out to NASA to see what it had to say about UFOs and the government space agency responded in a statement:\n\n\"To date, NASA has yet to find any credible evidence of extraterrestrial life, however, NASA is exploring the solar system and beyond to help us answer fundamental questions, including whether we are alone in the universe.\"\n\n\"We stand ready to support the rest of the government in the search for life in the universe, be it close to home, on the planets or moons of our solar system, or deeper into space.\"\n\nAndre Lamar is the features/lifestyle reporter.

Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.\n\nCNN —\n\nThe Taurid “swarm” is still going strong this month, with bright meteors known as fireballs visible across the world in the night sky.\n\nThe Southern Taurids peaked last week, with sightings of fireballs lasting throughout the first week of November, but it’s not over yet. The Taurid meteor shower is composed of two streams, and the Northern Taurids are predicted to peak on Saturday, according to EarthSky.\n\n“The Taurids only peak at maybe five meteors per hour, but there’s always a chance that one of those five might be a fireball, which is brighter than any star or planet in the sky,” said Robert Lunsford, the fireball report coordinator for the American Meteor Society. “Only the sun and the moon are brighter than the normal fireballs, so they are quite spectacular when you see one.”\n\nThe Southern Taurids run from about September 23 to November 12, while the Northern Taurids are active from about October 13 to December 2. When the two showers are active simultaneously, there can be an increase in fireballs, especially during a Taurid swarm year such as this one.\n\nThe showers reach their respective peaks at points where Earth is closest to the center of each stream. The swarm results when Jupiter is close enough to pull on the streams with its gravity, causing debris to condense and creating a spike in fireballs. The last time this happened was in 2015, and before then in 2008, creating a seven-year repetition that the meteor society predicted would happen again for 2022.\n\n“It’s a very interesting shower that produces a lot of fireballs,” said Mike Hankey, the American Meteor Society’s operations manager and creator of its fireball tracking program. “It’s always been known for fireballs, but we can definitely see an uptick in the data every day this month. There has been a lot of fireballs already.”\n\nOrigin of the Taurids\n\nThe Taurids radiate from the direction of the Taurus constellation, although it’s best not to look in that area since the meteors’ trails last for the shortest period then. Fireballs will be seen all over the sky, and they won’t be disturbed by the waning of the bright November 8 full moon either since they can outshine most elements of the night sky.\n\nThe Southern and Northern Taurids both derive from components of Comet Encke, which has the shortest orbit around the sun of any major comet in our solar system at a little more than three years. Every time Encke passes Earth in its orbit, it leaves a new trail of debris, making it a large producer of meteoroids. The strain is so large it takes our planet several weeks to pass through the meteor shower.\n\nComet Encke will return in October 2023.\n\nSeeing a fireball\n\nTaurid meteors tend to move slowly but sometimes are very bright, depending on their size. Meteors larger than a meter (3.3 feet) across tend to move the slowest and shine the brightest, according to NASA. Fireballs can be seen moving across the sky for a few seconds, whereas most meteors are visible only for a millisecond. The fireballs are often described as colorful, either red, orange or yellow.\n\n“You won’t always see fireballs, but there are meteors every night of the year,” Lunsford said. “It’s something you can do inexpensively. You don’t even need a telescope; just your eyes are perfect.”\n\nOther space events this year\n\nThere are three more meteor showers you can see in the remainder of 2022, according to EarthSky’s 2022 meteor shower guide. Here are the showers and their predicted peaks:\n\n• November 18: Leonids\n\n• December 14: Geminids\n\n• December 22: Ursids\n\nThere is one more full moon on the The Old Farmer’s Almanac calendar for 2022: the cold moon on December 7.", "authors": ["Taylor Nicioli"], "publish_date": "2022/11/11"}]}

The President’s vacation home near Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, is in the middle of a flood zone, and an analysis by a climate research group shows that the house is facing “extreme” flooding risk that is expected to get more severe over time.\n\nThat means the nation’s homeowner-in-chief is among the millions of Americans who are facing climate-linked danger to their properties – and he has a big personal financial stake in the fight against the climate crisis.\n\nBiden’s multi-million-dollar vacation home, which he has visited nearly a dozen times during his presidency, is in a quiet community tucked between a canal, the wetlands of a state park, and the Atlantic Ocean. Delaware has the lowest average elevation of any state, leaving neighborhoods like his in danger of being swamped during storms.\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks to reporters as he walks on the beach in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, on June 20. Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP\n\nBiden and his wife Jill bought the home in 2017 after he left the vice presidency, and the structure is elevated to avoid major damage from all but the most catastrophic floods.\n\nElevation can be a powerful tool to protect against flood damage. Some climate advocates, while applauding Biden’s legislative accomplishments, argue that his administration should do more to help other residents of flood zones raise their homes – in a similar manner to the President’s summer retreat.\n\nAnd they note that areas like Biden’s wealthy neighborhood, where streets are dotted with elevated homes, are far better protected from the impacts of climate change than poorer communities hit by disastrous flooding, from rural Kentucky to Jackson, Mississippi.\n\n“When rain falls, it falls on those in power and those without power as well,” said Daniel Gilford, a researcher at the nonprofit Climate Central. “Climate change comes for all of us, but only some are wealthy enough to protect themselves.”\n\nRising waters, rising risks\n\nBiden’s home is in North Shores, an unincorporated community about a mile north of Rehoboth Beach’s tourist-filled boardwalk. The area was first developed in the 1950s and 60s on marshland that was filled in, government records and historic aerial photos show.\n\nEarly newspaper articles promoted the development’s “rustic simplicity” and “maximum privacy.” But the low-lying area also faced flooding and damage during multiple storms over the years, at times leaving streets inundated with up to six feet of water.\n\nBiden’s six-bed, five-and-a-half-bath house was built near the development’s north end in 2007, according to real estate listings. In June 2017, soon after signing a multi-million-dollar book deal, the Bidens bought the home for $2.74 million, property records show. Thanks to a pandemic-era jump in home prices, it’s now worth nearly $3.8 million, according to an estimate from the real estate website Redfin.\n\nThe home overlooks the salt marshes of Cape Henlopen State Park – a former military site that Biden helped return to Delaware when he was a US senator, and where he’s often spotted biking on weekends. The Rehoboth-Lewes Canal borders one side of the neighborhood, and North Shores’ private beach is about a half-mile walk away.\n\nThe proximity to water from multiple directions comes with a downside. The home has an extreme risk of flooding – 10 on a scale of 10 – according to the climate research group First Street Foundation, which has used environmental science and computer modeling to estimate flood risk for every property in the US.\n\nThere’s a 98% chance of flood water reaching Biden’s house within the next five years, First Street found. Less than 5% of properties nationwide have as high a flood risk.\n\nThe home is in FEMA’s Special Flood Hazard Area – the zone that would be inundated during a 100-year flood. A rarer 500-year flood would be likely to inundate the property with just over 10 feet of water, according to First Street’s national model. As climate change advances, the same flood would be expected to reach a depth of 11.4 feet in 30 years.\n\nAnd as Biden himself has noted, “what used to be once-in-a-century storms are now happening every few years.”\n\nDefended by building up\n\nIn an apparent response to that risk, Biden’s home was designed with flooding in mind. The living area is elevated about 10 feet off the ground, according to county records, with a broad exterior staircase leading to the double front doors and the ground floor used as a garage.\n\nMany of the first couple’s neighbors live at similar heights, with some huge homes suspended on stilts. New and significantly renovated homes are required by the county to be raised to a height known as the base flood elevation – five feet for much of the neighborhood.\n\nSteven Hollman, who owns a home around the block from Biden’s and serves as the president of the North Shores Board of Governors, said the community has taken efforts to mitigate the risk from floods. That includes maintaining and replenishing their private beach’s sand dunes “at not insignificant expense,” he said.\n\nThe dunes are “our first safeguard,” Hollman said. “If we have a breach of the dunes because of a cataclysmic weather event, then that’s going to affect the entire community.”\n\nRehoboth Beach as seen on July 20, 2022. Julia Weeks/AP\n\nStill, as climate change advances and sea levels rise, flooding that seeps up from the low-elevation marsh that borders Biden’s property will likely become more common, according to University of Delaware professor John Callahan, who studies flood risk in the state. Eventually, it could mean high-tide flooding, with water regularly reaching streets even on days without major storms.\n\n“A lot of flooding in neighborhoods like this is not from the ocean but from behind – the streams, marshes, and canals that all fill up and flood,” Callahan said.\n\nThe White House didn’t respond to requests for comment about the home’s flood risk, or whether the Bidens have flood insurance. While the first couple aren’t required to have flood insurance because they don’t have a mortgage on the home, Hollman said flood insurance in North Shores is “very common” even for homeowners without mortgages.\n\nBiden’s neighborhood is an example of how development near the coast can lead to more people facing flood danger decades later – a trend that’s still happening today. The surrounding Sussex County has seen a boom in housing construction, and had more homes built in areas at high risk of flooding than almost any other coastal county in the US, according to a 2019 report from Climate Central.\n\nThat kind of development is “gambling on people’s future resilience,” said Danielle Swallow, a coastal hazards specialist with the environmental organization Delaware Sea Grant. “It’s passing the risk on to homebuyers and future generations.”\n\nFrom Rehoboth to Mar-a-Lago\n\nOwning a home at risk from climate change doesn’t necessarily make a president more likely to address the crisis. But Biden has advanced measures to help protect flood-prone areas – although experts say his administration could go further.\n\nChad Berginnis, the executive director of The Association of State Floodplain Managers, said the administration’s accomplishments included allocating more funding to build flood mitigation infrastructure projects, update rainfall frequency information, and expand flood maps. He called the progress on those issues “very encouraging.”\n\nStill, Berginnis said more should be done to help individual homeowners in flood zones raise or relocate their homes – key adaptation measures that have successfully protected communities.\n\n“Going property by property is a slower slog, but it’s an effective solution, especially for many smaller communities that can’t afford or maintain” larger projects like seawalls, Berginnis said.\n\nWhile the infrastructure bill Biden signed last year increases funding for home elevations and other flood mitigation projects, experts say it doesn’t meet the growing need.\n\nAnd the bulk of grant funding for home elevations has gone to wealthy and White neighborhoods, in part because federal programs take into account the higher property values in those areas, an investigation by Politico earlier this year found. FEMA has said it is working to address the disparity and help disadvantaged communities. (No homes in Biden’s Rehoboth Beach-area zip code have received federal elevation grants, according to FEMA data.)\n\n“Elevating homes can be pricey, and it’s easier to make the money work when properties have higher value,” said Kristin Smith, a researcher with the nonprofit Headwaters Economics. That can end up excluding “some of the people who need help the most,” especially in low-income areas, she said.\n\nResearch has found that poor and minority neighborhoods have been disproportionately affected by some climate change-linked flooding, and are likely to see the greatest increases in risk over time. Less privileged communities are also more likely to struggle to recover from flooding – especially compared to places like North Shores, where most houses are vacation homes, not primary residences.\n\nMore broadly, Biden’s recent climate legislation is the farthest-reaching bill of its kind in US history, and includes hundreds of billions of dollars to reduce the carbon emissions that lead to sea level rise. However, the spending package didn’t fund programs like subsidized flood insurance that had been included in previous versions of the proposal.\n\nBiden isn’t the only executive branch leader who has a home facing climate danger: Vice President Kamala Harris has spoken publicly about how her house in Los Angeles has been threatened by wildfire.\n\nAnd former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida has a similar level of flood risk as Biden’s vacation home, according to First Street.\n\nTrump spurned the scientific consensus on climate change, and unraveled or weakened dozens of environmental regulations during his time in the White House. Notably, Trump axed an Obama-era executive order that toughened building standards for federally funded construction projects in flood zones – and Biden brought it back.\n\nThat contrast between two presidents who both like to vacation in areas threatened by rising seas shows the wide variations in how Americans respond to climate risk, Berginnis said.\n\n“Presidents are people, and human nature is a funny thing,” he said. “They are going to come to their own approaches and conclusions.”", "authors": ["Casey Tolan"], "publish_date": "2022/09/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/02/01/delaware-state-university-unrest-students-leg-hall-sexual-assault-reports/69858440007/", "title": "Delaware State unrest: What to know about students heading to Leg ...", "text": "Tension was brewing.\n\nReports of sexual assault ticked up in the Delaware State University daily crime log, each sending another alert to student cellphones.

They want “advocacy transportation” following a sexual assault report to be ensured and for students facing allegations to be barred from campus activities while a case is open.\n\nOrganizers also call for more security across the main campus and DSU Downtown; education and awareness programs across the university and police; and increased counselors and support available to students.\n\n“It's all about accountability,” said one sophomore, Melanie Jimmerson. “We’ve told you what we need.\"\n\nWhat has the university said so far?\n\nUniversity President Tony Allen responded with initial steps on Jan. 20 after one town hall, closed to the public and media, pushed until nearly 3 a.m. in a campus auditorium. A follow-up town hall, also closed to media on Jan. 27, came with more details.\n\nA “Safe Space Coalition” — made of student committees, parents and administrators — will be forming to assess existing protocol on safety and sexual assault, streamlining recommendations to his office. Mandatory sensitivity training will be scheduled across the university, starting with public safety. And a new \"Center for Safety & Well-Being\" is to be established.\n\nThis joins promises to upgrade campus lighting and cameras, update the blue lights system and assess existing escort services and counseling hours. Allen did not give an exact timeline for these efforts.\n\nDSU protest:Delaware State gives next steps in campus security: 'Your bravery and strength are clear'\n\nNo media allowed:Delaware State responds to protest cries with town hall meeting — but closed it to public\n\nThe president, through a university spokesperson, told USA TODAY Network he was “not inclined” to take an interview on more specifics.\n\nAllen also said each public safety officer will be equipped with a body camera, though this measure was also not given a timeline. Public safety is focused on expanding security, he noted, and hiring more women officers.\n\nWhat's happening at DSU? In case you missed it\n\nCalls without answers, long times spent waiting for response, avoiding stairwells, fear of walking alone at night — students had a lot to say about campus safety. And they found a megaphone to do it.\n\nHundreds of students protested on Jan. 18, calling for change within Delaware State University public safety. That protest pushed into the late afternoon. Since then, multiple town halls and other meetings have stretched hours in length.\n\nDelaware State crime reports show five cases of rape on campus in 2019, two in 2020 and five in 2021. The university’s daily crime log shows 10 reports in 2022, as a calendar year, with four more reported this month.\n\nSubscribers, go deeper:Delaware State students aren’t done. Hear their stories and what they need to change.\n\nThis violence is not unique to Dover. University of Delaware crime statistics show five assaults in 2021, with Temple University recording seven that year. These schools are nearly four times and six times larger than Delaware State in total student population, respectively.\n\nNationally, over a quarter of undergraduate women will experience sexual assault, according to the Association of American Universities. The vast majority, researchers say, will go unreported.\n\nThis comes as the institution just celebrated enrollment milestones.\n\nAgainst the grain:Colleges are shrinking.

A month after Jethani dropped off his kids for their freshman year in October 2022, there was a fatal shooting near their dorm.\n\n“This was a real rude awakening,” he told USA TODAY.\n\nCheck out USA TODAY's Crimes on Campus tool for detailed information. Zoom in on the map below to search crimes on more than 10,000 college and university campuses. Don't see a map? Click here.\n\nJethani and other parents were concerned that crime across the city of Berkeley seemed on the rise. A February shooting scared some parents, too. No one was injured and a suspect was reportedly taken into custody.\n\nHiring private security officers didn't sit well with Berkeley administrators. In a statement to USA TODAY, spokesperson Janet Gilmore said money intended to keep Berkeley students safe would best be spent supporting the school’s police force.\n\n“Hiring private security raises a number of concerns, including the training and experience of individuals hired by such firms,” Gilmore said.\n\nCampus crime rebounds to pre-pandemic levels\n\nThe number of crimes reported by college campuses across the country rebounded to pre-pandemic levels in 2022, government data shows.\n\nCrime reported from nearly 6,000 institutions rose about 8% from 2019, even though enrollments dipped during that timeframe. The jump in offenses between 2019 and 2022 coincided with students’ post-pandemic return en masse to campuses. Compared with year-over-year changes before 2019, the recent jump represents the largest increase since post-secondary institutions that receive federal funding began reporting campus safety statistics.\n\nExperts see little reason to worry and say the numbers are largely consistent with what colleges have been experiencing since 2013, according to S. Daniel Carter, president of the consulting firm Safety Advisors for Educational Campuses.\n\nFollowing a steady decline starting around 2006, the number of crimes reported by colleges and universities remained pretty stagnant over the past decade, according to government data. Yet when foot traffic on and around campuses diminished in 2020 after classes went online during the pandemic, crime dropped precipitously in 2020. In the years since it has inched up again.\n\nThe recent increase was mostly driven by a surge in reported motor vehicle theft, which more than doubled from 2019 and accounted for more than a quarter of offenses in 2022. Carter was skeptical of that increase, saying it could be traced to schools changing their reporting requirements to comply with federal law.\n\n“There has been some work done to increase awareness that scooters and golf carts are motor vehicles – that could be a factor,” he said.\n\nGovernment data is not yet available for 2023, so these numbers don’t account for the turmoil on college campuses in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. Recent surveys show many Muslim and Jewish students reported feeling unsafe on campus since the Oct. 7 attacks, which prompted massive campus clashes and protests, as well as surges in Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents.\n\nThe reported numbers from 2022 include offenses that occurred on and off campus, including on university properties located elsewhere; offenses that occurred on public property adjacent to campuses, and a small number of offenses reported to institutions by local police.\n\nRenewed push to encourage students to report crimes\n\nColleges and universities that receive federal funding must compile statistics about crimes that occur on or near campus under the Clery Act. The federal law, passed in 1990, was named after 20-year-old Jeanne Clery, a student whose rape and murder at her dorm at Lehigh University drew national attention.\n\nThe tension colleges contend with in simultaneously trying to encourage students to report crimes and keep numbers down was on full display during a recent scandal at Liberty University, a private Evangelical university in Virginia.\n\nThe federal government concluded last year that the school created a culture of dissuading victims of sexual assault from reporting what happened to them, according to a preliminary report obtained by USA TODAY. Then, in March, the Education Department slapped the school with a $14 million fine and ordered officials to pay an additional $2 million for “on-campus safety improvements and compliance enhancements.” In a written statement in March, Dondi E. Costin, Liberty’s president, said the school sincerely regretted the errors.\n\nThe scandal shed light on the consequences schools face if they don’t fully comply with the law, said Abigail Boyer, the associate executive director of the Clery Center, which tracks campus safety trends.\n\n“Ultimately, we want campuses to create a culture in which students are comfortable about reporting,” she said.\n\nClery Act figures are self-reported, and the Department of Education doesn’t verify them independently. However, the agency conducts periodic reviews of Clery Act compliance. Over the past 15 years, the agency has evaluated at least 110 universities. Dozens of those cases have led to fines.\n\nDo stolen scooters and e-bikes explain the apparent crime surge?\n\nThe Clery Act requires schools to report “motor vehicle thefts,\" but the statute doesn’t only include cars – scooters, electric bicycles and golf carts fall into the same category.\n\nSeveral schools said the surge in crime on or near their campuses in 2022 could be attributed to their revised reporting of scooter, electric bike and golf cart theft.

It wasn’t a serious wound, but over the weeks it didn’t heal.\n\nAround the same time, her wrists and knees became sore; her ankles started rolling when she walked; her hands began shaking; her headaches and stomach aches became more frequent and intensely painful. She was always exhausted.\n\nBefore her health declined, Poppy had enjoyed horse riding and gymnastics, she’d competed in cross country races and been a fearless goalkeeper for the school hockey team.\n\nBut within a couple of months, as walking became increasingly difficult, she asked me for a walking stick. We found one that folds up and fits neatly in her school bag.\n\nI took Poppy to doctors who conducted tests, but they couldn’t find out what was wrong with her. Then, in October, a breakthrough.\n\nA podiatrist who was measuring Poppy for insoles to support her aching feet asked if Poppy could bend her thumb to reach her forearm. She could. Could she pull her little finger back to form a 90-degree angle with the back of her hand? She could do that, too.\n\n“Have you heard of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome?” the podiatrist asked me. I hadn’t – so as soon as I got home, I went looking on the internet.\n\nThere are 13 types of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), according to research and advocacy organization The Ehlers-Danlos Society. Most types are very rare, and can be diagnosed using genetic tests. However, the genes that cause hypermobile EDS (hEDS) – the most common form, accounting for about 90% of cases – are unknown, so diagnosis is based on a checklist of symptoms. The list includes a hypermobility rating, known as the Beighton Score.\n\nPoppy had enough symptoms to qualify for hEDS, and the diagnosis was confirmed by a doctor one year ago, on Christmas Eve. He told us that although we can do our best to alleviate some symptoms, there is no cure.\n\nPoppy reacted to the news better than I did. She had known for some time that something was fundamentally wrong. The diagnosis was upsetting but identifying her illness also gave her a sense of relief. I felt shocked and overwhelmed, and I cried for weeks.\n\nReading about EDS was like a dreadful slow reveal.\n\nI learned that it’s a genetic disorder that causes the body to make faulty connective tissue, and connective tissue is everywhere – in the tendons, ligaments, skin, heart, digestive system, eyes and gums.\n\nWeak connective tissue leads to hypermobility, which may sound like a good thing, but some people with bendy bodies suffer a mind-boggling array of symptoms, including joint dislocations and subluxations (like a mini dislocation, when the joint partially slips out of place), soft stretchy skin, abnormal scarring, poor wound healing, gastrointestinal disorders, chronic pain and fatigue.\n\nThe severity of symptoms varies wildly. Patients with milder cases can lead relatively normal lives, while others become housebound, and some can’t digest food and must be fed through tubes.\n\nWhat’s more, people with hEDS are prone to other conditions, including POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, which makes you dizzy when you stand up) and MCAS (mast cell activation syndrome, which gives you allergy-type symptoms).\n\nI learned a lot of new acronyms and they all spelled bad news.\n\nZebras or horses?\n\nI initially thought hEDS was rare, because all forms of EDS are commonly referred to as rare. But within a few weeks, I felt like I was seeing references to hEDS everywhere. Actor, writer and director Lena Dunham; actor and presenter Jameela Jamil; and drag queen Yvie Oddly live with it. I deep dived into EDS Twitter and EDS Instagram, while Poppy found it comforting to watch TikTok videos made by teenagers with the condition.\n\nDrag queen Yvie Oddly, who has hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, crab walks down the pink carpet at RuPaul's DragCon LA in 2019. Rodin Eckenroth/Getty Images\n\nI discovered multiple patient groups on Facebook, each with tens of thousands of members, which turned out to be great sources of support. I asked questions (what kind of shoes are best for weak ankles? Which knee braces are easiest to pull on and off?) and kind strangers sent helpful advice. At the same time, scrolling through countless personal stories of pain, despair and shattered dreams made me feel terrified about what might lie ahead.\n\nI noticed common themes. Many EDS patients had spent years seeking the correct diagnosis; others felt they’d been neglected and gaslit by doctors.\n\nThere was also a lot of talk of zebras.\n\nLinda Bluestein, a Colorado-based physician who specializes in EDS and other hypermobility conditions, and has hEDS herself, explains why.\n\n“I was told in medical school, ‘when you hear hoofbeats think horses, not zebras,’” she says. Many trainee doctors receive the same advice – when a patient presents with symptoms, “look for the common thing.” That’s why EDS patients commonly refer to themselves as zebras – and also use the fabulous collective noun “dazzle.” The name represents rarity and evokes the stripy stretch marks that are a common feature on EDS skin.\n\nBut if people with hEDS are medical zebras, why am I encountering so many of them?\n\nBluestein says that for many years it was thought that one in 5,000 people had Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. But she says the limited research that’s been carried out into the prevalence of hEDS suggests the true number of cases is “much, much higher” than that.\n\nDr. Linda Bluestein has treated hEDS patients who have been searching for a diagnosis for decades. Linda Bluestein\n\nBluestein points me to a 2019 study carried out in Wales – a country of 3.1 million people. An examination of primary care and hospital records from 1990 to 2017 found that one in 500 people there has either hEDS or joint hypermobility syndrome (a similar condition with a slightly different set of symptoms). She says it’s “a good study” but believes it’s still an underestimate. The Ehlers-Danlos Society says more population studies need to be done to give a more accurate view of its incidence elsewhere.\n\nBut despite this possible prevalence, and how debilitating hypermobility disorders can be, the average time to diagnosis from the onset of symptoms is 10 to 12 years, according to The Ehlers-Danlos Society.\n\nBluestein has firsthand experience of this. Growing up, she wanted to become a ballet dancer and trained six days a week. When puberty hit, she started experiencing joint pain and migraines, and at 16 had her first orthopedic surgery. She realized she wouldn’t succeed in the ballet world and instead pursued her “back-up plan,” to become a doctor. But despite her career choice, Bluestein only received her hEDS diagnosis when she was 47 – more than 30 years later.\n\n“I told my doctor on numerous occasions, ‘there is something wrong with me, I don’t heal well, I get injured more easily than other people’,” she says. “And he just never, never listened.”\n\nWhy, for so many patients, does it take so long to get diagnosed?\n\n‘The worst possible model’\n\nIn 2014 a leading EDS expert, Professor Rodney Grahame, remarked at a conference that “no other disease in the history of modern medicine has been neglected in such a way as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.”\n\nFar more women than men are diagnosed with EDS, which could help to explain the neglect, because the medical profession has a long history of overlooking health complaints made by women.\n\nA 2009 study, conducted by the European Organisation for Rare Diseases, surveyed 414 families of EDS patients from five countries and found that the average delay to an EDS diagnosis was four years for men – but 16 years for women.\n\nThe report states that women with EDS tend to be “diagnosed later because their pain and hypotonia (poor muscle tone) aren’t considered as physical symptoms but rather as psychological symptoms or common complaints.”\n\n“We tend to get dismissed a lot more easily,” says Bluestein. “People jump to the conclusion that we’re histrionic females.”\n\nAnxiety is very common in patients with hypermobility issues, says Bluestein, which can cloud the picture. “When people with anxiety present to a physician, it can suck all the air out of the room, so that the physician almost can’t see anything else.”\n\nThis can ramp up the patient’s anxiety further “because people aren’t validating our symptoms, and then we start to doubt ourselves,” she says.\n\nWhat’s more, medicine is divided into silos which creates the “worst possible model” for EDS patients, says Bluestein.\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 'We're born with this and will never be free:' Hear stories from people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome 05:02 - Source: CNN\n\nShe explains that undiagnosed patients might consult a neurologist for their migraines, a rheumatologist for joint pain, a cardiologist for palpitations, a gastroenterologist for digestive issues and a urologist for bladder symptoms. Each doctor focuses on the symptoms that fall within their specialty but doesn’t consider the other ailments. “Nowhere along the way does somebody realize that there are certain conditions that could tie all of these things together and explain everything,” says Bluestein.\n\nThe 2009 rare diseases study found that during the quest for a diagnosis, 58% of EDS patients consulted more than five doctors, and 20% consulted more than 20.\n\nThe consequences of not getting diagnosed for years can be devastating.\n\nMelissa Dickinson, a psychotherapist in Atlanta, Georgia, says she experienced symptoms of a “mystery illness” since childhood. Then in 2013, she “went on honeymoon to Mexico, relatively healthy, and came back disabled and with a dislocated neck.”\n\nWhile on vacation, Dickinson says she got food poisoning and was prescribed ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic that can pose a serious risk of aortic aneurysm to people with EDS. Instead, she says it triggered significant nerve damage, digestive issues that almost made her go blind because her body wasn’t absorbing nutrients, and put her in a wheelchair.\n\nDickinson, who finally received her hEDS diagnosis in 2014, says taking the wrong medication “wrecked me from head to toe.” Now that she’s receiving treatment, “I can walk with mobility aids, but most of my body has to have constant support to function.”\n\nLara Bloom, president and CEO of The Ehlers-Danlos Society, who herself has hEDS, says many patients have “medicalized PTSD.”\n\n“They have had to stop their careers, they’ve had to drop out of school, their relationships have broken down.” The delay inevitably results in worsening symptoms and a declining quality of life, she says. In worst-case scenarios, patients “are dying by suicide, they’re self-harming.”\n\nSometimes, the failure to diagnose EDS has led to children being taken away from their parents.\n\nIn 2010, Americans Rana Tyson and her husband Chad were falsely accused of harming their 4-week-old twin daughters, who had unexplained fractures in their legs.\n\nAlong with their older sister, the baby girls were taken by state authorities in Texas and sent to live with relatives. “It was the worst day of my life,” Tyson tells me in a phone call.\n\nFive months later, a geneticist identified the twins as having a connective tissue disorder, and they were subsequently diagnosed with EDS and a vitamin D deficiency. The family was reunited but “12 years later, it still hurts,” says Tyson.\n\nBloom says some other parents of children with EDS have been wrongly accused of “fabricated or induced illness (FII)” – a rare form of abuse, formerly known as Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy, in which a parent or care giver deliberately causes symptoms or tries to convince doctors that a healthy child is ill.\n\nEllie Pattison, who has hEDS, has been repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder. Ellie Pattison\n\nEllie Pattison, a 19-year-old student who lives in County Durham, England, suffers from severe digestive issues linked to hEDS.\n\nThroughout her childhood, Ellie was repeatedly misdiagnosed as having an eating disorder, she says, while her mother Caroline was accused of FII on three separate occasions. Caroline successfully fought to keep her daughter at home, says Ellie, but the ordeal has left the whole family with “an unimaginable amount of trauma.” Ellie says she suffered from PTSD and endured years of horrific nightmares, triggered by living with the fear from a young age that she could be forcibly separated from her family.\n\nThis underlines why prompt diagnosis is so important, says Bloom. “Our hope and dream is for people to get diagnosed when their symptoms begin.”\n\nThe search for answers\n\nIn the case of hEDS, a crucial first step is to find out what causes it.\n\nCortney Gensemer, a biomedical scientist in the Norris Lab at the Medical University of South Carolina’s department of Regenerative Medicine and Cell Biology, is trying to solve this mystery. She and research mentor Russell Norris, head of the lab, have been studying a gene mutation they believe causes hEDS (the results of the study are currently under peer review).\n\nLike Poppy, Gensemer was diagnosed with hEDS as a teenager. She says the disease affects every aspect of her work. Looking down a microscope is particularly painful at times – her neck is unstable because of her hEDS, and she’s had metal screws put into some of her neck vertebrae to fuse them.\n\nCortney Gensemer working in the Norris Lab and recovering from neck surgery earlier this year. Cortney Gensemer\n\nNorris kitted the lab out with special equipment, including motion sensor doors (standard lab doors are very heavy), adjustable chairs and ergonomic pipettes that are gentle on the hands. “If I didn’t have all that stuff, I don’t think I’d be able to do it,” says Gensemer.\n\nTo find a hEDS-causing gene, Gensemer says she and Norris sampled DNA from a large family with cases spanning four generations and looked for a mutation that appears only in relatives who have the disease. They identified a “strong candidate gene” and inserted it into mice using gene editing tools.\n\nGensemer and Norris found that the hEDS mice had significantly more lax tissues, and floppier tails than regular rodents. “You can tie a loose knot into the mutant mouse tail. With a normal mouse tail, you can (only) bend it into a circle,” Gensemer says.\n\nThe gene that Gensemer and Norris found won’t account for all hEDS cases, she says. They believe that eventually multiple genes will be identified, and hEDS may be split into different subtypes. This would help to explain why different patients have different symptoms. Crucially, if genetic information sheds light on how the connective tissue is “messed up,” it could lead to effective treatments, says Gensemer.\n\nThe Ehlers-Danlos Society is also looking for genes as well as blood markers, working with a team of experts to sequence and analyze the DNA of 1,000 hEDS patients from around the world. And at the UK’s University of Warwick, Ph.D. candidate Sabeeha Malek, another scientist with hEDS, has proposed that EDS might be caused by a fault in the way that collagen binds to cell membranes in connective tissue. If she’s right, she hopes her work will lead to a skin biopsy test that could identify all forms of the disease.\n\nSabeeha Malek is working to identify biomarkers that could make EDS diagnosis easier. Sabeeha Malek\n\nProgress is being made but on a very small scale. “If you look at any major academic institution, there are multiple labs studying cancer, multiple labs studying heart disease. When you look at a disease that affects one in 500 people, and probably more than that, there should be a lab studying it at every single academic institution,” says Gensemer.\n\nGensemer hopes that as more discoveries are made and data is accumulated it will “change the way the medical community looks at the disease” – and that it will be taken more seriously.\n\nA giant kitten for my zebra\n\nA year has passed since Poppy’s diagnosis. The initial shock has subsided, and while I’m still grieving the loss of her health, we’ve both learned to accept our new reality and have adjusted to living with EDS.\n\nI’ve assembled a team of supportive doctors and therapists and acquired an arsenal of paraphernalia to fight pain and manage symptoms, including braces and kinesiology tape to hold her joints in place; ice packs, heat pads, tiger balm and arnica gel for sore muscles; and a cupboard full of medications and supplements.\n\nWith Poppy often stuck at home, I also got her a giant kitten that she calls Bagel, and he provides the best therapy.\n\nPoppy with Bagel. Tom Booth/CNN\n\nWriting this article has taught me a lot more about EDS: It’s been upsetting to report on the terrible experiences some have suffered, but I’ve been awestruck by the dedication of people, many with the condition themselves, who are working to find solutions.\n\nI don’t know what the future holds for Poppy. Some patients’ symptoms improve with age; others experience an increase in pain and a loss of mobility. I’ve learned there’s a limit to what we can control but there’s a lot we can do, to tackle symptoms and make life easier. And I believe that change is coming.\n\nWith a better understanding of the condition and diagnostic tools on the horizon, my biggest hope is that there will be a cure one day – and that it will come in time for Poppy.", "authors": ["Sarah Lazarus"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/01/31/delaware-state-students-arent-done-so-whats-next-for-campus-safety/69843585007/", "title": "Delaware State students aren't done.

It’s weighing on imports and exports, sapping investment and contributing to labor shortages. All this has exacerbated Britain’s inflation problem, hurting workers and the business community.\n\n“The most plausible reason as to why Britain is doing comparatively worse than comparable countries is Brexit,” according to L. Alan Winters, co-director of the Centre for Inclusive Trade Policy at the University of Sussex.\n\nThe sense of gloom hanging over the UK economy is captured by striking workers, who are walking out in ever larger numbers over pay and conditions as the worst inflation in decades eats into their wages. At the same time, the government is cutting spending and hiking taxes to fill the hole in its budget.\n\nWhile Brexit isn’t the cause of Britain’s cost-of-living crisis, it has made the problem more difficult to solve.\n\n“The UK chose Brexit in a referendum, but the government then chose a particularly hard form of Brexit, which maximized the economic cost,” said Michael Saunders, a senior adviser at Oxford Economics and former Bank of England official. “Any hope for economic upside from Brexit is pretty much gone.”\n\nNHS nurses strike over pay outside St Thomas' Hospital in London on December 20, 2022. Maja Smiejkowska/Reuters\n\nBusinesses count the cost\n\nAlthough Britain voted to leave the European Union in June 2016, its exit from the single market and customs union was finalized only on December 24, 2020, when the two sides finally agreed a free trade deal.\n\nThe Brexit deal, known as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, came into effect on January 1, 2021.\n\nIt eliminated tariffs on most goods but introduced a raft of non-tariff barriers, such as border controls, customs checks, import duties and health inspections on plant and animal products.\n\nBefore Brexit, a farmer in Kent could ship a truckload of potatoes to Paris just as easily as they might send it to London. Those days are no more.\n\n“We hear stories every single day from small businesses about the nightmare of forms, transportation, couriers, things getting stuck for weeks at a time… the epic length of the problems is just gobsmacking,” said Michelle Ovens, the founder of Small Business Britain, a campaign group.\n\n“The way things have panned out in the last two years has been really bad for small businesses,” Ovens told CNN.\n\nResearchers at the London School of Economics estimate that the variety of UK products exported to the European Union declined by 30% during the first year of Brexit. They said that this was likely because small exporters had exited small EU markets.\n\nTake the example of Little Star, a UK company that makes jewelry for children. Its business took off in the Netherlands and it had plans to expand to France and Germany next. But since Brexit, only two of more than 30 of its Dutch customers are prepared to handle the costs and paperwork to obtain stock from the company.\n\nProducts that took two days to ship are now taking three weeks, while import duties and sales taxes have made it much harder to compete with European jewelers, according to Rob Walker, who co-founded the business with his wife, Vicky, in 2017. The company is now looking to the United States for growth opportunities.\n\n“Isn’t it mad that we have to look to the other side of the Atlantic to do business, because it’s so difficult to do business with people 30 miles away?” Walker said.\n\nA truck passes a Union Jack, at the Port of Dover on April 1, 2021. The UK government has delayed post-Brexit checks on EU food imports until the end of 2023. Chris Ratcliffe/Bloomberg/Getty Images\n\nA British Chambers of Commerce survey of more than 1,168 businesses published this month reported that 77% said Brexit has not helped them increase sales or grow their businesses. More than half said they were finding it difficult to adapt to the new rules for trading goods.\n\nSiteright Construction Supplies, a manufacturer in Dorset, told the Chamber that importing parts from the European Union to fix broken machines has become a costly and “time-consuming nightmare.”\n\n“Brexit has been the biggest-ever imposition of bureaucracy on business,” according to Siteright.\n\nNova Dog Chews, a producer of snacks for canines, said it would have lost all its EU trade had it not set up a base in the bloc. “This has cost our business a huge amount of money, which could have been invested in the UK had it not been for Brexit,” it added.\n\nA UK government spokesperson told CNN that the government’s export support service has provided exporters with “practical support” on the implementation of the Brexit deal. The deal is “the world’s largest zero tariff, zero quota free trade deal,” the spokesperson added. “It secures the UK market access across key service sectors and opens new opportunities for UK businesses across the globe.”\n\nPermanent damage to trade\n\nBritain won’t easily replace what it has lost by forfeiting unfettered access to the world’s largest trading bloc.\n\nThe only substantive new trade deals it has struck since exiting the European Union, which did not simply roll over the deals it had as an EU member, have been with Australia and New Zealand. By the government’s own estimate, these will have a negligible impact on the UK economy, increasing GDP in the long run by just 0.1% and 0.03% respectively.\n\nBy contrast, the UK Office for Budget Responsibility, which produces economic forecasts for the government, expects Brexit to reduce Britain’s output by 4% over 15 years compared to remaining in the bloc. Exports and imports are projected to be around 15% lower in the long run.\n\nInitial data has borne this out. According to the OBR, in the fourth quarter of 2021, UK goods export volumes to the European Union were 9% below 2019 levels, with imports from the European Union 18% lower. Goods exports to non-EU countries were 18% weaker than in 2019.\n\nThe United Kingdom “appears to have become a less trade-intensive economy, with trade as a share of GDP falling 12% since 2019, two and a half times more than in any other G7 country,” the OBR said in the March report.\n\nThe decline in exports to non-EU countries could be a sign that UK businesses have become less competitive as they battle higher supply chain costs following Brexit, according to Jun Du, an economics professor at Aston University in Birmingham.\n\n“The UK’s trading ability has been damaged permanently [by Brexit],” Du told CNN. “It doesn’t mean it can’t recover, but it’s been set back for a number of years.”\n\nResearch by the Centre for European Reform, a think tank, estimates that over the 18 months to June 2022, UK goods trade is 7% lower than it would have been had Britain remained in the European Union.\n\nInvestment is 11% weaker and GDP is 5.5% smaller than it would have been, costing the economy £40 billion ($48.4 billion) in tax revenues annually. That’s enough to pay for three quarters of the spending cuts and tax rises that UK finance minister Jeremy Hunt announced in November.\n\nA heavy economic toll\n\nThe United Kingdom is projected to have one of the worst performing economies next year among developed nations.\n\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development expects the UK economy to shrink by 0.4%, ahead only of sanctioned Russia. GDP in Germany is forecast to be 0.3% smaller.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund forecasts growth of just 0.3% for UK GDP next year, ahead of only Germany, Italy and Russia, which are expected to contract.\n\nBoth institutions say high inflation and rising interest rates will weigh on spending by consumers and businesses in Britain.\n\nAccording to the Confederation of British Industry, a leading business group, the fall in private sector activity picked up pace in December and has now declined for five consecutive quarters.\n\nThe downward trend “looks set to deepen” in 2023, principal economist at the CBI Martin Sartorius said in a statement.\n\n“Businesses continue to face a number of headwinds, with rising costs, labor shortages, and weakening demand contributing to a gloomy outlook for next year. ”\n\n— Julia Horowitz contributed to this report.", "authors": ["Hanna Ziady"], "publish_date": "2022/12/24"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/09/14/us/power-outages-rising-extreme-weather-climate/index.html", "title": "Power outages have spiked in the past 10 years. Here's what's to ...", "text": "CNN —\n\nPower outages in the US are climbing, researchers reported Wednesday, as extreme weather gets worse due to the climate crisis, the demand for electricity climbs and the country’s energy infrastructure gets older and more vulnerable.\n\nThe analysis from Climate Central, a nonprofit research group, revealed that from 2000 to 2021, 83% of all reported power outages were caused by a weather-related event, from drought-fueled wildfires to damaging storms such as tornadoes and hurricanes – many of which will only intensify as the climate warms.\n\nAnd those numbers are on an upward trend. Researchers reported that outages in the past 10 years had increased by 64% compared with the previous decade.\n\n“This is really something that we should be concerned about because this is affecting all of us and we’re seeing more of them,” Kaitlyn Trudeau, data analyst with Climate Central who worked on the report, told CNN.\n\n“The system we have right now was not built in a time and climate we’re experiencing now,” she added. “It is not prepared for the climate that we have now, and the climate we’re going to see in the future.”\n\nUsing federal data provided by utility companies and the North American Electric Reliability Corp., researchers found more than 1,500 cases of extreme weather-related power outages since 2000, including those caused by high wind; heavy rain and thunderstorms; winter weather, including snow, ice and freezing rain; hurricanes; extreme heat and wildfires. Climate researchers have noted many of these phenomena are becoming more intense and more frequent as global temperatures rise.\n\nClimate Central\n\nClimate Central found that Texas reported the largest number of weather-related outages since 2000, followed by Michigan, California, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania.\n\nThe winter storm and cold snap of February 2021, for example, was the costliest winter weather event on record, resulting in multiple days with below-freezing temperatures that led to several days of power outages for millions of customers in Texas. Nearly 10 million people across the South did not have power at the peak of the outages, according to government figures.\n\nThen in May, a heatwave knocked six natural-gas power plants offline in Texas. The state’s grid operator asked residents to limit electricity use, keeping thermostats at 78 degrees or higher and avoid using large, power-sucking appliances during peak times.\n\nTexas utilities reported around 80 weather-related outages between 2019 and 2021 alone – about 44% of Texas’s total since 2000. Severe weather, winter storms and hurricanes caused a majority of the outages. The report also noted that the state operates its own grid independently from the countries two main grids, which makes it challenging to draw power from elsewhere during disaster events.\n\nIn California, researchers documented 44 weather-related outages between 2019 and 2021 – more than a third of the state’s total since 2000. And, they said, wildfires are a growing threat to stable electricity there. Utilities in California are required to implement public safety power shutoffs to reduce risks of equipment flaring during extreme wildfire days. At least 14 of the state’s 44 outages during that time were due to these preemptive shutdowns.\n\nClimate Central\n\nRomany Webb, a researcher at Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said US utility companies need to account for the changing climate — evaluating whether existing stations are located in areas at risk of flooding, how severe droughts may affect the power plant operations, or how power lines might be impacted by increasing temperatures.\n\n“For many, the findings won’t come as a surprise because, all across the United States, people are already directly experiencing climate change-related disruptions to electricity and other services,” said Webb, who was not involved with the report. “As we’ve seen in recent years, those disruptions can have deadly consequences. Things will only get worse if we don’t take action.”\n\nSteven Weissman, an emeritus lecturer at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in energy law and policy, said that he would like to see the analysis expand to focus on all aspects of grid operation — and not just the transmission system — as the world looks into cleaner energy sources.\n\n“As we move more toward these intermittent sources of energy like solar and wind, we need to shift to an era where we predict supply and then manage demand, sort of flip it upside down,” Weissman, who was not involved in the report, told CNN. “And how do you manage demand? Well, you set prices that are going to encourage people to use power off-peak. You can also encourage people to have smart appliances that would not have to take power from the grid when demand is highest.”\n\nFirefighters spray water on trees during the Dixie Fire, which was caused by damage to power lines, in August 2021 near Janesville, California. Patrick T. Fallon/AFP/Getty Images\n\nTrudeau said the US needs to create a more resilient and reliable power system to prevent power outages as climate change advances. Building microgrids — small, renewable-powered networks that act as backups for the primary electricity grid, in the event of a major power outage — for example, can help residents weather power outages while also reducing emissions from power generation.\n\nWhen Hurricane Sandy brought heavy rain, strong winds and flooding to Northeast in 2012 and caused significant damage to electrical infrastructure, for instance, microgrids helped residents weather the storm. At the time, 21 states along the East Coast experienced widespread power outages.\n\nShe also said states must invest in smart grid technologies as well as harden the grid to withstand severe storm damages, while also providing customers incentives to reduce energy overuse during peak times.\n\nDespite the uptick in extreme weather, Webb said utilities still haven’t thought ahead.\n\n“Unfortunately, many electric utilities and system operators still aren’t engaging in this sort of planning, and have instead chosen to ignore the reality of climate change,” Webb said. “It is, though, quickly becoming impossible to ignore. The sooner action is taken, the better off we will all be.”\n\nUntil the US makes large-scale investments and pushes to create a more reliable and resilient power grid, the climate crisis will likely lead to more outages and force grid operators to encourage the public to cut electricity use when supply is unable to meet demand, according to Trudeau.\n\n“There is no magic wand that we can wave right now,” Trudeau said. “But ultimately the things that we can focus on are things like cutting our emissions, because it’s the most meaningful action to slow down the rate of warming and the mounting stress on our power grid and really allow us more time to adapt to our changing climate.”", "authors": ["Rachel Ramirez"], "publish_date": "2022/09/14"}, {"url": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/31/health/rainbow-fentanyl-halloween-candy-scare-wellness-partner/index.html", "title": "Is 'rainbow fentanyl' candy just another scary Halloween rumor? | CNN", "text": "Editor’s Note: The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation.\n\nThe Conversation —\n\nEvery year around the middle of October, reporters start contacting me wanting to talk about rumors of contaminated Halloween treats.\n\nThat’s because I track media coverage of reported incidents of trick-or-treaters receiving razor blades in apples or pins and poison in candy bars. My data goes back to 1958, and my principal finding is simple: I can’t find any evidence that any child has ever been killed or seriously injured by a contaminated treat picked up in the course of trick-or-treating.\n\nREAD MORE: A brief history of poisoned Halloween candy panic\n\nThis often surprises people who assume that Halloween sadism is both very real and very common.\n\nStories about contaminated treats are best understood as contemporary legends. They’re tales we’ve all heard, that we’ve been assured are true. They warn that we live in a dangerous world filled with villainous strangers who could harm us if we aren’t careful.\n\nThis year, reporters began reaching out earlier than usual, in late September, and they wanted to talk about a new alleged threat: “rainbow fentanyl.”\n\nKids are next\n\nFentanyl is a very powerful synthetic opioid that has caused thousands of overdoses and deaths over the past two decades. In August 2022, drug enforcement authorities noted that pills containing fentanyl were being manufactured in various colors.\n\nDEA Administrator Anne Milgram said, “Rainbow fentanyl – fentanyl pills and powder that come in a variety of bright colors, shapes and sizes – is a deliberate effort by drug traffickers to drive addiction amongst kids and young adults.”\n\nMany news outlets covered this story, including the notion that the colors might be some sort of marketing ploy to attract younger drug users. But then some people started connecting rainbow fentanyl to Halloween.\n\nREAD MORE: Vampire myths originated with a real blood disorder\n\nInterviewed on Fox News on Sept. 20, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel declared, “Every mom in the country is worried, what if this gets into my kid’s Halloween basket?” Other Fox commentators suggested that parents might want to protect their children by not letting them go trick-or-treating this year. And, to prove the bipartisan appeal of protecting children, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, repeated the warnings.\n\nIt’s worth considering what’s familiar and what’s new about these warnings.\n\nOne fairly standard element is commentators’ readiness to link September crime news to the possibility that it might presage what could happen on Halloween.\n\nIn 1982 there was a spate of Tylenol poisonings – seven people died after purchasing and consuming tampered packages of pills. Many commentators then warned that parents needed to be extra vigilant when examining Halloween treats. Those deaths also led to a dramatic increase in protective packaging for all sorts of products to discourage tampering.\n\nSimilarly, the 9/11 terrorist attacks led to rumors about Halloween 2001 threats – that there were plans to attack a mall where some parents let their children go trick-or-treating, or that terrorists had purchased massive amounts of candy, presumably so they could poison the treats before distributing them.\n\nREAD MORE: From Black Death to Covid-19, pandemics have always pushed people to honor death and celebrate life\n\nTrends in recreational or illicit drug use often make the jump to Halloween warnings. In 2014, the year that Colorado first allowed state-licensed retail sales of recreational marijuana, the Denver Police Department posted online warnings that parents ought to keep an eye out for THC-laced edible candies in Halloween treats. Yet after Halloween had passed, a department spokesperson admitted, “We are not aware of any cases of children ingesting marijuana candy during Halloween season.”\n\nSimilarly, in 2019, September reports of deaths caused by vaping black-market THC-infused cartridges were coupled with news that Pennsylvania authorities had confiscated commercial THC candies – supposedly smuggled from a state where they could be purchased legally – to generate another round of Halloween warnings.\n\nThe irrationality of it all\n\nOne obvious hole in these concerns is that drugs tend to cost more than candy – marijuana edibles, for example, run somewhere in the neighborhood of a dollar or two per dose or more.\n\nFentanyl is considerably more expensive. It is not unreasonable to wonder just what a fentanyl dealer’s overarching goal might be if in passing the drug off as candy. The suggestion that a school-age kid would go from accidental user of fentanyl to a paying addict is far-fetched.\n\nOf course, the villains in contemporary legends aren’t expected to behave rationally. Ask why gang members would attempt to kill motorists who blink their headlights at them – an urban legend from the 1980s – and the response is likely to be, “That’s just the sort of thing those sadistic people do.”\n\nIt might not make any sense for someone to give a brightly colored opioid pill or THC-infused candy to a small child, but it isn’t impossible, is it? Such reasoning is thought to justify ringing the alarm bells.\n\nREAD MORE: How the ancient world’s scented sorceresses influence ideas about magic today\n\nOften there is a kernel of truth to these fears. Certainly fentanyl is a dangerous drug. But American history can be read as a long line of fears about witches, immigrants, drugs, conspirators and so on. These fears emerge as reflections of current social changes. Yes, things are always changing, and this can always frighten some people. But it is also true that, in retrospect, these fears are usually exaggerated.\n\nWhat seems new about describing rainbow fentanyl as a Halloween danger is the willingness of important political figures and news media outlets to spread the warnings. Most past claims about Halloween sadism lack such prominent spokespeople.\n\nBut in a time when many news outlets seem intent on maintaining their audiences by frightening them, and increased political polarization seems to stall efforts to devise workable social policies, calls for protecting our children from the threats of boogeyman drug dealers return us to the spirit of Halloween: offering up fresh ways to keep people scared.", "authors": ["Joel Best"], "publish_date": "2022/10/31"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2023/06/12/who-is-running-for-office-in-delaware-elections-2024/70302805007/", "title": "Delaware 2024 election: Who is running for office?", "text": "Elections are months away, but statewide and local races are already heating up across Delaware.\n\nBefore U.S. Sen.

No gas stoves or ovens.\n\nOther progressive cities followed suit with similar bans. San Francisco passed its own ban in 2020. New York City became the largest US city to pass a version in 2021, with New York Gov. Kathy Hochul vowing to pass a statewide law that would ban natural gas by 2027.\n\nBut other municipalities looking to take similar action are running into a brick wall. Twenty states with GOP-controlled legislatures have passed so-called “preemption laws” that prohibit cities from banning natural gas.\n\nIt’s bad news for municipal climate action: Taking natural gas out of the equation and switching to electric appliances is one of the most effective ways cities can tackle the climate crisis and lower their emissions, multiple experts told CNN.\n\n“Natural gas bans are kind of low-hanging fruit,” said Georgetown Law professor Sheila Foster, an environmental law expert. Foster said cities can make a significant impact by moving away from natural gas and toward electricity, especially considering what little federal action there’s been on climate, and the mixed record of states.\n\nThe climate stakes are high. Residential and commercial emissions made up 13% of total US emissions in 2019, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. About 80% of those emissions came from the combustion of natural gas, the fuel that heats homes or powers a restaurant’s cooking stoves, and emits planet-warming gases like methane and carbon dioxide in the process.\n\nBut clean alternatives exist: Electric heat pumps can heat homes more sustainably than gas furnaces; induction ranges can replace gas stoves. And experts stress that to fully transition to renewable energy sources like solar and wind, homes and businesses need to operate on electricity – not gas.\n\nPresident Joe Biden’s Build Back Better bill, which fizzled in the Senate after objections from Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, contained billions in tax incentives to help consumers switch to cleaner ways of heating their homes. But people who own and rent homes in big, multi-unit buildings depend on developers and city planners to make the switch.\n\nAdvocates worry these preemptive bills could stall impactful climate action at a critical time.\n\n“We’re afraid that’s going to have a chilling effect on cities that want to take action,” said Alejandra Mejia Cunningham, a building decarbonization advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “Many cities and towns have small staffs, they don’t want to be taken to court, being seen as going outside state law.”\n\nA ‘new trend’\n\nIn November, a GOP bill to block natural gas bans in new buildings was passed in North Carolina but ultimately failed to make it into law when Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it. Two more similar bills are being considered in Pennsylvania and Michigan this year.\n\n“To me that’s what’s interesting about this new trend, it seems like states are trying to eliminate the possibility before cities try to catch onto this,” Sarah Fox, an associate law professor at Northern Illinois University School of Law, told CNN. “The natural gas industry realized this was in the water a while ago and has been very aggressive in getting this passed.”\n\nThe American Gas Association, the natural gas industry’s powerful trade group, told CNN it lobbies at the federal level but isn’t directly lobbying in any state.\n\nBut many of the association’s members, including gas utilities, have gotten involved at the state level, according to an analysis by independent climate think tank InfluenceMap for CNN.\n\nInfluenceMap “found high levels of engagement on preemption bills within the power sector, including its key trade associations.” The American Gas Association and its members “appears to have played an early role encouraging these bills,” according to the analysis.\n\nThere’s also evidence that suggests the AGA is running the playbook for its members to lobby state lawmakers for the preemptive laws.\n\nIn audio of a private AGA call obtained by watchdog group Energy and Policy Institute and shared with CNN, the AGA’s Vice President of Advocacy and Outreach Sue Forrester discussed the group’s strategy modeling “preemptive legislation” in certain states.\n\n“We launched in partnership with Southwest [Gas]. Well, they launched it, but we were helping on the back end: Energy choice language in Arizona that was passed and signed by the governor at the beginning of the year,” Forrester said in the recording.\n\nWhen asked about Forrester’s comments, an American Gas Association spokesperson reiterated the trade association doesn’t get involved in state-level legislation.\n\n“Sue’s comments make it sound that way, and that’s unfortunate, but the American Gas Association is not set up with lobbyists on the ground in the states,” the spokesperson said, adding the “we” Forrester was referring to is “we as the industry and all who have an interest in gas.”\n\nCEO of the American Gas Association Karen Harbert told CNN in a statement that “AGA is educating policymakers at every level about the supportive policy frameworks necessary for natural gas and our infrastructure to help achieve our nation’s ambitious environmental goals.”\n\nWhile the AGA and other industry groups are messaging that they are advocating for more fuel choices for consumers, climate advocates say the preemption laws are having the opposite effect.\n\n“I’d say the industry has put decades of effort and resources into fine tuning their messaging to the American public – and they do it well,” NRDC’s Mejia Cunningham told CNN.\n\nSome cities in the US want to ban natural gas hookups in new homes and buildings, to reduce their fossil fuel emissions and meet their climate targets. Natural gas is primarly made of methane, an extremely potent planet-warming gas. Rosmarie Wirz/Moment RF/Getty Images\n\nMost cities and towns in the US that are pursuing natural gas reforms are not shooting for stringent bans like what Berkeley passed – many are trying to find a middle ground that incorporate and encourage electrification and heat pumps as an alternative to gas.\n\nBroadly written state laws can discourage that transition, Mejia Cunningham said.\n\n“We don’t expect Berkeley to be the right model for most of America,” she said. “That doesn’t mean we should completely slash out a whole bucket of policies that could work for communities across America.”\n\nAn attempt to electrify gets quashed\n\nIn 2019, officials in Flagstaff, Arizona, were working on their city’s plan to get to net-zero emissions by 2030. Building emissions were an obvious target; the built environment is the largest contributor to Flagstaff’s greenhouse gas emissions, Nicole Antonopoulos, Flagstaff’s sustainability director, told CNN.\n\nFlagstaff’s plan didn’t include an explicit ban on natural gas; instead, it said the city would promote “aggressive building electrification,” thereby decreasing reliance on fossil fuels.\n\nThat was still enough to get the attention of members of the Republican-controlled Arizona state legislature, which in 2020 passed a bill preventing cities and towns from passing their own natural gas bans.\n\n“It was a huge setback, in a nutshell,” Antonopoulos told CNN. “The state preemption threw a huge kink in our efforts towards carbon neutrality. This isn’t the first time the state has preempted things that have made us go back to the proverbial drawing table and figure out how we get creative and innovative in a space where we don’t have funding.”\n\nArizona’s 2020 law – the first natural gas preemption law of its kind – was a harbinger of what was to come. Since then, 19 other states have adopted them. These laws have largely been concentrated in red states in the Rust Belt and Southwest, a cluster of southwestern states including Utah and Wyoming, and New Hampshire.\n\nAnd currently, there’s not much favoring cities’ ability to sue states. The 1907 US Supreme Court case Hunter v. Pittsburgh favored states’ authority to craft laws for their cities, and gave cities little legal recourse to sue.\n\n“It’s not a very coherent line of case law, but that’s the official stance,” said Fox, who added she’d be very surprised if the current conservative Supreme Court majority allowed a challenge to the current law from progressive cities.\n\n“There’s a lot of legal uncertainty,” Foster said, adding that there’s not much current litigation to speak of around natural gas bans and preemption laws.\n\nIn Flagstaff, Antonopoulos said her office is trying to find ways around Arizona’s law.

None of the former leaders responded to requests for comment.\n\nBoard Chairman John Cochran declined an interview request.\n\nIn a statement, the retired Bank of America executive said there is \"no one-size-fits-all\" approach to contract negotiations.\n\n\"Employment packages often involve a mix that includes deferred compensation, retirement contributions, and items such as bonuses earned in one year that may be paid out over multiple years,\" he wrote.\n\nTaken together, such line items represent the full value of an executive's compensation, which is rarely reported, in total, to the public, according to George Mason University public policy scholar James Finkelstein, who has reviewed hundreds of university president contracts.\n\n\"We call it the CEO-ization of university leadership,\" he said.\n\nState. Sen. John Kowalko called UD's compensation packages \"excessive.\"\n\nFor years, the Newark Democrat has rallied unsuccessfully to open up the state's land-grant universities to increased public scrutiny.\n\n\"Until you let the public see how you're doing these things, you are and you should be suspected,\" he said.\n\nUD is slated to receive about $120 million from the state this fiscal year, about 11 percent of the university's total budget. The university is not obligated to publicly disclose the details of its executive compensation packages other than what it reports to the IRS.\n\nThe Delaware General Assembly considers UD, like Delaware State University, a quasi-public agency, which means most of its records are off-limits to the public.\n\nUD President Dennis Assanis, for instance, took over in 2016, but the university won't release his base salary or total compensation package.\n\nState Sen. Greg Lavelle has consistently voted against broadening public access to UD records and meetings.\n\nThe university \"is not a state agency in the true sense of the word,\" the Sharpley Republican said recently, noting that taxpayers finance a small portion of UD's billion-dollar budget.\n\nLavelle and his wife, Ruth, work as managing directors for Puglisi & Associates, a Newark accounting firm founded by UD Trustee Don Puglisi. The senator said his votes are unrelated to his employment, which predates Puglisi's time on the board.\n\nAsked about UD's payouts to former top executives, Lavelle wrote in a statement: \"I'm concerned about the increasing cost of higher education across the country. I think all universities should manage all of their expenses.\"\n\nLieutenant Governor Bethany Hall-Long, a former state senator and representative, works as a nursing professor at UD.\n\nTo determine how much money the university paid former administrators, The News Journal pieced together the information from the university's Form 990s, which tax-exempt organizations file annually with the IRS.\n\nAmong the findings:\n\n• Before stepping down in July of 2007, former University President David Roselle earned about $875,000 a year, making him the highest-paid public university president in the nation. Post-UD, Roselle has received nearly $1.9 million. This is in addition to the more than $2.45 million he earned during his final year at the helm, according to IRS records.\n\n• K.C. Keeler, who during the Great Recession was granted a 10-year contract extension to stay on as head football coach through the 2017 season, was fired in January of 2013. Keeler, who earned a salary of more than $300,000, received nearly $2 million from UD in 2013, despite working for roughly one week that year, IRS forms show.\n\n• Former President Patrick Harker, who left UD midway through 2015 to lead the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, earned nearly $817,000 that year, or about 86 percent of his compensation the previous year. For six months of 2015, Harker was also employed by the Fed. His salary at the central bank has not been disclosed; his predecessor, Charles Plosser, earned $350,000.\n\nIt's not certain if Harker or other recently departed UD executives are due more payments from the university; UD won't file its form 990 for fiscal year 2017 until next year.\n\nFormer Provost Domenico Grasso, who resigned in October from a $641,000-a-year position for what he called personal reasons, is now on a one-year paid administrative leave.\n\nAfter that, Grasso plans to return to UD to develop a program in engineering and environmental policy.\n\nReached by phone recently, the former chief academic officer likened the leave to a faculty sabbatical.\n\n\"I took a sabbatical back in 1996 and I have worked constantly,\" Grasso said, before rushing off the phone.\n\nUD Vice President for Finance and Deputy Treasurer Greg Oler signs UD's 990 forms, but would not comment on the compensation portion.\n\n\"Attracting and retaining the best talent is vital in helping our University and students thrive and grow,\" he said in a statement.\n\nPrivate dollars, not taxpayer funds, are used to pay executive compensation at UD, according to university spokeswoman Andrea Boyle. University leaders receiving post-employment payouts earned that money while they were still working at UD under the terms of their contracts, she said. State law doesn't cap how much top administrators can receive.\n\nThe Board of Trustees' special compensation committee, whose meetings aren't open to the public, sets compensation packages for key executives.\n\nThe committee relies on benchmark data from peer institutions and a third-party consultant who reviews proposed compensation for \"reasonableness,\" Boyle said. The IRS recommends a similar process to determine \"reasonable compensation\" at private universities, according to its website.\n\nUD trustee Joan Coker, a Wilmington doctor who has served on the board for three years, said the full board is not privy to executive contract negotiations. She declined to name the members of the compensation committee.\n\n\"Literally, this is the first time I've heard this,\" she said of the university's post-employment payouts.\n\nParting gifts common\n\nNationwide, universities like UD dangle exit perks to recruit the best and brightest managers, according to research by Finkelstein and his colleague, Judith Wilde, chief operating officer of George Mason's Schar School of Policy and Government.\n\nIn evaluating more than 100 employment contracts for university presidents, the pair found that 40 percent contained deferred compensation clauses, allowing executives to delay receiving a portion of their income, such as retirement benefits, until after they enter a lower tax bracket. The value of such arrangements ranges from $17,000 to $500,000, according to the study by Finkelstein and Wilde.\n\nSeventy percent of contracts gave university presidents a direct pipeline to tenured faculty positions, recouping most of their previous salaries even if they don't teach any classes, according to the researchers.\n\nNearly half of the contracts guaranteed presidents a year-long sabbatical at their full presidential salaries, while 13 percent offered contract completion bonuses of $50,000 to $1 million – unless the presidents were fired for cause, such as in cases of embezzlement or sexual harassment.\n\nEven when presidents are fired, they emerge as winners in severance agreements that protect colleges and universities from costly litigation. Last summer, for instance, outgoing Northern Illinois University President Doug Baker received a $700,000 package in a closed-door meeting with university trustees, after a state investigation detailed his mismanagement of the university.\n\nGolden parachute clauses written into university president contracts have been around for decades, just as private CEOs and college coaches continue to earn eye-popping rewards. Over the years, the perks have filtered down to other high-ranking university administrators like provosts and finance chiefs, Wilde said.\n\nMembers of the business elite, who populate university boards, are comfortable paying top dollar for talent to compete with private universities and the corporate sector. To that end, they sweeten contracts with allowances for housing, cars, entertainment and country club memberships, along with generous payments for unused sabbaticals and sick time that aren't available to faculty and other staff.\n\n\"If you add in all the extras, the contract could be twice [the base salary] or more,\" Wilde said.\n\nThe public City University of New York system, for instance, paid $19,500 a month to house its Chancellor James Milliken on the Upper East Side as part of his annual $670,000 compensation package. Milliken's rent in 2015 was roughly on par with an adjunct instructor's annual salary in the university system.\n\nOn the opposite coast, California has cracked down on executive compensation at public universities. In 2012, public outcry prompted the Board of Trustees of the California State University system to cap pay raises for new presidents at no more than 10 percent of their predecessor's earnings.\n\nIn 2015, the trustees barred the university system, which receives billions of dollars annually from taxpayers, from financing executive pay with foundation funds. The move came after a state audit revealed that university executives' salaries and benefits were significantly higher than those awarded to state employees with similar job functions.\n\nBut reining in executive compensation has real consequences, according to Raymond Cotton, a Washington, D.C.-based attorney who has negotiated compensation packages for hundreds of university presidents.\n\nIn an interview earlier this year, Cotton insisted that executive benefits prevent star academic talent from going elsewhere.\n\n\"In the business world, those people who bring substantial benefit get substantial pay,\" he said.\n\nCollege and university presidents have far-reaching responsibilities, including essential fundraising tasks. They also work in tumultuous, highly politicized environments. On average, chief executives at S&P 500 companies remain in their positions a decade or more, but university presidents typically leave before 7 years, according to a recent study by the American Council on Education.\n\nIRS records show that UD is not the only Delaware university to handsomely reward executives on their way out.\n\nSTORY: At Wilmington University, it's all in the family\n\nSTORY: University of Delaware Provost steps down for personal reasons\n\nThe last time the Chronicle of Higher Education published data on the highest-paid private university presidents for 2014, then-Wilmington University President Jack Varsalona led the pack with his more than $5.4 million compensation package. The bulk of that amount came from a one-time retirement bonus that Varsalona received after more than 25 years of service at the commuter school.\n\nMichael Townsley, Wilmington University's former senior vice president and chief financial officer, stopped working for the university in fiscal year 2002, but received more than $911,000 three years later as part of a supplemental retention and retirement plan, IRS forms show. Former Provost Betty Caffo, who retired in 2011, received more than $2.2 million the following calendar year, including $2 million in \"other compensation.\"\n\nLike UD, Wilmington University has declined to discuss its employment contracts.\n\nAt Goldey-Beacom College, which counts fewer than 3,000 students, former president Mohammad Ilyas earned nearly $1 million in retirement bonuses in 2015, bringing his total compensation that year to nearly $1.5 million.\n\nIlyas retired from the Wilmington college on June 30, 2015, but his compensation that year included accumulated sick time dating to 1975, Goldey-Beacom Executive Vice President Kristine Santomauro said. Goldey-Beacom's board of trustees has since nixed that policy and no longer automatically offers senior managers deferred compensation plans, she said.\n\nSantomauro declined to release current president Gary Wirt's contract, explaining that Goldey-Beacom is a private institution.\n\nDespite the secrecy surrounding lucrative top administrator contracts, universities aren't internationally trying to deceive the public, according to Finkelstein, the researcher. Federal tax forms \"only require you to report what an individual received in that year.\"\n\n\"The public isn't asking the right questions,\" he said.\n\nWhose legacy?\n\nRoselle, a mathematician credited with ushering in a renaissance at UD, also earned substantially more money than his predecessors.\n\nPast president E.A. Trabant, who served for more than two decades beginning in 1968, earned less than $121,000 in his final year, according to a 1991 News Journal article. Trabant's successor, Russel Jones, who served for less than two years, earned a nearly $138,000 salary. Following Jones, Trabant took over briefly before Roselle came on board.\n\nA former University of Kentucky president, Roselle was known as a soft-spoken straight-shooter who was fiercely protective of UD's national reputation. His name now graces the university's performing arts venue.\n\nWhile Roselle's $875,000 compensation package outshone those of presidents at institutions twice UD's size, he was praised for transforming the university into a respected and financially secure institution over his 17 years at the helm.\n\nRoselle nearly quadrupled the university's endowment to $1.2 billion, shepherded the construction or renovation of about two dozen buildings, and boosted endowed faculty positions, student study abroad opportunities and student aid programs.\n\nWhen Roselle retired in 2007, the university senior administration counted one provost, one executive vice president and six vice presidents at a cost of nearly $2.5 million, according to IRS forms.\n\nWhen Harker stepped down eight years later, UD had one provost, one deputy provost, one vice provost for research, one executive vice president and nine vice presidents at a cost of nearly $4.7 million.\n\nFormer UD employees said spiraling executive compensation under the Harker administration has dragged down the university since the recession, forcing UD to consolidate departments amid state budget cuts. In 1991, Delaware paid 24 percent of UD's budget, compared to half that percentage today.\n\nIn 2011, Harker, a former dean of the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, asked the General Assembly to give UD more flexibility to spend state funds. He also sounded the alarm on layoffs.\n\n\"We have to put everything on the table right now,\" Harker told legislators at the time. \"If someone retires, will we fill that position? That's something we have to think about.\"\n\nFour years later, UD eliminated Joseph Filippone's job and four others in the Facilities Planning and Construction department after the department merged with the university architect's office.\n\nHarker \"ran the university like a business,\" according to Filippone, who said he earned a $47,000 salary working as a computer design technician. After 14 years of service, Filippone received nearly $8,000 upon his exit, which consisted of one month's salary and one month's worth of unused vacation time.\n\nAnother former employee, who requested anonymity, said she lost her job in 2008, along with 10 others in her division over the next two years, after the university's publications department merged with the public relations office.\n\n\"Everybody just got to the point that they were keeping their head down and crossing their fingers that they weren't on the list,\" the employee said.\n\nThrough a Fed spokeswoman, Harker declined an interview for this story, referring all questions to UD. During his tenure in a tough economy, he increased student diversity, built new residence halls and laid the foundation for the STAR (Science, Technology & Research) Campus on the site of the former Newark Chrysler plant.\n\nIn 2014, in addition to receiving more than $950,000 in salary and benefits from UD and its affiliates, Harker earned more than $500,000 serving on the boards at chemicals group Huntsman Corp. and power utility Pepco Holdings Inc., according to a Bloomberg News report.\n\nBoyle, the university spokeswoman, said she could not discuss layoffs in individual departments. UD may merge operations to \"reduce redundancy\" and boost efficiency in an effort to \"keep tuition cost at a reasonable level for our students,\" she said. The university counted more than 4,300 employees last year, an eight percent increase from 2007, according to UD statistics.\n\nFull-time faculty members at UD receive salaries and benefits above the national average, according to data from the American Association of University Professors (AAUP). Full professors, for instance, earn about $149,000 a year, while instructor-level faculty earn $72,000. The AAUP did not include data from part-time faculty members, the largest segment of the academic labor force.\n\nUD surpasses the national average in another area: Tuition and fees. In-state students pay $13,160, not including room and board, according to College Board data. Out-of-state students pay $33,150.\n\nOver the past decade, in-state tuition and fees at UD have increased by 61 percent, which is in line with the national average. Out-of-state students, however, saw a 71 percent increase, significantly higher than the national average. More than 60 percent of undergraduates at the Newark campus come from out of state.\n\nLast month, UD announced \"Delaware First,\" the largest-ever fundraising campaign in the centuries-old institution's history.\n\nThe $750 million fund drive will support student scholarships, endowed professorships, graduate fellowships, a $60 million transformation of the Delaware Stadium and a new building to house UD's public policy school and the Biden Institute, a domestic research and policy think tank.\n\nIn announcing the campaign, Assanis said that while the university appreciates its state funding and tuition dollars, it needs more money to make a difference globally.\n\n\"This is all about taking the University of Delaware to the next level,\" he said.\n\nContact Margie Fishman at 302-324-2882, on Twitter @MargieTrende or mfishman@delawareonline.com.\n\nWhere the money flows:\n\nFederal tax records dating to 2007 show that UD has distributed more than $6 million in payments to top administrators who have left their posts. Here are the highest earners:\n\nDavid Roselle\n\nServed: President from May, 1990 to July, 2007\n\nExit pay: Nearly $1.9 million\n\nDetails: Roselle's total compensation of about $875,000 in 2005 was the highest nationwide that year among public university presidents. The following year, his last full year at the helm, Roselle earned more than $2.45 million, the university's IRS forms show. He continued to receive annual compensation from UD through 2011. Roselle now serves as executive director of Winterthur Museum, Garden & Library. He did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nDavid Hollowell\n\nServed: January, 1988 to December, 2007, most recently as executive vice president and treasurer.\n\nExit pay: Nearly $1.1 million\n\nDetails: Hollowell earned nearly $651,000 in total compensation in 2006, which ballooned to more than $1.1 million during his final year. In 2008, when he was no longer employed by the university, he received nearly $1.1 million, according to IRS forms. He now serves as a commissioner and treasurer for the Middle States Commission on Higher Education in Philadelphia, which is chaired by Goldey-Beacom College President Gary Wirt. Hollowell could not be reached for comment.\n\nK.C. Keeler\n\nServed: Head football coach from March, 2002 to January, 2013\n\nExit pay: Nearly $2 million\n\nDetails: Keeler, who earned more than $300,000 annually, was under contract with UD through 2017. He was fired in January 2013, but received nearly $2 million from the university that year, including a $1 million \"severance payment\" listed on UD's Form 990. Now head football coach at Sam Houston State University, Keeler did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJennifer \"J.J.\" Davis\n\nServed: Vice president for finance and administration from November, 2008 to March, 2013\n\nExit pay: At least $454,000\n\nDetails: Davis left UD in early March of 2013, but still received more than $563,000 in total compensation from the university for the 2013 calendar year, including a more than $454,000 \"severance payment\" listed on UD's Form 990. Previously, Davis earned about $346,000 a year from UD. She now works as senior vice president for finance and administration for George Mason University in Virginia. Davis did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMark Stalnecker\n\nServed: Chief investment officer from October, 1999 to July, 2013\n\nExit pay: At least $107,000\n\nDetails: Stalnecker was among UD's highest-paid employees, earning nearly $367,000 in 2012, his last full year at the university. Stalnecker left midway through 2013 but still earned more than 80 percent of his 2012 compensation. Stalnecker earned a bonus of more than $107,000 that year \"for services rendered through the date of his retirement,\" according to UD's Form 990.\n\nPatrick Harker\n\nServed: President from July, 2007 to July, 2015\n\nExit pay: At least $400,000\n\nDetails: Harker stepped down from UD at the close of the 2014-15 academic year. During his final full year at the helm, he earned nearly $951,000, including nearly $144,000 in bonus compensation. In 2015, Harker earned nearly $817,000 from UD for working 55 hours a week, according to UD's Form 990 filed with the IRS, despite working for the university for only half the year. Harker left UD mid-year to become president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/12/13"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2019/02/13/nj-list-of-priests-accused-of-abuse-by-diocese/2848547002/", "title": "List of NJ priests accused of sex abuse", "text": "New Jersey's five Catholic dioceses on Wednesday morning began releasing lists of priests who have been credibly accused of sexually abusing children.\n\nCardinal Joseph Tobin, the Newark archbishop, announced last year that the dioceses were reviewing clergy sex abuse cases.

Accreditation is not only a status; it is also an ongoing process that ensures a school’s continued growth and excellence. According to the MSA, accreditation is the result of an \"external, objective validation of school quality and achievement—the Gold Standard.\"\n\nFor two years, Union Catholic engaged in a comprehensive self-study, using the MSA protocol \"Excellence by Design.” The self-study process was facilitated by two Internal Coordinators: Noreen Andrews, Assistant Principal, and Barbara Dellanno, Dean of Academics & Faith-Formation.\n\nThe Planning Team, whose members represented a cross-section of UC stakeholders and included faculty member Catarina Abrantes, Director of School Counseling Jennifer Dixon, faculty member Timothy Breza, faculty member and alumus Edward Sagendorf class of 2007, Associate Principal and alumna Karen Piasecki class of 1988, faculty member and Media Specialist Kathy Webber, Student Support Services Director and alumna Meg Nuwer class of 1998, faculty member and alumnus Ed Thornton class of 2004, and Director of Parent Relations and UC parent Allison Lestarchick, working closely with the Internal Coordinators. This team developed a Mission Statement, reflecting UC’s vision for the school and its students; a Belief Statement, identifying UC’s core values and the beliefs that guide the school’s mission; and The Profile of a Graduate, specifying what UC students have to know, be able to do, and to demonstrate for the school to achieve its mission. These three foundation documents are available at www.unioncatholic.org under “About Us.”\n\nThe Planning Team also collected the information and data from stakeholders that was used to create its report on the Context of the School and its Profiles of Student Performance and Organizational Capacity. All of this led to the team’s development of a Plan for Growth and Improvement in student performance and the school’s capacity to achieve the desired outcomes. Three measurable objectives were identified by the team. The first two objectives focus on student performance: improving critical reading proficiency and increasing knowledge of the principles of Catholic social teaching. The third objective focuses on curriculum design in light of the Profile of the Graduate.\n\nIn October 2015, a Visiting Team appointed by MSA spent four days evaluating the school using the self-study as its guide. Some highlights of the Visiting Team’s report:\n\n“The principal is a visionary who began implementing technology into the classroom as early as 1997. Now all students have laptops and the school has integrated technology throughout.”\n\nUnion Catholic has a commendable cohesive environment. A true collaborative atmosphere permeates the work of faculty and staff\n\n“The vast number of volunteer work and charitable causes championed by the students and club moderators over the years demonstrates the school’s spirit of outreach, which also supports the school’s Catholic identity.”\n\nOn May 2016, Union Catholic received “Official Notice of Middle States Accreditation” for the period May 1, 2016 to May 1, 2023. In his letter to the school the MSA President, Henry G. Cram Ed. D, commended UC for continuing “to be among the schools throughout the world that meet the internationally recognized standards of quality of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools”—the Gold Standard.\n\nUnion County 4-H\n\nUniversity of Arkansas at Little Rock\n\nStephanie Lauer of Canbury was named to the spring chancellor's and dean's list at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock .\n\nUniversity of Connecticut\n\nThe following Central Jersey residents at the University of Connecticut received their degrees this spring :\n\nChristina Donna Massoni of East Brunswick, bachelor’s in nursing\n\nRachel Lynn Borden of Kendall Park, bachelor’s degree in economics\n\nCarissa Etsuko Buurstra of Keyport, bachelor’s degree in exercise science\n\nKiera Jean Schneider of Matawan, bachelor’s degree in animal science\n\nKatherine Girard Duddy of Metuchen, bachelor’s degree in English\n\nMatthew Jordan Russo of Middletown, bachelor’s degree in chemical engineering\n\nChase Barrett Adams of Monmouth Junction, bachelor’s degrees in finance and biological sciences\n\nErin Teresa O'Rear of Old Bridge, bachelor’s degree in animal science.\n\nThe following Central Jersey residents at the University were named to the spring dean's list: Quentin Robert Oddi of Clark, Rebecca Sara Bierstein, Suraj Reddy Muddasani of Dayton, Danielle Lee Lindeman of East Brunswick, Xiao Li of Edison, Ayushi Sanjay Pathak of Edison, Angelica Maria Monsanto of Fords, LindsayCarbone, Raj D.

Jalloh in a prepared statement. “They have provided an inspirational demonstration of the great things that happen when we all pull together for a good cause.”\n\nUC-STEP (the Union County Student Training and Enrichment Program) began in 2013 as an initiative of Freeholder Linda Carter, who was freeholder chairman that year. It is a daylong summit that brings high school sophomores and juniors together from all walks of life, to practice leadership skills and engage in personal development activities.\n\nThe summit culminates in the creation and selection — by popular vote — of a countywide civic engagement project to be carried out in the spring, with the support of the freeholder Bboard and other community sponsors.\n\nThe first UC-STEP campaign, called Support 4 Soldiers, enlisted the Union County community to collect “care package” items for active duty military members serving overseas. A total of 250 care packages were assembled through the efforts of that campaign.\n\nThe co-sponsors of this year’s Donate to Educate — Schools Supplying Schools campaign were The Boys and Girls Clubs of Union County and Ivy Visions Inc. of Plainfield.\n\nThis year, 14 high schools participated: Academy for Performing Arts, Academy for Allied Health Sciences (both part of the UC Vo-Tech school district), Arthur L. Johnson in Clark, Barack Obama Green Charter in Plainfield, Cranford, Governor Livingston in Berkeley Heights, Jonathon Dayton, Linden, Plainfield, Roselle Catholic, Summit, UC TEAMS in Plainfield, Union, and Union Catholic in Scotch Plains.\n\nThe campaign also included a friendly competition between the schools, based on the number of donations raised. Union Catholic High School was the first-place winner and was awarded the Freeholder Board’s $1,000 START NOW grant for collecting an impressive total of 14,841 items.\n\nUC TEAMS and Governor Livingston High School came in second and third, respectively.

In addition, he was instrumental in recently securing a large gift to support the University’s new Daniel and Martina Lewis Center for Healthcare Innovation and Technology. He also was the driving force in developing the University’s 2014-2019 strategic plan, working with Drucker, the board and faculty and staff across the University, including at the university’s two international campuses in Canada and England.\n\nCapuano also provided the leadership for changes to the school’s University Core program, the adoption of the Individual Development and Educational Assessment (IDEA) system for instructor and course assessment and development, and changes to the requirements for completion of Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science degrees.\n\nIn his former position as vice provost for international affairs, Capuano provided oversight of the University’s Office of Global Partnerships and worked closely with the University’s Office of Global Learning to facilitate study abroad and other international initiatives.

The Rutgers program supports women pursuing careers in computer science (CS) and will address the need for a diverse workforce.\n\n“Technology is a driving force in our economy, and we need to ensure that the field is enhanced by the benefits of a diverse workforce,” said Congressman Frank Pallone Jr. (D.-Dist. 6), who announced the grant. “This grant, to encourage women to remain involved in the increasingly important discipline of computer science, helps Rutgers solidify itself on the cutting-age of technology education and represents an important commitment to growing diversity in science, technology, engineering and math.”\n\nWhile computer science enrollments have risen significantly in the last five years, the percentage of graduates who are women remains low (around 14 percent). The CS-LLCW project made possible by this grant will address the lack of diversity in computer science by developing a computer science Living-Learning Community for women. It aims to provide an immersive educational experience and to enhance the recruitment and retention of women in the field. Building on existing research on LCCs in other fields, on broadening participation in computing, and on best practices for computer science education, this project also aims to build capacity to be a national model.\n\nState University of New York\n\nEmily B.

Dumbbells and pulley systems are a very high-traffic and high-touch area, and, because CuVerro is a superior product combined with anti-bacterial properties, I knew it was the best option,” he said in a prepared statement.\n\nThe dumbbells are made of hard chrome to prevent chipping and rusting, are balanced and calibrated for exact weight, and have no welds or bolts, so they will not break if dropped. Pingry acquired a complete set of dumbbells comprised of 23 pairs of weights, as well as four barbells and 20 pulley-handled attachments.\n\nThis new equipment will be integrated into the new Miller A. Bugliari ’52 Athletics Center, which Pingry plans to build as part of its $65 million campaign. The center, whose groundbreaking is scheduled for Sept. 19, will include a 4,500-square-foot strength and conditioning center.\n\nTo learn more about CuVerro, visit cuverro.com.

The transition took place on May 15.\n\n“Moving Operation College Promise into our institution helps ensure that we can continue its excellent work in support of our nation’s veterans,” said Louis Martini, associate vice president of Military and Veteran Education at Thomas Edison State College. “This goes beyond the enrollment of veterans. It is about making a larger impact on the lives of those who have served.”\n\nThe college played a pivotal role in Operation College Promise when the program was selected in 2009 as one of 20 recipients of the American Council on Education/Walmart “Success for Veterans” grants.

For many of these students, it was their first experience learning about the interview process.\n\nOutside representatives who served as interviewers were: Sanford Josephson, Director of Marketing and Public Relations, Matheny Medical and Educational Center; Andrea Kirchuk, Co-Owner of Computer Images Web; Liz McDonough, Business Development Representative of Visions Federal Credit Union; Yolanda Sheffield Williams‘06; Director of Major Gifts, Easter Seals; Steve Van Houten, Director of Human Resources, Nisivoccia & Company: Arlene Swanston, Director of Human Resources, Abilities of Northwest Jersey, Inc.; Laurie Rapisardi, Executive Director of Rutherfurd Hall; Bob Eberle, Panther Valley Pharmacy; and David Schmeltze, Biz Budding, Inc.\n\n“I enjoy being asked to participate in the Summer Culture and Language Program mock interviews every year,” said Yolanda Sheffeld Williams class of 2606. “It is fascinating to learn about the students’ career goals and discuss their backgrounds, views of the United States and the various field trips they attend during their stay here. What is most exciting about their time at Centenary is how much better their English skills become, how much their self-confidence increases and how they have the opportunity to meet new friends and create great memories.”\n\nCentenary College’s Summer Culture and Language Program brings students to the Hackettstown-based campus from many countries to learn about American culture and the English language. It also provides them with the opportunity to participate in cultural and educational trips to Washington, D.C., Boston, Philadelphia, and New York City.\n\nOn the academic side, they participated in an English pronunciation enrichment program during their six-week stay and took a four-credit Intensive English as a Second Language reading and writing class. They also took a four-credit American Culture class that provided them with an understanding of America today and cultural life on American college campuses. Students with exceptional English skills participated in a literature and writing course. Thirty-nine of the 66 students remain on the campus to study for a full year at the institution.\n\nLafayette College\n\nThe following Central Jersey residents at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania, spent a week volunteering at Brilla College Prep, a free K-2 public charter school in the South Bronx during a 2014-15 semester break as part of Lafayette's student-led chapter of Alternative School Break: Erik Jones of Metuchen, Jethro Israel of Plainfield, Matthew Ackerman of Hillsborough, Emma Sherry of Fanwood.\n\nMisericordia University\n\nChristopher Hale of Basking Ridge at Misericordia University in Dallas, Pennsylvania, participated in first-year student orientation day of service.

One winner will be selected and awarded a $500 scholarship to honor their achievements.\n\nThe New Jersey Agricultural Achievement Award, sponsored by Dr. Amy Butewicz, a former New Jersey Equestrian of the Year, was started because of her desire to give back to the community. This scholarship is meant to assist its recipient in beginning their future in agriculture.\n\nThe qualifications for receiving this award include submitting an application, found at www.jerseyequine.nj.gov/agachievementapplform.pdf, a resume along with an essay answering the question, “How has your involvement within your respective nominating organization helped to shape your future career choice?”\n\nIn addition, a contestant is required to be a current, active member of an organization either on the New Jersey Equine Advisory Board and/or represented at the Youth Reception portion of the New Jersey State Agricultural Convention. Each organization on the New Jersey Equine Advisory Board and a participant of the State Agricultural Convention is able to nominate a maximum of two contestants.\n\nThe winner of the Agricultural Achievement Award must attend the Annual New Jersey Bred Equine Breeders Award Luncheon to be held on Sunday, Jan.y 24, 2016 in Eastampton and will read his or her essay to the attendees.\n\nMail application, resume and essay by Jan. 2, 2016 to: NJDA, Attn: Lynn Mathews, P.O.

The experience the team received last year will only help to propel us forward.”\n\nLasda said she is confident the coaching staff will be able to keep the team grounded despite all their success this past year, including winning the school’s third NJSIAA Group 1 state championship as well as the NJIGILL division crown.\n\n“Since the younger players have already gone through this process, they know how much hard work and dedication it took to get where we ended last season,” said Lasda, who was named All-USA Girls Lacrosse Coach of the Year by America Family Insurance in June. “Knowing this will only help them prepare, perhaps even more rigorously, now that every team we play will be looking to upset us.”\n\nReadington Township Public Schools\n\nCamp Invention, the only nationally recognized, non-profit elementary enrichment program backed by the National Inventors Hall of Fame, was offered by the Readington Township Public Schools during the week of Aug. 3. Open to children in the community entering grades one through six, Camp Invention provided opportunities for the students to explore connections between science, technology, engineering and innovation.

Kaufelt, a 1969 RPS graduate.\n\n“This year’s recipients demonstrate the commitment to animal protection that the award seeks to honor,” said Bernard Unti, senior policy advisor and special assistant to the CEO of The HSUS. “Both Kayla and Riya have volunteered for local sheltering organizations while also devoting energy to international animal welfare concerns. They exemplify the compassion and respect for animals that inspired the creation of the Florence Kaufelt Memorial Scholarship.”\n\nBancone and Patel were selected based on essays they submitted describing their involvement with and ongoing concern for animal protection and how that has been expressed in their daily life, family experience and volunteer activities.\n\nIn her essay, Bancone, a senior, describes her work with a friend to re-start the school’s animal club – RPawS (RPS) – which sent members to volunteer at the Somerset Regional Animal Shelter and brought attention to elephant poaching and the global ivory trade. Patel started a non-profit organization to help shelter pets called Can6 Pets, holding can drives at birthday parties and other events. A senior, she’s volunteered at the Franklin Animal Shelter since sophomore year and also devoted efforts to elephants, sponsoring an orphaned baby in sanctuary in Africa whom she visited with her family.\n\nBoth students cite a love of animals since childhood and envision stepping up their efforts in the future. “Animals will always be a large part of my life,” said Bancone, “and I’ve made a clear goal to maximize the value of every animal’s life that is within my reach.”\n\nAdded Patel: “I cannot wait until more opportunities arise for me to make a stronger and more meaningful impact on the lives of the animals, and my community.”\n\nRutgers begins 250th Anniversary celebration\n\nAs Rutgers prepares to launch the celebration of its 250th anniversary, the university is building on its historic strengths by opening modern residence halls, classrooms and labs that will provide new academic opportunities for students and faculty.\n\nOne of the most visible signs of Rutgers’ ambitions is the new Honors College at Rutgers University-New Brunswick, designed as a living/learning community and home to more than 500 first-year students. The five-story, 170,000 square-foot building overlooks the Raritan River and is a major component of Rutgers-New Brunswick’s College Avenue redevelopment initiative. A formal ribbon-cutting ceremony is being conducted on Friday, Sept. 25.\n\nThe Honors College will offer academic opportunities and challenges beyond traditional curriculum and classroom experiences. Students will have direct access to live-in faculty fellows, on-site Honors College advising and administrative offices, as well as high-tech seminar and study spaces and lounge areas.\n\nStudents are also moving into the four Bishop Quad residence halls following completion of extensive upgrades. Hegeman, Wessels, Leupp and Pell halls, located in the heart of the College Avenue Campus, date from the 1920s and have undergone a two-year, $13 million renovation. Approximately 300 undergraduate students reside in the Bishop Quad buildings. Rutgers also has opened the new New Jersey Institute for Food, Nutrition and Health. The $55 million, 78,000 square-foot building on the George H. Cook Campus houses state-of-the-art laboratories, community clinics, a children’s nutrition center and preschool, as well as a dining facility offering healthy food options.\n\nOther completed projects include:\n\n15 Washington St. (Rutgers University-Newark): An icon on the Newark skyline, the former home of Rutgers School of Law-Newark has been converted to apartment-style units for 333 graduate and undergraduate students that are configured as studios and one-, two-, three- and four-bedroom units. There will be common areas for student and academic use, and spaces that support events and arts performances and exhibitions produced by Rutgers faculty, staff and students in collaboration with Newark performers, artists and creators of all ages. The building will also serve as a residence for the chancellor of Rutgers University-Newark. The project cost was $85 million. A formal dedication is scheduled Nov. 17.\n\nSchool of Health Related Professions Clinical Lab Renovation (Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences): This $4 million renovation will improve the use of existing interior space by reconfiguring approximately 4,410 square feet to provide space and resources for the renovated SHRP Clinical Science and Interprofessional Health Laboratories and the adjacent research and clinical support area.\n\nSeveral major projects are scheduled for completion during 2015-2016:\n\nSchool of Dental Medicine Oral Health Pavilion (Rutgers Biomedical and Health Sciences): This $13.5 million project in Newark adds more than 24,000 square feet of clinical teaching space to the C Level of the building. The clinic seamlessly integrates into the existing building and features a corridor that links to the adjacent Bergen Building, and will be completed by the end of 2015.\n\nThe Chemical and Chemical Biology Building (Rutgers University-New Brunswick): With nearly 145,000 square feet, the facility will be connected to the Wright Reiman complex on the Busch Campus in Piscataway. The $115 million building will be energy efficient, sustainable and reconfigurable. It will provide needed laboratory, teaching and collaboration space that will enable Rutgers’ faculty to expand and accelerate in groundbreaking research drug design, alternative energy, biomaterials, nanotechnology and molecular engineering. The project is scheduled for completion in fall 2016.\n\nGlobal Village Learning Center at the Jameson Dormitory Complex (Rutgers University-New Brunswick): The new 19,000 square-foot center at Douglass Residential College on the Douglass Campus will be the home of the Global Village Learning Community. The facility will include lounge, classroom and residential spaces, including a large assembly space for leading lecturers and conferences. The $11.5 million project is scheduled for completion in fall 2016 and is a partnership between alumnae donors and Rutgers University.\n\nExpress Newark, a university-community collaboratory (Rutgers University-Newark): Occupying about 10 percent of the 500,000 square-foot classic Hahne & Co. building, a former downtown department store, Express Newark will be an interdisciplinary learning space housing the collaborative practice of community residents and artists who will innovate and experiment with Rutgers University-Newark faculty, staff and students to engage in creative practice, foster democratic dialog and promote positive transformation.\n\nWriters House (Rutgers University-Camden): 305 Cooper St. (Henry Genet Taylor House) is on the National Register of Historic Properties. The project includes a major renovation of the existing 6,685 square-foot building to restore the building to its former glory by fall. The facility, which will be occupied by the Department of English, will provide students, faculty and guest writers an environment in which to meet and discuss literature and scholarly projects. Total cost is $4.5 million.\n\nAlumni House and Development Office (Rutgers University-Camden): 312 Cooper St. (the former Red Cross Building) will be the home of the Alumni and Development offices. The $2.5 million project will see the renovation and restoration of the original 8,000 square-foot space and the construction of an additional 1,150 square-foot stair tower. The building includes meeting space for alumni of Rutgers. Completion is anticipated this semester.\n\nThomas Edison State College\n\nThomas Edison State College recently ranked as the third safest college campus in America. ADTSecurity.com turned to the U.S. Department of Education's Office of Post Secondary Education to gather data. The OPE's Campus Safety and Security Statistics database collects information about on-campus crime reports and fires.\n\nThe Citadel\n\nThe following local residents at The Citadel in Charleston, South Carolina were named to the spring president's list. Michael Subach of Hillsborough, Robert Waldrop of South Plainfield.\n\nThe Hun School of Princeton\n\nWhat does innovative teaching look like? How can established institutions ensure they evolve in innovative ways? Grant Lichtman attempted to answer these questions while traversing the country and visiting educators. The results were the basis for his book, #EDJourney. During a visit to The Hun School of Princeton on August 27, Lichtman addressed the Hun School’s faculty about his findings and invited them to join him in the conversation about educational innovation today.\n\nDuring his keynote address, Lichtman said, “We have to teach our kids, essentially, for their future, and not for our past. And, I think that is what you are thinking about here. You are thinking about the operating system of your school, not just the hardware and software.”\n\nAfter Lichtman’s keynote address, faculty spent time participating in breakout groups. They worked together to develop new ideas and discussed how best to support innovation on campus.\n\nThey collaboratively imagined systematic-level, big picture changes – aspirations for high-level innovations that aligned to the school’s strategic plan. When they reconvened as a whole to share these goals, themes emerged that included interest around student voice, interdisciplinary programs, and testing boundaries of space and time.\n\n“If we are going to be leading and significant as opposed to just great and successful, we do that by taking some degree of risks,” Lichtman said. “It’s a healthy thing to have in your risk-reward portfolio. The question for some schools is, ‘Can we do it?’ The question for your school is, ‘Well, we have to decide to do it.’”\n\n\n\nUpper School head Ryan Hews said, “In recent years, The Hun School has shifted curricular focus from traditional disciplines and content to a more skills-based curriculum, with an eye toward higher levels of student engagement. Mr. Lichtman’s visit both affirmed this innovative work and inspired Hun’s visionary faculty to imagine what’s next. Schools need to be dynamic, adaptable, and reflective places and it was rewarding to have Mr. Lichtman partner with us toward these ends.”\n\nThe Wardlaw-Hartridge School\n\nThe Wardlaw-Hartridge School in Edison kicked off its 133rd year with the annual Convocation Ceremony in Laidlaw Gym on Sept. 10.\n\nLower and Middle School Students entered the gym with their teachers, smiling and eager to begin the new school year. The Upper School students marched in behind their respective class flags and were accompanied by their advisors. The Class of 2016, this year's seniors, made a grand entrance for their final Convocation ceremony.\n\n\n\nSenior Astitva Soni of Edison, the school’s Student Council President, led the W-H student body in the Pledge of Allegiance and MadJazz joined selected W-H students to sing America the Beautiful.\n\n\n\nAndrew Webster of Edison, Head of School, welcomed the students, faculty, staff and parents to the ceremony. Webster spoke about the school’s six core values – Integrity, Opportunity, Support, Diversity, Community and Sustainability. He emphasized Community and gave a special welcome to new students and international students.\n\n\n\nJeanne Barbet of Plainfield, an officer on the school’s Board of Trustees, shared the Robert Frost poem The Road Not Taken and challenged students to explore different paths during her remarks. Soni asked his fellow students to try something new and step out of their comfort zone in his speech before Webster concluded the program by wishing everyone a successful school year.\n\nUnion County College\n\nUnion County College’s Class of 2015 is the most successful graduating class in the College’s 82-year history, according to a college news release. The total number of graduates this year hit 1,505. That’s 200 more than the prior year’s record.\n\nUnion County College President Margaret M. McMenamin announced the milestone achievement during the college’s annual Convocation on Sept. 1. She said, “That’s another 1,505 college-educated people to enrich our community. That’s not just good for our workforce, it’s good for America. As Thomas Jefferson once said, ‘An educated citizenry is a vital requisite for our survival as a free people.’”\n\nThis year’s graduation total is nearly three times higher than it was five years ago. In addition, the three-year graduation rate for full-time students surpassed 15 percent — which is 5 percent higher than last year and the highest percentage in more than 20 years.\n\nThe president gave credit to faculty and staff for their commitment to student success. She offered even more accolades to the students themselves, saying “their record of achievement is proof that a little tender-loving-care can go a long way. Given the right amount of support, our students have proven that they can and will succeed.”\n\nAs is tradition, the annual Convocation was held the day before the start of the Fall semester. Classes began at all three of the College’s campuses (Cranford, Elizabeth, and Plainfield) today, welcoming more than 11,000 new and returning students.\n\nFollowing President McMenamin’s meeting with employees was a presentation by the University of Tennessee’s Dr. Robbie Melton, who energized the audience with a series of demonstrations on educational technology. Melton showed the faculty a veritable smorgasbord of new tools for engaging students in what she called “the active and interactive pursuit of learning.”\n\nFor more information on Union County College or to register for “later start” classes, visit www.ucc.edu.\n\nALSO: The American Honors program at Union County College provides high achieving, motivated students the opportunity to earn an associate degree and transfer to a four-year university as a junior. The in-county tuition cost for the American Honors program at Union County College is $7,220, while the average cost nationally for a four-year college education is approximately $23,000 before the cost of housing, travel and other fees.\n\nBut it isn’t all about the money saved. American Honors students take classes with other high achieving students in a smaller, more intimate setting. Classes are capped at twenty students and are taught by Honors faculty. Students also have a dedicated advisor who encourage professional development, leadership and transfer seminars to prepare them for their future endeavors.\n\nTransfer rates are extremely high among American Honors students, and the program maintains transfer agreements with over 50 colleges and universities nationwide.\n\nJanine Mills, a current American Honors student at the college, said, “American Honors means everything to me because it embodies my personal feelings about my education: to go above and beyond what I can imagine. The Honors program has helped me to embrace my future with not only open arms, but with a calm readiness.\"\n\nFor more information about American Honors at Union County College, visit www.ucc.edu/AmericanHonors.\n\nUnion County Freeholders\n\nUnion County Freeholder Chairman Mohamed S. Jalloh and Freeholder Sergio Granados recently joined students taking courses at the kick-off for Chairman Jalloh’s initiative, the “College Readiness Now” program, at Union County College’s Sidney Lessner Building in Elizabeth.\n\n“College Readiness Now” is designed to test juniors requiring remediation near the end of the academic year. Those who need remediation will have it done during their senior year to ensure they are college ready. This program is designed to help reduce the time students have to stay in school and reduce the loans they have to pay when they get out.\n\nUnion County College has launched the program with four County high schools: Plainfield High School, Abraham Clark High School of Roselle, David Brearley High of Kenilworth, and the Hillcrest Academy. Another six County high schools are also seeking to participate in the program at the start of the fall semester.\n\nWestfield Public Schools\n\nA total of 36 new Westfield Public School teachers and support staff attended the in-house New Staff Institute (NSI) prior to the start of school, receiving orientation and training to become familiar with expectations of the district and community. The majority are new to the district, while a few stepped in as mid-year leave replacements during the last school year. To offer further support to both these first year educators and to those veteran teachers who are new to Westfield, NSI meetings also will take place in the next two years.\n\nAt a NSI luncheon held on Sept. 1, Westfield Board of Education Vice President, Gretchan Ohlig, welcomed the new teachers to the district. Westfield Education Association President, Michael Seiler, told the newcomers that they are entering a district with a well-deserved reputation for excellence. Superintendent of Schools, Margaret Dolan, wished the new teachers a year of learning and growing and reminded the new hires that the administration reviewed thousands of resumes and held hundreds of interviews before making selections.\n\nDolan addressed all teachers in the district at a morning assembly for staff held September 2. Reiterating the district’s theme, “A Tradition of Excellence,” Dolan gave examples of how a teacher can influence a student’s life.\n\nBoard of Education President Richard Mattessich also credited teachers for making a difference.

More than 40 topics were covered, from curriculum development to behavior analysis. Superintendent of Schools, Margaret Dolan, explained that every session was designed to equip school personnel with best practices to serve Westfield students. The Curriculum, Instruction and Program Department outlined a full schedule for staff at all grade levels. At Westfield High School, Pedro Noguera, renowned sociologist and professor of education, accepted the invitation by WHS Principal Peter Renwick and addressed the entire faculty and staff on motivating and engaging students. Anti-Bullying Coordinator/Wilson Principal, Joseph Malanga met with elementary school counselors Frank Uveges, Jaime La Rosa, Lynn Slomczewski, and Mary Beth Herits to discuss updating the district’s website in regard to the Harassment, Intimidation and Bullying law. Speaking on behalf of the group, La Rosa explained, “As the HIB law continues to change, we want to continue to provide our community with the most up-to-date information and resources.”\n\nYoung Audiences Arts for Learning New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania\n\nAt a time when schools throughout the region are reeling from budget cuts, Young Audiences New Jersey & Eastern Pennsylvania (YANJ/EP) continues to provide some relief by offering arts education scholarships for up to $10,000. These scholarships are made possible by a grant that Target has provided to Young Audiences. This partnership has provided transformative arts experiences to thousands of children in challenged schools throughout New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania for the last six-years.\n\nGrant recipients will work with Young Audiences’ staff, and their roster of professional teaching artists, to plan first-quality arts programming tailored specifically for their schools’ unique needs. Each recipient will receive funding for a variety of initiatives, including: professional arts performances at their school; in-depth, hands-on workshops with professional artists: professional development to help teachers best use the arts in their classrooms: assistance in creating a community event celebrating students’ work\n\nAll public, private and charter preschools, elementary, middle and high schools throughout New Jersey or in the Pennsylvania counties: Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lehigh, Montgomery and Philadelphia are eligible for the grants.\n\n“The grants come at a critical time, when schools throughout the area have cut back arts programs”, noted Larry Capo, President of Young Audiences New Jersey & Eastern Pennsylvania. “Many schools are committed to the value of arts education, but simply can’t afford it in this economy,” Capo said. “Our strong partnership with Target ensures that children will continue to receive quality arts experiences with professional working artists to develop their creative, innovative skills needed to succeed in learning and life.”\n\nThe YANJ/EP Target Arts Education Scholarships will be awarded on a competitive basis, with priority given to schools in financial need. The deadline for applications is Oct. 8 at 3 p.m. Winning schools will be notified via email or phone by Oct. 23.\n\nFor more information, and for grant applications, schools can visit www.yanj-yaep.org, or contact Liz Winter-Kuwornu at Young Audiences New Jersey, at 866-500-9265.\n\nALSO: Young Audiences of New Jersey & Eastern Pennsylvania is now accepting applications for the Emerging Artists Creativity Hub (EACH). EACH is a teen arts program designed specifically for young artists, ages 13-17, who are interested and gifted in the arts. It is intended for students to study and work in the arts far beyond the typical high school curriculum. In partnership with The College of New Jersey (TCNJ), this 10-week program is held each semester on Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Arts and Interactive Multimedia Building on The College of New Jersey’s Ewing campus.\n\nNow in its sixth year, EACH offers teenaged visual and performing artists from diverse economic and social backgrounds an arts education experience. The young artists study and work in all different arts forms with professional teaching artists from the Young Audiences’ roster. EACH encourages students to take creative risks and explore their lives as inspiration for their work.\n\n“EACH is an amazing and unique artistic experience. It enables me to gather with other young artists and discover something new each week…By being part of EACH, I have learned that possibilities are endless,” said EACH student David Jansen.\n\n\n\nThe goal of EACH is to help young people acquire knowledge, understanding of, and skills in the arts. Students will create individual artworks and collaborate with their fellow students on group projects. Students will also have the opportunity to experience great works of art by visiting cultural institutions like the American Museum of Natural History and Grounds for Sculpture. The program culminates in a community event that is open to all.\n\nApplications are due on Friday, Sept. 25, and classes begin on Saturday, Oct. 3. Space is limited and scholarships are available.

She has been teaching at the University since 2005.\n\n“I rip classrooms like Drake RIP stages,” Leverette says in one of her lyrics. “I’mma make algebra and trig contagious!”\n\nWhile Leverette has done “a little rap here, a little rap there” since she was a teenager, this semester her rapping caught on in her MATH 1000 class, which is college algebra.\n\n“Every Friday I’ll say a few sentences in rap, then I drop the mic. That lets them know I’m finished and it’s time to go. The students have gotten into it,” she said, adding that students have recorded her raps and posted them on social media.\n\nLeverette said that many students feel they can’t learn math. But she works to create a relaxed learning environment as she breaks down algebra into understandable concepts and comes up with ways to help individual students learn.\n\nSeveral students said Leverette’s approach helps them master the subject.\n\nProsper Nwankwo, a freshman architecture major from Trenton, said Leverette keeps students focused. “I love coming to class because you can tell she loves her job,” he said.\n\nCollege algebra is a math requirement for many students in various majors at Kean. Louis Beaugris, executive director of Kean’s School of Mathematical Sciences, said the University encourages professors to think beyond the whiteboard and slide presentation in their approach to teaching.\n\n\"At Kean, we expect our professors to innovate and engage students, to take the extra step to ensure our students learn,” he said. “Irisa Leverette does that.\"\n\nLeverette also uses technology in teaching. She posts math videos on her Facebook page, ithinkalgebra. The rapping prof plans to use social media further by creating a YouTube channel for ithinkalgebra. Her math videos have received close to 8,000 views on Facebook, and helped students in China, India, and elsewhere, as well as at Kean, she said.\n\n“Social media is the 'real world,' and universities want students to have real-life experiences in the classroom,” she said. “Plus, students are so attached to their phones, it makes sense to utilize this technology in the classroom.”\n\nAnd for good measure, she also uses her rap to remind students to continue learning at home.\n\n“Don't forget to study over the weekend,” Leverette raps. “Let it sink in, marinate. See you on Monday. Don't be late!”\n\nREAD: The good things students are doing in Central Jersey and beyond\n\nREAD: Education news from around the region\n\nCOLLEGE CONNECTION: Advice from local expert columnist\n\nALSO: Make some room, Rockettes: the newest performing group to grace the stage of Radio City Music Hall is the Kean University Gospel Choir.\n\nThe award-winning choir performed on Sunday, Dec. 2 at the legendary Radio City in New York City, opening for the annual Christmas Spectacular show.\n\n“The experience was amazing!” said choir Director Malcolm J. Evans, who arranged the Christmas medley the group performed, which included \"O Come, O Come Emmanuel; O Come\" \" All Ye Faithful\" and \"Joy to the World.\"\n\nAn audience of about 6,000 enjoyed the performance.\n\n“Standing on the stage gave you a sense that you were a part of something historic. It was a humbling experience. Also, they pronounced Kean correctly, which is always great,” Evans said.\n\nBackstage, Evans had a conversation with a stage manager, who listed some of the other performers and events that had graced the famous stage: Luther Vandross, Michael Jackson, David Bowie, Tina Turner, Rod Stewart, Madonna, Beyoncé, Liberace, and the first MTV Video Music Awards. As well, the venue is known for the high-kicking Rockettes.\n\n“He wanted to impart in us a sense of weight of the moment,” Evans said. “We’ve performed in front of crowds before, but Radio City is one of those iconic venues that you dream of performing in.”\n\nThe Kean group was recommended for the gig, but choir members do not know who made the recommendation to Radio City, said Shakira Jackson, a choir member and one of the group’s public relations coordinators. You might say it’s something of a holiday mystery.\n\n“This experience taught me that you can never know what to expect. I am still surprised we were given this opportunity,” Jackson said. “The audience was very engaged, which made everything more amazing. I couldn't be any more grateful.”\n\nThe Kean Gospel Choir is a volunteer group of Kean students from different majors, many of whom grew up singing in church choirs, and who want to continue sharing their talent. Among its many awards and accomplishments, the choir won McDonald’s Gospelfest for three straight years; recorded and released a single, Behold Him; and performed with Sons of Serendip at a Kean Stage concert.\n\nKean has been very supportive of the choir, Jackson said.\n\nRichonda Fegins is an alumni choir member and vocal coach. Fegins joined the group in 2016 as a first-semester graduate student looking to connect with like-minded students and has remained involved up to and including the Radio City performance.\n\n“The best part about being able to open up for the Rockettes was the fact that I was able to share this memory with my choir,” Fegins said. “It is a huge accomplishment and opportunity for us, and I am just so proud of how far we have come.”\n\nDiocese of Metuchen YES program\n\nCatholic Charities, Diocese of Metuchen,has added a second preschool program to its catalogue of services in New Brunswick — the Youth Enrichment Services (YES) at St. Ladislaus, 197 Somerset St.\n\nFor this program, Catholic Charities says that it is building on the success of the YES Early Learning Center at Sacred Heart, 115 Commercial Ave., which uses Tools of the Mind© Curriculum to ensure every child becomes a successful learner.\n\nAccording to a news release, the Agency was awarded a second contract and began the task renovating the center on July 1. Thirty-two new staff members were hired and upgrades to the center were completed in preparation to welcome students in September. The Preschool Center at St. Ladislaus has 12 classrooms with a maximum capacity of 180 children. Funding for the program is provided by the New Brunswick School District.\n\nCatholic Charities celebrated with the community during an Open House and ceremonial ribbon cutting on Nov. 29.\n\n“We look forward to celebrating the amazing work of so many people who make a difference in the lives of children and families,” Catholic Charities’ Acting Executive Director Julio Coto said. “Our Agency operates many programs throughout Middlesex County which improve the quality of life for people in New Brunswick and its surrounding communities, and we will continue as a resourceful partner to serve the citizens of New Brunswick and beyond.\"\n\nIn addition to the two early learning child care centers, Catholic Charities programs in New Brunswick include immigration services, a homeless shelter for men, housing for people with special needs who were previously homeless, counseling services, supervised visitation and Unity Square — a 37-block community revitalization project. Last year, Catholic Charities operated more than 100 programs and served more than 50,000 people in the counties of Hunterdon, Middlesex, Somerset, and Warren including 1,458 children who received affordable quality child care services.\n\nFor more information, visit http://www.ccdom.org.\n\nEast Stroudsburg University\n\nMonroe Township resident John Yoffredo was among students at East Stroudsburg University in Pennsylvania recognized by the University's Council of Trustees (COT) on Nov. 29 for their quick action to provide CPR and AED intervention to an individual who experienced sudden cardiac arrest during a workout in the Mattioli Recreation Center on Sept.11.\n\nThe individual in need of medical attention was John Tobin, the evening help desk coordinator for computing and communications and husband of Dr. Doreen Tobin, vice president of student affairs. The immediate action of the students enabled EMT personnel to transport Tobin to the hospital where he later died on Sept. 24, according to a school news release.\n\nCOT Chair Pat Ross thanked the students and applauded their training in CPR and the use of AED equipment. Ross also applauded the University's recent decision to invest in additional AED equipment throughout campus in collaboration with the Gregory W. Moyer Defibrillator Fund organization.\n\nEmporia State University\n\nMike Awad of Piscataway received the Teachers College Scholarship for the current academic year at Emporia State University in Kansas.\n\nFairleigh Dickinson University\n\nFairleigh Dickinson University’s Silberman College of Business is an outstanding business school, according to The Princeton Review. The education services company profiles the school in its 2019 annual business school rankings at www.princetonreview.com.\n\nAccording to Robert Franek, Princeton Review Editor-in-Chief, \"We recommend Fairleigh Dickinson University’s Silberman College of Business as one of the best to earn an MBA. We chose the 252 on-campus MBA programs schools on this list based on our high regard for their academics and our assessment of institutional data we collect from the schools. We also solicited and greatly respect the opinions of 18,400 students attending these schools who reported on their experiences at their schools on our 80-question student survey.\"\n\nThe Princeton Review's on-campus MBA survey asked students at the 252 b-schools about their school's academics, student body, and campus life as well as about themselves and their career plans. The student surveys that were used for this edition were conducted in the 2015-16, 2016-17, and 2017-18 academic years.\n\n“The Princeton Review ranking confirms that the commitment of our faculty and staff to FDU students makes the Silberman College of Business one of the region’s premier business schools,” said Andrew Rosman, Dean of the Silberman College of Business. “We are proud to have been listed again.”\n\nGrove City College\n\nDunellen resident Jillian Breckenridge was among several students at Grove City College in Pennsylvania who presented research in the field of sports medicine at the American College of Sports Medicine Mid-Atlantic Regional Conference in Harrisburg, on Nov. 2 and 3.\n\nImmaculata High School\n\nThree students from Immaculata High School, Bridgette LeBoeuf of Milford, Gerard Rabulan of Somerville, and GianMarco Scotti of Milltown, were named to the All-Eastern Chorus.\n\nMusic Department Chairman Ed Webber said this achievement \"is a testament to the talent of our students, their level of commitment to their music, as well as the dedication of their Chorus teacher Michael Gasko.”\n\nThese students from the Somerville-based school will prepare challenging music that they will perform under the leadership of conductors in this biennial event. Students will spend three days rehearsing with one of five conductors during the Eastern Division Conference of the National Association of Music Educators (NAFME) to be held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in preparation for performances on April 7, 2019, at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, Pittsburgh.\n\nThe NAFME All-Eastern Honors Ensembles, consisting of a concert band, symphony orchestra, mixed chorus, treble chorus, and jazz ensemble, are organized by members of The NAFME. Student participation from each state is determined by a percentage of the total NAFME Eastern Division membership. Each of the state music educators associations oversee the selection process in their state and compile ranked lists of recommended juniors and seniors for consideration.\n\nMiddlesex County Vocational and Technical Schools\n\nIt started with snacks — healthy snacks such as veggie sticks and fruit cups — as a wellness program kicked off at Middlesex County Academy for Allied Health and Biomedical Sciences in Woodbridge.\n\nThe Whole School Wellness Initiative, a pilot program funded by a $15,000 grant from the state Department of Health, will include monthly workshops beginning next month and continuing throughout the school year and for the next two school years.\n\nThe Piscataway Campus of the Middlesex County Vocational and Technical Schools has received a similar grant.\n\nThe Nov. 30 Woodbridge Academy kickoff event began with all 270 students gathered in the gym for an assembly. They showed their approval by snapping their fingers as the rest of the program was explained by master of ceremonies Eric Shandroff — a poet known as Myster E because he’s “a mystery.”\n\nThe biggest applause came when Principal Terri Ann Sullivan announced the snacks. She joked that the choice of two mini-workshops to attend “felt like a very big decision” to her ever-serious students.\n\nBut once they broke into smaller groups for the workshops, the fun began.\n\nThe workshop topics included coloring, holiday crafts, meditation, yoga, and aroma therapy.\n\nMyster E led a session on creative expression, including poetry and rap.\n\n“Rap is something you do; hip-hop is something you live,” he explained. “Rap is just one element of hip-op.”\n\nCarolyn Herbert led a workshop on biomedical drawing — right up the alley of the academy’s students. She explained that anatomical drawing dates back to the Renaissance and Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n“He connected science with nature and art,” she said.\n\nThe Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child Health Project hopes to combat chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension and help students understand the connection between health and academic achievement.\n\n“The focus is on relieving the stress and anxiety of these students,” said Dr. Tracey Maccia, MCVTS director of special education and the project director for the grant. “That’s why we concentrated on mindfulness, meditation, yoga. The research says these activities increase academic achievement.”\n\nNew Brunswick Public Schools\n\nWhen New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced on Nov. 27 that New Brunswick Public Schools — along with the Paterson and Burlington City school districts — would receive grants to implement the P-TECH (Pathway in Technology Early College High School) education model, he set in motion a program that will provide select students with a wealth of new opportunities.\n\nAccording to a news release, these include the chance to earn an associate degree in parallel with high school graduation, and to participate in internship and mentee relationships connected to leading prospective employers.\n\nP-TECH is a STEM-based, public-private partnership co-developed by IBM, which is intended to establish a clear pathway from high school, to college, to a career. New Brunswick Superintendent Dr. Aubrey Johnson already has plenty of ideas about how his district will utilize the program, which in New Brunswick Public Schools will focus on engineering.\n\n“Many of our students are interested in careers in science, technology, engineering, and math, but until now, the path toward the necessary instruction — not to mention finding a job — hasn’t been clear,” Johnson said in the news release. “But this model changes all that. Now, there will be a clearly defined process for our students that can actually conclude with potentially being hired by one of the exceptional companies located in and around New Brunswick. I’m extremely appreciative of this opportunity that’s been presented to our district.”\n\nSpecifically, approximately 30 New Brunswick High School ninth-graders will begin the P-TECH program in September of 2019. As they progress toward high school graduation following their senior year, they’ll be taking STEM-focused, college-level courses. The end result will be that when they graduate from New Brunswick High School, they’ll also be earning an associate degree from Middlesex County College in a specialized field.\n\nAnd they’ll do so without incurring any tuition costs. That expense will be entirely covered by the program.\n\n“It’s no secret that a primary barrier separating some students from college-level courses and an eventual degree is affordability,” Johnson said. “The P-TECH program not only will provide college-level instruction to some very capable, talented students, but it will do so without forcing them into tuition debt.\"\n\nAnd there’s even more to P-TECH. High schoolers participating in the program will have a variety of internship and mentee opportunities related to a range of New Brunswick-area companies. Specifics are pending, but the school district and city already maintain a number of industry partnerships, and we’re looking forward to developing additional relationships of this type.\n\n“As an example, the district has already incorporated Edwards Engineering into the program, and we’re in discussions with many others,” Johnson said. “Through experiences outside the classroom, they’ll provide P-TECH students with a chance to learn a great deal about the intricacies and nuances of professional environments. And some of these students may even be able to start careers with the companies they’re interning with.”\n\nThe P-TECH model already has been effectively implemented in eight states outside of New Jersey — Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Louisiana, Maryland, New York, Rhode Island, and Texas — as well as in several countries.\n\nPaper Mill Playhouse\n\nSince their inception in 1996, the Paper Mill Playhouse Rising Star Awards for Excellence in High School Musical Theatre presented by the Investors Foundation have ignited the careers of many notable performers, all of whom attended high school in New Jersey.\n\nAny New Jersey school that produces a legally-licensed musical between January 17 and April 14, 2019, is eligible to participate. The application for schools to participate is available at http://www.papermill.org/education/rising-star-awards/award-application.html. Applications are accepted on a first-come, first-served basis and only the first 100 schools to apply will be able to participate in the program. The deadline for submissions is Wednesday, Jan. 9, 2019 at 5 p.m.\n\nSaint Peter's Preparatory School\n\nJames C.

After winning their first game in the tournament, they fell to No. 2 Delta College by a score of 2-0. This was the college’s first time at the national tournament since the inception of the women’s soccer program at Union.\n\nThe Lady Owls were awarded the National Tournament Sportsmanship Plaque at the awards portion of the tournament held after the championship game. This award is given by the NJCAA to the team whose actions on and off the field have demonstrated fairness, respect, honesty, unselfishness, and responsibility. In addition, two team members, sophomores Monica Flores of Elizabeth and Lindsey Wielgus of Cranford were named to the All-Tournament team.\n\nThe team finished the season with a 15-2-1 record and finished their regular season ranked eighth in the country by the NJCAA. They were seeded sixth of the eight teams that competed in the national tournament. An incredible season for a group of student-athletes who trained and played hard to achieve this success.\n\n“I am extremely proud of the success of our women’s soccer team this year. The Lady Owls worked extremely hard every day, on and off the field, to achieve the success they had this season. They were a great representation of Union County College on the national stage in both their athletic abilities and their sportsmanship. I am already looking forward to seeing what next year’s team will achieve,” said Head Soccer Coach Angie Correia, who is only in her second year as head coach.\n\nFor more information on the College’s soccer program, visit http://www.unionowls.com.\n\nStudent and School news appears Fridays.

Rutgers University–Newark has been a TheDream.US partner college since 2015 and currently has 41 students enrolled.\n\nThose eligible for this new scholarship program can apply through Feb. 28. Information on how to apply can be found here. Awardees will be notified in late April. The scholarship is expected to fund approximately 10 new incoming Rutgers–New Brunswick students for the 2020 academic year.\n\nThe new scholarship round comes after TheDream.US’s recent release of In Their Own Words, a report summarizing the responses and implications from a national survey of 1,400 TheDream.US Scholars. The survey results underscore education’s importance to scholars, while portraying the uncertainty they face in a difficult immigration climate, particularly with the forthcoming end of DACA and Temporary Protected Status (TPS).\n\n“This partnership enhances Rutgers University’s ability to support students who are DREAMers,” said Salvador B.

This free event is open to the community.\n\nKean University\n\nGetting out of prison is only the first step toward freedom for ex-offenders in New Jersey.\n\nMore than 150 professionals in law enforcement, corrections, criminal justice and social services got a small sense of just how difficult it can be to rebuild your life after getting out of a prison during the recent Re-Thinking Re-Entry simulation event conducted at Kean University Union.\n\nSponsored by the Union County Re-Entry Task Force, in the role-playing exercise, participants followed in the footsteps of a person recently released from prison. They applied for identification cards, birth certificates and bank accounts, and interacted with social services and parole offices. Many landed in a mock jail for failing to follow the rules.\n\n“In programs like this, we try to identify where weaknesses in a re-entry program are, so we can build them into strengths,” said James Drylie, executive director of the School of Criminal Justice and Public Administration. “If you can get someone assistance at the exit level, perhaps they won’t return to prison.”\n\nThe United States has one of the highest criminal recidivism rates in the world. According to a Bureau of Justice Statistics study, five out of six state prisoners released in 2005 were arrested at least once during the nine years after their release.\n\nFormer New Jersey State Sen. Raymond J. Lesniak, founder and president of the Lesniak Institute for American Leadership at Kean University and a leader on criminal justice reform, spoke at the event. He advocated for legislation he sponsored that would initiate a re-entry program at the start of an inmate’s prison sentence, offering incentives for inmates to get vocational training, and individual and group therapy.\n\n“Preparing prisoners during incarceration for re-entry and removing barriers to employment upon release will increase public safety, save tax dollars and save lives,” he said.\n\nBrandon Miles, a sophomore computer science student, volunteered at one of the tables as the “ex-offenders” worked their way through the simulation.\n\n“You see what happens to people when they get out of jail, and they are trying to get their lives together,” he said. “It is a struggle for them. It shouldn’t be so hard. It's shameful.”\n\nMiddlesex County Freeholder visit\n\nFreeholder Director Ronald G. Rios visited South River High School and the Middlesex County Vo-Tech School campus in Perth Amboy in a series of student discussions following the Thanksgiving holiday. In each class, Rios shared details on his journey of becoming an elected official, as well as the role and operation of county government. He also stressed to each class the importance of being an engaged citizen by exercising the right to vote, caring for neighbors and being involved in their communities, urging students to volunteer with local civic and service organizations.\n\nRios said: “We live in a country where anything is possible. No matter what you decide to do when you graduate, find something you love. Make a positive change in people’s lives and find a way to express the change you want to see. Dream big – they do come true.”\n\nPalmer College of Chiropractic\n\nAndrew Campana was named to the summer dean's list of Piscataway at Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa. Students must achieve a grade-point average of 3.5. Campana was also accepted for enrollment for the fall 2018 trimester in the doctor of chiropractic degree program.\n\nPrinceton Academy of the Sacred Heart\n\nThe challenge this year for the National Day of Design centered around food waste. Forty percent of all food is wasted worldwide, yet millions of people still go hungry. In addition, food waste in landfills creates methane gas, which has a serious impact on our atmosphere and climate change.\n\nStudents in fifth grade at Princeton Academy of the Sacred Heart were challenged to come up with a solution to the food waste problem in teams of three.\n\nLinda Hogancamp, middle school math teacher and Greson Torchio, middle school science teacher and curriculum innovator teamed up to tackle the challenge and their students spent four periods following the engineering process (or the design-thinking process) in the same way they did during a recent catapult project and during daily STEM activities in math.\n\nThey defined the problem, brainstormed a solution, conducted research, designed a prototype, built and modified the prototype, and then presented their invention to the class. The boys could have come up with any solution, however, many of them invented ways to convert the emitted methane gas into energy.\n\nOne invention was a spaceship that would vacuum the gas in the atmosphere and use the methane to power the spaceship. Another group planned to create a Princeton Academy Food Bank and even designed a logo for their \"website.\"\n\n“We observed many Sacred Heart goals as the boys were addressing social and sustainability issues that impact us all,” Torchio said. “They were building community with each other, strengthening friendships through this shared experience.”\n\nAdded Hogancamp: “And they were further living the design-thinking process which can be applied to any future problems we face.”\n\nRandolph-Macon Academy\n\nCaelan Johnson of Metuchen was named to the fall dean's list at Randolph-Macon Academy in Front Royal, Virginia. Students must achieve a grade-point average of 3.3-3.99.\n\nRoselle Catholic High School\n\nRoselle Catholic High School will conduct its second annual Race to Replace 5K Holiday Run and Walk on Saturday, Dec. 8, at the school, followed by a luncheon at\n\nthe Kenilworth Inn.\n\nFunds raised from the race will benefit the renovation of the school’s track and field complex, which will be named The Bobby Hoffman Championship Track after Bobby Hoffman, a Roselle Catholic High School (RCHS) student athlete and 12-time varsity letter winner. The track will become part of a new athletic complex which will be named after former RCHS Track and Field Coach Frank Gagliano.\n\n“We’re both excited and proud to host this annual event, which is open to everyone and attracting student, alumni and local family participation. As a community, we’re embracing a very ambitious, yet incredibly important goal — to renovate and improve our campus with a well-deserved state-of-the-art facility for our students,” RCHS Director of Development Dave Boff said in a news release. “We can only achieve this\n\ngoal with the help of our alumni, donors and friends.”\n\nThis year’s event keynote speakers include former Villanova champion hurdler and Olympic Silver Medalist Erv Hall and Coach Frank Gagliano. The race will include team and individual age competitions, with cash prizes awarded for several category winners. T-shirts will be given to the first 300 pre-registrants.\n\nRegistration must be completed online by 3 p.m. Friday, Dec/ 7. To register for the race or make a donation, visit https://www.rosellecatholic.org/race-to-replace.\n\n\n\nEstablished in 1959, Roselle Catholic is a coed, college preparatory secondary school which enrolls approximately 400 students in Grades 9 to 12 from more than 25 different municipalities.\n\nSomerset County Vocational & Technical High School\n\nCaleigh Allen, a resident of the Somerset section of Franklin and a sophomore in the TOPS Program and Graphic Communications at Somerset County Vocational & Technical High School in Bridgewater, recently advanced to the Irish Step Dancing World Championship in Greensborough, North Carolina.\n\nAllen, inspired by her grandmother and great-aunt who were Irish Step Dancers, has been performing competitively for eight years. Dedicated to her craft, she travels to New York and Pennsylvania five to six times per week to practice with each practice lasting about two hours.\n\n“I like Irish Step Dancing because it’s an amazing part of my culture and very challenging,” Allen said. \"Going to the World Championship has been my dream and I'm very excited for the opportunity. Another goal is to go to Ireland and perform in County Limerick where my family is from.\"\n\nThe Educational Services Commission of New Jersey\n\nThe addition of SiLAS (Socially Interactive Learning Avatar Software) to the social skills curriculum is having a positive impact at Bright Beginnings Learning Center (BBLC), a school for students 3-21 with special needs in Piscataway.\n\nFunded by a $250,000 National Science Foundation grant, SiLAS is clearly helping many students identify and implement appropriate behavior in social situations, said BBLC Supervisor Cindy Borell, speaking on the Educational Services Commission of New Jersey’s ( ESCNJ) recent Better Together podcast http://www.teachertube.com/audio/11590, hosted by Coordinator of Communications David Sandler.\n\n“We are seeing significant improvement in the ability of students to demonstrate appropriate social skills in different settings,” Borell said.\n\nSpeech Therapist Marisa Martin Vargo said SiLAS helps students improve verbal and nonverbal skills.\n\n“I have particularly noticed improvement in many students’ ability to make eye contact, which is such an important social skill,” Vargo said.\n\nThe SiLAS software prompts students to select a social interaction like starting a conversation in the cafeteria. Students are led through several steps to create a video reflecting appropriate behavior in a cafeteria setting, and choose from among 20 “emotion-expressing” avatars and background elements to create and record a real time animated video. Students then move away from the computer and participate in role playing exercises, demonstrating appropriate social skills when interacting with others.\n\n“We developed the product because without appropriate social skills, it is nearly impossible to communicate effectively, regardless of how knowledgeable you are in any field,” said SiLAS Founder and CEO Chris Dudick, who previously worked several years in television animation.\n\n“SiLAS engages students with its technology, and teachers work with students in demonstrating their ability to use appropriate social skills in different environments,” he added.\n\nElementary Teacher Cristina Pallone said: “I like that the skills students are learning through SiLAS is helping them learn how to work collaboratively on different projects.”\n\nThe BBLC is part of the ESCNJ, which provides services and programs for school districts statewide. The ESCNJ also operates seven schools in Middlesex County for student’s ages 3-21 with autism spectrum disorders, multiple disabilities, and at-risk behaviors. The largest Educational Services Commission in New Jersey, the ESCNJ coordinates transportation services for approximately 12,000 students across the state, and manages a 1,200 member Co-op Pricing System, the largest cooperative buying program in New Jersey.\n\nThe Wardlaw+Hartridge School\n\nThe Wardlaw+Hartridge School in Edison observed Red Ribbon Week from Oct. 23 to 31. This positive campaign to promote healthy lifestyles was a huge success, according to a news release.\n\nThe Red Ribbon Team comprised of juniors who attended the Young Women’s Conference last May led many of the activities in all three divisions. After the Young Women’s Conference, W+H was given a $500 grant from Wellspring to work in conjunction with their staff to help promote drug awareness and pledge to live drug free.\n\nOn the first day, grades in all three divisions received strips of red paper and each student wrote a “drug free pledge” on a strip. The classroom teacher or advisor linked the strips and the Red Ribbon Team picked up the completed chain from each class or advisory. All three divisions were linked throughout the AP Room at the end of the week.\n\nIn addition, the Upper School shared facts about the dangers of drug use at each morning meeting. Upper School advisory groups also incorporated drug free activities into their Dream Big programs and competed in an Advisory Door Decorating Contest promoting drug awareness and drug free lifestyles. Middle School students created posters to promote similar positive drug free messages. Students in all three divisions enjoyed the opportunity to pose for selfies inside specially crafted red ribbon frames during lunch and meeting periods.\n\nWellspring judged the Upper School advisory classroom doors and provided many of the prizes. Each class winner as well as the overall champion received a dress down day and $5 gift card to Dunkin’ Donuts. Runners-up received a water bottle. Daily giveaways also included pencils, water bottles, red ribbons, bracelets and drug free certificates for each student in all three divisions.\n\nALSO: The Middle School at The Wardlaw+Hartridge School in Edison conducted its fall afterschool STEAM workshop, which focused on programming, coding and design thinking, from Nov. 5 to 9. The students were taught how to use MIT's Scratch programming by a team of instructors that was led by Marc Spivak, director of Technology, and included faculty members Andrea Barnett and Erin Maciorowski and Dr. Corinna Crafton, Middle School Head.\n\nThe program began with a \"This is Me\" project where everyone had to produce a story or game using Scratch to tell something about themselves. Once they were finished, they had to give the game over to someone else for critical commentary. The point of the exercise is to show how programmers need to be willing to give up a piece of themselves in their programs and hard work and allow others to comment to make it better.\n\nThe next project focused on learning how to write clear instructions. The students were asked to physically design a special handshake and others were asked to tie shoes blindfolded only listening to instructions. The goal of the lesson was to teach two things — the importance of being exact in your language and defining your terms for a computer to understand and for others to understand your work.\n\nIn the final project, the instructors broke the students into groups and had them make a \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" project. The team had to write careful notes for others to understand. The group was asked to hand over their work to another group to complete the project using the code and the notes.\n\nThomas Edison EnergySmart Charter School\n\nOn Nov. 2, Thomas Edison EnergySmart Charter School welcomed Bethany Medeiros as the Mystery Reader for the first-grade class at the Franklin-based school. She is the mother of first-grade student, Christopher, and wife of CPT Alex Medeiros, Captain of the Military Police Corp branch of the U.S. Army.. Medeiros came in to class to read to students, and discuss Christopher’s father’s role in the army. She also provided pictures for the students to color.\n\nALSO: TALSO: Thomas Edison EnergySmart Charter School joined students from Hunterdon County Poly Tech, Somerville High School, North Brunswick High School and Newmark High School at the JA Career Success Workshop on Nov. 2 at Raritan Valley Community College. They enjoyed meeting and collaborating with new people while having an opportunity to visualize their future. The organizers of the event, Junior Achievement of NJ (JANJ), deemed the day a success.\n\nJANJ’s mission is to inspire and prepare young people in grades K-12 to succeed in a global economy through real world relationships with business, government, and education partners that can help them develop the employability and financial literacy skills needed to succeed in the 21st century. Their innovative hands-on curriculum – provided at no cost to schools, students, or their families – emphasizes real world learning experiences, and motivates youth to achieve by connecting them with corporate and community role models committed to investing in their future.\n\nUnion Catholic Regional High School\n\nThe Union Catholic Forensics Team, blending a strong group of returning forensicators with some talented newcomers, turned in several outstanding performances on the way to a third-place finish at a Newark Catholic Forensics League Tournament last month at Ridge High School.\n\nIn the varsity competition, Nora Gerlitz and Bridget McDermott reached the quarterfinals in Public Forum Debate, Edwin Rivera placed second in Drama, Kaitlyn Monahan finished third in Declamation, Matt Gomez was sixth in Oral Interpretation, Jack Carolan and Nick Menho placed third in Duo, Shaun Keating finished second in Original Oratory, and James McElroy finished fifth in Student Congress,\n\n\n\nIn the J.V. division, Riley Roder placed third in Oral Interpretation, Abby Hunsinger and Courtney Lucius finished second in Public Forum Debate, Henrique Alves and Aiyana Williams were fourth in Public Forum Debate, and Jenny Liu placed sixth in Oral Interpretation.\n\n\n\nMcElroy was ecstatic with his very strong fifth-place finish.\n\n\n\n\"I've been waiting since freshman year to finally break, so I was overjoyed to finally break and fulfill all my hard work,'' said McElroy, a senior. \"To achieve something that I've been working toward for so long is extremely satisfying and rewarding.''\n\n\n\nFreshmen Hunsinger, Lucius and Roder were thrilled with how they performed in their UC debuts.\n\n\n\n\"Being that it was our first meet, we weren't really expecting anything except to go for the experience,'' said Lucius. \"But the fact that we worked so well together and got as far as we did really meant a lot to us. It was a nice surprise.''\n\n\n\n\"I was very nervous coming into it, but then felt much more confident and ready after our first debate,'' said Hunsinger. \"It was a great experience and it was really good for team bonding.''\n\n\n\n\"It was very exciting,'' said Roder. \"As a freshman you are really expected to break, so for us to place was a great feeling. And all our teammates, friends, and coaches were so great at calming us down and making us feel relaxed and were so supportive. The whole day was such a great experience.''\n\n\n\nThe coaching staff at the Scotch Plains-based school was impressed and proud of how the team performed.\n\n\n\n\"This year is very exciting for UC forensics,'' Head Coach Edward Sagendorf said. \"Our team continues to build and grow as we add more and more enthusiastic new members.''\n\n\n\n\"Our senior captains Nora Gerlitz and Bridget McDermott broke to Quarters and got points toward nationals for the second meet in a row,'' Assistant Coach Sean Gaynor said. \"Our team brings such a positive energy to every practice. I for one couldn't be prouder.''\n\n\n\n\"Our team had a remarkable showing on Saturday,'' added Assistant Coach John Rotondo. \"For one of the first times in our coaching careers, we were finalists in every Speech category we entered. After celebrating our successes this weekend, we are back to work at practice this week. Our goal is to not stay complacent because there is always room to keep improving and perfecting what we've started.''\n\n\n\n\"The team surpassed our expectations this meet with their dedication and delivery,'' said Assistant Coach Katie Sagendorf. \"After meeting a number of times over the past few weeks, students were really able to showcase their incredible talent.''\n\nSubmitted by Jim Lambert.\n\nWorcester Polytechnic Institute\n\nKassidy Utheim of Monroe Township earned NEWMAC academic all-conference accolades at Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts.\n\nStudent and School news appears Fridays.

Harris McDowell, co-chair of of the powerful budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, said at a Friday press briefing. “I don’t want to de-emphasize that it’s a difficult issue. But we just have to get those diversity numbers up.”\n\nMcDowell and other state leaders came together to say, unequivocally, that it is untenable for the state’s flagship university to have only one in 20 students enrolled be black when one in five residents statewide are black. That’s especially true, McDowell points out, when state taxpayers annually hand the school millions of dollars – $120 million in the most recent budget passed in June.\n\n“All our students, including our minority students, need to see a path forward at UD,” said Sen. Margaret Rose Henry. “Many of our students in Delaware are not able to attend their own state school.”\n\nCalls for change are welcome to students like Jasmine Anthony, a Sussex County native who is used to finding herself the only black student in any class.\n\n“I sometimes feel like, whenever I speak out in class, I’m not just speaking for me, I’m speaking for all black people,” said Anthony, who’s majoring in black studies and political science. “I have to be very careful what I say, because everyone is looking at me like, ‘This is what all black people think.’”\n\nUD grad Carl Suddler knows precisely what Anthony is talking about. He calls it “being speaker for your race.”\n\n“As a student, it puts you in this position where you’re more cautious, you’re timid, you don’t want to say the wrong thing,” said Suddler, who graduated from Glasgow High School. “You feel like everybody’s looking at you.”\n\nSeveral black students said they’ve rarely encountered outright, flagrant racism at UD, though incidents do happen. Anthony says she once had a racial slur shouted at her from a passing car, and one of Anthony’s friends said she had the same N-word hollered at her by a white person who tossed a chicken nugget while she walked down a sidewalk.\n\nLast year, when UD played Delaware State University, a historically-black university, racial insults spread on the social media app Yik Yak, drawing condemnation from top UD officials.\n\nYasser Payne, a professor of black studies at UD, often tells black students that adjusting to college life will take more effort for them than it will for white students.\n\n“Your biggest challenge will not actually be drilling down and doing the work, attending class, doing papers,” Payne said. “Your biggest challenge will be with contending with the culture of this place. It will be trying to get the jokes, to find out when it is appropriate to speak or not to speak.”\n\nPatrick Harker, UD’s president the past eight years, is leaving to lead the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, putting the university at a crossroads as it selects his replacement.\n\n“One of the biggest things we need to address is diversity,” said Robert Opila, the incoming president of the Faculty Senate and a member of the search committee. “The student body isn’t diverse. The faculty isn’t diverse. But the state of Delaware has a sizable African American population. It has to change.”\n\nOpila points to a Middle States Commission on Higher Education review of UD released in 2012 that praised UD for many things, but found it lacking on diversity.\n\n“UD is not diverse in either absolute or relative terms,” the report said. “With few exceptions, we believe that the university trails its peers in every measure of diversity in every constituency of the institution.”\n\nIn the fall of 2014, more than 76 percent of UD’s undergraduate students were white. About 5 percent of undergraduates were black, 7 percent were Hispanic, and 4.5 percent were Asian or Pacific Islander. Foreign students, Native Americans and multiracial students made up the remaining 7.5 percent.\n\nBy contrast, 64 percent of Delaware’s population is white, 22 percent is black, 8 percent is Hispanic and 3.7 percent is Asian, Census figures from 2013 show. Native Americans and multiracial citizens make up the remaining 2.3 percent.\n\n“It’s not like we’re in Minnesota,” said Leland Ware, a black professor who has taught at UD 15 years. “We are between Baltimore and Philadelphia, where there are large black middle classes.”\n\nBetween 1998 and 2014, the percentage of Hispanic students at the school leaped from 2.4 in 1998 to more than 7.\n\nMaria Matos, president of the Latin American Community Center, credited Harker’s predecessor, David Roselle, with helping build the Hispanic student body by hiring upper-level administrators, like the provost and admissions staff, who were Hispanic.\n\n“If there’s diversity at the table when people are making decisions, there are different perspectives,” Matos said. “If you don’t have those perspectives, it’s difficult to make decisions that lead to diversity.”\n\nAsian students’ share increased from 2.6 percent to 4.6 percent between 1998 and 2014.\n\nPalash Gupta, President of the Delaware Asian American Business Association, believes more Asian students are attending UD because more Asian families are coming to Delaware. Over the past few decades, Gupta said, immigrants flocked to the U.S. to receive training in burgeoning engineering and computer science fields – and children of those immigrants followed in their parents’ footsteps.\n\n“Delaware is definitely one of those places where there is opportunity,” Gupta said.\n\nWhile Hispanic and Asian students have seen steady gains, the percentage of black students has stubbornly stayed around five percent for decades. In 1998, 5.8 percent of students were black; in 2014, that number was around 5.1.\n\nJames Jones, Director of the Center for the Study of Diversity at UD, says cost is often a factor, because black families generally have lower incomes than white families. The K-12 school system, he points out, also continues to see achievement gaps between white and black students, meaning fewer black students reach the admissions bar. And those that excel may go elsewhere.\n\n“Those black students who are well-prepared and have the economic wherewithal have a lot of options, so we are really competing heavily with other institutions for them,” Jones said.\n\nNationally, there were 17.5 million undergraduates in 2013, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. Of those, 56 percent were white, while almost 2.6 million – about 15 percent – were black. The number of black students nationally doubled between 1990 and 2013.\n\nOther regional institutions have higher proportions of black students: last school year, the University of Maryland was 12.7 percent black, Rutgers was 10 percent black and the University of Pennsylvania was 7.1 percent black.\n\nUD’s 5.1 percent was higher than Penn State’s 3.8 percent.\n\nSchools nationwide that set similar entrance requirements to UD were slightly more diverse. About 7 percent of students were black, according to U.S. Department of Education Data analyzed by Anthony Carnevale, director of the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce.\n\nThese comparisons hardly mean UD is alone in having a less-than-diverse student body. In fact, many schools that require high test scores and GPAs have largely white, affluent populations.\n\n“If you look at the demographics nationally, we are on par with our aspirant and peer institutions when it comes to attracting students who are of African descent,” said Carol Henderson, vice provost for diversity.\n\nUD officials point to the statistics for research-intensive universities that the school either competes with, like Rutgers, Penn State, the University of Maryland, or aspires to compete with, like Ohio State, University of Michigan and the University of Wisconsin.\n\nA group of 34 such universities had an average of 4 percent black students, according to a report run for UD officials by the National Center for Education Statistics.\n\nUD agrees that it needs to do more.\n\nIn February, when Harker went to discuss the school’s state funding in front of the Legislature’s budget-writing Joint Finance Committee, he addressed growing criticism about the lack of diversity from groups like the NAACP.\n\n“In all candor, this has been a long-standing issue for the University of Delaware. It’s an issue that we need to continue to plug away at,” Harker said. “It’s not something we’re going to solve overnight.”\n\nIn 2012, after the Middle States report, the university launched the President’s Diversity Initiative, spurring the creation of new programs and student organizations designed to make the campus more inclusive.\n\nIn June of last year, Harker named Henderson, a UD professor who has authored books about the representation of black people in literature and culture, the school’s Vice Provost for Diversity.\n\n“Diversity is an ongoing process and the university is actively involved in that process,” Henderson said.\n\nHenderson’s job is to not just encourage diversity based on race, but also family income, sexual orientation and gender.\n\nHarker directed Henderson to create a university-wide plan for diversity. She says a draft of that document should be ready by summer’s end.\n\nHenderson points to a host of different programs UD already has created aimed at recruiting minorities and helping them succeed. A few of those programs include:\n\n• The College Readiness Scholars Institute, in which Christina School District seniors and juniors get to visit the school and get help with admissions.\n\n• UD Scholars, in which first generation freshmen come to school early to get acclimated to college life.\n\n• Diversity Enrichment Leaders, specially trained guides who host campus tours for minority students and send personal letters to admitted students.\n\n• Each One Reach One, which pairs first-year black students with upperclassmen.\n\n• NUCLEUS, which includes additional work with academic advisers, weekly e-mails and social media posts about important academic deadlines and campus events, a dedicated study space, work-study positions and opportunities to do research as an undergrad.\n\nSchool officials also point to a long list of student organizations dedicated to minority students, from the Asian Student Association to the Caribbean Student Alliance and the Indian Student Association.\n\nUD has a Center for Black Culture, which lists at least 17 different student organizations for black students, including seven black sororities and fraternities, an NAACP chapter, gospel choir and African Dance troupe.\n\nHenderson argues there’s evidence all these efforts are bearing fruit. Considering all minority races, the past two freshman classes have been some of the most diverse in school history, she said.\n\n“Different affinity groups require different approaches,” Henderson said. “Here at UD we try to take lots of different approaches to diversity.”\n\nSome, like professor Jones, see promise in the work that Henderson is doing and changes in the admission process.\n\n“I don’t believe the efforts and the analytics have been there to support this effort until recently,” Jones said.\n\nBlack students were not permitted to attend UD until 1950, when Louis Redding successfully sued the school on behalf of six black students who were turned down for admission because of their race. Unable to attend UD himself, Redding went on to graduate from Brown University and earned a law degree at Harvard.\n\nThe year after the UD suit, cases Redding had filed in Delaware were combined with suits from other states in the landmark Brown v. Board of Education ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court which found schools that were separated by race were inherently unequal. The decision led to desegregation of public schools.\n\nStudent activists like Anthony, who is president of the UD chapter of the NAACP, acknowledge that UD is taking some action.\n\n“Dr. Henderson is fabulous,” Anthony said. “They’re trying. But more needs to be done.”\n\nFor one thing, Anthony argues the university needs to target more efforts at white students. Many white students and even white professors, she argues, are ill-equipped to have conversations about race.\n\n“It’s a very polite campus,” Anthony said. “Talking about race can be difficult, and people don’t like to do it. But how can we address a problem if we can’t even talk about it?”\n\nHenderson said the university has tried to spur campus-wide conversations about diversity through its First Year Experience program, in which freshmen students read a common book and have group discussions.\n\n“The First Year Experience is one of the rare times that we get all our students together,” Henderson said. “We use that opportunity to have conversations about how we can be a more inclusive academic community.”\n\nThe university needs to hire more black professors, many students and faculty say.\n\nOf the 1,203 full-time faculty at UD last year, only 52 professors were black – less than 5 percent.\n\n“If I come visit campus and it looks like all the students are white and all the professors are white, that’s going to be a worry for me,” said UD grad Suddler.\n\nHe remembers black students at UD finding common places where they could gather to avoid a sense of isolation, like “The Booth” in the Trabant Student Center.\n\nSuddler was a member of the first graduating class in the University’s Black American Studies program, double-majoring in history. He recently earned his PhD at Indiana University – another largely-white school – and will be a visiting fellow at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\n“[Emory's] population is 10 percent black,” Suddler said. “That was appealing to me, to know that it was less likely where I’d run into the situation where my whole class is white students. To know that there’s a better chance there will be other black members of the faculty.”\n\nUD professor Payne argues that the university can’t simply hire its way to a more diverse student body.\n\n“It can be a hard problem for a university to solve because it is sort of an abstract issue,” Payne said. “There has to be a cultural shift that starts at the administration and goes all the way down to the faculty.”\n\nProfessor Ware says continued efforts from top officials won’t get traction unless the broader university community starts to see a shift in mindset.\n\n“Decisions at the staff level, at the department level, have to be made with diversity in mind,” Ware said. “Professor Jones has to look out and see an all-white class of 35 students and think, ‘OK, this is strange.’ And that’s often not the case now.”\n\nContact Matthew Albright at malbright@delawareonline.com, 324-2428 or on Twitter @TNJ_malbright.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2015/07/24"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/in-our-schools/2018/08/23/wardlaw-hartridge-school-students-summer-interships/949127002/", "title": "Student news: Internships help Wardlaw + Hartridge School ...", "text": "Staff Report\n\n@MyCentraljersey\n\nLara Jasti of Colonia and Dazlyn Erachshaw of Iselin, rising seniors at The Wardlaw+Hartridge School in Edison, explored interests in the fields of sustainability, energy and facilities management during a paid summer internship program at their school.\n\nAreas covered in the internship included gaining familiarity with services The Stonehouse Group has provided, identifying opportunities for good return on investment (ROI) and examining sustainable rating programs for the school.\n\n“I enjoyed this internship because it allowed me to gain insight into not only the inner workings of the school’s energy systems, but it also taught the many simple ways that we can all make a difference to preserve energy,” Ercahshaw said. “As a part of the internship Lara and I also attended the EnergyPath Conference, which gave me many different perspectives of the different approaches people all over the world are taking to achieve the common goal of sustainability. In addition, it was really cool to go on the roof to look at the school solar array!”\n\nThe students worked on the Solar Panel Tech Week Curriculum, Commissioning of the Berry Performing Arts Center building, Solar Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) and Energy Procurement. They mapped the Wardlaw+Hartridge carbon footprint at base year, now, and in the future.\n\n“Dazlyn and Lara were excited to explore new topics related to sustainability and energy efficiency that they had not previously known much about. They brought new ideas and asked well thought-out questions that demonstrated their engagement in the topics discussed,” said Terry Duncan, an associate at The Stone House Group who worked with the students. “Not only did they learn about what our company does and the importance of reducing energy consumption on a school campus, but they also strengthened research skills, Excel skills and their presentation skills.”\n\nThe girls analyzed the school’s latest energy bills and performed a high level lighting energy audit to help The Stone House Group understand whether W+H could reduce energy consumption by 15 percent for a second time in the past five years. If the school can reach and sustain the 15 percent energy consumption reduction for a year, it will be eligible to apply for New Jersey's Clean Energy Program's Pay for Performance (P4P) incentive program and receive funds to help offset any equipment costs related to reducing energy consumption.\n\n“I learned many things over the course of the internship, but perhaps the most valuable was the ability to read energy and gas bills, and how to use Excel so that the program works for me,” Jasti said. “I know that these are skills I can use now and later on during life. I enjoyed the opportunity to make a difference and give back to the school community. I enjoyed making new relationships, and learning something new every day.”\n\nColgate University\n\nThe following Central Jersey residents at Colgate University in Hamilton, New York, were named to the dean's list with distinction: Michael Tom of Plainsboro, Suyash Handa, Danielle Blick of Princeton; dean's list for academic excellence: Tori Pozsonyi of Roselle Park, Gwen Koehler of Princeton and Cheyenne Brown of Dayton.

Niche, a company dedicated to comprehensive reports on schools and colleges, neighborhoods, towns and companies, based its rankings on an analysis of academic and student life data from the U.S. Department of Education, along with test scores, college data, and ratings collected from millions of Niche users.\n\nPiscataway’s overall score was A-, with particularly strong showings in the following categories: Teachers, College Prep, Clubs and Activities, Diversity, and Sports. This ranking follows on the heels of other recent awards for Piscataway, including being named a Best Community for Music Education by the NAMM Foundation (National Association of Music Merchants) and named to College Board’s AP Honor Roll for increasing access to Advanced Placement® courses to a broader number of students while maintaining or improving the rate at which their AP® students earned scores of 3 or higher on an AP Exam.\n\nNiche offers an opportunity to see some of the remarks from students who currently attend school in Piscataway. “Piscataway High School is full of opportunities for education, art, sports and so much more. They have a large variety of AP and Honors classes sure to suit your interest, with great teachers for them,” noted one student. “The school's ethnic, racial and religious diversity makes it a place of learning and acceptance that I would not have gotten in most other schools. It is very safe and the teachers and counselors are there to make sure you're okay.”\n\n“We are very happy to see Piscataway recognized by these national organizations and companies,” Teresa M. Rafferty, Superintendent of Schools, said in a statement. “But our true pride comes in seeing first-hand the great work accomplished by our students and facilitated by our staff. It is gratifying to see their hard work acknowledged on a national level.”\n\nPiscataway opens its doors for the 2018-2019 school year on Sept. 4, with a continued focus on academic achievement. At Piscataway High School, for the first time, a select group of students will enter PHS Academies in either Engineering, Biomedical Sciences, Fine Arts, or Performing Arts. These students passed a rigorous application process and will follow course pathways that offer in depth instruction in preparation for post-secondary study and career exploration. PHS Academies aims to allow students to combine specialized study with a full high school curricular and extra-curricular experience.\n\n“In the new school year, our staff will continue to explore new and exciting educational practices,” Rafferty said. “I look forward to seeing the results of our Academies and to working with our staff to develop other exciting opportunities for our students.”\n\nPurchase College, SUNY\n\nThe following Central Jersey residents received their degrees on May 18 from Purchase College, SUNY:\n\nLindsey Raguette of East Brunswick, bachelor's degree in theatre design/technology, cum laude\n\nDeja Robinson of Plainsboro, bachelor's degree in music/performance(voice), summa cum laude\n\nTejaswi Tatineni of Monmouth Junction, bachelor's degree in biochemistry, cum laude.\n\nRamapo College of New Jersey\n\nThe following Central Jersey residents received their degrees from Ramapo College of New Jersey:\n\nCranford: Jonathan Albert, bachelor's degree; Christina Bravo, master's degree; Anastasia Caulfield, bachelor's degree; Jennifer Hornlein, bachelor's degree; Mathieu Ravetier, bachelor's degree\n\nDayton: Kyle Hartshorn, bachelor's degree\n\nDunellen: Jason Hulik, bachelor's degree\n\nEast Brunswick: Faith Freedman, bachelor's degree; Lena Husslein, bachelor's degree; Amanda Khoudar, bachelor's degree; Rachel Lubitz, bachelor's degree; Samanthan Mulvhill, bachelor's degree; Hope Patti, bachelor's degree; Julia Preziosi, bachelor's degree; Edward Santos, bachelor's degree\n\nEast Windsor: Jenna Daniels, bachelor's degree\n\nEdison: Marissa Cooney, bachelor's degree; Jung Lee, bachelor's degree; Hannah Levine, bachelor's degree; Meghan Mudrick, bachelor's degree; Devashri Parikh, bachelor's degree; Stephen Rosado, bachelor's degree;\n\nFords: Jessica Lowrie, bachelor's degree\n\nKendall Park: Christopher Grocholske, bachelor's degree; Jennifer Maister, bachelor's degree\n\nKeyport: Alyssa Bonheur, bachelor's degree; Kurtis Tuohy, bachelor's degree\n\nLinden: Anthony Cockerhan-Williams, bachelor's degree; Matthew Gooney, master's degree; Anaiis Gonzalez, bachelor's degree; Matthew Remblish, bachelor's degree\n\nMatawan: James Buckley, bachelor's degree; Sarah Carew, bachelor's degree; ​​​​​​​Ian Cordova, bachelor's degree; ​​​​​​​Kyle Dy, bachelor's degree; Megan Maddalena, bachelor's degree\n\nMetuchen: Emily Filocco , bachelor's degree; Noreen Rich, master's degree; Mollie Zuvich, bachelor's degree\n\nMiddlesex: Katherine Strang, bachelor's degree\n\nMonroe: Matthew Earl, bachelor's degree; Holden Frandino, bachelor's degree; Christopher Jablonkap, bachelor's degree\n\nNorth Brunswick: Michelle Berls, bachelor's degree; Alissa Sprock, bachelor's degree; Christina Wai, bachelor's degree\n\nOld Bridge: Brandon Kurtzman, master's degree; Jennifer Trabucco, bachelor's degree\n\nPerth Amboy: ​​​​​​​Mikhaela-Jane Lee Ho, bachelor's degree; Gabrielle Medina, bachelor's degree\n\nPiscataway: Rachel Kabus, bachelor's degree; Dayna Lynch, bachelor's degree\n\nPort Reading: Alexus Fuentes, bachelor's degree\n\nPrinceton: Jacob Varga, bachelor's degree\n\nRoselle Park: Kayla Nese, master's degree\n\nSayreville: Caitlin Crabbe, bachelor's degree; Kathleen Fasulo, bachelor's degree; Hallie Meister, bachelor's degree\n\nSomerset: Gabriella Buckley, bachelor's degree; Joseph Ugri, bachelor's degree; Carl Wickman, bachelor's degree\n\nSouth Plainfield: Jenna Bengivenga, bachelor's degree; Sabrina Hemming, bachelor's degree; David Hogan, bachelor's degree; Michelle Keane, bachelor's degree; Carol Pennington, bachelor's degree; Heidi Pilla, bachelor's degree; Michael Polizzano, bachelor's degree\n\nWoodbridge: Jaclyn Krausmane, bachelor's degree; Stefanie Shapiro, bachelor's degree\n\nALSO: The following were name to the spring dean's list: Nicole Aellis of Matawan, Samuel Anklowitz of Princeton Junction, Matthew S.

You have much to teach us: some of you personalize student learning, others engage parents and communities in the work and life of your local schools and still others develop strong and forward-thinking leaders from among your teaching staff.”\n\nThe National Blue Ribbon Schools Program honors public and private elementary, middle and high schools where students achieve very high learning standards or are making notable improvements in closing the achievement gap.\n\n“The selection of Cheesequake Elementary School as our first National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence speaks volumes about our educators, our families, our community, and most of all our children,” said Old Bridge Township Public Schools Superintendent David Cittadino. “Cheesequake School serves as our template of quality in education as we continue to move at a remarkable pace toward recognized excellence throughout our 15 township schools. Having our first Blue Ribbon School coupled with our 15 National Schools of Character in Old Bridge will forever solidify our reputation as a superior school district.”\n\nThe Old Bridge Township Public School District, a National District of Character, boasts 15 National Schools of Character and 15 State Schools of Character by Character.org.\n\nCharacter.org (formerly The Character Education Partnership) selects schools and districts that demonstrate that their focus on character development has had a positive impact on academic achievement, student behavior, and school climate. Selected schools are then expected to serve as models for other schools, helping them to achieve the same results.\n\nThe coveted National Blue Ribbon School award affirms the hard work of educators, families and communities in creating safe and welcoming schools where students master challenging and engaging content.\n\nNow in its 35th year, the National Blue Ribbon Schools Program has bestowed recognition on more than 8,500 schools. The Secretary and the Department of Education will celebrate with the 292 public and 50 private schools at an awards ceremony at the Omni Shoreham in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 6 and 7. The 2017 cohort represents public and non-public elementary, middle, and high schools, including traditional, charter, magnet schools, parochial and independent schools in 44 states, the District of Colombia and Department of Defense Education Activity schools in Okinawa, Japan; Stuttgart, Germany; and West Point, New York.\n\nAll schools are honored in one of two performance categories, based on all student scores, subgroup student scores, and graduation rates:\n\nExemplary High Performing Schools are among their state’s highest performing schools as measured by state assessments or nationally normed tests.\n\nExemplary Achievement Gap Closing Schools are among their state’s highest performing schools in closing achievement gaps between a school’s subgroups and all students over the past five years.\n\n“We are humbled and elated to receive this prestigious award from the United States Department of Education,” said Cheesequake Principal Thomas Ferry. “This is a wonderful moment for our school and the township of Old Bridge. My talented staff and hard-working students have an unwavering commitment to excellence and focus on growth… I am incredibly proud of the staff, students, and parents of the Cheesequake School community and am honored to serve as their principal.”\n\nUp to 420 schools may be nominated for the Blue Ribbon award each year. The Department invites National Blue Ribbon School nominations from the top education official in all states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Department of Defense Education Activity and the Bureau of Indian Education. Private schools are nominated by The Council for American Private Education (CAPE).\n\n“We are proud of the outstanding progress of all of the staff and students at Cheesequake School,” said Assistant Superintendent of the Old Bridge Township Public Schools Kathleen Hoeker. “They set the bar high, and with drive and determination, they have achieved this most distinguished honor. They possess the expertise, skills, and knowledge to serve as role models for others and will serve as such, as the very first Blue Ribbon School in Old Bridge.”\n\nREAD: St. Francis in Metuchen designated Blue Ribbon School\n\nREAD: The good things students are doing in Central Jersey and beyond\n\nREAD: Education news from around the region\n\nBerkeley College\n\nIn honor of Women’s Entrepreneurship Week, Berkeley College, 430 Rahway Ave., Woodbridge, is hosting a free event on Thursday, Oct. 19, featuring panel discussions with prominent women leaders.\n\n\"Women in Media: The Courage to Own Your Story,\" will discuss how women are shaping the news landscape, how small businesses can stand out by sharing their stories, and how entrepreneurs can develop and protect their digital presence.

Kline and GCU President Joseph R. Marbach, is effective as of the signing.\n\nUnder the agreement, qualified Immaculata High School students will: have their undergraduate admission application fee waived; be eligible for academic and partnership scholarships, worth up to $19,000 annually; be eligible for guaranteed admissions to Course Ahead, the GCU five-course college credit program offered to high school students; get personalized admissions advising from GCU on site at Immaculata; and attend GCU college search and financial aid workshops on site at Immaculata.\n\n“Guaranteed admissions represents is an exciting opportunity for GCU and for Immaculata’s students,” GCU Dean of Admissions Justin G. Roy said. “We believe strongly in the power of Catholic higher education and the many ways Georgian Court can provide an experience that mirrors Immaculata’s emphasis on challenging academics and improving the lives of others.”\n\n“Georgian Court has been recognized by these organizations for doing what we do best—expanding possibility in the lives of the students entrusted to us,” said Dr. Marbach. “Indeed, it is faith-based institutions like Georgian Court where students are afforded the luxury of discerning their vocation, the ability to answer their calling, and the opportunity to realize their full potential.”\n\nThe GCU–Immaculata guaranteed admissions agreement reflects Georgian Court’s commitment to collaborating with area high schools and is an extension of GCU’s Catholic Schools Initiative, which launched in 2015.\n\nAs part of the effort, GCU established specific scholarships for Catholic high school students and dedicated two GCU admissions contacts to every Catholic high school in the Trenton, Metuchen, and Camden dioceses. GCU is also offering college-level classes to juniors and seniors at select Catholic high schools. Currently, the university has partnerships with Donovan Catholic; Holy Cross Academy; Holy Spirit High School; Immaculate Conception High School; Notre Dame High School; Trenton Catholic; Saint John Vianney High School; St. Joseph High School; and Union Catholic High School.\n\nFounded in 1908 and sponsored by the Sisters of Mercy, Georgian Court University is Central and South Jersey’s only Catholic university.

It addresses how the choices they make affect them in both positive and negative ways, helping them make good decisions that lead to positive outcomes.\n\nGrades 3 through 5 saw \"Eye to Eye,\" which seeks to give students a straightforward look at how we classify, categorize and label each other. It focuses on the attitudes that lead to cliques and bullying, and tries to help the students to see and value one another for who they are.\n\nThe presentations included video on three big screens that featured personalities and clips from popular TV shows and movies, such as “American Ninja Warrior” and “Boss Baby.” The video portions were broken up by live segments in which the presenters brought student volunteers up to help make key points.\n\nSchool 9 social worker Marissa Hudak, who introduced the presenters for both assemblies at her school, said it’s important to emphasize these types of messages to the students, especially leading up next week's national Week of Respect.\n\nThe assemblies were led by Camfel Productions of Irwindale, California, which has been making student development and bullying prevention programs for 40 years. They spent the morning at Deerfield Terrace School No. 9 and the afternoon at Highland Avenue School No. 10. Each show ran about 40 minutes.\n\nSaint Helena School, Edison\n\nIt began after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas.

Everyone also gathered in prayer in the parish's church. The school community recited the rosary as the students in grades 5 to 8 became the beads holding a white rose. The roses were presented to the statue of the Blessed Mother.\n\nStudents raised almost $1,000 for the victims of hurricanes.\n\n“Pray with Us” will be a monthly event, according to a school news release. On Friday, Oct. 13, participants we will pray for peace in the world in honor of the 100th Anniversary of Fatima.

But these efforts cost money – more dollars than many agencies anticipated as the nationwide opioid and heroin epidemic grows exponentially.\n\nIn response, Highmark Delaware pledged $325,000 in BluePrints for the Community grants Monday to four local organizations, including Gaudenzia, in their fight against what is considered the public health crisis of this generation.\n\n\"This crisis is going to take a village,\" said Perry Patel, chief operating officer for Gaudenzia, Inc., which will receive $75,000.\n\nHighmark Delaware President Tim Constantine announced the funding Monday at the Clarence Fraim Boys and Girls Club in Wilmington. Beneficiaries also included atTAcK Addiction, the Boys and Girls Clubs of Delaware and the Sussex County Health Coalition – which will use the money for treatment, prevention, harm reduction and community planning.\n\nHEROIN: Delaware's deadly crisis\n\nCOURTS:What Delaware's opioid lawsuits may accomplish for the state\n\n\"No organization or entity can fight this alone,\" Constantine said.\n\nFor a state ravaged by heroin and opioids, the funds come at a pivotal time. Already this year, 34 people have died from suspected overdoses, according to the state Department of Health and Social Services. In 2016, 308 people died from suspected drug overdoses, and preliminary numbers for 2017 are expected in the coming month.\n\nDr. Karyl Rattay, director of the state Division of Public Health, noted that the state first began measuring the uptick in 2009 – the first year that overdose deaths surpassed motor vehicle deaths in Delaware. Now, those rates have tripled as heroin and its powerful synthetic lookalike, fentanyl, have spread nationwide.\n\n\"No one entity can resolve this alone,\" she said. \"Government alone cannot reduce the crisis of this epidemic.\"\n\nAtTAcK Addiction will use its $50,000 grant to fill an emergency need for naloxone. The organization has helped get the overdose antidote into the hands of local police officers throughout the state in efforts to save more lives.\n\nLawrence Tan, chief of the New Castle County Emergency Medical Service Division, said the demand for naloxone and overdose response comes with extreme urgency. Because overdoses shut down the respiratory system, first responders must get to a patient fast in order to make a difference.\n\nDespite the large number of resources, Tan said the tactic is necessary to change the course of the epidemic.\n\n\"Our patients have to survive an overdose event,\" Tan said, \"in order to engage in treatment for opioid addiction.\"\n\nThe Boys and Girls Clubs of Delaware and the Sussex County Health Coalition, both of which saw $100,000 in grants, will use their money to further their efforts in preventing and responding to the opioid epidemic.\n\nThe Boys and Girls Clubs will continue their \"Strategic Prevention Framework – Partnership for Success,\" an evidence-based program that targets underage drinking and prescription drug misuse.\n\nFor every $1 invested in a child through the Boys and Girls Clubs programming, about $14 is returned to the state in cost savings related to substance abuse and the criminal justice system, said John Wellons, president and CEO of the Boys and Girls Clubs of Delaware.\n\nIn Sussex County, the health coalition is working with 27 community partners to target Seaford and its struggle with the opioid epidemic. The grant will help them continue these partnerships and implement drug prevention tactics that meet the needs of the community, said Executive Director Peggy Geisler.\n\nOne of the goals, in particular, will be to divert children from ever entering the path of drug use, Geisler said.\n\n\"It is a long-term marathon,\" she said. \"We appreciate the starting gun from Highmark, but we're here for the long haul.\"\n\nContact Brittany Horn at (302) 324-2771 or bhorn@delawareonline.com.

Local governments and the National Guard spent Friday preparing emergency response crews.\n\nThe National Weather Service predicts 18 to 24 inches of snow will fall in New Castle County along the I-95 corridor starting Friday evening, when temperatures drop into the 20s.\n\nOn Friday night, as the first flakes began to fall in southern Delaware, Gov. Jack Markell declared a state of emergency. The declaration allows the governor to take actions to protect public safety and property.\n\nA few hours later, both Wilmington Mayor Dennis P. Williams and New Castle County Executive Thomas Gordon declared states of emergency in the city and county. Williams asked drivers to stay off the roads to make way for emergency vehicles and snowplows.\n\nPublic transportation will also be throttled down on Saturday – DART won't be running any of its statewide bus routes or its transportation services for elderly and disabled residents, the agency announced late on Friday. The Wilmington/Newark SEPTA line will also be suspended on Saturday.\n\nThe weather service declared a blizzard warning for much of the Mid-Atlantic, including New Castle County, through 10 a.m. Sunday.\n\nRoad safety will deteriorate rapidly, the agency said, as high winds blow fallen snow sideways, causing whiteout conditions.\n\nGovernor Markell Issues State of Emergency Announces Level 1 Driving Warning to Begin at Midnight\n\nSustained winds in New Castle County will be between 20 and 30 mph, with gusts up to 50 mph.\n\nThe force of the storm will be stronger at the Delaware beaches, with sustained winds between 25 and 35 mph, and gusts up to 60 mph. Ocean swells directly offshore could build to 22 feet Saturday night, according to the National Weather Service's marine forecast.\n\nSussex County could receive 4 to 8 inches of snow during the weekend, most of it falling Friday night, before turning to sleet and rain during the day Saturday. The precipitation combined with high tides could cause coastal flooding.\n\nBetween 12 and 16 inches of snow will fall on the Dover area, but that amount will taper off farther down Del. 1 in Kent county.\n\nThe Delaware Department of Transportation will have more than 400 snow plows ready to clear Delaware’s primary roads – like Del.1, I-95, and U.S. 13 – before turning onto secondary roads, outside of municipalities and subdivisions. It could take 72 hours from when a snowfall event has ended for DelDOT crews to clear the state’s roads.\n\nThe agency has 43,154 tons of salt in its stockpile, enough for more than three severe storms. It also has contracts with vendors, OceanPort and Chemical Equipment Labs, to replenish the material if necessary. DelDOT has $10 million budgeted for its fiscal year 2016 storm operations, which extends from July 2015 until July 2016.\n\nA severe weekend storm could cost “a few million dollars,” said DelDOT spokesman Jim Westhoff. If annual cleanup work surpasses $10 million, the agency will dip into its general operations money.\n\nWilmington has been preparing for days for the impending storm, brining roadways with salt and inspecting its 13 plow trucks, said Jeffrey Starkey, the city's public works commissioner.\n\n“We have got about 1,800 tons of salt, and we are scheduled to get another delivery tomorrow or Sunday,” Starkey said.\n\nLike DelDOT, city crews will plow primary roads first before getting to neighborhood streets. The city is responsible for 200 miles of roadway, he said.\n\n“Please do not shovel the snow back in the street,” Starkey said. “Stay off the roads and stay safe.”\n\nNewark declared a snow emergency Friday and directed residents to remove vehicles parked on its snow emergency routes, so that its plows can safely operate. Those include Main Street, Elkton Road, Del. 273, College Avenue, Delaware Avenue, Cleveland Avenue, Chapel Street, Casho Mill Road, New London Road, Academy Street, Park Place and Paper Mill Road.\n\n\"This is the first significant weather event of the year and is likely to have a substantial impact,\" said City Manager Carol Houck in a statement. \"Neighbors are encouraged to check on the elderly and bring outdoor pets inside during the duration of the storm.\"\n\nResidents can park their vehicles at the University of Delaware's Trabant garage, located on Main Street across from Deer Park Tavern.\n\nDelaware snowfall totals\n\nMany Delawareans visited local grocery stores and gas stations Friday to stock up on necessities for the weekend. Willis Phelps Jr., a retired National Guardsman from New Castle, said his wife persuaded him to visit the Save A Lot grocery store in New Castle to buy canned goods, fruit, cooking oil and water. She insisted, he said, and gave him the list of items that can sustain them through the weekend.\n\n\"I said, 'We're good,' and she said, 'No, we need to get this stuff and be ready,' \" Phelps said. \"We're now good for a month.\"\n\nNew Castle County government announced Friday that all of its facilities would be closed to the public during the weekend, starting at 6 p.m. Friday. County Executive Thomas Gordon encouraged residents to stay at home after the snowstorm begins, as most snow-related injuries result from vehicle collisions.\n\nJoseph L. Thomas, director of the Sussex County emergency operations center, said the mixture of snow, rain, and strong winds can combine to cause the most dangerous kind of storm.\n\n\"It’s a mix of just about everything, and it’s not going to rush out of here quickly,” Thomas said in a statement. “The public should be prepared for impassable roads, downed trees and power lines, and power outages along the coast as well as inland.\"\n\nThe Delaware National Guard has 125 troops ready to respond to weather-related emergencies in all three counties, said Col. Leonard Gratteri. Troops will be on standby starting 3 p.m. Friday, he said, and will be able to evacuate residents from homes if they lose power, pull vehicles out of flooded areas on the coast, and provide extra security in neighborhoods that have been evacuated. The National Guard will coordinate its response with the Delaware Emergency Management Agency.\n\n\"The majority of these soldiers have done this four or five times in the past,\" Gratteri said. \"This is our bread and butter.\"\n\nTroops will be positioned at National Guard facilities in Wilmington, Smyrna, Georgetown and an armory near Newport.\n\nLive tracking the winter snow storm with #StormDE\n\nThe Delaware Emergency Management Agency will coordinate with the National Guard and other response agencies to ensure that resources are sent where there is need, said Gary Laing, spokesman for the agency.\n\nThere will be at least five evacuation centers in all three counties where residents can go they lose power or their homes are otherwise unsafe. As of Friday night, Laing declined to say where those centers will be because the agency doesn’t want people to show up unless it becomes necessary, he said. Until that possibility becomes a reality, residents should stay in their homes.\n\nThe storm is a “double whammy” of hazardous conditions, Laing said, because both heavy snow and flooding is in the forecast.\n\n“Friday is day three of our preparation for this storm,” he said.\n\nIn addition to Delaware, five states and the District of Columbia declared states of emergency, and schools and government offices across the region closed in advance of the storm. Multiple flights were canceled on the East Coast, including all flights in and out of Philadelphia International Airport, said airport spokeswoman Diane Gerace. Airlines could resume flights on Sunday, but travelers should check with their carriers.\n\nLittle hope that Delaware snow forecast is a dud\n\n\"The airlines got out in front of this storm and proactively cancelled all flights,\" Gerace said.\n\nThe Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority is suspending almost all service around Philadelphia starting at 4 a.m. Saturday.\n\nThe snowfall, which will be heaviest on Saturday in Delaware, could easily cause more than $1 billion in damage and paralyze the Eastern third of the nation, National Weather Service director Louis Uccellini said.\n\n\"It does have the potential to be an extremely dangerous storm that can affect more than 50 million people,\" Uccellini said at the Weather Prediction Center in College Park, Maryland.\n\nSnowfall as heavy as 1 to 3 inches an hour started in Virginia, Tennessee and other parts of the South on Friday.\n\nAlso at the Save A Lot on Friday was Daniel Walchli, originally from Switzerland. He was there with wife, Jazmin, and four-year-old child, to buy bottled water and other items. Before moving to Delaware, they lived in Kentucky and before that in Nebraska.\n\nDelawareans' reactions to this forecast has been a little extreme, he said, but nevertheless, bottled water is important in case the pipes in his home freeze, he said.\n\n\"I come from places where they get a lot of snow,\" Walchli said. \"But it's not the first time they're getting snow here.\"\n\nDelawareans can find out which roads will be passable with DelDOT’s smartphone app. The snow plow tracker will show where trucks are currently working and where they have been. After opening the app, users can click on the traffic map option to see the paths of plows.\n\nMore than 33,000 people have downloaded the app, Westhoff said\n\nFor more information about government preparations and services, residents can call the state emergency management office, at (877) SAY-DEMA, or county emergency response officials at the following numbers:\n\nNew Castle County Office of Emergency Management: (302) 395-2700\n\nKent County Department of Public Safety, Emergency Management Division: (302) 735-3465\n\nSussex County Emergency Operations Center: (302) 855-7801\n\nThis story contains information from the Associated Press.\n\nContact Karl Baker at kbaker@delawareonline.com or (302) 324-2329.

Kyle Evans Gay, a Democrat representing North Wilmington, announced in late August the launch of her campaign for lieutenant governor, resulting in an even more competitive race for 2024.\n\nGay was elected to the legislature in 2020, when she flipped a Republican-held seat. The senator previously worked as deputy attorney general in the Delaware Department of Justice before going into private practice. Her campaign video, which featured her two young daughters, focused on parenting.\n\n“Delaware families know that raising kids is hard work, and it’s harder when the deck is stacked against working parents and working people,\" Gay said in her campaign announcement. \"It’s what drove me to run for the State Senate, where I worked to pass bills that make it easier for Delawareans to afford the basics and raise a family.\"\n\n“Delawareans know we have a lot more work to do,\" she said. \"That’s why I’m running for Lieutenant Governor: to make sure Delaware works for working people.”\n\nEugene Young to run for Congress\n\nEugene Young, former director of the Delaware State Housing Authority, announced this summer that he is running for Delaware’s at-large U.S. congressional seat.\n\nYoung, who made the announcement in a campaign email, has been viewed as a rising star in Delaware politics for years.

Former City Councilperson Justen Wright also vied for the Democratic nomination, garnering 21.5% of the vote.\n\nThe former city treasurer’s mayoral campaign touts a focus on making neighborhoods safer, empowering Wilmington residents and using city resources efficiently.

Margaret Rose Henry, began his campaign for county executive in April of last year.\n\nHenry has over 20 years of experience in public service and has worked for the past three county executive administrations, including as the general manager of the county Department of Community Services under current executive Matt Meyer and a brief stint as the county’s economic development director.\n\nHe has publicly stated his intention to bring transparency to the position and ensure that the county remains “a safe and flourishing home for residents, and an attractive destination for visitors.”\n\nThe Marcus Henry campaign did not directly respond to a request for comment.\n\nKaren Hartley-Nagle, current New Castle County Council President, announced her candidacy on March 24 of this year. She has served as council president for the past six years, with two left in her current term.\n\nHartley-Nagle previously served as a board member of Delaware Common Cause and the Coalition for Open Government and was a member of the New Castle County Board of Adjustment. She has publicly stated that as County Executive, her main focus would be on core services such as public safety, parks and recreation, libraries, land use and infrastructure.\n\nHartley-Nagle has come under scrutiny from her fellow council members in the past, and was under investigation for hostile work environment claims. As Council President she has focused on uplifting the county’s senior population and attracting business development to the area.\n\nCandidate enters Insurance Commissioner's race\n\nKayode Abegunde, a member of New Castle County's Financial Advisory Council, launched his campaign for insurance commissioner.\n\nAbegunde, a Democrat, previously lost in the primary to incumbent Trinidad Navarro, who has served in the role since 2016. The two will likely face off again in the primary.

Others are concerned that seeking treatment could jeopardize their immigration status.\n\nAnd, on top of all of this, Delaware's limited testing capability in the early weeks made it difficult to identify COVID-19 patients and further stop the spread.\n\n“Because of this crisis, everything that hasn’t been addressed before is exacerbating,” said Erika Gutierrez, the Latino outreach coordinator for the Delaware Campaign for Achievement Now, a nonprofit that advocates for student achievement.\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal found that the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in Sussex County is more than double New Castle County's, once adjusted for population size. The number of cases in Sussex County is also doubling faster than it is in New Castle County.\n\nAs of April 23, health officials have confirmed 1,377 cases in Delaware’s most rural county, making up more than 40% of the state total.\n\nDr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Division of Public Health, said the state doesn’t have “one great explanation” for why there’s been a rise in Sussex County cases. But she said those who are unable to social distance, live in crowded homes and are essential employees have a high risk for the chance of infection.\n\nIt’s why the state has drastically increased testing in the area, both at poultry plants and at community sites, and will now provide no-cost housing to some who are sick and unable to self-quarantine.\n\nThe reality is that the poultry plants are just a symptom of a much larger problem in Sussex County, where million dollar homes line the beaches, but socioeconomic and racial issues saturate the county west of the waterfront.\n\n“We are very focused on Sussex County right now,” she said. “For us, this is an all hands on deck approach.”\n\n'This is the moment of truth'\n\nWhen the results finally came in early April, nurse practitioner Emanie Dorival was not surprised.\n\nHer patient – a Haitian immigrant, who works in a chicken processing plant and lives in the Seaford area – had tested positive for the coronavirus, adding to the almost two dozen patients of Dorival’s who have been confirmed with the virus. She said all of her COVID-19 positive patients work at a chicken processing plant.\n\nThe man lives with his pregnant wife, his brother and sister-in-law, who is also expecting. They all have since tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the nurse practitioner.\n\n\"I am really worried,” said Dorival, whose practice primarily serves the Haitian community in Seaford. “I am really worried for the Haitian and Hispanic community, and I don’t feel like there are protections in place.\n\n“I am feeling helpless.”\n\nThe Haitian community makes up about 8% of Seaford’s population. Census data shows more than one-third of Georgetown residents are Hispanic, pointing to southern Delaware’s need for resources and health information to be provided in languages like Haitian Creole and Spanish.\n\nAccording to the Delaware Community Foundation, 80% of Latinos in Sussex County live in poverty.\n\nDorival said she has done outreach with local churches and hosts information sessions through conference calls every Saturday. But she worries it won’t be enough.\n\nHer patients are afraid to get tested, she said. They fear they could be separated from their families due to their immigration status or not be able to return to work. Many of her patients, she said, are the breadwinners for their family.\n\n“All they are thinking,” Dorival said, “is ‘Am I going to lose this paycheck?’”\n\nIn Georgetown, Dr. Rama Peri hears the same concerns.\n\nThe family medicine physician, who primarily cares for the Hispanic community, has been holding drive-thru clinics at local churches in the past month.\n\nOftentimes, her biggest battle is making sure her patients are properly informed about how dangerous the coronavirus is. Some, she said, have incorrectly likened it to the flu. Like Dorival, the physician said many of her patients are afraid to seek help.\n\n“We’re trying to do outreach of ‘You don’t need to be afraid. And no one is out there to try and get you.’”\n\nPeri believes testing has played a large role in why the state is now seeing an increase in cases. And though testing capacity has improved, Peri said she is still limited in testing those who are demonstrating symptoms of the virus.\n\nState Sen. Brian Pettyjohn (R-Georgetown) wonders if more “blanket communication” should have been done earlier in the outbreak, particularly with the Hispanic community.\n\n“Everyone could Monday morning quarterback this till the cows come home,” he said. “I’m sure once this was done there will be a look at what actions the state took … and try to learn from some of the difficulties of what happened.”\n\nRattay, the director of the Division of Public Health, said the state is working with a hotel in Sussex County to provide no-cost temporary housing for those who have tested positive and are unable to quarantine because they live in a crowded home. Right now, about 100 people can be accommodated, health officials said.\n\nRattay said the state does have concerns for black and brown communities in Delaware, which already experience disparities in health outcomes. The state has yet to release race and ethnicity data for those who are COVID-19 positive.\n\nAcross the country, people of color – particularly black Americans – are being infected and dying from coronavirus-related complications at a disproportionate rate.\n\nThis includes immigrant employees who work for wages to keep America – and their families – fed, said Gutierrez, the outreach coordinator.\n\n\"This is the moment of truth,” she said. “This is the moment to change the way our state functions.”\n\nEmployees fear they are at high risk\n\nMuch of the chicken that adorns American dinner tables comes from poultry processing plants like those in southern Delaware, where employees stand side-by-side to debone, gut, and strip each bird of feathers, then cut and package the meat.\n\nThe work is demanding, low-paying and essential, meaning employees have to come into the plant to do their work.\n\nThough plants have taken some preventative steps, some employees say they still fear they are at high risk for infection. These workers have told Delaware Online/The News Journal that the lack of both social distancing and information about which of their colleagues has been infected makes the job more dangerous than it already is.\n\nThese employees also said fewer people are showing up to work either because they are sick or fear they will be infected. The recent preventative measures, including temperature checks, that have been put in place since the pandemic, however, have eased some concerns.\n\nAcross the country, more than 150 of the largest meat processing plants are in counties where the rate of coronavirus infection is already among the nation’s highest, based on an analysis by USA TODAY and the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting of slaughterhouse locations and county-level COVID-19 infection rates.\n\nRates of infection around these beef, pork and poultry plants are higher than those of 75% of other U.S. counties, the analysis found.\n\nUSA TODAY INVESTIGATION:Coronavirus at meatpacking plants worse than first thought\n\nThis week, the state began rapid coronavirus testing at Delaware chicken processing plants, said Dr. Rattay, the director of the Division of Public Health.\n\nThough not mandatory, the tests are free for workers at the plants, which employ more than 6,000 people and offer contract work to hundreds of local farmers.\n\nSince Delaware had confirmed its first case at a plant one month ago, the poultry industry has worked on creating social distancing, screening employees and having workers wear masks, Rattay said.\n\nPerdue Farms plant employees practice social distancing on the production lines “where possible,” according to the company’s website.\n\nA Perdue Farms spokesperson said there have been a “limited number of cases” throughout the company’s facilities.\n\nWhen asked for specific numbers of cases, the spokesperson declined to provide numbers, citing \"privacy under applicable confidentiality guidelines.\"\n\nMountaire Farms said it has its facilities disinfected every night and has “redoubled” efforts to clean and disinfect common areas and cafeterias.\n\nGutierrez has heard from families about how scared they are to go to work.\n\n“While businesses are telling the governor they are complying and doing everything possible,” she said, “our families are not agreeing with that.”\n\nEnvironmental reporter Maddy Lauria contributed reporting to this article.\n\nFollow Meredith Newman on Twitter at @merenewman.

The county executive said that's because the state won't cough up more cash.\n\n\"When the state restores funding, we will put more paramedics in your communities,\" Meyer said, answering a question about Tan's request.\n\nThe problem was underscored last year when the New Castle County Police Department applied for a federal community policing grant this summer and the county pulled back before it could be processed. The $2 million in federal aid would have put 15 officers on foot patrols in the county's troubled neighborhoods, but NCCP won't get them.\n\nIt would have cost the county about $1.4 million in matching funds, and then-Chief Executive Officer Kathy Jennings said the county already was struggling to keep other services online.\n\n\"You have a paramedic service that is very stressed,\" Jennings said then. \"We really need to make sure we're fiscally responsible and that we take into account saving lives and public safety.\"\n\nMORE: Without grant, plans for more NCCo foot patrols canceled\n\nThe number of calls paramedics answer has spiked across the state — in New Castle, as much as 65 percent over a dozen years — and there's no indication Delaware's population will get healthier.\n\nAnd there's not much hope the state will spend more on paramedics.\n\n\"We're to a point where we need some help in the field,\" said New Castle's Tan. \"We have a tradition of excellence and, quite frankly, we do not want to see that degrade.\"\n\nReimbursement from the state once made up more than half of the budgets for the state's three paramedic services. Now, through a convoluted payment system, the state pays less than a quarter of their budgets.\n\nIn New Castle County, that means paying overtime to keep paramedics on the shifts they have to run.\n\nIn Sussex, shrinking state dollars means holding off on plans for paramedics to better reach rural areas.\n\nKent's paramedic boss is holding the line, but without relief he says the system is stressed and, one day, something will have to give.\n\n\"It hasn't gotten better each year,\" said Kent County Director of Public Safety Chief Colin Faulkner. \"After a while, you get conditioned to that trend.\"\n\nCash-strapped\n\nThe statewide paramedic services were created following the Delaware Paramedic Services Act of 1990 with a 60 percent state reimbursement plan for their expenses. Now, 24 percent of the county paramedic budgets come from state coffers.\n\nAnd the state only reimburses old budgets.\n\nTo avoid having to forecast expenses, the state repays paramedic services based on last complete fiscal year of expenditures, usually two years back. For example, 2017's payments were based on 2015's expenditures.\n\nBut paramedics' expenses increase each year, so reimbursements never meet actual expenditures.\n\n\"It has put a hardship on the county,\" said Sussex EMS Director Robert Stuart. \"They've had to come up with the difference in reductions each time.\"\n\nStatewide paramedic expenditures for FY17 reached $42.4 million, but they were given $1.92 million less than 30 percent of that year's total.\n\nThe three paramedic services instead received 30 percent of the $36.03 million they spent in FY15, which is $10.8 million.\n\nThe gap is further exacerbated by the reduction from 30 percent reimbursement to 24 percent started in FY18, so paramedics have been receiving less in their quarterly reimbursements since the end of September.\n\nBut fewer state dollars can't mean less service, and hasn't meant fewer calls.\n\nCalls for service to New Castle County Paramedics went from about 24,000 in 2005 to nearly 37,000 in 2017, according to county statistics. In that time, the county population increased by about 17,500 people.\n\nIn Sussex, paramedics saw a 55 percent increase in calls for service between 2005 and 2017, according to county statistics. There were almost 18,000 more calls to Sussex County EMS last year than 12 years before, during which time the population grew by nearly 21,500 people, many part of a growing retiree community.\n\nFaulkner said calls for paramedic services in Kent County rose 6 percent between 2016 and 2017.\n\n\"We're just busier than we ever have been in the history of the program,\" Faulkner said. \"If the money disappears and each county agency is left having to keep the service together, it's going to be difficult.\"\n\nPicking up the slack\n\nBound by the law to operate a paramedic service, there's been no option for the counties but to pick up a larger portion of the paramedics' tab.\n\n\"The challenge going forward is to maintain those critical services while figuring out a fair division of the costs,\" read a statement from the Department of Health and Social Services.\n\nAnd there's no guarantee of relief in the budget recommendation filed by Gov. John Carney.\n\nHis recommendations for FY19 includes about 10 percent more for grants-in-aid, from which paramedics receive state funding. But the Joint Finance Committee makes the final decision. Some lawmakers are calling for the 2018 cut of 20 percent grant-in-aid money to be restored, which would give the paramedics more.\n\nState law requires a minimum of 140,160 paramedic staff hours per year for New Castle County; 52,560 for Kent County; and 87,600 for Sussex County, and they all exceed it.\n\nBut as reimbursement has declined, counties found themselves on the hook for the costs.\n\nLast year, New Castle County rerouted more than $1 million to help make up for the difference, in addition to the overtime.\n\n\"It's an underfunded mandate,\" said New Castle County's Meyer. \"This is in a world where the expertise of a paramedic is increasing, therefore the salary and wages and benefits of a paramedic are, rightfully, increasing.\"\n\nThe pay for paramedics in New Castle County starts at $40,753 and can be as high as $63,225.\n\nIt can take a full year for a paramedic to achieve National Registry Paramedic certification and another three to nine months to receive a Delaware paramedic certification. Cost for entry-level paramedic training is about $92,000, including salary and benefits, tuition and supplies.\n\nParamedic candidates hired for entry-level paramedic training in New Castle County sign a five-year service obligation contract with the county.\n\nParamedics in Sussex County are offered a starting salary of about $45,555, though employees with college degrees and prior experience are given a bump. Kent paramedics get a $44,043 base salary which goes up to $48,043 for experienced hires.\n\nMORE: Carney proposes pay raises for state workers, no tax hikes\n\nCalls never cease\n\nMedical calls are the bulk of the work for Delaware paramedics.\n\n\"If the state's looking at what they see for a reimbursement investment, think about the downstream healthcare cost if you didn't have paramedic-level services,\" New Castle's Tan said.\n\nIn 2016, NCCo responded to 716 patients in cardiac arrest and 4,220 patients with chest pain, representing some of its most frequent calls for service, according to county statistics.\n\nThe opioid epidemic also is driving calls, including at least 795 overdose incidents in 2016 in New Castle County. And NCCo Paramedics also service Wilmington, where there were nearly 200 shooting victims in 2017.\n\nStaffing at NCCo Paramedics has increased by only eight positions since 2005.\n\nThe job leaves paramedics drained, Tan said. They're at risk without relief, and that can lead to burnout and turnover.\n\n\"You're walking in and out of vehicles every day. The latest generation monitor you carry is about 25 pounds. The drug bag you carry is another 25 pounds. Your patients vary in pounds,\" Tan said.\n\nAnd a part of their burden doesn't disappear after a good night's sleep.\n\n\"One of the requirements of the job is an ability for reasoned judgment while under stress. We're asking people to make some very important decisions that can determine the outcome of your medical emergency,\" Tan said. \"That's a lot of stress. That's a lot of responsibility.\"\n\nSussex's Stuart has one open position on his service of 116 paramedics and support personnel, and he said overtime hours aren't eating up his crews. There were 14 vacancies last year, he said, and he has 10 new paramedics in the middle of training which could have them on ambulances by spring.\n\n\"This looks like a good summer for us, compared to some in the past,\" Stuart said.\n\nWhile day-to-day operations haven't been affected, Stuart said plans for growth have stalled.\n\nSussex EMS was going to shutter a rented facility in Dagsboro which served as a paramedic station and a special operation station. The plan was to move the special operation station to Georgetown and the paramedic station would have gotten a new facility.\n\nThe Georgetown move already was underway when the most recent funding cuts came down, Stuart said. So while that plan is going forward, the new paramedic station is on hold, he said.\n\nThe mean age of Sussex paramedics patients is around 65, Stuart said. Chest pain and difficulty breathing are among the top calls his service answers.\n\nAnd because his county is more rural, it can take longer for his paramedics to get a patient from the scene of a medical emergency to a hospital, Stuart said.\n\n\"Your units are tied up more frequently during the day,\" Stuart said. \"We are going to have to deal with our under-served areas. We're going to have to make some adjustments in the future, and funding will affect how quickly we can do that.\"\n\nContact Adam Duvernay at aduvernay@delawareonline.com or (302) 319-1855 or @duvINdelaware.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2018/01/30"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/local/2023/09/22/tropical-storm-cyclone-16-coastal-flood-warning-delaware-tips/70929184007/", "title": "Tropical storm to bring coast flooding to Delaware. How to stay safe", "text": "As heavy winds and rain are expected to hit the region beginning Friday night, the National Weather Service is predicting \"major\" flooding along much of Delaware's coastline.\n\nIn a Friday morning storm briefing, the agency warned that \"widespread coastal flooding, strong to damaging winds and locally heavy rain are expected.\"\n\nThe worst flooding in Delaware is expected along the Atlantic coast, stretching from Sussex County to southern New Castle County. A National Weather Service map shows the \"major\" flooding designation reaching about the Smyrna area.\n\nThough most of New Castle County likely won't see the worst flooding, the agency said residents will likely still see some. There's also a \"slight\" risk of flash flooding due to heavy rainfall.\n\nFlooding do's and don'ts:\n\nEven without tropical storm conditions, certain areas of Delaware are prone to flooding during periods of heavy rain. This has long resulted in fire department rescues of motorists who either don't realize how deep the water is or who believe their car can get through.\n\nBut the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warns that even 6 inches of water can knock a person down, and just a foot of moving water can sweep vehicles away.\n\nAvoid flooded areas\n\nResidents should never try to walk, swim or drive through flooded areas.\n\nAdditionally, residents should stay off bridges over fast-moving water as creeks and rivers can rise rapidly and wash away bridges with almost no warning.\n\nStay inside your vehicle, if possible\n\nIf a person is trapped in their car during flooding, they should remain inside − unless water begins to rise on the inside. If that's the case, get to the roof.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security also stresses that motorists should never drive around barricades. While this may seem obvious, across the country, drivers routinely disregard safeguards that officials have put in place and thus put themselves and first responders in danger.\n\nMove to higher ground\n\nThe agency also stresses that if a home becomes flooded, residents should get to higher floors. There is always a risk of electrocution when water meets electrical items, so residents should stay away from equipment if it's wet or if they are standing in water.\n\nIf possible, it's recommended to turn off the electricity.\n\nWatch out for debris, unwanted visitors\n\nOnce flood waters have subsided in a home, residents should be wary of what might have been brought inside, including unwanted visitors such as snakes or other animals. If attempting cleanup, the federal government recommends wearing heavy work gloves, protective clothing and boots.\n\nThough flooding may recede from a home, that doesn't mean outside areas will also be dry. Residents should avoid wading in floodwater, which can be contaminated and have hidden debris or other items (though unlike in Southern states, Delawareans typically don't have to worry about creatures like alligators swimming around).\n\nStill, underground or downed power lines can electrically charge the water, creating an electrocution risk.\n\nAdditionally, residents should use generators or other gasoline-powered machinery only outdoors and away from windows to prevent the possibility of carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nPay attention to warnings\n\nFinally, residents should always heed warnings from local officials and follow the recommendations of public safety personnel who are typically better trained for emergencies than the average resident.\n\nFor more information and tips, visit ready.gov/floods.\n\nWHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:Potential tropical storm causes coastal flood warning for southern Delaware, New Jersey\n\nGot a tip?

Margaret Rose Henry, and county council President Karen Hartley-Nagle are running for county executive in 2024.\n\nCurrent county Executive Matt Meyer is running for Delaware’s governor.\n\nHenry has over 20 years of experience in public service and has worked for the past three county executive administrations, including as the general manager of the county Department of Community Services under Meyer and a brief stint as the county’s economic development director.\n\nHe has publicly stated his intention to bring transparency to the position and ensure that the county remains “a safe and flourishing home for residents, and an attractive destination for visitors.”\n\nHartley-Nagle has served as council president for the past six years, with two left in her current term.\n\nShe previously served as a board member of Delaware Common Cause and the Coalition for Open Government and was a member of the New Castle County Board of Adjustment. She has publicly stated that as county executive, her main focus would be on core services such as public safety, parks and recreation, libraries, land use and infrastructure.\n\nHartley-Nagle has come under scrutiny from her fellow council members in the past, and was under investigation for hostile work environment claims. As council president she has focused on uplifting the county’s senior population and attracting business development to the area.\n\nVal Gould pursues run for New Castle County Council president\n\nFormer policy analyst Val Gould, a New Jersey native and University of Delaware alum, announced intentions to run for county council president.\n\nGould currently teaches music at George Read Middle School. Before teaching, they worked as a legislative fellow for the State House Majority Caucus during the 2021 legislative session and as a policy analyst for the Delaware State Senate Majority Caucus during the 2023 legislative session.\n\nGould plans to run on the promises of advocating for sustainable development, creating more affordable housing and ensuring that land use decisions are designed to benefit historically neglected communities.\n\nIf elected, Gould would be the County Council’s first queer and nonbinary member.\n\n“I hope to make my family, friends, community, coworkers and neighbors proud by leveraging my privilege to encourage responsible development and positive, impactful change for those who need it most,” Gould said. “I truly believe that, if we strive to uplift everyone, our communities and businesses will thrive.”\n\nWilmington mayoral races take shape\n\nFormer city treasurer Velda Jones-Potter was the first to announce a run for Wilmington mayor in March 2023.\n\nJones-Potter unsuccessfully ran for the city seat in 2020, trailing incumbent Mayor Mike Purzycki by just over 1,000 votes in the Democratic Primary. Purzycki captured 42.9% of the total vote, compared to Jones-Potter’s 35.6%. Former City Councilmember Justen Wright also vied for the Democratic nomination, garnering 21.5% of the vote.\n\nIn October, Purzycki announced he would not seek a third term, citing his age and desire to spend more time with family. That opened the door for Delaware Gov. John Carney to consider a run for office.\n\nCarney is unable to seek a third term as Delaware governor due to term limits. City mayor has a limit of three terms.\n\nThe governor has not said whether he’s officially running for Wilmington mayor, but year-end campaign finance reports show Carney’s mayoral campaign fundraising outpaced those of Jones-Potter.\n\nThe former city treasurer’s mayoral campaign touts a focus on making neighborhoods safer, empowering Wilmington residents and using city resources efficiently.\n\nMORE:Carney expresses interest in Wilmington mayor after Purzycki announces he won't run in 2024\n\n3 Democrats, Republican vying for Delaware governor\n\nThree Democrats and a Republican are running in Delaware’s gubernatorial race.\n\nMeyer, who has been county executive since 2016; Lt. Gov. Bethany Hall-Long, who has spent two decades in public office; and Collin O’Mara, a former Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control Secretary and current CEO of the nonprofit National Wildlife Federation, are all running on the Democratic line in September.\n\nO’Mara was the first democrat to file his candidacy in the race for governor on March 13. Meyer filed two weeks later. Hall-Long has yet to file her candidacy, but, if elected, she would be the state’s second female governor, following Ruth Ann Minner, who served in the early 2000s.\n\nLongtime police officer Jerrold Price is seeking the Republican nomination.\n\nCAMPAIGN FUNDRAISING:Meyer leads among Democratic gubernatorial candidates, raising over $675K in donations\n\nPrice is a retired New York Police Department officer, who moved to Delaware’s coast about 20 years ago and resides in Lewes. According to his campaign website, he later joined the Rehoboth Beach Police Department and has an extensive career in law enforcement.\n\nThree spar for lieutenant governor\n\nThree candidates familiar to Delaware politics are seeking the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor.\n\nState Sen. Kyle Evans Gay, who represents North Wilmington; state Rep. Sherry Dorsey Walker, who represents the city of Wilmington; and Debbie Harrington, a retired U. S. Army colonel and state Democratic Party vice-chair, are running for Delaware lieutenant governor.\n\nGay was elected to the legislature in 2020, when she flipped a Republican-held seat. The senator worked as deputy attorney general in the Delaware Department of Justice before going into private practice. Her campaign video, which featured her two young daughters, focused on parenting.\n\nThe representative ran for the seat in 2016, coming second to now Lt. Gov. Hall-Long in the 2016 Democratic primary.\n\n“As Lt. Gov. I will continue to be a boots-on-the-ground advocate for all Delaware citizens,” Dorsey Walker said in her announcement last year. “My decision to announce on Juneteenth is symbolic of the advancements made by people of color, women, and those who seek the freedom that comes with change for the advancement of all mankind.”\n\nHarrington, a Middletown resident who served in the Army for 25 years, became an advocate for children with disabilities in her retirement. Her daughter is visually impaired.\n\nHarrington has run unsuccessfully for other elected offices. She is a vice chair of the state Democratic Party, vice chair of the Middletown Police Advisory Board and part of Delaware State University's Board of Trustees, according to her website.\n\nDorsey Walker or Harrington could become the state’s first Black woman to serve in the role if elected.\n\nRepublican challenger enters U.S. Senate race\n\nWilmington resident and businessman Eric Hansen is the latest candidate for Delaware's soon-to-be-vacant U.S. Senate seat.\n\nHansen, who built his career at Proctor and Gamble, Johnson & Johnson and Walmart, is seeking the Republican nomination for the post, which is being vacated by U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, a Democrat, who has decided to retire.\n\nBlunt Rochester, if elected, would become the first Black Delawarean and the first woman to represent The First State in the U.S. Senate – and possibly the fourth Black woman ever in the country’s history.\n\nREAD:Lisa Blunt Rochester, Delaware's sole congresswoman, will run to fill Carper's Senate seat\n\nBlunt Rochester announced her intentions to run shortly after Carper announced his retirement plans in May last year. Carper publicly called on the congresswoman to run — admitting she probably should have done so years ago.\n\nDr. Mike Katz, an anesthesiologist and former Delaware state senator, has filed to run as an Independent in the U.S. Senate race. Katz, a former Democrat, created the Brandywine Valley National Scenic Byway Advisory Board, according to his campaign website, and helped restructure the Delaware Health Information Network.\n\nKatz is running on a platform of dismantling partisan politics and what he calls \"America's two party problem.\" If elected, Katz would be Delaware's first Independent U.S. Senator.\n\nWith candidates on three different party lines, they all will face off in the general election Nov. 5.\n\nU.S. House race down to two Democrats, one Republican\n\nThe race for Delaware's at-large U.S. House of Representatives seat has narrowed down to three contenders, with two Democrats vying for a spot on the general election ballot.\n\nRepublican Donyale Hall, a veteran, Dover resident and small business owner, is the sole Republican nominee running for the seat formerly held by Blunt Rochester, and is guaranteed a spot in the general election.\n\nHall, who is biracial, has run for political office before. She said she brings a “unique” perspective to the seat having served in the U.S. Air Force in support of Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm; being a survivor of domestic violence; and overall understanding others who feel as though they have been forgotten or overlooked.\n\nThe Democratic Primary has narrowed to two contenders after state treasurer Colleen Davis withdrew from the race in February, citing personal and family health concerns. She has since endorsed state Sen. Sarah McBride, who will face former Delaware State Housing Authority Director Eugene Young in the primary.\n\nYoung has been viewed as a rising star in Delaware politics for years. If elected, he would be the first Black man to represent Delaware in Washington, D.C.\n\n—If McBride — the country's highest-ranking transgender elected official — were elected to the Congressional seat, she would become the first trans person elected to federal office, catapulting the already nationally known politician to an even bigger stage.

Of the 20 cases, 15 occurred in western Sussex County.\n\nThe outbreak claimed the lives of two Seaford men. The most recent was a man believed to be in his 40s. His death was preceded by the death of a man believed to be in his 50s on Friday. Both men’s names and ages have not been released by DHSS, pending notification of next of kin, Fredel said.\n\nDuring the same time, Kent County and New Castle County accounted for eight suspected drug overdoses, she said.\n\nRELATED: Where Delaware gets its heroin\n\nPatrolman 1st Class Christopher Story with the Laurel Police Department wouldn’t say if a \"bad batch\" of the drug was going around in Sussex County. Though he did say police agencies in the area are actively trying to determine the cause of the overdose spike.\n\n“At this time, we don’t know if these are all the same stamps linked to the overdoses,” he said. “We are still trying to identify.” Most heroin bags (or wax baggies) are marked with a “personal stamp,” to reflect the dealer or the area.\n\nHe did say there has been an increase in calls over police dispatch this past weekend related to overdoses.\n\nBeginning Thursday, emergency crews responded to seven reported overdoses in a 24-hour period in the Seaford and Laurel areas.\n\nLast month, four fatal overdoses hit New Castle County in five hours.\n\nFredel stressed the importance of treatment for those battling the addiction epidemic. The Department of Health and Social Services offers a 24/7 Crisis Helpline at (800) 345-6785 in Sussex and Kent counties, or (800) 652-2929 in New Castle County for people seeking drug treatment. Additionally, there are two drug addiction treatment centers in Delaware, in New Castle and southern Kent counties.\n\n“If someone calls us and says ‘I’ve been on heroin for months, or years …’ we will work with them to first get them to a detox (center) and then into a residential treatment facility,” she said.\n\nAnyone who witnesses an overdose is asked to call 911. Under Delaware’s 911/Good Samaritan Law, people who call 911 to report an overdose, cannot be arrested for low-level drug crimes.\n\nMichael Barbieri, director of the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health, alerted treatment providers statewide of the surge in overdoses in western Sussex. Hospitals and urgent care centers were notified of the increase by the Division of Public Health’s Emergency Medical Services, which oversees the state’s paramedic service.\n\n“This spike in overdoses is alarming,” said Dr. Kara Odom Walker, cabinet secretary for DHSS and a family physician. “Even one use of heroin or another opioid can end a life.”\n\nThe National Prescription Drug Takeback Day on April 29 will give Delawareans a safe way to dispose of prescription drugs at local police departments and other participating agencies. The goal is to both rid homes of addictive medications and educate citizens on the potential for misuse of these drugs.\n\nIn a high percentage of cases, Fredel said discarded prescription painkillers kept in homes are “sometimes the gateway, unfortunately, for people to experiment with heroin down the road.”\n\n“We want to get the medication out of people’s houses … purses … medicine cabinets … drawers and just give people a safe way of disposing of them,” she said.\n\nThe statewide effort run in conjunction with Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), has resulted in the collection of more than 60,000 pounds of medication, Fredel added.\n\n“The way Delaware comes out of the heroin epidemic is restricting people from getting addicted in the first place,” Fredel said.\n\nAdditionally, multiple police departments and select Walgreens are accepting unused or expired medication. A full list of drop-off locations in Delaware can be found on the Drug Enforcement Agency's website: deadiversion.usdoj.gov.\n\nDHSS reports in 2016, 308 people died from overdoses in Delaware, almost triple the number who died in traffic accidents.\n\nIn 2015, a total of 228 people died from overdoses in Delaware, six more than the 222 overdoses deaths reported in 2014.\n\nOn Friday, Sgt. Richard D. Bratz, director of the Public Information Office for the Delaware State Police, reported that as a result of the spike in heroin overdoses, the Sussex County Drug Unit is actively investigating and seeking information on any of the drug overdoses.\n\nPolice ask anyone with information to contact Sgt.

In all, some 3,700 drug prosecutions, including 500 felony cases, could be imperiled.\n\nDrug dealing is behind much of the rising tide of violence that has plagued Wilmington, New Castle County and other parts of the state. Community leaders and police have expressed frustration that the scandal has undermined police efforts to crack down.\n\nProsecutors are hoping to salvage some pending drug cases by avoiding taking any to trial right now, according to state prosecutor Kathleen Jennings, who said a trial would force the state to disclose details about the criminal investigation of the state's Controlled Substances Lab and potentially undermine the investigation.\n\n\"And we simply will not do that,\" she said.\n\nOther attorneys have said if a judge were to rule in a case right now that security at the lab was so compromised that any drug evidence held there was irreparably tainted, it could scuttle most or all of the pending drug cases from 2010 to 2013.\n\nIn effect, prosecutors are sacrificing cases now to avoid losing them all. They are hoping that the investigation, when complete, will offer a chance some cases can be salvaged.\n\nDelaware State Police have given no indication when the investigation, which involves a time-consuming and tedious audit of more than 22,500 drug evidence bags, will be completed.\n\nIn the meantime, more than just routine drug possession cases are being affected.\n\nIn one case this month, all drug charges against a man a police affidavit said was caught with 5,900 bags of heroin, $10,000 in cash and five guns, including an AK-47, were dropped before trial. That left only weapons charges against the defendant, and he was subsequently acquitted.\n\nHad that man, Kevin L. Harris, been convicted of the original charges, he faced a life sentence. Instead, he will be back out on the street after he completes a short sentence for a probation violation.\n\nSince the drug testing lab inside the Medical Examiner's Office was closed on Feb. 20, the state has been sending drug evidence to an out-of-state lab for testing. This week, Attorney General Beau Biden proposed establishing a new, independent state crime lab.\n\nWidener Law professor emeritus Tom Reed said prosecutors dropping drug charges in the Harris case is \"a big flag that something is going on here.\"\n\nHe said Harris was clearly a \"heavy-duty bad guy,\" and there has been no indication to this point that any heroin had been tampered with at the Controlled Substances Lab, so he found it strange that prosecutors backed away from the case.\n\n\"Where there is smoke, there is fire ... this is really beginning to shape up to be a mega-scandal,\" he said, adding problems at the lab may be worse than suspected.\n\nWilmington City Councilwoman Maria Cabrera said the Harris case made her blood boil because it has been very difficult to get the community, which has been torn by drugs and violence, to put its trust in authorities to help clean things up. \"And now we have to work even harder to build and earn that trust,\" she said.\n\nCabrera said she is equally upset that all the hard work of the police in the Harris case and other drug cases has been in vain. People are constantly questioning if the city police are doing their job, she said, and are asking, \"Why aren't they locking these guys up?\"\n\nHere, the police did their job, she said, and locked a man up, yet he will soon be back on the street.\n\n\"And where are they going to go? Right back to the community,\" she said, adding that they are likely to cause the very same problems for which they were locked up.\n\n\"For us, it's like starting back at square one,\" said New Castle County Police Chief Elmer Setting. \"If the people we investigate and ultimately arrest are released, unless they had some kind of rehabilitation, they're going to come back out and ply their trade.\"\n\nWhen the scandal at the state's drug testing lab first broke in late February, Superior Court President Judge James T. Vaughn Jr. put a 30-day hold on all drug prosecutions set for trial.\n\nProsecutors then asked for an additional 60-day delay, saying they needed more time to investigate. But Vaughn declined to extend the delay, siding with defense attorneys who argued all cases should move forward on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSince April 1, at least 16 felony drug cases have been delayed, dropped or resolved with a plea on the day of trial in New Castle and Sussex counties, according to the Delaware Attorney General's Office. That does not count cases in Kent County, any that were resolved before the day of trial or the 63 instances where defendants have been informed that drug evidence in their cases had been tainted or has gone missing.\n\nNo drug prosecutions have made it to a courtroom anywhere in the state since April 1.\n\nIn Sussex County, attorney John Brady said dozens of marijuana cases also have been dropped in the Court of Common Pleas. \"In misdemeanor court, everything is being dropped down or waived,\" he said. Attorneys in Kent and New Castle counties said the same has been happening in misdemeanor courts there.\n\n\"And in Superior Court, they [prosecutors] are now being more reasonable,\" Brady said, with pleas being offered to drug defendants.\n\nIn one case typical of the last-minute offers, Wallace Sanchez was facing charges in New Castle County Superior Court involving dealing crack cocaine. He faced a sentence of up to 15 years in prison.\n\nBut on the day his case was set to go to trial, April 15, prosecutors offered him a deal to a sentence of time served if he admitted guilt. He agreed and was immediately released.\n\n\"It was a good deal,\" said Sanchez's attorney Brad Manning, who added that while defense attorneys have been looking to force hearings on the drug lab scandal, he had to consider the interests of his client first.\n\n\"There is never a good time to be a defendant, but if you are going to be a defendant facing a drug charge, there are some opportunities available right now because of the state's situation with the medical examiner,\" said Delaware public defender Brendan O'Neill.\n\n\"What I'm seeing is different charging decisions, a different logic,\" attorney John Deckers said, in terms of resolving drug cases since April 1.\n\nThat was clear in the Kevin Harris case. According to court papers, he was the target of a weekslong investigation that began in January 2012 with a tip to police that he was moving large amounts of heroin.\n\nPolice set up surveillance on Harris and multiple vehicles outside the Colony North Apartments. Once police moved in, they seized more than 5,900 bags of heroin in a stash vehicle at Colony North; a small amount of heroin, two guns and $10,000 in cash in the nearby apartment of Harris' ex-wife; and three more guns, including an AK-47, in the apartment's storage unit, according to a police affidavit.\n\nHowever, without the drug charges, prosecutors could not refer to any heroin or money that were seized. At trial, the state struggled to connect Harris to the seized guns since Harris did not live at the apartment where they were recovered.\n\nDeputy Attorney General Sarita Wright said she respects the jury's verdict but said it was \"unfortunate that the jury could not see all the evidence investigators collected in this case.\"\n\nDefense attorney John Barber said that at the two-day trial, no one testified to seeing Harris touching or holding any of the guns. The closest prosecutors came to tying Harris to the guns was the fact that one was recovered in an H&M bag that also contained a receipt for men's shoes that the state claimed Harris had purchased.\n\nProsecutors showed the jury a surveillance video that they claimed was of Harris buying the shoes, but Barber disputed that the grainy video actually showed his client.\n\n\"They didn't have the evidence to connect him to any of it,\" Barber said, adding his client also disputed the dropped heroin allegations.\n\n\"Kevin Harris maintains his innocence,\" Barber said.\n\nHad Harris been convicted in the original case, he was looking at a life sentence as a habitual offender. Harris remains in prison, serving a two-year sentence for a probation violation related to his Feb. 15, 2013, arrest.\n\nState prosecutor Jennings conceded that the case against Harris was weaker without the drug charges and acknowledged that prosecutors have been avoiding taking any drug cases to trial since April 1. She said this is, in part, because prosecutors do not have the detailed answers that defense attorneys are looking for about the size and scope of the scandal at the Medical Examiner's Office.\n\nAnd in the cases where prosecutors do have answers, Jennings said they do not want to compromise the ongoing investigation of the drug thefts at the lab.\n\nIn the Harris case, Barber filed a detailed motion before trial that, among other things, sought details on the ongoing criminal investigation at the state's drug testing lab and how it may have affected his client's case. He also raised chain-of-custody concerns related to the drug evidence and sought to call suspended Delaware Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Richard Callery and other lab employees to the stand to answer questions.\n\nHarris had at least seven prior felony convictions, and Jennings described him as \"a bad ... violent, dangerous guy.\" But she said prosecutors made the decision to go forward without the heroin charges, because to put that case on – and open up the state to questions about the drug lab – \"would have compromised what we are doing.\"\n\n'I realize this can't go on forever.'\n\nMore than three months since the first problems were discovered at the drug lab and more than two months since officials closed it down, no suspects have been arrested, and no charges have been filed.\n\nBoth prosecutors and state police have been either unable or unwilling to say when the investigation will come to a close.\n\n\"They haven't told us a damn thing about what is going on,\" said William Deely, head of the Delaware Public Defender's Office in Kent County. \"And the way they are not telling us is by dropping cases,\" he said, or by making favorable plea offers.\n\nSo far, the only employee who has faced any kind of public disciplinary action is Chief Medical Examiner Callery, who was suspended with pay on Feb. 25. Callery is also the focus of a separate criminal investigation for alleged misuse of state resources to operate a private business as a consultant.\n\nJennings said the uncertainty about what happened at the lab is why the state pressed hard for an additional 60-day delay in all drug trials.\n\n\"We have this robust, intense criminal investigation into what happened, and we are not going to sacrifice the integrity of that investigation and the ability of that investigation to get to its goal by being placed in a situation where we are answering questions about the investigation itself,\" Jennings said.\n\nSo, to protect that investigation, Jennings said prosecutors are cutting favorable plea deals and dropping charges.\n\n\"And we will try to get continuances in cases where we can reasonably ask [for a delay],\" she said, adding that a delay was not possible in the Harris case because it was so old.\n\n\"I realize this can't go on forever,\" Jennings said. \"Very difficult decisions have to be made, balancing the integrity of that investigation and the goals of getting to the bottom of this against what we take to trial at this point,\" she said.\n\nSome defense attorneys, like Patrick Collins, said prosecutors also might be reluctant to take certain drug cases to trial because they are concerned about a judge making an early ruling that could result in the widespread dismissal of most, if not all, of the 3,700 pending drug cases from 2010 to 2013.\n\nCollins and others have argued that there is already enough evidence of compromised cases for a court to find that the problems at the Controlled Substances Lab were so widespread and the security lapses so large that all of the lab's work from 2010 to 2013 has been irreparably compromised.\n\nProsecutors recently confirmed details about the lab's security shortcomings, first detailed by The News Journal in an April 6 front-page story. In an April 16 letter from Deputy Attorney General Caroline Cleary to the Delaware Public Defender's Office, the state confirmed \"access to the drug evidence locker [at the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner] was not restricted to, or monitored by, a single individual\" and \"The door to the locker was left open at times.\"\n\nThe letter also reveals that there were significant discrepancies in record-keeping related to drug evidence at the lab. \"In some cases, evidence logs could reflect a discrepancy of hours or days between the time the police log notes evidence as having been submitted to the OCME and the time the OCME records it as having been received,\" wrote Cleary.\n\nProsecutors also have said they are hoping to take many of the pending drug cases from 2010 to 2013 to trial. If drug evidence bags show no signs of tampering and the contents of the bags match the original reports filed by police, the state expects to move forward with prosecutions.\n\nBut if a judge rules that drug evidence has to be tossed out because of security lapses at the lab, regardless of evidence of tampering – which is apparently what authorities concluded in a similar drug thefts case at a crime lab in San Francisco – that could quickly have a snowball effect, said Collins.\n\nOther defense attorneys would immediately cite that ruling and press for dismissal of other drug cases, Collins said, and a handful of dismissals could turn into hundreds.\n\n\"All we are getting is that the investigation is ongoing … we are just left to make assumptions about when this will come to a head,\" said attorney Deckers.\n\nLongtime Wilmington defense attorney Eugene Maurer Jr. said that while the state has clearly been putting off a confrontation in court about the problems at the state's drug testing lab, \"eventually it is going to happen.\"\n\nPoliticians, meanwhile, are also clamoring for answers.\n\n\"I really think that the Attorney General's Office, at this point, is really downplaying this in an effort to make this go away,\" said Senate Minority Whip Greg Lavelle, R-Sharpley.\n\n\"We now have a public safety issue as a result of multiple failures to oversee this office ... A hell of a lot of money and resources went into these cases that are now compromised, and even more will be needed to dig out from this problem,\" he said.\n\nThe silence has to end at some point, Lavelle said. \"At some point, there has to be accountability.\"\n\nSen. Robert Marshall, D-Wilmington West, said there is statewide concern and anger about failures at the state's drug testing lab, but he said he has confidence in the Attorney General's Office and the courts to \"do the right thing.\"\n\n\"We are all outraged at what has occurred, yet we need to work our way through it and make corrections in the system so it won't happen again,\" he said, voicing support for Biden's proposal for a new state crime lab separate from the Medical Examiner's Office.\n\nAs for answers, Marshall said officials from the state Department of Health and Social Services, which oversees the medical examiner, and the state Department of Safety and Homeland Security will be discussing the drug lab situation at a state Senate hearing on Wednesday.\n\nStaff writer Adam Taylor contributed to this story.

Anyone who is not blind can see that,” said Darla Booher of Greer, president of the Carolina Independent Auto Dealers Association and an opponent of the Senate roads plan. She said the main issue is how to fund the repairs “or if there really is a need or the funds are already there.”\n\n“I think the Legislature has to look at that first and make sure the money already being collected is being used properly,” she said.\n\nBill Meyer of Moore, who supports a tax hike, has spent years cataloging the misery of driving over ruts and potholes, broken and sunken pavement, even rebar, using photos shot when he worked as a deputy sheriff in Spartanburg County.\n\nThe resulting library of images and videos tell the story of bad roads in a state filled with crumbling pavement and substandard bridges.\n\nMeyer said he hopes lawmakers will provide enough money this year to fix not just congested interstates but rural roads that he says have been patched multiple times but not repaired.\n\n“My feeling is there is not enough money to do what needs to be done because the roads have gotten so bad,” he said. “And with the current funding, I don’t see it getting any better.”\n\nAt stake, many lawmakers argue, is not just fixing the state's broken pavement and bridges but reducing highway carnage from accidents that gave South Carolina the top fatality rate in the nation in 2015.\n\nHouse lawmakers earlier this year approved a plan to raise the gas tax by 10 cents a gallon over five years. With some new and increased fees, the House plan would raise almost $600 million a year.\n\nUpstate lawmakers voting against the plan included Rep. Eric Bedingfield of Belton, Rep. Mike Burns of Taylors, Rep. Jason Elliott of Greenville, Rep. Bill Chumley of Woodruff, Rep. Neal Collins of Easley, Rep. Dan Hamilton of Greenville, Rep. Jonathon Hill of Townville, Rep. Davey Hiott of Pickens, Rep. Joshua Putnam of Piedmont, and Rep. Garry Smith of Simpsonville.\n\nThe Senate Finance Committee amended the plan to increase the gas tax by 12 cents per gallon over six years, which supporters say would cost the average motorist about $60 more per year if driving 10,000 miles. That plus various fees would raise almost $800 million. Upstate senators on the panel voting against it included Sen. Tom Corbin of Travelers Rest, Sen. Danny Verdin of Laurens, and Sen. Shane Martin of Pauline.\n\nOn Wednesday, an attempt in the Senate to give the roads bill priority status fell just shy of the votes needed. Talks are likely to continue between both sides to see if a compromise can be reached.\n\nMuch of the reason citizens see decay on South Carolina's primary road system has been because lawmakers have funneled much of DOT's money to interstates and certain types of secondary routes, State Transportation Secretary Christy Hall told The News.\n\nDOT officials say they have tried their best to maintain the state's roadways with the resources given to them.\n\nIn fact, while the state’s highway agency has tripled its spending on pavement over the past decade, it still has spent less per mile and per capita than almost any state in the nation, records show.\n\nThe lack of spending has caught up with the state, Hall says, leaving a majority of roads in such bad condition they must be rebuilt, at a cost of $8 billion. Still, other organizations that have reviewed the state's roads using federal highway data have reported a much smaller percentage of bad roads and have placed the state in the middle of the pack when ranking states on road conditions.\n\nFollow the money\n\nOne of the chief opponents of a gas tax increase has been Sen. Tom Davis.\n\n“Spending on South Carolina’s roads has skyrocketed during my time in the Senate,” the Beaufort Republican said in a commentary printed in Greenville News on March 15. “When I first took office in 2009, we spent $1 billion a year; now, after steady increases, road spending is $2.2 billion. Yet despite this 120 percent increase, many of our state’s roads remain in bad condition. Which begs an obvious question: Why aren’t we getting the results the people deserve given the amount of their money we are spending?”\n\nDOT officials say there are multiple answers to Davis’ questions.\n\nFirst, they note that Davis’ starting date was during the recession, when DOT revenues had bottomed out. The increase is not as big if comparing to 2006, they say.\n\nDOT's budget, however, grew from $1.8 billion in the current fiscal year to a proposed $2.1 billion in the fiscal year starting in July. DOT officials say that is because previously approved major projects, including a port road, Volvo plant infrastructure and interstate projects, are entering the construction phase, where more money is spent.\n\n“The DOT budget has grown in recent years,” Hall told The News. “But the bulk of those funds are designated or earmarked for certain types of projects. For example, the largest increases to the agency were designated for interstate widening projects and also for bridge replacement. Very little was for resurfacing.”\n\nOther increases, she said, were due to so-called pass-throughs, such as money for the port access road, Volvo plant infrastructure or State Infrastructure Bank reimbursements.\n\n“So yes, the budget has increased,” she said. “However, it has been legislatively directed for certain types of activities which are primarily not the repaving of our primary roads.”\n\nAnd the primary road system, which carries almost half the state’s traffic “basically has been reduced funded for an extended period of time,” she said.\n\nFormer state Sen. John Land, a Calhoun County Democrat and former state highway commissioner who served in the Legislature from 1976 to 2012, argues that it is the Legislature, not the transportation department, that is to blame.\n\nDOT came to the Legislature in 1987, he said, and made an “absolute” case for raising the gas tax by 10 cents a gallon.\n\n“We gave them 5 cents and told them to take that money and build new roads,” Land said. “So we didn’t do a thing for them, and they have existed from 1987 up until now simply by using maintenance money for construction and to match the federal dollars.”\n\nHe said those opposed to raising taxes or fees often say the solution is to rid the agency of fraud or waste and then restructure it.\n\n“That’s a hide-behind,” Land said. “If you can’t fight it head-on, you say, ‘I’m for it but let’s get all this fraud out of it or restructure it.’ That’s the same argument that’s going on. I’ve heard it so many times I can predict it, always from the Republicans, always from the conservatives.”\n\nRoad building, he argued, is a “long-term proposition,” meaning the roads that should be planned now are for 30 years in the future.\n\n“What we have done is gone back to planning on what we’re going to do tomorrow and there is just not enough money there,” he said. “We have gone to the point now where this state will never catch up with its road system.”\n\nSmall state, big system\n\nSouth Carolina has the fourth-largest state-maintained road system in the nation, with more than 41,000 miles. Primary routes are major state and U.S. roads and make up 9,517 miles. Federal-aid secondary routes are less traveled local roads. They make up 10,370 miles. The last category are the least traveled secondary roads, many of them short roads, some in front of schools or cemeteries or dead ends. These are not eligible for federal aid and comprise almost 21,000 miles.\n\nAbout 7 percent of the state's traffic rides on the non-federal aid secondary routes, which lawmakers for years have wanted to return to local governments. But local officials have remained suspect of accepting anything from the state without guaranteed funds to maintain them.\n\nIn the 1990s, DOT launched an accelerated road improvement program called 27-7, aimed at building 27 years of projects in seven years, primarily with the aid of bonds. The program built or improved many roads but also left the state with a debt it is still paying today.\n\nOver the next decade, DOT was hit with a string of problems, including fallout from the Great Recession, increased material prices and cash-flow problems.\n\nStill, revenues increased. According to DOT’s financial statements, revenues grew from $1.1 billion in 2008-09 to $1.6 billion in 2014-15. This year, the agency is expected to collect between $1.7 and $1.8 billion.\n\nMost of the agency's money comes from fuel taxes, either from the state’s gas and diesel taxes or federal grants derived from the federal fuel taxes.\n\nBut much of the revenue is not spent on roads.\n\nFor instance, out of $601 million forecast for this year’s gas tax revenue, the agency will net $463 million because of a series of deductions mandated by law. They include almost $75 million for county transportation committees, nearly $18 million for the state Department of Health and Environmental Control, close to $1 million for the state Department of Agriculture, $3.7 million for the Department of Natural Resources watercraft fund and almost $15 million for an international fuel tax agreement, according to DOT.\n\nOf $841 million in non-federal revenue, according to DOT, the agency was required by law this year to spend $88 million for a port access road, almost $80 million for the State Infrastructure Bank, $8 million for the Cross Island Toll Road operations and $128 million for non-federal aid for secondary roads. The Infrastructure Bank is a separate agency that finances major transportation projects in the state using bonds.\n\nOut of that same pot, according to the agency, DOT also will spend $64 million for debt service, $270 million for routine maintenance, including employee benefits; $90 million for engineering and project management; $11 million for planning and mass transit; $27 million for general administration, including benefits; $8 million for facility repairs; and $133 million for federal match funds. The federal government reimburses the state 80 percent or more for any eligible project cost.\n\nWhat is left for pavement this year is $212 million on federal aid-eligible road widening, principally interstate projects, and new construction, and $268 million on federal aid-eligible pavement rehabilitation and resurfacing projects. Another $179 million will be spent on bridges eligible for federal aid.\n\nMost of the state's pavement projects are expensive. According to a report by the Legislative Audit Council, the Legislature's watchdog, the average resurfacing project cost per mile of lane in South Carolina projects it surveyed was about $161,000. For new construction that cost was $1.4 million.\n\nWatchdog: Fraud, abuse not the problem\n\nIn 2016, the LAC looked at DOT revenues and spending for the years 2006 through 2015. Its auditors found no significant waste or fraud. Instead, they reported the agency was not able to keep up with inflation.\n\n“Total SCDOT revenues have increased approximately $160 million over the last 10 years, with some years showing a significant decrease due to swings in revenue sources caused primarily by the recession and underlying construction activity,” the LAC reported. “In our review, we found that revenue sources are not increasing enough to cover rising costs due to inflation.”\n\nThe LAC reported that DOT revenue had grown by 12 percent over 10 years. But over the same time period, it found, the Consumer Price Index rose 18 percent and an index measuring prices for capital projects was up 34 percent.\n\n“This indicates that revenue sources are not growing at a pace to cover increasing costs due to inflation,” the LAC concluded.\n\nStill, the agency has almost tripled its spending on resurfacing and rehabilitation, the LAC found.\n\nThe amount spent by the agency on pavement projects, not including new construction or road widening, according to the LAC, grew between 2008 and 2015 from $129 million to $326 million. According to DOT, the agency completed 684 miles of rehabilitation or reconstruction projects in 2009-10 and 973 miles of the same type of projects in 2015-16.\n\nThe agency spent about $321 million in 2016, according to DOT, on road rehabilitation or reconstruction projects on 638 miles of interstates (counting one direction only) and $76.6 million for rehabilitation and reconstruction projects on 335 miles of state roads, counting both directions.\n\nThe LAC also noted that one out of every four dollars going to DOT was spent on debt service or sent to other agencies, such as the Infrastructure Bank, county transportation committees, metropolitan planning committees and regional councils of government. In fact, the LAC said DOT spent $182 million on metro planning committees and regional councils in 2015, although only $36 million was required by federal law to be spent. That money went for capacity projects \"and may not address statewide needs,\" LAC said.\n\nDOT officials said spending above the required amounts for metro and regional agencies is the result of a policy decision made by the DOT commission in the 1990s. Those are planning organizations, such as the Greenville-Pickens Area Transportation Study (GPATS), responsible for recommending local and regional transportation projects in urban and rural areas.\n\nHall wrote in her response to the LAC report that South Carolina has developed a “bookend” approach to funding roads, with one bookend the funding of interstates by DOT and the Infrastructure Bank and the other bookend the funding of low-volume, local or neighborhood streets by the county transportation committees and the non-federal aid program.\n\n“This bookend approach, combined with 25 percent of the agency’s revenues being diverted and the overall decline in purchasing power, has limited SCDOT’s ability to address its core priorities,” she wrote. “As a result, the primary system which carries half of our traffic and serves a vital role in the movement of people and freight in both our urban and rural communities has significantly eroded in condition.”\n\nThe LAC found problems with the way the agency ranked projects in priority. SCDOT did not have a single prioritization list encompassing all types of projects, had advanced lower-ranked projects over higher-ranked projects without written justification, could not provide the raw data used to calculate scores for the criteria used to rank projects, and could not provide the methodology to determine criteria scores, the LAC reported.\n\nDOT, in its LAC response, took issue with the criticism over its prioritization process, saying it was impractical to put all projects on a single list. But it said it was reviewing its processes and was willing to make improvements.\n\nLand said the Legislature has waited too long to fix the state's infrastructure problem.\n\n\"Our roads are in a mess,\" he said. \"It's just like not taking care of your health. You can't wait until you're 75 and all of a sudden say, 'I'm going to start doing the things I should have done when I was 35. It's too late.\"\n\nSouth Carolina spends less in maintaining its roads than most states but its road system is better than many, according to various rankings that have peered at the state's infrastructure.\n\nBut the reviews contain qualifications that make exact comparisons difficult.\n\nThe Reason Foundation conducts a regular review of state transportation agencies’ spending and ranks them based on their efficiency, a weighted measurement of how much is spent to maintain the mileage in each system.\n\nFor 2013, the latest year of data analyzed by Reason, South Carolina spent the least per state-maintained mile, at $35,286. North Carolina ranked 3rd while Georgia ranked 24th.\n\nAs the study notes, state-maintained systems vary greatly and not just because of the state’s size. Some states are responsible only for some major highways, whereas in others, such as South Carolina, they must maintain interstates, primary routes and all secondary routes.\n\nIn another national comparison, by the Associated Press using federal highway agency data, South Carolina ranked 49th among the 50 states and the District of Columbia in per capita highway spending for 2013. North Carolina ranked 35th and Georgia ranked 51st.\n\nTo gauge DOT’s efficiency in pavement projects, the South Carolina Legislative Audit Council compared its contracts with contracts in other Southeastern states.\n\nThe LAC found that South Carolina’s average cost per lane mile for resurfacing was $161,236 compared to a national average of $160,979. For new construction, South Carolina’s average cost per lane mile was $1.4 million, compared to $1.3 million for other states.\n\nMany agree that South Carolina's roads are in need of repair but organizations that have studied the state's road conditions have offered different numbers and rankings on road quality.\n\nWhile DOT says 54 percent of the state's roads are in poor shape and need rebuilding, other groups score the percentage of bad roads much lower and place the state in the middle of the pack or better nationally.\n\nThe latest to evaluate the state's roads is TRIP, a national nonprofit research group based in Washington, D.C., that analyzed federal highway data and concluded that 29 percent of South Carolina's major locally and state-maintained urban roads and highways are in poor condition, while 35 percent are in mediocre condition. Another 19 percent are in fair condition and 17 percent are in good condition, TRIP said.\n\nRocky Moretti, director of research and policy for TRIP, told The News that states like South Carolina conduct more comprehensive analysis of roads so their numbers will differ.\n\n\"It's not a question of right or wrong,\" he said. \"They are looking at different things.\"\n\nHe said the data TRIP uses is based on smoothness of the highway, measured by vibration recordings in vans driving over the roads. The federal highway data and data used by TRIP, he said, is a sampling of the state's roads.\n\n\"We use it because it's all 50 states,\" he said. \"But each state individually has more sophisticated pavement management programs that look at the ride quality, what is underneath the surface, how strong is the substructure.\"\n\nSince 2008, according to DOT’s records, the percentage of road miles in good condition has stayed relatively the same, at or just below 20 percent. But that percentage varies by type of route. Interstates, for instance, have the highest percentage of good miles, at 66 percent in 2014, according to the LAC, while the least traveled secondary routes have the least, at 12 percent.\n\nOver the past decade, the percentage of road miles in poor condition has grown, DOT’s figures show, from 31 percent in 2008 to 54 percent currently.\n\nDOT grades its roads using physical assessments conducted by teams traveling in vans. The measurements examine rutting, roughness and pavement distress and are boiled down into a pavement quality index. From that, DOT can rate the health and remaining life of its pavement. The least would be zero and the most ranges from 16 to 20 years. About half the state's mileage has no years remaining in service, according to DOT.\n\nInterstates are inspected each year, while primary routes and some secondary routes are studied once each three years. The least traveled secondary roads are examined once each six years.\n\nThe Federal Highway Administration takes a snapshot of states' roads by measuring the percentage of miles in urban and rural interstates and major rural primary routes that are rated rough. In South Carolina, interstates make up about 851 miles of the system and are in better shape than all other roads in the state. So defining the state's road conditions based on this snapshot will offer a different view than the state's measurements.\n\nThe Reason Foundation ranks states in each of its reports using the federal data. For the most recent report, South Carolina ranked 9th lowest in the percentage of rural interstates in rough condition, 11th lowest in urban interstates and 7th lowest in rural major routes, meaning most states had higher percentages of their roads rated as rough.\n\nThe American Society of Civil Engineers uses the roughness index to give a single percentage for the state's roads.\n\nAccording to its latest report, 16 percent of South Carolina’s roads are in poor condition. That ranks the state 29th in the percentage of poor roads, tied with Massachusetts and Delaware. Only 4 percent of Georgia’s roads were rated in poor condition, while 13 percent of North Carolina roads were.\n\nConnecticut had the highest percentage of poor roads, at 57 percent, followed by Rhode Island at 54 percent and California with 50 percent.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation used 2013 ASCE data to rank states last year in the percentage of roads in poor and mediocre condition.\n\nSouth Carolina’s 40 percent ranked 37th among states, meaning 36 states had higher percentages of their roads rated poor or in mediocre condition.\n\nBut TRIP's study found that bad roads overall cost South Carolina drivers $5.4 billion yearly in damage and accidents costs and congestion delays, or an average of almost $1,400 per driver.\n\n\"Essentially what it points out is the state doesn't have the resources to maintain the system that it has,\" Moretti, of TRIP, said of its ratings. \"The state needs to improve the conditions of roads, highways and bridges. It needs to make significant improvements in roadway safety.\"\n\nSome of the criticism aimed at the state Department of Transportation over state House and Senate plans to raise the gas tax actually concerns an agency separate from DOT.\n\nThe State Transportation Infrastructure Bank, which has financed major road and bridge projects in the state since 1997, has for years been a magnet for controversy, called a \"shadow\" DOT, and lambasted for acting out of political influence.\n\nLawmakers last year sought to address issues with the bank by requiring that all its project decisions also be approved by the DOT board, which must apply certain objective criteria when ranking projects.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped critics of plans to raise the gas tax from using past examples of the Infrastructure Bank's actions as ammunition in pushing for more reform.\n\nSen. Tom Davis, a Beaufort Republican who opposes the current Senate road-funding plan, wants to abolish the Infrastructure Bank and make DOT a cabinet agency, calling past spending by the organization a \"Third-World political-spoils\" system.\n\nHe mentions two highway projects to prove his point. One highway in the Pee Dee, known as the Pamplico Highway, was a two-lane road in Florence County that was converted to four lanes with the aid of $100 million in Infrastructure Bank funding. An official with an organization criticizing the bank was photographed lying down in the middle of the road to illustrate how little traffic there was on it.\n\nAt the same time, Davis said, the late Sen. Clementa Pinckney asked officials for $54 million to widen a four-mile stretch of U.S. 17 in Jasper County from two lanes to four, arguing that traffic fatalities on the road required its widening. He said that request was not granted.\n\n\"It is why, despite substantial increases in funding, our roads remain in poor and substandard condition, and why simply focusing on the revenue side of the equation will never be the answer,\" Davis said.\n\nOther lawmakers also have called for the Infrastructure Bank to be abolished or its functions somehow blended with DOT.\n\nA prime criticism is that a majority of the seven-member board is appointed by two lawmakers, the House speaker and the Senate president pro tempore. Davis argues that means two legislative leaders effectively control financing that has totaled more than $4 billion over the years.\n\nLast year's reforms also lowered the threshold of Infrastructure Bank projects to $25 million from $100 million to allow more counties and communities to submit applications.\n\nMuch of the bank's early financing was targeted at major new projects, including the Ravenel Bridge, the state's most expensive transportation project, and freeways in Horry County designed to aid the Grand Strand's traffic flow.\n\nCritics contended that most of the financing went to a handful of counties, while supporters noted that those counties supplied a local match and submitted projects with state significance.\n\nDavis and others argue that the issue is one of accountability, their primary rub with the Senate's road-funding plan.\n\nDana Beach, executive director of the Coastal Conservation League, which has argued that reform should come before funding, also would like to see the Infrastructure Bank abolished, saying the state does not need two transportation agencies.\n\nDOT restructuring\n\nDaniel Brennan, state director of Americans For Prosperity South Carolina, has argued for reform, too, saying a poll shows most South Carolinians do not want the gas tax or fee increases.\n\n“As the roads have gotten worse, there have been some roads that have gotten wider even though they have very little traffic,” Brennan said. “There have been some that have gotten repaved even though there have been very few potholes. You kind of have to ask yourself, if the secretary was accountable to the governor who is accountable to all the citizens of the state, would some of these projects get done? And I think anybody with common sense would say absolutely not.”\n\nDavis, Brennan and others want lawmakers to allow the governor to appoint the DOT secretary and abolish the commission. Currently, the governor appoints the commission that then hires the secretary. But the commissioners must be nominated and screened by lawmakers, who must also approve any commissioner's removal by the governor.\n\nA House-passed bill would allow the governor to appoint commissioners without being screened or nominated by lawmakers -- a plan some legislators fear would put too much power in the hands of the governor.\n\nIt would also raise just shy of $600 million more per year for roads, chiefly by raising the gas tax by 10 cents per gallon over five years. The sales tax cap on cars also would be raised from $300 to $500 and other fees would be raised or created, such as a special fee for hybrid vehicles.\n\nA Senate plan under consideration would raise almost $800 million more per year through a bevy of fee increases, new fees and an increase of 12 cents in the gas tax over six years, in addition to indexing the tax for inflation. The plan would cap the tax so it could never exceed the gas tax in any North Carolina or Georgia county. The bill at present does not change any DOT governance and Republicans have signaled they will oppose it unless it contains more work on DOT reforms.\n\nRick Todd, president of the South Carolina Trucking Association, which supports raising the gas tax for road repairs, said while he favors accountability, he thinks some people opposed to the roads plan are simply against any increase in the gas tax.\n\nHe said those who do not travel much or travel only certain local routes “may view the world and see the needs completely differently than someone who just puts a lot of miles on the car.”\n\n“I understand people complaining about 'I don’t want to pay for road repairs in another part of the state I never go to.'\" But those other parts of the state, \" can have the same people too,” he said.\n\n“Every other state has bit this bullet. It’s frustrating we’re not willing to do it ourselves.”\n\nHe said people often do not think about the myriad of expenses in running DOT that are necessary not only to support paving and bridge projects but also to comply with state and federal laws, including engineers, planners, attorneys, and maintenance workers and supplies.\n\n“I represent businesses,” Todd said. “And businesses understand overhead. I think as citizens we should trust the professional staff at DOT who try their best to be good stewards of the public’s resources. And to those who don’t want to give them the benefit of the doubt, I think they are being unreasonable. I think a lot of the doubt is sowed by the naysayers, people who are just anti-tax.”\n\nBrennan said he doesn’t believe corruption exists at DOT and praises the agency's director, Christy Hall. But he does believe a small group of officials “are misusing state funds.”\n\n“I think the system is set up to fail,” he said. “And I think it has shown itself over and over again.”\n\nMichelin North America President Pete Selleck, who has spoken in favor of the House plan, takes a different view, saying the state's infrastructure problem is a \"crisis.\"\n\n\"The road conditions every year are getting worse,\" he said. \"And they're getting worse at a faster rate. I think the Legislature over the last couple of years has come to grips with the issue. They recognize now something has to be done. They recognize they are the only ones that can do it and they recognize there are no simple, politically expedient solutions. They've got to do the right thing for the long-term.\"\n\nBattle lines\n\nDrivers and vehicle owners may be the ones most affected by any increase in the gas tax but a bevy of groups have lined up to support and oppose any such legislation.\n\nAt press conferences, legislative hearings and other Statehouse battlefronts, groups on both sides of the issue have spoken up.\n\nOn the pro side to raise the gas tax and fees, the South Carolina Alliance to Fix Our Roads has led the fight for several years.\n\nThe group is a coalition of businesses and business groups impacted by the state’s transportation system, including paving companies, materials firms, trucking companies and the Upstate Chamber Coalition.\n\nThe Alliance argues that poor roads affect citizens' quality of life, costing time, money and lives.\n\n\"Road conditions will only worsen if increased investment is not made available at the state level,\" the group argued recently in an email. \"Continued inaction on a long-term transportation plan will result in greater road deterioration and lead to a competitive disadvantage for our state. South Carolina cannot afford to wait another year for sustainable road funding legislation.\"\n\nOther groups that have spoken in favor of raising funds for roads include the S.C. Trucking Association, the S.C. Agribusiness Council, the S.C. Economic Developers Association, the S.C. Maritime Association, the S.C. Manufacturers Alliance, the S.C. Chamber of Commerce and the Carolinas Associated General Contractors.\n\n\"The South Carolina business community has long known the cost of our deplorable roads in South Carolina,\" Ted Pitts, president of the state chamber, said recently. \"If you look at the cost of time, the cost of lives and the cost of jobs, there's actually a real cost to South Carolinians you can put in a dollar figure. A lot of the debate that will occur will be about charging South Carolinians more for fixing our roads when really the dialogue should be about how much it's costing South Carolinians to do nothing.\"\n\nExecutives with individual companies also have spoken this year in support of the legislation, including Selleck, of Michelin North America; Lou Kennedy, CEO of Nephron Pharmaceuticals; and Roger Schrum, vice president of Sonoco.\n\nThe opposition against a gas tax hike has been led by Americans For Prosperity South Carolina, the state branch of the grassroots, anti-tax group with chapters in 35 states. Last year, the group campaigned against the gas tax in senators’ districts, leading some senators to complain about misleading robocalls.\n\nThe group this year says it opposes the Senate road-funding plan unless and until DOT is made a cabinet agency and the Legislature enacts tax reform.\n\n\"Everyone agrees that the roads and infrastructure here in South Carolina are in bad shape,\" Brennan, state director of the group, told an audience recently. \"We also agree that the legislation passed by the House, which is a lot more than a gas tax increase, is not the answer to the root cause of the transportation problems we face in our state.\"\n\nThe state, he said, has gone into debt by billions of dollars for \"pet projects and corporate welfare over the last decade.\"\n\n\"Our transportation system hasn't received the attention it deserves because the organizational structure is set up to fail,\" he said. \"We have an exceptionally qualified DOT secretary in Christy Hall. But she cannot bring about the change needed at DOT until she only answers to one boss, the governor who is accountable to all the people of South Carolina.\"\n\nAlso opposing such legislation has been the SC Club for Growth, Concerned Veterans for America-SC, the South Carolina Policy Council, the Carolina Independent Auto Dealers Association ,which is opposed to the proposal to double the sales tax cap on cars, Coastal Carolina Conservatives, as well as various TEA parties in the state.\n\nDianne Belsom, president of the Laurens County Tea Party, is among the opponents.\n\n\"We are taxed enough already,\" she told a rally recently. \"I think we the people are sick of sending our money to the state and the federal government only to see it mismanaged and wasted. We are calling for our Legislature to do the right thing and not pass some ridiculous tax increase without the necessary reforms.\"\n\nR.J. May, executive director of the SC Club For Growth, said the group supports a \"sensible solution to our failing infrastructure.\"\n\n\"When our roads, bridges, ports and railways are strong, we stand to benefit from more and higher paying jobs,\" he said. \"But our roads problem is not a funding problem. The roads bill is not a roads solution. It is a tax increase on hard-working South Carolinians, one of the largest tax increases in state history.\"\n\nLast year, Americans For Prosperity volunteers made 30,000 calls in addition to sending mailers and post cards to oppose a gas tax increase, according to the organization.\n\nState lobbying records show some of the leading groups on the issue have registered lobbyists but the records only offer a snapshot of what is spent on lobbying activity.\n\nAmericans For Prosperity listed lobbying expenses of almost $13,000 for 2015 but none for the last half of 2016 and did not file an expense report for the first half of that year.\n\nThe Alliance To Fix Our Roads listed lobbying expenses of almost $24,000 for 2016, according to the State Ethics Commission, which maintains all the reports.\n\nSouth Carolina and much of the country was in an economic downturn in the early 1920s when the federal government announced it would jumpstart employment through a highway building program.\n\nThe catch, according to a history of the South Carolina Department of Transportation, was that only state roads would receive aid.\n\nThat spurred a rush by county leaders, according to the book \"Highway Department,\" to get some local roads into the state system.\n\nBy 1925, only 225 miles of 4,740 in the state system were paved. A bond bill in 1929 increased the paved numbers, but by 1935 the state still maintained only 6,000 miles, two thirds of which were paved, according to Walter Edgar's \"South Carolina A History.\"\n\nFrom 1946 to 1950, 5,300 miles of highways were built and 4,900 farm-to-market roads, now known as secondary routes, were paved, Edgar wrote.\n\nBut the real stimulus for expanding the state's road program came from lawmakers, former legislators said, before the age of home rule.\n\nLegislators then oversaw local roads and helped transfer them into the state system.\n\n\"The large number of roads we've got in the state system are directly attributable to legislators trying to help their local areas back in the day when there really was no other way to respond to it,\" said former Sen. Larry Martin of Pickens, who served in the Legislature from 1979 until last year. \"There was no other pot of money available.\"\n\nSometimes farmers or businesses called, wishing a road were paved, he said. Sometimes school officials worried about school buses traveling on certain roads.\n\n\"Whatever it was, that was what got them brought into the system,\" he said. \"That was the way the highway system developed.\"\n\nFormer Sen. John Land, a Clarendon County lawyer and former highway commissioner who served in the Legislature from 1975-2012, said officials' decisions decades ago to develop one state road system with a higher set of standards was a \"wise\" one.\n\nThe policy, he said, greatly aided rural communities who could not have developed or paved roads on their own.\n\nHe said the federal aid program for secondary roads \"was one of the best systems for modernizing rural America.\" He said his county now gets enough state money to pave up to 2 miles a year. Federal aid decades ago allowed his county to pave close to 30 miles.\n\n\"I am in favor still of one state paved road system, maintained by the state,\" he said.\n\nToday, South Carolina has the fourth-largest state-maintained road system in the nation, with more than 41,000 miles.\n\nPrimary routes - major state and U.S. roads - make up 9,517 miles, while federal-aid secondary routes comprise 10,370 miles. The least traveled secondary roads, many of them short roads, some in front of schools or cemeteries or dead ends, are not eligible for federal aid and total almost 21,000 miles.\n\nState law enacted in the 1950s formalized the process of transferring roads, allowing local roads to be placed into the state system by mutual consent with DOT. The law was amended in 2013 allowing the state to give back roads if they were determined to be of “low traffic importance,\" and the counties, government agencies or private entities or persons receiving them consented.\n\nToday, the roads are seen as a part of the state’s infrastructure problem because DOT cannot afford so many roads and the local roads do not connect towns or traverse the state. Lawmakers want to give many of them back but counties have been reluctant, fearful that the state will not provide the funding to keep them maintained.\n\nInitial proposals to force local governments to accept the roads have been replaced with optional plans if local governments choose.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2017/04/01"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/23/news-around-states/39798807/", "title": "50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery:A Department of Corrections narcotics dog died last weekend after he had an allergic reaction to a substance inside an Elmore County prison. Department of Corrections officials say K-9 Jake collapsed during a contraband search inside Staton Correctional Facility last Thursday. Jake “alerted” on a substance before falling unconscious. The substance has not yet been identified, though ADOC says an early test by a HazMat team identified it as synthetic marijuana. The nursing staff at Staton performed CPR and inserted an IV before Jake was transported to the Auburn University Veterinary Clinic. But his condition deteriorated after Friday when he developed pneumonia. A funeral with full honors will be held for Jake and Gov. Kay Ivey also commended Jake’s service to the state.\n\nAlaska\n\nFairbanks: An Alaska company is completing plans to acquire and develop a site for mining metals for foreign markets. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported that Trilogy Metals plans to develop an ore-extraction site called Artic, where about 43 million tons of reserves were discovered. The company president says the copper deposit is located in the Ambler Mining District about 300 miles north of Fairbanks. By the end of this year, Trilogy hopes to complete its plan to use the site to extract and transport metal ore to Asia. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management says the project includes building a road. Federal officials say draft plans for the road are expected to be released in August followed by a public comment period.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix:The state landed $90million in federal grants for a project to widen Interstate 17 north of Phoenix in hopes of easing congestion and cutting down on the number of wrecks, according to Gov. Doug Ducey’s office. It’s part of a $320 million project led by the state Department of Transportation and Federal Highway Administration to add lanes along 23 miles of I-17, from Anthem Way to Sunset Point. The project will also add eight miles of “flex lanes”, which will carry traffic north on Fridays and Saturdays but south on Sundays between Black Canyon City and the Sunset Point Rest Area.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A meat-alternative food company has filed a lawsuit in federal court claiming a state law that bans the use of “meat” in labeling plant-based foods violates free speech rights. Oregon-based Tofurky Co. filed the lawsuit Monday against Arkansas’ Bureau of Standards. Tofurky produces a variety of tofu, quinoa and other plant-based “sausages,” deli slices and burgers. The Arkansas law’s stated goal is to “require truth in labeling.” It also bans companies from labeling other vegetables, such as cauliflower, as “rice.” Arkansas is the nation’s top rice producer. Tofurky filed a lawsuit in 2018 against a Missouri meat-labeling law. This month, Illinois-based Upton’s Naturals Co. challenged a Mississippi law. Arkansas’ law is set to take effect Wednesday. It would fine companies up to $1,000 for each violation.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Her name was “Lucille,” and in B.B. King’s hands she gave voice to the “King of the Blues.” Julien’s Auctions announced Tuesday that King’s black Gibson ES-345 prototype guitar is among the items from his estate that will go up for bid on Sept. 21. Julien’s says Gibson gave King the instrument for his 80th birthday. The headstock has “B.B. King 80” and a crown inlaid with mother-of-pearl. The guitar is estimated to be worth $80,000 to $100,000. The National Medal of Arts that President George H.W. Bush presented to King in 1990 is also up for auction. So are his touring van, jewelry and clothing. The 15-time Grammy winner was 89 years old when he died in 2015.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: Public health officials say four homeless people have been diagnosed with hepatitis A this year, so the city is stepping up free vaccinations. KDVR-TV reported Monday that three of the cases were diagnosed within the past three weeks. Public Health executive director Dr. Bill Burman says his agency will set up vaccine clinics almost every day in day shelters, syringe access programs, Civic Center Park and other places where people at risk of contracting the disease are found. Hepatitis A can be spread through the sharing of drugs and equipment, fecal-oral contamination or intimate contact with a person who has the disease. Health officials say the disease can be prevented with a vaccine that has been a part of standard childhood immunizations for more than a decade.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: Heavy rainfall and thunderstorms that raced across the state caused major flooding and a fire in a dorm at a private school. At the Tweed-New Haven Airport, major flooding Monday night caused airport staff to cancel flights for almost 24 hours through Tuesday afternoon. A dorm at Choate Rosemary Hall, a private school in Wallingford, also caught fire after a lightning strike, forcing students to evacuate and take shelter at an athletic center. No injuries were reported. Lorraine Connelly, director of communications for the school, said the lightning struck the building around 6:20 p.m. Firefighters say they had to wait until the lightning passed to complete their work. The state’s major utilities were reporting scattered power outages Tuesday morning.\n\nDelaware\n\nGeorgetown:A Confederate flag and monument honoring those who fought for the South in the Civil War have cost the local historical society more than $14,000 in state funding. The Georgetown Historical Society was set to get $14,443 in grant-in-aid under a bill that gives tens of millions of dollars to more than 100 nonprofits each year, according to budget documents. But Sen. Trey Paradee, D-Dover, who serves on the General Assembly’s Joint Finance Committee, recommended that the group be struck from the list because of the Confederate monument and flag, which are on the grounds of the historical society’s museum on Bedford Street. The bill passed unanimously on the last day of the legislative session. Paradee told The News Journal that he did not discuss the change in funding with the historical society in advance, though he would consider restoring the grant if they got rid of the Confederate symbols. The Georgetown Historical Society did not return calls for comment. Debbie Jones, the group’s vice president, told WBOC 16 that the decision threatens the nonprofit’s financial standing.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: A D.C. council member who voted for a no-bid sports gambling contract says he wasn’t aware of documentation connecting his cousin to the contract. The Washington Post reports Kenyan R. McDuffie defended his vote Friday, saying his motivating factor was the best interest of the District and residents. Intralot was awarded the sole-source sports gambling contract. The company submitted subcontracting plans with McDuffie’s cousin listed as chief executive of Potomac Supply Company, a commercial paper supplier. McDuffie said he had no knowledge of his cousin being listed as CEO of Potomac before the newspaper contacted him. Potomac’s owner Okera Stewart says Intralot mistakenly identified McDuffie’s cousin as CEO because of an email he sent Intralot on Stewart’s behalf. An Intralot executive hasn’t returned comment requests.\n\nFlorida\n\nCocoa:Trafford Realty, which had been in operation for 102 years, closed July 1. The business was the oldest continuously operating retail office in Florida, says Margot Trafford Hester, former realtor whose father, Al, was chairman. The closure of Trafford Realty followed the death of company President Terry Lolmaugh and Vice President Roy Berry this spring. A.R. Trafford founded the company in 1917. His son, Al, started his career in 1938 and took over the company from his father. Al Trafford, who died in 2014, had continued participating in the business until age 98.\n\nGeorgia\n\nDallas: A K-9 was fatally shot by a deputy during a foot chase of a suspect. News outlets report 8-year-old Verro got out of his patrol car Friday without being assisted by his handler, Cpl. Brandon Kilgore. Paulding County sheriff’s spokesman Sgt. Ashley Henson says deputies were pursuing a man fleeing the scene of an alleged domestic dispute. The situation didn’t require the deployment of the dog, but Verro squeezed out of his kennel looking to help Kilgore. The dog then attacked a deputy because he couldn’t differentiate who the suspect was without his handler. Henson says the deputy was unaware the dog was a K-9 and shot him to stop the attack. The suspect was apprehended. Kilgore had worked with Verro for about seven years.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Hawaii County officials have announced reconstruction of a Big Island highway covered in lava is progressing on schedule. The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reported Sunday that the Department of Public Works says construction on parts of Highway 132 is expected to be completed in a few weeks. A spokeswoman says the project that began earlier this month is expected to be completed by Oct. 5 to qualify for 100% federal reimbursement. Work will continue on various sections of the roadway that was inundated with lava during the 2018 Kilauea volcanic eruption. Officials say access to some residents’ land-locked homes and farms will be restored by October on the highway located about 24 miles southeast of Hilo.\n\nIdaho\n\nCaldwell: Federal data shows more women are operating farms in Idaho, but officials say they have always been there. The Idaho Statesman reports the 2017 Census of Agriculture released earlier this year shows about one-third of Idaho farms are run by women. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recorded more than 10,000 women in farm leadership roles. It also says more than 17,000 women are working on farms and ranches in the state, up from the just over 13,000 recorded in 2012. The department attributed the uptick to a change in how the farm leadership positions are recorded. Department statistician Randy Welk says officials determined that woman and youth were probably getting undercounted. He says often the name listed as the operator of a family farm wasn’t updated.\n\nIllinois\n\nFord Heights: A south Chicago suburb without a library is getting a boost from students at an alternative high school inside a state juvenile detention facility. Illinois officials say the youth enrolled at Booker T. Washington Alternative High School at Harrisburg youth center constructed four library boxes to be placed throughout Ford Heights. The boxes will continually be replenished with books through a partnership with a bookstore. Department of Juvenile Justice Director Heidi Mueller says the boxes are symbolic of how collaboration, hard work and a shared goal can help families. Ford Heights had to close its library decades ago over funding issues. There will be a dedication ceremony for the boxes on July 30.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Indiana State Fairgrounds officials say a $50 million project will replace its nearly century-old swine barn with a new building that can hold events around the year. Fairgrounds Executive Director Cynthia Hoye says the open-air building can’t generate year-round revenue because it isn’t climate-controlled. The new building will be called the Fall Creek Pavilion and will still house livestock during the state fair. Most of the building that opened in 1923 will be demolished. Work could start after next year’s state fair. Gov. Eric Holcomb proposes dipping into the state’s $2.3 billion in reserves to pay cash for the project. Democrats have lambasted that plan, saying the money should go to other priorities such as raising teacher pay or improving access to affordable child care.\n\nIowa\n\nIowa City:The Muslim community in the Iowa City area is growing quickly, and along with that growth so is the need for a new Islamic cemetery, mosque leaders say. The Iowa City Mosque spent years establishing the Al-Iman Cemetery in southwest Iowa City and is now in the slow process of beautifying the space and putting in necessary physical infrastructure. The cemetery has long been an important project for the Iowa City Mosque, in part because members found local cemeteries did not allow them to bury loved ones in accordance with certain Muslim traditions, says Ousainou Keita, president of the Executive Committee for the mosque. The new cemetery allows for loved ones to be buried facing Mecca, the birthplace of Islam, and coffins or caskets are not mandated, like they are with other cemeteries. The Al-Iman Cemetery will serve the small slice of residents who identify as Muslim in Iowa City, Coralville and North Liberty.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: State health and environment officials are recommending alternative ways for municipal water operators to treat toxic blue-green algal blooms that have troubled state lakes for nearly 10 years. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says people and animals that come into contact with cyanobacteria algae might suffer diarrhea, headaches and other symptoms. The state Department of Health and Environment has detected traces of toxins related to the blooms in at least five water treatment plants. KMUW-FM reports that the department has suggested adding activated carbon to the water treatment process. The carbon causes algae to fall to the bottom of ponds, allowing clean water to pass through. Department officials say they also offer a program to subsidize water quality tests searching for toxins caused by cyanobacteria.\n\nKentucky\n\nAshland: Planning is underway for a monument that would list the names of all Boyd County residents who served in World War II. The Independent reports the Ashland Rotary Club is planning a 79-foot wall that would have 6,700 names laser-etched on it. Cheryl Spriggs is spearheading the project and says the organization has raised about $20,000 and hopes to double that. She says Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has agreed to attend an Aug. 21 fundraiser for the project. She says officials are looking for locations along the riverfront and in Central Park. The wall will replace one built in 1944 and demolished a decade later. Spriggs said she hopes to finish the wall by May 8, 2020, which is the 75th anniversary of Germany’s surrender.\n\nLouisiana\n\nLake Charles:Hurricane Barry brought a 7-foot storm surge in some parts of south Louisiana and dropped more than 20 inches of rain in one parish, according to a preliminary report from the National Weather Service. The storm, which made landfall July 13 as a Category 1 hurricane, also caused flooding and power outages in more than a dozen parishes, according to the report out of the NWS Lake Charles office. The most rainfall was measured in South Ragley in Beauregard Parish. It received 23.5 inches of rain, according to the report. Morgan City in St. Mary Parish, near Barry’s landfall, received nearly 11 inches of rain. Denham Springs in Livingston Parish received nearly 9 inches. In St. Martin Parish, Barry dropped about 7 inches of rain. Scott, in Lafayette Parish, received about 6 inches. The storm, which might have caused as much as $900 million in property damage, also caused more than 7 feet of storm surge in St. Mary and Vermilion parishes. At its peak on July 14, the Vermilion River in Perry reached nearly 11 feet.\n\nMaine\n\nMadawaska: The state will receive $36 million to help pay for the replacement of an aging bridge that connects one of its northernmost communities with the Canadian province of New Brunswick. Republican Sen. Susan Collins, who chairs the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, says the money will go toward replacing the Madawaska International Bridge. The bridge connects Madawaska with Edmundston, New Brunswick. The money is through the Infrastructure for Rebuilding America Program, which uses federal grants to help communities fix infrastructure. The program served 26 projects in the country last year. Collins’ office says temporary closures and a weight limit on the bridge forced some residents and businesses to drive as many as 75 miles out of their way. The total cost of replacement is estimated at $73.5 million.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The state will receive a $125 million federal grant for long-sought improvements to the Howard Street Tunnel. Gov. Larry Hogan announced the grant Monday from the federal Infrastructure For Rebuilding America Grant Program. Height restrictions prevent the shipment of double-stacked containers by rail to and from the Helen Delich Bentley Port of Baltimore and up and down the East Coast. Double-stack containers provide a more cost-effective way to transport freight by rail than by truck.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nWorcester: The largest furniture and flooring store in New England has been acquired. Vystar Corp. announced Monday that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire Worcester-based Rotmans Furniture and Carpet. Rotmans, one of the largest independent furniture retailers in the U.S., with 200,000 square feet and 150 employees, was founded by and has been under the leadership of the Rotman family for 50 years. Vytex is a Worcester-based manufacturer of environmentally safe and biodegradable rubber latex products. Vystar has acquired a controlling interest in Rotmans for more than $2 million, comprised of 25% cash and 75% in notes convertible into shares. Steve Rotman, CEO of Vystar and Rotmans, says the transaction will not impact the Rotmans store name or business practices and is expected to increase Vystar shareholder value and liquidity.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit:Fire has claimed the building that once housed the Gold Dollar, the Cass Avenue bar where the White Stripes played their first show and other bands cut their teeth in the late 1990s as Detroit’s garage-rock phenomenon took flight. The Gold Dollar closed in 2001 after a five-year run, and the property was reportedly purchased by the Ilitch organization in 2015 as the company acquired properties in the area around Little Caesars Arena. Deputy fire commissioner David Fornell says the fire was “fully involved” when firefighters arrived on the scene after 8 p.m. Monday. They were still battling the blaze at 10 p.m. Power and gas services at the building were shut off six years ago, Fornell says, adding it was too soon to determine the cause of the fire or speculate about arson.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCollegeville:A St. John’s University monk has been named 2019 Jefferson Lecturer in the Humanities by the National Endowment for the Humanities, marking the first time the honor has been given to a Minnesotan, a member of the clergy or a Benedictine monk. According to a news release issued Monday, Father Columba Stewart, OSB, will give a lecture titled “Cultural Heritage Present and Future: A Benedictine Monk’s Long View” at 7:30 p.m. Oct. 7 at the Warner Theatre in Washington. The lectureship is the highest honor bestowed by the federal government for contributions to the humanities, according to the release. Stewart is a graduate of Harvard, Yale and Oxford universities and a professed Benedictine monk of St. John’s Abbey since 1981. He is a much-awarded expert in the research field of early Christian monasticism, according to the release. Stewart is a professor of theology at St. John’s University School of Theology and Seminary and has been the executive director of the Hill Museum & Manuscript Library at St. John’s since 2003.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Mississippi Department of Education says a $1,500 raise for teachers will cost $18.5 million more than it originally told lawmakers. The department made the announcement Monday, months after local superintendents discovered a shortfall caused by the department’s ignorance of how teachers were classified in its computer system. Lawmakers allotted $58 million for the raise that began July 1, based on it going to 31,000 teachers. But the department didn’t count 10,000 other teaching positions that officials thought were federally funded. Instead, those positions are state-funded, and Mississippi must absorb the costs. Legislators pledge to pay the remainder of the full $77 million when they convene in January after elections. State Superintendent Carey Wright has said the department will give local school districts enough money to cover costs until then.\n\nMissouri\n\nRocheport: The Missouri Department of Transportation will receive an $81 million federal grant to help pay for the replacement of the Interstate 70 bridge over the Missouri River near Rocheport. Republican members of Missouri’s congressional delegation announced Monday the state will receive the grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Infrastructure for Rebuilding America program. The bridge was built in 1960 and carries about 12.5 million vehicles per year. It is rated in poor condition and repairing it has been a top priority of state officials for years. State transportation officials have said the current bridge will remain open while the new one is built. The agency had applied for about $178 million for the project, which has an estimated cost of $200 million.\n\nMontana\n\nMissoula: Wildlife officials are asking people who are traveling near Glacier National Park to report sightings of animals crossing the road. The Missoulian reported Monday that park officials and the U.S. Geological Survey want to know where animals are crossing U.S. Highway 2. Officials plan to use the data to help find locations for dedicated wildlife crossings and for other efforts to ease animals’ migration between the park and the Flathead National Forest. Park wildlife biologist John Waller says officials are interested in sightings of rare animals like lynx, bears and wolverines, as well as common animals like deer. Research ecologist Tabitha Graves says officials want to collect as much information as possible, including sightings from several years ago.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A poultry farm that could house up to 380,000 chickens has been proposed for Lancaster County as the county considers new regulations for large livestock operations. The Lincoln Journal Star reports that Sunset Poultry LLC applied earlier this month for a special permit for eight barns housing up to 47,500 chickens each on 80 acres just south of the Saunders County line. The birds would go to the Lincoln Premium Poultry plant in Fremont that’s processing chickens for Costco. An application last year for a poultry farm that would supply Costco spurred officials to examine Lancaster County’s lack of specific zoning laws regarding large livestock operations. A task force has arrived at recommendations for changes. A Lincoln Premium spokeswoman says Sunset Poultry would abide by the pending recommendations.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas:Retired engineer Gary George was a NASA intern in 1976 when he paid $218 at a government auction for three truckloads of film reels that happened to include original video footage of man’s first steps on the moon. On Saturday, three film reels of the moon mission labeled “Apollo 11 EVA” were sold to a private buyer at a Sotheby’s New York auction for $1.82 million. Running 2 hours, 24 minutes, the “unrestored, unenhanced and unremastered tapes” – as described before the auction – including Neil Armstrong’s famous lunar declaration: “That’s one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.” But that sale perhaps would have never happened if George’s father hadn’t looked a little closer at the peculiar tapes. George had decided to donate any leftover tapes to a Texas church that produced a syndicated television show. That way, he said, he could write them off come tax time. His father, Chet, helped him load the remaining tapes into the family’s 1963 Pontiac station wagon. Scanning the labels on the boxes, Chet noticed something that seemed impossible. On three of the boxes were small labels identifying the metal reels as “Apollo 11 EVA.” George took the three reels out of the pile and put them in a safe place with three other reels that seemed worth keeping: A Bob Hope special recorded at NASA as a benefit for the Apollo 1 astronauts who died in a tragic fire.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: Three public school teachers have received fellowships as part of a program aimed at retaining educators in the northern part of the state. The New Hampshire Charitable Foundation says the winners of the Louise Tillotson Teaching Fellowships are Melissa Jellison, STEAM Coordinator at White Mountains Regional High School in Whitefield; Kate Moore, a second-grade teacher at Brown Elementary School in Berlin; and Deborah Sargent, Art Educator at Pittsburg School. Each winner will receive $10,000. Since 2007, the Louise Tillotson Fellowship has awarded $445,100 to North Country public school educators.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nVoorhees: Residents of a southern New Jersey nursing home have returned to their rooms after a malfunctioning air conditioning system forced them to be evacuated for several hours during last weekend’s heatwave. Officials say 183 residents of Voorhees Care and Rehabilitation were evacuated Sunday afternoon while repairs were made. Most were taken across the street to Eastern High School, while some went to other medical facilities. Residents returned to the center around 8 p.m. Sunday. Officials say at least one patient was taken to a hospital, though it wasn’t clear if that case was heat-related. Officials said outside temperatures were reported at 99 degrees when the cooling system failed, with the heat index around 110 degrees. Some patients’ relatives said temperatures inside the facility reached into the 90s.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: Five trees planted in New Mexico from seeds taken to the moon during Apollo 14 and given to the state by NASA have died or been forgotten. KOAT-TV reports officials, where the trees were planted decades ago, admit they have lost track of the trees. Other states have kept up with moon tree locations. Moon trees were grown from 500 seeds taken into orbit around the moon by former U.S. Forest Service smokejumper Stuart Roosa during the 1971 mission. NASA says the resulting seedlings were planted throughout the United States and the world. A NASA list of moon trees only cites one New Mexico tree. That one was planted in Albuquerque and city officials say it died.\n\nNew York\n\nBuffalo: After more than 20 years and $50 million, the restoration of an estate designed by architect Frank Lloyd Wright for a patron in Buffalo is complete. Work on the Darwin D. Martin House complex has been ongoing since the early 1990s and involved restoring or rebuilding the main house and several smaller structures, including a carriage house, glass-roofed conservatory and covered walkway. The complex was built between 1903 and 1905. The 1.5-acre estate is a National Historic Landmark and has received $24 million from the state over the years. On Monday, officials announced the completion of the Wright-designed landscape, the final piece of the project. The estate is seen as an example of Wright’s vision of architecture that promotes harmony with the natural world.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: North Carolina lawmakers are cracking down on robocalls and telephone scammers in a bill that has passed both chambers of the General Assembly. The state Senate voted 45-0 on Monday and sent the bill to Gov. Roy Cooper to be signed. Under the bill, any telephone solicitor who masks their real number on caller ID so that the call appears to come from a local number or a familiar number can be fined up to $5,000. The practice of using fake numbers or names is illegal under federal law, but this bill gives North Carolina more leverage to go after scammers. It requires callers to use their real information or the information of the business they’re representing. The bill also applies to text message solicitations.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nNorthwood: Sheriff’s officials say an overweight semitrailer loaded with dried beans caused a more-than-century-old bridge to. Grand Forks County sheriff’s officials say the bridge over the Goose River near Northwood collapsed Monday afternoon. Photos show the wooden and iron span buckling under the weight of the vehicle. The bridge is partly submerged in the water. The 56-foot-long bridge was built in 1906 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It has a 14 ton weight restriction. Sheriff’s officials say the semitrailer was 29 tons over that limit. The driver, who was not injured, faces an $11,400 overload fine. Officials say it will cost up to $1 million to replace the bridge. Northwood is about 200 miles northeast of Bismarck.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine has declared a state of emergency in 63 counties where severe weather caused serious highway damage last month. The 63 counties covered by the emergency declaration have had weather-related damage to roads and/or bridges after mild temperatures and significant rains in June saturated the ground. Some roads still have lane restrictions or are closed completely. The governor said in a statement Monday that the emergency proclamation allows the state Department of Transportation and local governments in the 63 counties to access federal emergency relief funds to help fix the damage.\n\nOklahoma\n\nEdmond: First-degree murder charges have been filed against two people in the shooting death of the manager of a medical marijuana dispensary. Oklahoma County court records indicate charges were filed Monday against 38-year-old George Stewart Watson and 37-year-old Lyndsi Mae Mayabb. The records do not list an attorney for either defendant. Authorities say they are charged in the death of 24-year-old Andrew Sawyer English, the manager of a medical marijuana dispensary in Edmond, whose body was discovered by police in his home on June 27 with three bullet wounds in his back. Investigators tracked the suspects to St. Augustine, Florida, earlier this month, where Mayabb told detectives that Watson allegedly shot English after learning she had a relationship with him. Edmond Police spokeswoman Jennifer Wagnon said Tuesday that the suspects have waived extradition.\n\nOregon\n\nAstoria: Wildlife officials have proposed new regulations to avoid entangling whales in commercial fishing gear used by the state’s Dungeness crab industry. The Daily Astorian reports state fishery officials presented recommendations to avoid unwanted whale interactions to the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission during a June meeting. Officials say there were 12 cases of entangled whales as of July 16, half associated with commercial fishing and a third with commercial crabbing. Fisheries say recommendations include new gear identification tags and equipment cleanup requirements before the season’s end, eliminating a two-week, postseason grace period. Commercial fishermen say they can clean up earlier, but other changes could be contentious. Officials say Oregon has also applied for a federal permit allowing fishermen to take a small number of whales each year while fishing.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPittsburgh: Scores of police officers, officials and members of the community gathered to pay their respects to an off-duty Pittsburgh police officer shot to death in a street confrontation more than a week ago. Relatives of 35-year-old Officer Calvin Hall were among those speaking during Tuesday’s service at Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum in Pittsburgh’s Oakland neighborhood. Hall’s sister remembered her brother as “the rock of our family.” His father performed a song he wrote and dedicated to his son. Hall died last Wednesday, three days after he was shot three times in the back during a street dispute in the Homewood neighborhood as a party was going on. Charges were announced against a suspect Monday afternoon as a viewing for the slain officer was being held.\n\nRhode Island\n\nNewport: A developer wants to demolish the former Newport Grand slots parlor and build hotels, apartment buildings, offices and retail space. The Carpionato Group says Tuesday it wants to create “Newport North End,” a $100 million mixed-use development project at the site. The project would include two six-story hotels, two six-story apartment buildings, offices and medical, retail and restaurant space. The project needs approvals from the city and state. The slots parlor closed nearly a year ago, when the Twin River Management Group relocated its gambling operations in the area to the new Tiverton Casino Hotel. City officials said then they expected to lose roughly $800,000 in annual property taxes and casino revenues. The Carpionato Group says its project would generate $1.5 million in tax revenue for Newport.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Highway crews are closing a lane on the main highway north out of downtown Columbia as they prepare to build a bridge. The state Department of Transportation said the lane closure on state Highway 277 north bridge over Interstate 77 will continue until Thursday. Crews are preparing to build a $25 million bridge to carry the freeway from downtown Columbia to I-77 north. DOT engineers say the current bridge is getting old and its intersection with I-77 doesn’t match current safety standards. Crews hope to finish the new bridge by August 2020. They say they will have to temporarily close I-77 next year when they tear down the old bridge.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls:The leader of Jefferson High School will be hired a full year before the Sioux Falls School District’s newest high school even opens, school officials announced Monday. The searches for the new high school principal and the new Ben Reifel Middle School principal will happen somewhat concurrently, Superintendent Brian Maher said during the district’s annual school board retreat. Both schools are projects tied to a $190 million bond passed in 2018 to help address overcrowding, and both buildings are expected to open by fall 2021. The high school search will begin in January or February and conclude by March or April, he said.\n\nTennessee\n\nJohnson City: East Tennessee State University researchers have developed a device to measure environmental preferences of salamanders that live in southern Appalachia. ETSU says plethodontid salamanders are threatened by climate change, shrinking habitats and fungal infections. ETSU biomedical sciences doctoral student Trevor Chapman calls the salamanders a crucial link in the local ecosystem. He says they’re one of the most abundant vertebrate species, are eaten by most creatures that prey on small organisms and they prey on almost any invertebrate or vertebrate they can fit in their mouths. With the help of faculty, Chapman made a four-chambered device that varies temperatures, moisture levels and other factors to monitor the behavior of salamanders within. Chapman sets the chambers at different levels and sees over 24 hours which chamber the animal will stay in longest.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: A south Texas state park has reopened for overnight camping nearly two years after Hurricane Harvey battered the coastal area. The Texas Parks & Wildlife Department on Monday announced Mustang Island State Park has overnight camping available after Harvey delayed a scheduled restroom replacement project. Superintendent Scott Taylor says the staff of Mustang Island State Park is excited to again be able to offer camping to visitors from around the world. Mustang Island is in the area where Harvey made landfall in August 2017. Camp officials say the bathroom renovations included major plumbing and electrical work. Additional Harvey repairs are ongoing to the park’s headquarters and maintenance shop.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Officials are considering whether to preserve a painted image of a Native American and the name “Redmen” on a water tank or allow it to be changed. The Spectrum reports the Cedar City Council reviewed last week two competing resolutions on the Leigh Hill water tank. One measure would designate the tank as a city marker, keeping the image and name of the former Cedar High School mascot. The second measure would allow schools to decide what goes on the tank and a second water tank in town. Under the second measure, representatives from the town’s two high schools would submit proposals for the tanks to the city council. The council is scheduled to vote on the resolutions next week.\n\nVermont\n\nBakersfield: The community has dedicated a memorial pavilion to a U.S. Marine killed overseas. NECN.com reports the community honored Lance Cpl. Lucas Williams at a dedication service Friday. Williams was killed in a Humvee wreck during a training exercise in Kuwait in 1998. He was 19 years old. The late soldier’s mother, Rosalie, has been holding youth programs in her son’s name for nearly two decades and has always wanted a permanent structure for where they can be held. She says the memorial pavilion will now be that place for children and the community to gather. Williams says this pavilion would have been Lucas’s wish and that she was “determined to make his wishes come true.”\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: The state Department of Health says the number of people in the state needing medical treatment for heat-related illnesses has nearly doubled compared with last July. Data released Sunday show just over 1,000 people visited emergency departments or urgent-care for heat-related illness since the beginning of the month, up from just below 600 during the same period last year. Parham Jaberi, the state’s chief deputy commissioner for public health and preparedness, told the Richmond Times-Dispatch the numbers describe a serious public health threat. Jaberi said there have been four heat-related deaths in the state within the past week, including an infant left in a car. She said the three others were older than 69 and included a woman doing yard work and a person sitting in a car.\n\nWashington\n\nBainbridge Island: A no-contact advisory for the city’s eastern shoreline north to Indianola has been lifted following a large spill at a Seattle sewage treatment plant. The three-day advisory was posted by the Kitsap Public Health District on Friday following a spill of 3 million gallons of untreated sewage from King County’s West Point Treatment Plant. King County reported the spill was a combination of stormwater and wastewater and said the problem was caused by a power surge early Friday. Workers responded by sending the water into Puget Sound through an emergency outfall pipe for about 30 minutes, in order to prevent flooding in the plant, King County said. The state’s Department of Ecology said backup pumping systems failed during the power disruption and said it is investigating the incident as a violation of the state’s water quality permits for the facility. Following the investigation, the state could levy fines and administrative orders against the county, Ecology spokesman Larry Altose said.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nWheeling: Officials say a suspension bridge will remain closed for another month so crews can make needed repairs and improvements. The Wheeling Suspension Bridge has been closed since a charter bus weighing well over the 2-ton weight limit crossed the span on June 29 and compromised its integrity. The Intelligencer reports state highway officials say along with making structural repairs, the state plans to put a hard barrier at the bridge’s entrances, which would stop vehicles such as dump trucks and tour buses from crossing it. Wheeling Police Department spokesman Philip Stahl has said the driver of the bus was cited for the overweight vehicle and failing to obey a traffic control device.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: The state Department of Natural Resources is asking wastewater treatment plants to test for polyfluoroalkyl pollution. The substances, also known as PFAS, are man-made chemicals that have been used for decades in products such as firefighting foam, nonstick cookware and fast-food wrappers. Research suggests PFAS can decrease female fertility, increase the risk of high blood pressure in pregnant women and lower birth weights. DNR officials said Monday they have started sending letters to 125 municipal wastewater plants asking them to sample and analyze water flowing in and out of the facilities for PFAS compounds. The DNR picked the facilities because they’re more likely to receive wastewater from businesses that use PFAS. The DNR plans to use data from the sampling to build a plan to reduce PFAS entering the facilities.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: State wildlife officials encourage people who enter the backcountry to carry bear spray, but they declined to make it a requirement. The Cody Enterprise reported Monday that the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission took no action last week on a petition submitted by seven conservation groups earlier this year. The conservation groups had asked the state to consider a bear spray mandate, aiming to reduce the number of grizzly bear deaths from encounters with hunters. Hunters defensively killed 15 grizzlies in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem in 2017. Bonnie Rice of the Sierra Club says bear spray is a proven tool in preventing injury to people and bears. Grand Teton National Park requires elk hunters to carry bear spray when they’re in the park each fall.", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/23"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/07/03/kacey-musgraves-sneaker-flap-skiing-july-news-around-states/39650191/", "title": "News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMobile: The City Council is delaying a proposal that endorsed the return of passenger rail service to the Gulf Coast. Officials recently delayed a resolution that would have asked Gov. Kay Ivey to commit state funds necessary to return Amtrak service to the region, Al.com reports. Ivey said last month that she needs more information. Council members say they want more time to consider information about fares, ridership and logistics. Mayor Sandy Stimpson expressed concern about trains potentially blocking access to the cruise-ship terminal. Councilman Joel Daves also questioned ridership interest. Amtrak suspended service east of New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina caused heavy damage in 2005. Mississippi ($15 million) and Louisiana ($10 million) have already dedicated their portions for the project. Alabama’s share would be about $2.7 million or less, the news site reports.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Furlough notices are being sent to about 2,500 University of Alaska system staff following Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s veto of $130 million in funding. University system President Jim Johnsen last week said the cut, if it stands, would be devastating. The veto is on top of a $5 million reduction authorized by lawmakers, and Johnsen says it follows a series of cuts in recent years. He has called on lawmakers to override the veto, which would require 45 of the Legislature’s 60 members. House Minority Leader Lance Pruitt, in a statement Friday, said if his 15-member caucus decides to revisit any of Dunleavy’s cuts, it wants to do so through a separate budget bill rather than an override. Democratic Rep. Adam Wool says he hopes “common sense” prevails and the cut is overridden.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Gov. Doug Ducey on Tuesday slammed Nike for canceling the release of a shoe featuring an early design of the American flag, saying the company had “bowed to the current onslaught of political correctness and historical revisionism.” Calling Nike’s decision a “shameful retreat,” the Republican leader vowed on Twitter to withdraw millions in incentives recently promised to the company in exchange for opening a manufacturing plant in Goodyear with some 500 full-time jobs. Nike pulled the shoe, set to go on sale this week, after former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick told them he and others found the version of the flag depicted on the shoe offensive, according to The Wall Street Journal. Kaepernick argued the “Betsy Ross flag” was appropriated by extremist groups as a symbol of white nationalism, the Journal reports.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: The state’s attorney general is asking a federal judge for a hearing on whether to block three new abortion restrictions a day or two before they’re to take effect. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge on Monday asked for an extension to respond to a lawsuit filed by abortion providers against the new laws, one of which would ban the procedure 18 weeks into a woman’s pregnancy. The three laws are to take effect July 24. Rutledge asked that the state be given until July 22 to respond and that a hearing on the request to block the laws be scheduled for July 22 or 23. Rutledge said the state would suffer “severe prejudice” if it has to defend the laws on the current timetable.\n\nCalifornia\n\nOakland: Four new gray wolf pups have come out of their den at the Oakland Zoo. The pups were born May 13. This month the 6-week-old pups have started to explore the 2-acre habitat. Parents Siskiyou and Sequoia were born in captivity and brought to the zoo’s California Trail area in April 2018. Siskiyou is a first-time mom, and the zoo doesn’t plan to breed further. Wolves are reclusive creatures and take time to bond. Then they mate for life. Darren Minier, the zoo’s assistant director of animal care, conservation and research, says creating a wolf pack is essential to the wolves’ emotional health. Zoo workers will monitor the family to ensure it is thriving.\n\nColorado\n\nFrisco: Officials with the Arapahoe Basin Ski Area in central Colorado say it will be open for skiing on the Fourth of July for the first time since 2011. The resort has received nearly 7 feet of snow since March. Lower-than-average temperatures since then allowed enough snow to remain. Ski area spokeswoman Katherine Fuller says Independence Day will be the final day of the resort’s 2018-19 ski season. The area has been open for weekend skiing for several weeks, and two lifts will run from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Thursday. No beginner skiing is available. Arapahoe Basin stayed open until Aug. 10 during the 1994-95 ski season.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: State environmental officials are asking beachgoers to stay at least 50 yards away from where large concentrations or birds are gathered and avoid areas roped off as designated nesting locations. The Department of Energy and Environmental Protection is making the request as people visit Connecticut’s shoreline around the Fourth of July. Jenny Dickson, DEEP’s wildlife division director, says shorebirds and wading birds need special protection throughout the April-to-September nesting season. She advises beachgoers to keep fireworks and kites, especially kites that make noise, away from beach areas. Piping plovers, least terns, American oystercatchers, herons and egrets are particularly vulnerable. DEEP is also urging people to keep their pets leashed at all times and away from fenced areas, noting that dogs are prohibited on some beaches during the summer season.\n\nDelaware\n\nDover: A bill passed by the state House requires all restaurants to offer a healthy beverage as the first option in any kids meals. That means no more washing down Happy Meals with soda, at least not as a first option. Parents will have the option to substitute sugar-laden drinks if the eatery offers them. Many restaurants would be allowed to offer as a first choice water; sparkling water or flavored water without added sugar, corn syrup or artificial sweeteners; flavored or unflavored whole milk; nonfat or low-fat dairy milk, or a dairy substitute; 100% fruit or vegetable juice, or a combination of the two; or fruit or vegetable juice combined with water or carbonated water, without added sugars or sweeteners. What is different about Delaware’s push for healthier beverages is that it cannot be viewed as a money grab, as in places where a soda tax was levied.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Maryland’s transportation secretary says the state will withhold about $55.6 million in capital funds from the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority due to a lack of transparency about how state money is being used. Pete Rahn wrote a letter Monday to WMATA board members and the CEO, saying it’s a necessary step “in response to an ongoing pattern of fiscal obfuscation and a lack of cooperation from WMATA.” A 2016 Maryland legislative audit recommended that Maryland create a process to verify that WMATA’s annual operating and capital grant subsidies are properly calculated. But Rahn writes that WMATA was unwilling to comply with these audits and refused to provide data requested for auditing its fiscal year 2017 capital program.\n\nFlorida\n\nSuwannee Springs: The Air Force says it’s investigating after a fighter jet struck a bird and dropped three dummy bombs used for training over northern Florida. Moody Air Force Base in central Georgia said in a news release that there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage after the 25-pound, nonexplosive training munitions were dropped Monday afternoon by an A-10C Thunderbolt II jet. The base said a “bird strike” had caused “an inadvertent release” of the three dummy bombs. The Air Force said it didn’t know where the training bombs landed, but the suspected area was about 54 miles south of Moody Air Force Base, near Suwannee Springs. The Air Force said the dummy bombs, though inert, contain small pyrotechnic charges and should not be handled.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The city council has approved a far-reaching ban on smoking and vaping in restaurants and bars – and inside one of the world’s busiest airports. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reports that city council members approved the ban Monday. It covers cigarettes, cigars and electronic cigarettes. If signed by the mayor, it would take effect Jan. 2, 2020. Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport is one of the few major U.S. hubs where people can still smoke inside designated rooms. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a 2017 report that most busy U.S. airports ban smoking in all indoor areas. Denver International Airport last year closed the last of its indoor smoking lounges and is now smoke-free indoors.\n\nHawaii\n\nKailua-Kona: A Dutch video game designer and entrepreneur has established a laboratory on the Big Island that is focused on developing alternatives to fossil fuels for energy, the Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Henk Rogers established the lab to test and develop renewable energy systems that he hopes will make the state’s energy use 100% renewable by 2045, ending its reliance on fossil fuels that Rogers says is adding acid to the ocean and killing the coral reef, the newspaper reports. The laboratory, on a ranch, is focused on the use of hydrogen to create energy, aiming to use hydrogen energy cells to store the energy harnessed by the solar panels in order to power the community water system, create jobs and cook food, the Tribune-Herald reports. One of Rogers’ software companies has the intellectual property rights to Tetris, according to his Blue Planet Foundation’s website.\n\nIdaho\n\nCaldwell: The state’s Latino student population is growing, while the number of Latino or nonwhite teachers remains stagnant. The Idaho Press-Tribune reports that in the state’s 10 school districts with the highest percentage of Latino students, 90% of teachers are white. Officials say Latino students are the largest minority group in Idaho public schools, including several schools and a few school districts where there is a Latino student majority. Officials say the high concentrations of Latino students occur in rural areas across southern Idaho where jobs on farms and dairies have drawn Latinos for generations. Many of those with the highest percentage of Latino students are elementary schools. An official in a district with a high Latino population says recruiting and retaining teachers is difficult when other areas offer higher pay.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Implementation of a new rule requiring the city’s police officers to report every time they point a gun at a person is being delayed. The rule that is included in a consent decree in which the city agreed to implement dozens of reforms at the beleaguered police department was to have gone into effect Monday, but a spokesman says a new implementation date will be announced “in the near future.” Spokesman Luis Agostini said in an email that more time is needed to review feedback from the consent decree Independent Monitoring Team and the Illinois Attorney General’s office about the new policy. Under the policy, officers must notify the city’s Office of Emergency Management whenever they point a gun at someone.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Duke Energy is asking to hike residential electricity bills by about $23 a month, its first such appeal to state regulators in nearly two decades. The largest electric utility in the state filed its request with the Indiana Utilities Regulatory Commission on Tuesday asking to increase its annual revenue by roughly $395 million. The proposed rate increase is driven by investments to serve a growing customer base, generate cleaner electricity and improve the reliability of electric service, according to Duke’s petition. Kerwin Olson, director of local customer advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition, says the request is the largest increase he has seen among the state’s five investor-owned utilities. He said the utility already charges customers for things like grid modernization and expanding its system through expenses tacked onto the bill, and the hike also does not include building new renewable energy projects.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: Zebras are back by popular demand at Blank Park Zoo for the first time since 2011. Two mountain zebras, named Duke and Duchess, have been getting acclimated to their habitat for several months, the zoo announced Tuesday. The animals are 3 and 4 years old. “Zebras are one of the top requests guests have asked me to bring to Blank Park Zoo,” CEO Mark Vukovich said in a statement. Like the zoo’s family of rhinos, the pair of zebras will be part of Species Survival Program. There are just 35,000 mountain zebras left in the wild, Vukovich said. Native to mountainous regions of Namibia, Angola and South Africa, the population is threatened by habitat loss, hunting and drought. Duke and Duchess are currently sharing their space with two ostriches part-time, the zoo says.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Two state lawmakers are encouraging teachers to incorporate culturally relevant studies into their lesson plans. The Topeka Capital-Journal reports that Democratic Reps. John Alcala and Valdenia Winn have spearheaded the Kansas Culturally Relevant Pedagogy Summer Intensive program, which is in its second year. Alcala helped create the initiative after noticing a lack of representation of various ethnic groups in history textbooks. The four-week-long program teaches Kansas educators about culturally relevant pedagogy, including Native American, Chicano/Latino, African American and Asian American studies. Teachers then implement the lessons in their classrooms and share with program directors what did and didn’t work. Alcala says all teachers who participate will be certified in culturally relevant pedagogy upon completion of the program.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: The U.S. Postal Service has suspended mail delivery to a street that has a history of dog attacks. Postal Service spokeswoman Susan Wright says dog attacks have been a problem on Girard Drive for a long time, and the issue is only getting worse. She says a mail carrier recently dodged three loose dogs on the street near Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport. Residents are being asked to pick up their mail from a nearby post office. Wright says the service is working with dog owners to restore delivery. She didn’t say when delivery is expected to resume. The service says mail carriers across the country suffered more than 5,700 dog attacks last year.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: The Essence Festival, which draws thousands to the city the week of the Fourth of July, is celebrating 25 years of bringing African American women of all ages together for thought-provoking conversation and performances from top musical acts. Launched to mark the 25th anniversary of black-owned Essence magazine, the festival has become a yearly celebration to highlight excellence in business, fashion, entertainment and, of course, music. It is a destination vacation for African American women, as showcased in the 2017 hit movie “Girls Trip.” The festival Friday through Sunday has two parts: daytime activities and panel discussions mainly held at the convention center, and nighttime music and concerts at the Superdome. Mary J. Blige and Missy Elliott are among this year’s top-billed musical performers.\n\nMaine\n\nPortland: Baby lobsters are continuing to appear in high numbers off some parts of Canada while dwindling off New England, raising questions about what the valuable shellfish’s population will look like in several years. University of Maine scientist Rick Wahle has documented trends in baby lobster density for years and released new data for 2018 last month. Wahle says his new data reinforces recent trends about lobsters that show major upticks off sites in Atlantic Canada, such as areas in Nova Scotia. Meanwhile, the Gulf of Maine reported below-average numbers from Bar Harbor to Cape Cod. New England’s commercial harvest of lobster has been strong in recent years, but it’s dependent on young lobsters growing to maturity. Some sites, such as those off Rhode Island, show few baby lobsters at all.\n\nMaryland\n\nGermantown: A company that produces electronics for the aerospace and defense industry is planning a new headquarters in the state. Gov. Larry Hogan’s administration made the announcement Tuesday that RADA Technologies is planning the new headquarters in Montgomery County, in the suburbs of the nation’s capital. The administration says the company will relocate to a 25,000-square-foot facility by the end of this year. Because of the expansion, the company plans to create 50 full-time jobs over the next two years and a total of 80 new jobs by December 2023. RADA Technologies is the American subsidiary of Israel-based RADA Electronic Industries. The subsidiary has been operating for about a year in Silver Spring, Maryland. The Hogan administration says RADA will invest nearly $4 million into the expansion.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: History-minded revelers can celebrate the Fourth of July by checking out an original copy of the Declaration of Independence at the state’s Commonwealth Museum. The document was one of 14 original copies and was sent by the Continental Congress to Massachusetts during the Revolutionary War. The copy was printed in the shop of Mary Katherine Goddard and bears the signature of Massachusetts’ own John Hancock, president of the Continental Congress. Other items include letters from John Hancock announcing the Declaration of Independence and an account book from the War of 1812 with one of the earliest written references to the phrase “Uncle Sam.” Thousands have visited the museum, located in the Dorchester neighborhood, on July Fourth in recent years to view the document.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Helping endangered wildlife is now as easy as sipping beer. The Detroit Zoological Society and Birmingham-based Griffin Claw Brewing Co. have announced the release of Piping Plover Pilsner, a special brew named for an endangered shorebird that nests along the Great Lakes. A portion of the proceeds from sales will go toward supporting the zoological society’s wildlife conservation work. The limited-edition beer is available for purchase starting this week in four-packs of 16-ounce cans at Griffin Claw and select grocery stores in the metro area. Piping Plover Pilsner is the first in a series of four special brews Griffin Claw plans to release under the Survival Series label. Brews highlighting the society’s work to help Grauer’s gorillas, Panamanian golden frogs and Partula snails are also on tap.\n\nMinnesota\n\nSt. Paul: Statistics released by the state Department of Health show 9,910 abortions were performed in Minnesota in 2018, a 2% decrease from the year before. While the overall numbers declined, the number of people who traveled to Minnesota for an abortion increased by 8% over 2017, with the bulk of out-of-state residents traveling from Wisconsin. The statistics released Monday also show that fewer teenagers and women under 20 received abortions in 2018. That number was 809, down from 841 a year before. The vast majority of abortions were performed in a woman’s first trimester.\n\nMississippi\n\nWoodville: A museum in southwestern Mississippi has opened a new exhibit of artifacts found near two Native American mounds in the area. The Natchez Democrat reports the items are now on display at the Wilkinson County Museum in downtown Woodville. Exhibit curator Megan Kassabaum, assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, says the display has been in development since last year, when she and her students did excavation projects at the Lessley and Smith Creek mound sites west of Woodville. The exhibit includes three glass cases that showcase Native American artifacts such as jewelry, spearheads and arrowheads, cooking tools and utensils, and pieces of pottery, as well as two handmade replica pots.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A man who was unable to finish high school but went on to serve as crew chief for the famed Tuskegee Airman has received an honorary diploma nearly 80 years after leaving high school. The Jefferson City News-Tribune reports that James Shipley got the diploma in a Sunday ceremony. Military historian Jeremy Amick says Shipley didn’t have a chance to earn his diploma years ago. He attended an all-black high school that wasn’t credentialed through 12th grade. Shipley would have had to travel to Sedalia for his final year, and he didn’t have the resources to do so. The Tuskegee Airmen were black military pilots and crew who made up the 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces.\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: Native Americans in the state are rallying behind a family who say a federal investigation into the shooting death of their relative by a white man 14 years ago was tainted by discrimination. The 10-year-old civil lawsuit questioning the FBI investigation into Steven Bearcrane’s death is getting renewed attention amid increasing national awareness of unsolved cases involving missing and murdered Native Americans. Dozens of people from across the state filled a courtroom Tuesday as the attorney for Bearcrane’s parents and daughter said the 2004 death illustrates how the FBI provides fewer law enforcement services for Native Americans compared to the rest of the population. Bearcrane was shot by Bobby Holcomb on a ranch on the Crow Indian Reservation. The FBI investigation concluded the shooting was self-defense, and prosecutors declined to charge Holcomb.\n\nNebraska\n\nFremont: University of Nebraska students are beginning to work in several communities through a new summer service program created in the wake of this year’s devastating flooding. The program projects include documenting flood damage to roads and bridges, organizing a thank-you event for volunteers who cleaned up a local fairground, and developing multilingual disaster recovery materials to help with landscape design and GPS mapping. The Fremont Tribune reports that 24 students representing the Kearney, Lincoln and Omaha campuses are helping 14 communities, with more students being placed as the university matches students’ skills with local needs.\n\nNevada\n\nNorth Las Vegas: The state has restored voting rights to ex-felons, putting it in line with at least a dozen other states that automatically grant voting rights to people once they are released from prison. Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford said at a news conference Monday in Las Vegas that voting is an important part of reintegrating into the community and that his office would work to spread the word about the new law. The change moves Nevada away from a more complex system in which an ex-felon’s right to vote depended on their crime, completion of probation or parole, the year they were convicted, and whether a judge approved giving them back the right to vote. Supporters of the law estimate about 77,000 ex-felons in Nevada will regain the right to vote under the change.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nLaconia: Officials say a 36-foot red oak sculpture of a Native American man called “The Defiant One” that had rotted through was removed. The Laconia Daily Sun reports the statue was dedicated in 1984 in Opechee Park. The sculpture was brought down by a backhoe Monday before it fell over on its own. Laconia Public Works Director Wes Anderson said when the sculpture came down, small pieces of wood and dust were everywhere, and “there was nothing you could recognize.” There’s an effort to replace the statue with one made out of a fiber filament. A 3D printer will use a laser scan to produce a new statue. Peter Toth, a Hungarian-born artist, created the wooden sculpture and others throughout the country to honor Native American people.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nFreehold: The state has expanded its medical marijuana program – including increasing the number of illnesses eligible for cannabis use, boosting the amount that can be dispensed and raising the number of cultivator permits – under a broad new law. Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, signed the Jake Honig Compassionate Use Medical Cannabis Act on Tuesday, alongside the parents and sister of the bill’s namesake, a 7-year-old who died last year after battling brain cancer. His parents have fought for easier access to cannabis to ease pain during illnesses. Among other changes, the measure allows for home delivery to patients. Illnesses now covered include seizure disorder, intractable skeletal muscular spasticity, post-traumatic stress disorder, glaucoma, cancer, chronic pain and opioid-use disorder. The law permits physician assistants and advanced practice nurses to authorize medical cannabis.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlbuquerque: The state’s largest electric utility on Monday submitted to regulators its plan for shutting down the coal-fired San Juan Generating Station, replacing the lost power and pricing the cost to customers. The filing with the Public Regulation Commission comes as a new state law dictates more aggressive renewable energy requirements while allowing Public Service Co. of New Mexico to recoup from customers some of the expenses. The costs range from nearly $4.7 billion to more than $5.4 billion, but utility executives say residential customers would end up saving about $7 a month in the first year after the plant closes under its preferred proposal. That option includes a mix of natural gas-fired power plants, solar and wind farms, and new battery storage facilities.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: An immigrant naturalization ceremony has been held at the Sept.11 memorial for the first time. The ceremony Tuesday saw 52 new U.S. citizens pledge allegiance to the nation at the ground zero museum, which opened in 2014. Alice M. Greenwald, president of the museum, says the location was symbolic because so many people who lost their lives on Sept. 11, 2001, were immigrants, hailing from 90 different countries. The acting director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli, administered the Oath of Allegiance and welcomed the new citizens. “We are stronger today because of naturalized citizens like all of you who followed the rules, upheld our laws and chose to make a permanent commitment to the United States,” he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: It’s not every day you can see the state’s copy of the Bill of Rights, but the original copy is on display to visitors at the North Carolina Museum of History through Sunday, including on Independence Day. Each of the 13 original states received a copy of what were initially 12 amendments to the Constitution, signed by then-Vice President John Adams. Ten amendments were soon ratified. Historians say the copy was stolen from the old Capitol building in 1865 by a Union soldier. The document wasn’t recovered until 2003, during an FBI sting operation involving an antiques dealer. The copy is on display from time to time. It otherwise sits in one of two vaults in the State Archives.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The Three Affiliated Tribes have been granted trust status for the historic Figure Four Ranch. The tribes bought the roughly 9,300-acre ranch that borders the reservation’s west side between Lake Sakakawea and the Little Missouri River in 1999 and converted it to a bison ranch. They requested trust status nearly a decade ago, a move that would make the land tax-exempt. The Bismarck Tribune reports it wasn’t approved until May, with a deed-signing ceremony this week. The federal government attributed the delay to red tape. Chairman Mark Fox said the change will allow the tribes to move ahead with energy development. Tribal officials also hope to develop tourism at the ranch, with expanded buffalo and elk hunting and the possible building of a hotel or resort.\n\nOhio\n\nCleveland: A ceremony marking the 125th anniversary of a Civil War monument in the city is set for Thursday. The Cuyahoga County Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Monument honoring the county’s citizens who fought and worked for the Union was dedicated July 4, 1894. The anniversary celebration is set for noon at the monument on Public Square. Major General John C. Harris Jr., adjutant general of the Ohio Army National Guard, will give the keynote speech. The Monument Commission recently announced the addition of 107 names of veterans of the United States Colored Troops to 9,000 names already on the monument’s Roll of Honor. All 107 were enlisted or appointed from Cuyahoga County. In case of rain, Thursday’s ceremony will be held at the nearby Old Stone Church.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: Officials say the number of structurally deficient bridges in the state has dropped from about 1,170 in 2004 to 132. Transportation Secretary Tim Gatz told a state transportation panel Monday that Oklahoma now ranks 13th in the U.S. for fewest deficient bridges in its highway system. About 6,800 bridges are part of Oklahoma’s system, a number that doesn’t include other spans operated by local entities such as city and county governments. Gatz says the state Department of Transportation began setting more money aside in 2006 for bridge repairs, and lawmakers provided additional funding a few years later. He says a finding that a bridge is deficient doesn’t necessarily mean it’s dangerous for motorists to cross. It’s an indication that some part of the bridge, such as the driving surface, needs improvements.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state has approved a pioneering measure to increase the supply of affordable housing. The Senate voted 17-9 Sunday to send the governor a plan to ease local zoning laws. Cities with more than 10,000 people must allow for the construction of less expensive housing options like duplexes, triplexes and townhomes. The measure doesn’t require that these types of housing units actually be built. Rather, it lifts local bans on these denser housing options, paving the way for possible future development. The city of Minneapolis approved a similar measure last year. The move responds to a statewide affordable housing crisis that touches every part of the state. The governor earlier this year approved the first statewide rent control law in the nation.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nPhiladelphia: Patti LaBelle now has her very own street in her hometown of Philadelphia, and the legendary soul singer has christened it with a song. A stretch of Broad Street was renamed “Patti LaBelle Way” during a ceremony Tuesday. “The Godmother of Soul” thanked the throngs of fans who clogged the intersection and treated them to an impromptu rendition of her hit “Love, Need and Want You.” Brandishing one of the new street signs, she told onlookers she felt blessed and spoke about how her parents used to walk along this stretch of road. “Lady Marmalade” was LaBelle’s first No. 1 hit when she was the lead singer of LaBelle. She also had a successful solo career with hits like “You Are My Friend” and “New Attitude.”\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: U.S. Sen. Jack Reed says the state’s health department will receive $11.3 million in federal funding over five years for immunization and vaccine programs for children. The Rhode Island Democrat says the state should expect to get nearly $2.3 million of that funding this year from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Reed says the federal money will be used to improve immunization levels and help eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases among children. The funding can be used for health care providers to vaccinate uninsured children, underinsured children and children on Medicaid at no cost to their family. Reed says Rhode Island isn’t immune from the threat of a measles outbreak, but its high vaccination rate of young people is the best line of defense.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: Supporters of the Confederate flag will be a few days late this year in marking the anniversary of the banner’s removal from the Statehouse grounds. A group called Flags Across the South has a permit for a rally outside the Capitol on July 13 and plans to fly the Confederate flag from a temporary flagpole from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., says Braxton Spivey, the group’s chairman. The event will be held three days after the fourth anniversary of the date state officials removed the banner from outside the Statehouse after a racially motivated attack at a historically black church in Charleston. The past three years, the South Carolina Secessionist Party raised the Confederate flag each July 10, but the group has since splintered, The State newspaper reports, and a group called Showing Up for Racial Justice Columbia reserved the spot this year, blocking any others from flying the rebel banner.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state’s first case of West Nile virus this year has been confirmed in Turner County, according to a Health Department news release. The person is in the 30-39 age group. West Nile is a mosquito-transmitted virus that can cause fever and sometimes fatal illness, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The West Nile season runs from summer through the fall, according to the CDC. Joshua Clayton, an epidemiologist with the South Dakota Health Department, said the state normally has more confirmed cases of West Nile than any other state and warned people to protect themselves, especially at night, “such as Fourth of July fireworks shows.”\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Grammy winner Kacey Musgraves hadn’t taken much time to reflect on her career until she saw it chronicled behind museum glass. The country singer is the subject of a new exhibit at the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum that opened Tuesday and runs through June 2020. Her critically acclaimed record “Golden Hour” earned four Grammys this year, including album of the year. Musgraves said it was a funny conundrum to win that award when many people didn’t know her music. The 30-year-old has become a cross-genre star whose emotional, clever lyrics and inventive style blending country with electronic, disco and spacey pop sounds has earned her plenty of new fans. Musgraves says the exhibit hit her “in an emotional way.” “Kacey Musgraves: All of the Colors” includes photos, song lyrics and fashions.\n\nTexas\n\nLa Porte: Public visits to the 107-year-old Battleship Texas near Houston will be limited during cataloging of thousands of artifacts aboard amid plans for $35 million in ship repairs. The Texas Parks & Wildlife Department announced last week that starting July 8, the vessel at the Battleship Texas State Historic Site in La Porte will close to visitors Monday through Thursday. The ship will be open Friday through Sunday. Anyone already holding July and August reservations can visit as scheduled. Department spokesman Stephanie Garcia says artifacts on board must be taken care of, for storage, before the ship goes into dry dock to fix the leaking hull. The Battleship Texas Foundation said in May that the ship will get a new home following repairs. No new location has been announced.\n\nUtah\n\nProvo: LGBTQ groups have been quietly accepted into a prominent July Fourth festival in this conservative city after being denied for years. The Daily Herald in Provo reports that five such groups marched in the America’s Freedom Festival parade last year, but only after an initial refusal and high-profile dispute. County officials threatened to pull $100,000 in taxpayer money from the privately organized event until the groups were allowed to participate. One was Utah County Commissioner Nathan Ivie, who recently came out as gay. This year, all four groups that applied were accepted to march in parade festivities. Freedom Festival Executive Director Paul Warner says the process was smooth. Actor Chuck Norris is a parade grand marshal along with Jennie Taylor, whose husband, Maj. Brent Taylor, was killed while deployed to Afghanistan.\n\nVermont\n\nShelburne: A simple change to a farmer’s hay cutting schedule could be the key to saving families of birds from extinction. Researchers are working with landowners in the state to preserve some of the last vital habitats available for grassland birds, like the bobolink, Savannah sparrow and meadowlark. Armed with data that shows an early hay cut can help the birds more successfully reproduce, places like Shelburne Farms are managing prime bird habitat to protect the species while also producing feed for their cows. Noah Perlut, associate professor and chairman of the Environmental Studies program at the University of New England, has studied these grassland birds for the last 18 years. While working for the University of Vermont, he made a groundbreaking discovery: If farmers cut hay early and wait 65 days before a second cut, the birds have enough time to breed and raise their young.\n\nVirginia\n\nCharlottesville: The city will no longer celebrate Thomas Jefferson’s birthday as an official holiday and instead will observe a day recognizing the emancipation of enslaved African Americans. The City Council voted Monday night to scrap the decades-old April 13 holiday honoring the slave-holding president and Founding Father. Charlottesville will now mark Liberation and Freedom Day on March 3, the day U.S. Army forces arrived in the city in 1865. Charlottesville has been grappling publicly for years with how to tell its history of race and discrimination. Those efforts intensified after white nationalists gathered in the city in 2017 for a rally that descended into deadly violence. The legacy of Jefferson, the nation’s third president, author of the Declaration of Independence and founder of the University of Virginia, has been a component of that ongoing debate.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Most of the 222 school buildings that officials examined across the state would be unsafe to occupy after powerful earthquakes. The Seattle Times reports that assessments by the Washington Department of Natural Resources found about a quarter of the schools would not be able to be repaired, and 43% posed a high or very high risk for loss of life from quakes. Department Chief Hazard Geologist Corina Forson says the buildings selected for assessment make up a “representative, meaningful sample” of the state’s 4,444 permanent school buildings. Officials determined that the most vulnerable buildings are the older ones and those built from unreinforced masonry or under-reinforced concrete. Forson says the department plans to examine 350 more schools.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nElkins: West Virginia University Extension Service faculty and staff are working with students at six elementary schools to plant edible landscaping that will provide fresh food for the students. Extension Service Family Nutrition Program youth health educator Tracey Valach found out one of the schools was planning new landscaping and suggested the school choose fruit-bearing plants. Valach worked with Extension Service agents Hannah Fincham and Jody Carpenter to choose the plants. With crowdfunding and community support, they purchased blueberry bushes and apple trees for each school. The students learned how to choose the best location for the plants. Valach says the students will be involved with harvest and other activities with the fruit, including hands-on cooking classes and taste testing. Some of the fruit will also go to the salad bar or be used in cafeteria meals.\n\nWisconsin\n\nSheboygan: A man has been sentenced to 150 days in jail for repeatedly clogging women’s toilets, including at places he worked. Patrick Beeman, 35, pleaded no contest to five counts of misdemeanor criminal damage to property. The state recommended a 30-day sentence for the crime, but Sheboygan Press Media reports that Judge Kent Hoffmann on Monday gave Beeman 30 days for each count, to be served consecutively. The Sheboygan man also was ordered to serve three years of probation and pay $5,500 in restitution. Prosecutors say Beeman told police he gets urges to do odd things, like look for bottles in the garbage to clog toilets and cause them to overflow. Police found a toilet in the women’s bathroom at Deland Community Center clogged by a plastic bottle last March, an incident similar to 10 others beginning in 2017.\n\nWyoming\n\nCody: A museum devoted to guns is reopening after a major renovation. Admission to the Cody Firearms Museum will be free Saturday night following the renovation, which cost $12 million. The Billings Gazette reports a large part of a new addition at the museum is dedicated to firearm education and safety. Visitors can practice on four simulators, one each for a handgun, M2 machine gun, long-range rifle and shotgun. The museum also has displays on rifling, gun barrel design and ballistics, where visitors can try to line up rifling marks with the images of fired bullets like a ballistics expert. Other displays cover the evolution of firearms and military history.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/07/03"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2022/10/16/stolen-atm-plan-lawsuit-huge-trout-news-around-states/50842757/", "title": "Stolen ATM, Plan B lawsuit: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: People with relatives and loved ones in Alabama prisons rallied outside the state Capitol Friday to decry what they described as inhumane conditions behind bars and a parole process that sees few inmates released. More than 200 people joined the rally outside the Capitol. Tombstones were placed on the white marble steps of the Alabama Capitol to represent the men who died in Alabama prisons from suicides, murders and overdoses. The rally followed a three-week work strike at many prisons aimed at seeking changes to state sentencing laws and the parole system. Inmates refused to show up for jobs in prison kitchens, janitorial services and laundries, jobs that keep the prisons functioning but for which the inmates receive no pay. The Alabama Department of Corrections said Friday that two facilities for men continue to have complete work stoppages, and three facilities have partial work stoppages. Inmates and activists have accused the Department of Corrections of using pressure tactics in an attempt to end the demonstration. Officials said the reduced rations and the lack of visits were the result of a prisoner labor shortage. The U.S. Department of Justice is suing Alabama over the conditions in its prisons, saying the state is failing to protect male inmates from inmate-on-inmate violence and excessive force at the hands of prison staff. The case is slated for trial in 2024. Alabama officials have acknowledged problems but deny that the living conditions violate constitutional standards.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: Mayor Dave Bronson’s administration officials approved a contractor to spend millions on building an emergency shelter without getting needed approval from the Assembly, Alaska Public Media reports. Public Works Director Lance Wilber said the city had given Roger Hickel Contracting the go-ahead to spend $4.9 million on the construction of a shelter and navigation center in East Anchorage. “The error on our part was that, in the traditional construction contracting process, we should have gone to the Assembly initially, and asked to amend the Hickel contract,” Wilber said. Anchorage municipal code states that any city contract of more than $50,000 has to be approved by the Assembly, according to the news outlet. The Assembly was supposed to vote on the contract in September, but the vote was pushed to Oct. 25 after concerns over costs. The East Anchorage shelter has been key to the Bronson administration’s response to homelessness.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Officials say eviction filings are continuing to rise in Arizona’s largest county, with the average judgment against tenants nearly doubling from four years ago. Maricopa County Justice Courts spokesman Scott Davis said this week that September was the third month in a row in which the filings were higher than they had been since October 2008. Maricopa County is home to Phoenix, the fifth largest city in the U.S. The average judgment against an evicted tenant has hit $3,337.50, up from $1,750.58 in 2008, said Davis. He also noted the number of eviction cases being sealed to protect tenants is rising due to a new law, with 248 cases sealed in just two weeks. Cases can be sealed to protect the tenant from future credit problems if, for instance, the rent is paid or if the paperwork is found to be deficient. Maricopa County had among the highest levels of evictions in the United States before state and federal eviction moratoriums slowed lockouts during the pandemic. Those eviction bans have long since ended.\n\nArkansas\n\nFort Smith: Medical marijuana patients in the state are on track to spend more at dispensaries in 2022 than they did in 2021, a spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration reports. Overall, purchases made by patients at Arkansas dispensaries totaled $31 million in 2019, then $182 million in 2020, $264.9 million in 2021 and so far this year, $205 million through the first nine months of 2022, said Scott Hardin, spokesman for the Arkansas Department of Finance Administration. “By the end of December, our overall sales for 2022 should certainly be above the $264.9 million sold in 2021,” Hardin said. While Arkansans approved medical marijuana in November 2016 in what is now Amendment 98 to the State Constitution, the first dispensary did not open in the state until May 2019. Arkansas limited the number of dispensaries allowed to sell medical marijuana. A limit on the number of dispensaries is also proposed in the Issue 4 state question on ballots for voters to consider legalizing recreational marijuana Nov. 8. “The reason sales were so low in 2019 was the number of dispensaries in operation. There were only a few dispensaries open for an extended period in 2019,” Hardin said. The number increased to 14 dispensaries by the end of 2019. There are currently 38 dispensaries. State tax revenue generated from medial marijuana totaled $2.9 million in 2019, $21.2 million in 2020, $33.1 million in 2021 and $23.9 million in 2022 through the first nine months. Overall, that is $81 million generated in state tax revenue since mid-2019.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCamp Pendleton: The Marine Corps has halted some operations of its new amphibious combat vehicles after one of the armored vehicles rolled over in surf during training. The eight-wheeled vehicle flipped over at about 7:45 p.m. Thursday at the Marines Assault Amphibian School at the base north of San Diego, authorities said. The three crew members weren’t injured, a Marine Corps statement said Friday. The vehicle had a “mechanical malfunction,” according to the Marine Corps, which banned the vehicles from going into or out of surf zones, except for testing, while more analysis is performed. The vehicles can still be used on land, in protected waters and in the open ocean. It was the second time this year that restrictions have been placed on the use of amphibious combat vehicles. Open water operations were halted after one of the vehicles rolled onto its side and another was disabled in unusually high surf on July 19 during another training exercise. The pause was lifted last month. The new vehicles, which are being tested and used in California, are designed to transport troops and their equipment from Navy ships to land. They are being rolled out to replace the Marine’s aging amphibious assault vehicle, which is lighter, slower and runs on tracks instead of wheels.\n\nColorado\n\nPueblo: The city is starting a multiday cleanup and outreach effort at Fountain Creek alongside partner agencies Monday to address environmental health and safety concerns. According to a news release from the city, the area has been identified as a concern for city officials, residents and business owners and there have been growing concerns of trash and people experiencing homelessness who often use the space as an encampment. Pueblo Code Enforcement unit is organizing the effort to gather community partners, including the Pueblo police and fire departments, for the cleanup. “The city of Pueblo’s biggest concern is the safety and health of the individuals in Pueblo and the protection of our waterway. We know this cleanup will provide much-needed outreach and the environmental protection in the area,” Mayor Nick Gradisar said in the release. Community partners involved in the effort are expected to provide outreach to the individuals experiencing homelessness in the area to meet their needs and connect them to resources. Loaders and skid steers will be used to transport trash, and once the cleanup is completed, boulders will be placed at various points in the area to discourage people from driving in and camping or living there.\n\nConnecticut\n\nPlainfield: Turbo-charged donations collected over the last two years from popular Plainfield motorcycle events helped the town secure a state grant that will add a bevy of new recreational offerings at a local park. Since first introducing the Plainfield Bike Night events two years ago, the overseeing event committee has taken in $22,500 from sponsors, sales and entrance fees, money later funneled into the town’s Recreation Department for use for parks and other improvements. But the “real” amount of those contributions is closer to $80,000 – a four-fold jump – thanks to the use of matching grants, town officials said. “From the very beginning, we planned on collecting money to help improve parks and anything else recreation-related,” said Leon Lefevre, president of the Plainfield Bike Night Committee. “But it wasn’t until last week when we made our latest check presentation that we found out how much in total it actually represented.” The group on Oct. 6 presented a $10,000 check to the recreation department, slightly less than the $12,500 raised in 2021. That check, along with last year’s donation, played a pivotal role in the town winning a $605,000 state Small Town Economic Assistance, or STEAP, grant that will jumpstart a $2 million planned phased upgrade to Lions Park.\n\nDelaware\n\nChristiana: Hobby Lobby, the national arts and crafts retailer, is planning to open a store in Christiana in January. The new store is taking a portion of a Burlington on Route 273 in University Plaza. It will be the first Hobby Lobby in New Castle County and the second in Delaware, joining a Hobby Lobby on Route 13 in Dover that opened in 2020. Burlington reopened in March in a smaller store to the right of their original University Plaza entrance when viewed from the parking lot. The entrance to Hobby Lobby will be to the left of the new Burlington. With more than 900 stores, Hobby Lobby says it’s the largest privately owned arts and crafts retailer in the world. Their stores offer home decor products, tableware, art supplies, fabrics and jewelry-making supplies. Adjacent to University Plaza, construction crews last summer cleared woods for a Wawa. A Wawa spokesperson did not respond when asked when the store will open. Approved plans also call for two retail pads – one for a fast-food or quick-service restaurant and the other for a larger restaurant. The Wawa will have gas pumps, according to the plan. New Castle County on Aug. 30 issued a building permit for Wawa. The permit expires after a year, but can be extended.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Initiative 82 is on the minds of voters in D.C., WUSA-TV reports. It would, over time, eliminate the tipped wage system that exists in some restaurants and bars. The debate has been an ongoing battle for years. “Change can be hard,” Andy Shallal of Busboys and Poets said. He hopes Initiative 82 gets support in November. “I really see tipping as something that is a past relic. Something that needs to, not be eliminated, but certainly not have people depend on it to make their living,” he said. The minimum wage for non-tipped employees in D.C. is $16.10 per hour, but just $5.35 for tipped employees. If passed, Initiative 82 would be slowly rolled out. Tipped employees will start earning $6 per hour by January 2023, $8 by next July and then two dollar raises each year until 2027, WUSA-TV reports. Shallal said it gives businesses time to make changes. “It should give time for a lot of businesses to make that adjustment and make it work, and you know, I think in the long run we’re going to be looking back at this years later and think, what were we thinking,” he said. But not all restaurants agree. Some say they can’t afford another mandatory increase in wages to stay afloat.\n\nFlorida\n\nWest Palm Beach: The trial of a Florida woman accused of dressing up as clown in 1990 and fatally shooting the wife of a man she later married has been postponed following the disclosure of a law enforcement file containing information about other clown-sighting leads at the time. Prosecutors informed defense attorneys for Sheila Keen Warren on Wednesday that they had found a “clown sighting file” which defense attorneys had been demanding but prosecutors had been saying they didn’t have, according to a court filing by defense attorneys in Palm Beach County case. Defense attorneys in the motion asked for a delay in the first-degree murder trial which was scheduled to start the next week. The jury trial was canceled on Friday. Defense attorneys also are seeking sanctions against prosecutors for what they say are instances of failing to disclose evidence to the defendant and are asking that Keen Warren be allowed pretrial release from jail. The 25-page “clown sighting file” has the names, addresses or phone numbers of 40 credible leads, according to the court filing from defense attorneys. “Needless to say this will take the defense considerable time and resources to investigate,” the defense attorneys said. Marlene Warren was fatally shot in the face in May 1990 by someone in an orange wig, red nose and white face paint who handed her carnations and foil balloons after she answered the door of her upscale South Florida home.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: A federal lawsuit filed Thursday accuses Bartow County of violating the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it fired two Black men two years ago. U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan of the Northern District of Georgia said the county, which is about 45 miles north of Atlanta, subjected former employee Carlen Loyal to a racially hostile work environment and retaliated against former employee Bobby Turner before dismissing them both. “No one should be forced to labor in an environment where employers condone racial slurs and employees are expected to tolerate them,” Buchanan said in a news release. “It is also unacceptable for an employer to foster a work environment where employees with the courage to report such abhorrent behavior experience retaliation from supervisors and face termination of their jobs. Our office will vigorously and continuously leverage our resources to address this type of illegal discrimination in the workplace.” Loyal worked for the county’s Road Department for almost 10 years and Turner, who is his brother-in-law, was also employed there for several years, according to the news release.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: Maui County has a new contract to save taxpayer money by reducing energy, water and fuel usage, Hawaii News Now reports. The county announced Friday it’s partnering with Johnson Controls to save the county $73 million by improving energy at 141 locations. Johnson Controls plans to hire 40 workers to retrofit buildings with LED lighting, install electric vehicle charging stations, replace plumbing fixtures and much more, according to the news outlet. “This is a fiscally responsible project that saves taxpayer dollars, creates local jobs, reduces our carbon footprint, and importantly, frees up clean water that we can use for affordable housing,” Mayor Michael Victorino said. “Reducing dependence on fossil fuels means we are taking money out of an oil tanker and keeping it right here, investing in jobs for our residents.”\n\nIdaho\n\nIsland Park: A huge trout reeled in by an angler broke a state record, the Idaho Statesman reports. Hailey Thomas was on the lake with her family when a “heavy fish” took Thomas’ bait, according to an Oct. 12 news release from Idaho Fish and Game. She began reeling in the catch from Henrys Lake. “Hailey did a phenomenal job fighting the fish and keeping it out of the abundant weeds, notorious for knocking large trout off the line,” her husband, Shane, told the state department. “After a stressful minute or so, I reached out and scooped up the fish. The net I usually use for chasing carp looked so small, as the fish barely fit in!” The angler had reeled in a “monster” rainbow/cutthroat hybrid trout, officials said. It measured in at 36 inches long with a 21-inch girth, according to the release. Experts estimate it likely weighed between 17 to 20 pounds. Thomas posed for photos with her catch, then released it back into the lake, officials said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A Chicago police officer with ties with the Proud Boys, a far-right extremist group, was suspended for 120 days but won’t be fired, the city’s watchdog agency has announced. In its latest quarterly report, the Office of Inspector General said that a lengthy internal police department investigation was resolved through a “mediation agreement” in which the officer agreed not to dispute the allegations against him, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. The officer was not named in the report, but in previous articles in the newspaper Officer Robert Bakker has acknowledged that he took part in Proud Boys group chats, and the police department confirmed that Bakker was, in fact, the subject of the investigation. The investigation into a link between Bakker and the Proud Boys was first reported two years ago. Since then, the group that has been designated extremist by the Southern Poverty Law Center has found itself at the center of a criminal investigation into the siege at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Bakker, who was also under investigation for not disclosing to the police department that he was under FBI investigation, could not be reached for comment. The police department declined to comment. The inspector general’s office determined that a police department investigation by its internal affairs bureau found that Bakker “made a contradictory statement” about his participation in a Proud Boys’ chat group and lied about attending a Proud Boys-sponsored barbecue, the newspaper reported. Bakker has acknowledged to the newspaper after being contacted for an article about him in 2020 that he posted messages on the Proud Boys Telegram channel but maintained that he was never a member of the group.\n\nIndiana\n\nFort Wayne: The Fort Wayne City Council has asked the city’s attorney to answer several questions stemming from Mayor Tom Henry’s recent drunken driving crash and the suspension of his driver’s license for 90 days. Council President Jason Arp sent the letter to City Attorney Malak Heiny on Friday and asks for a reply by the close of business Wednesday. The questions seek information on 12 topics such as leasing information for the Chevrolet Impala the mayor was driving, insurance coverage and whether Henry was ever stopped by police previously. Henry’s blood-alcohol level was 0.152 after he was arrested the evening of Oct. 9. Indiana’s legal limit to drive is 0.08. Police said Henry was driving and his wife and mother-in-law were passengers when his vehicle went left of the center line and struck another car. The other driver was not injured. The 70-year-old Democrat pleaded guilty Monday to operating a vehicle while intoxicated endangering a person.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics employees who say that overtime and other payments were improperly paid will receive $15 million as part of a class-action suit that was filed in 2019, according to documents filed Friday. The healthcare system and about 11,000 workers have argued that managers didn’t pay overtime, bonuses or accrued leave as quickly as state and federal laws require. Lawyers for the employees said the settlement figure could have been as high as $64 million. However, they were worried that a higher court could have reduced the amount to as low as $11 million after lawyers for the Iowa Board of Regents threatened to appeal a judge’s ruling for partial summary judgment, the Des Moines Register reported. Based on that prospect, attorneys for the class members said in documents they “believe they have obtained a great result” with the settlement. The six employees who led the lawsuit will each receive $10,000. The other workers will each receive a share of the remaining $11.6 million, based on how many payments employees allegedly received from the hospital later than the law allows. The lawyers will take home $3.4 million. A spokesperson for the Board of Regents did not immediately return an email seeking comment.\n\nKansas\n\nStilwell: A Stilwell nurse practitioner is suing CVS, arguing she was dismissed last year for not filling prescriptions for contraceptives despite previously having a religious exemption. The lawsuit, brought by Suzanne Schuler in the U.S. District Court for Kansas on Wednesday, argues the company changed its policies earlier this year to deem filling prescriptions for birth control or Plan B were “essential” functions and that a religious exemption was no longer an option. The lawsuit said that Schuler’s Nazarene faith prevented her from “providing, prescribing, or facilitating the use of any drug, device, or surgical procedure that can cause abortion,” believing life begins at conception. In 2009, Schuler was hired as a nurse practitioner at a MinuteWell clinic at a CVS in Olathe. Two years later she sought and obtained a religious exemption from prescribing contraceptives and did the same in 2015 when asked to prescribe Plan B. Instead, she would send customers to nearby stores to obtain those services – though she argues this was a rare occurrence and one the lawsuit argues didn’t prompt customer complaints.\n\nKentucky\n\nInez: Martin County’s top elected official is resigning from office, leaving a vacancy in a post that has been plagued by instability in recent years. Martin County Judge-Executive Colby Kirk announced his resignation on Friday, WYMT-TV reported. Kirk is taking a job as CEO of One East Kentucky, a group that recruits business and investment to the region. “I have been proud to serve the people of Martin County and am grateful beyond words to all who have supported me in this role,” Kirk said. He is withdrawing from the November election, where he was unopposed after defeating another Republican candidate in the May primary. Kirk was sworn in as an interim replacement in January after the departure of Judge-Executive Victor Slone. Slone, who had been battling cancer, died in January about a month after announcing he was leaving the elected post. Slone replaced William Davis, who abruptly resigned in March 2021. The small Appalachian county has long struggled with issues in its aging water line system and funding the costly repairs. Kirk said he would help ensure a smooth transition for the next office holder. He will serve until Oct. 28.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Fans of New Orleans’ Mardi Gras season can expect another year of shortened parade routes. The Mayor’s Mardi Gras Advisory Council said Thursday that the shorter routes of 2022 will continue in 2023, The Times-Picayune/The New Orleans Advocate reported. “Due to the manpower shortage that we’re seeing across the country within the law enforcement community, we are going to do the exact same routes that we did last year,” said James Reiss III, the advisory council’s chairman. “I will add that we’re very aware, the city is very aware, that it affects all of us individual parading krewes differently.” The smaller police force and a shortage of other municipal workers led City Hall to cut blocks from the parades routes last year. The continuing surge of retirements and difficulty recruiting new officers has left the police department with the fewest commissioned officers in decades, leading Mayor LaToya Cantrell in August to question whether Carnival parades would even be possible in 2023, the newspaper reported. But Carnival boosters and others noted that even though shortened routs aren’t ideal, they’re better than nothing. “I know we don’t like the shortened routes,” Reiss said, “but if we can work independently with the NOPD to make sure that your individual krewe is doing what it needs to be doing to be safe around that route, it’s very much appreciated by the police department and by the city that we do that.” Mardi Gras 2023’s parade season begins Jan. 6. Mardi Gras will be celebrated Feb. 21.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: A storm packing strong winds and heavy rain lashed the New England coast on Friday with the greatest impact in Maine, where more than 100,000 homes and businesses lost power. The storm brought a gust of 72 mph, just shy of hurricane force, to the Isle of Shoals off the Maine and New Hampshire coast, while 50 mph gusts hit coastal communities, said Sarah Thunberg, meteorologist for the National Weather Service. At the peak, nearly 70,000 homes and businesses were without power in Central Maine Power’s territory, officials said. The storm knocked down trees and left others barren of leaves, and brought several inches of rain to much of the region.\n\nMaryland\n\nSmith Island: A community is leaning on faith and neighbors in tornado cleanup. The aftermath of the tornado that struck Smith Island is still visible two months after it carved a destructive path through the sparsely populated Chesapeake Bay archipelago. The EF1 tornado began as a waterspout that continued on land, damaged a number of piers and homes despite not seriously injuring any residents. Efforts by local organizations like Smith Island United – led by Eddie Somers, Johnny Crantz Tyler, Scott Andreozzi, Duke Marshall, photographer Jay Fleming and Pastor Landon – have been at the forefront of rebuilding efforts. The Smith Island United Committee for Tornado Relief met in mid-September to discuss the first round of checks to be issued to uninsured tornado damage claimants. These first round of checks, approved in unanimous votes and distributed within 10 days, total approximately $34,000 that will take care of approximately 50% of claims submitted, according to the group’s social media post.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: Federal transit authorities have no plans to try to take over the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority or withhold funds from the agency despite a harsh safety review of the MBTA released in August. Nuria Fernandez, head of the Federal Transit Administration, made the comments Friday in response to a question by Democratic U.S. Sen. Edward Markey during a Senate hearing in Boston on the troubled MBTA. “The Federal Transit Administration does not have the legal authority to take over the day to day operations of any transit agency,” Fernandez said, adding that even if it could take over the MBTA, the FTA would not have the capacity to manage the operations of the transit authority. Some Beacon Hill lawmakers have raised the possibility of placing the MBTA into federal receivership. Fernandez said the FTA will continue its oversight of the MBTA to ensure that it addresses ongoing safety concerns. The FTA report includes four “special directives,” requiring 53 separate actions that the transportation authority must take, including addressing worker shortages, prioritization of safety management, safety communication, and operating conditions, policies, procedures, and training. “The Federal Transit Administration is not currently withholding any funding from the state,” Fernandez added. MBTA General Manager Steve Poftak, said the agency is working to address the concerns detailed in the FTA report. “The system is safe, but we can and will do better,” Poftak said. “Safety has been and continues to be our top priority.” Poftak also said that while there will be some nighttime and weekend shutdowns of portions of the MBTA, including on the Red Line, there are no plans to shut down an entire subway line. The MBTA recently shut down the entire Orange Line for 30 days to complete what they said was the equivalent of five years of maintenance.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Thieves are using cloned key fobs to steal Dodge muscle cars and other high-powered vehicles directly from dealerships and even automakers in the state, then selling them for tens of thousands of dollars less than their value, according to authorities and court records. For one Ohio-based theft ring, it all came crashing down after a January holdup of a U.S. postal worker led authorities to connect several men to brazen car thefts in the Detroit area, long home to the country’s biggest automakers, including Dodge, which is now owned by international conglomerate Stellantis. Investigators then discovered that new Chargers, Challengers, Durangos and Ram pickups worth $50,000 to $100,000 were turning up in Ohio, Indianapolis and East Cost shipping ports after being sold on the street for $3,500 to $15,000, according to a criminal complaint. Thieves in the Detroit area are primarily going after Dodge vehicles with Hellcat engines, including Chargers and Challengers – “the fast ones,” Sgt. Jerry Hanna with the Macomb Auto Theft Squad said. “If a patrol car gets them, they are not stopping and they’re faster than patrol cars. They’re 150 mph all day,” he said. Instead of stealing them off the street, they’re driving them straight off dealership and assembly plant lots. Just this year, about a half-dozen vehicles – primarily Dodge Ram TRX pickups – were taken from a lot outside an assembly plant in Macomb County.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: Before attending a packed Sunday morning service, Queen Sonja of Norway praised Mindekirken congregation for having maintained worship in Norwegian for all 100 years that the church has existed in Minneapolis. “It’s extraordinary to realize that, one hundred years after, Mindekirken is still fulfilling that purpose” of building community and preserving culture and language, she said to the nearly 500 people in attendance. They had lined up for more than an hour in this modest neighborhood in brisk fall weather in the 40s to participate in the service. Queen Sonja received a special greeting from Eline Gro Knatterud, 4, who presented the queen with a bouquet of red roses nearly as big as herself. The congregation was founded in 1922, at the tail end of a decades-long migration of hundreds of thousands of Norwegians to Minnesota that made the Twin Cities the “unofficial capital” of the Norwegian diaspora, said Amy Boxrud, the director of the Norwegian-American Historical Association.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: Plummeting water levels in the lower Mississippi River are projected to drop even further in the weeks ahead, a projection shows, dampening the region’s economic activity and potentially threatening jobs in one of the country’s poorest states. In Vicksburg, on the Mississippi river’s east bank near the Louisiana line, the water is approaching its lowest level since 2012. The river’s level near that Mississippi city on Thursday was 4.3 feet, and it is projected to drop to 3 feet by Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. Falling water levels have disrupted industrial shipping and tourism in the area and are on pace to keep dropping. “Right now, the latest forecast is going to take us down on Nov. 8 down to 2 feet at Vicksburg and it could drop a lower than that,” Marty Pope, a hydrologist at the National Weather Service Office in Jackson, told the Vicksburg Post. A dearth of rainfall in recent weeks has left the Mississippi River approaching record low levels in some areas across several states. Nearly all of the Mississippi River basin, from Minnesota through Louisiana, has seen below-normal rainfall since late August. The low levels have caused barges to get stuck in mud and sand, disrupting river travel for shippers, recreational boaters and passengers on a cruise line.\n\nMissouri\n\nFlorissant: There is significant radioactive contamination at an elementary school in suburban St. Louis where nuclear weapons were produced during World War II, according to a new report by environmental investigation consultants. The report by Boston Chemical Data Corp. confirmed fears about contamination at Jana Elementary School in the Hazelwood School District in Florissant raised by a previous Army Corps of Engineers study. The new report is based on samples taken in August from the school, according to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Boston Chemical did not say who or what requested and funded the report. “I was heartbroken,” said Ashley Bernaugh, president of the Jana parent-teacher association who has a son at the school. “It sounds so cliché, but it takes your breath from you.” The school sits in the flood plain of Coldwater Creek, which was contaminated by nuclear waste from weapons production during World War II. The waste was dumped at sites near the St. Louis Lambert International Airport, next to the creek that flows to the Missouri River. The Corps has been cleaning up the creek for more than 20 years. The Corps’ report also found contamination in the area but at much at lower levels, and it didn’t take any samples within 300 feet of the school. The most recent report included samples taken from Jana’s library, kitchen, classrooms, fields and playgrounds. Levels of the radioactive isotope lead-210, polonium, radium and other toxins were “far in excess” of what Boston Chemical had expected. Dust samples taken inside the school were found to be contaminated. Inhaling or ingesting these radioactive materials can cause significant injury, the report said. “A significant remedial program will be required to bring conditions at the school in line with expectations,” the report said. The new report is expected to be a major topic at Tuesday’s Hazelwood school board meeting. The district said in a statement that it will consult with its attorneys and experts to determine the next steps. “Safety is absolutely our top priority for our staff and students,” board president Betsy Rachel said Saturday.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: In addition to the head-to-head races on this November’s ballot, a county is asking the public to decide if it wants to contribute to a public safety mill levy. The levy has several components, including county attorney and deputy salaries, pre-trial services and school safety. The levy amount is 14 mils, which would cost the taxpayer $18.90 per $100,000 of a home’s taxable value annually. Cascade County Commissioner Don Ryan explained that the levy could also go toward general public safety, although the commissioners would have to show how that allocation would make the public safer. Due to legislation that governs how much the county can raise taxes, Ryan said, the additional money for public safety must come from a levy. Ryan said the commission – and to some extent, the public – decides how the money is applied to public safety, and the commission seeks to solve long-term problems. “I’m a big supporter of letting the public determine how this goes,” Ryan said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Pickleball and tennis players might one day have multiple courts dedicated to each of their sports in the four quadrants of the city, the Lincoln Journal Star reports. The growing demand for courts prompted the city last summer to look at existing courts, gauge demand with a public survey and come up with a master plan. If approved by the Lincoln Parks and Recreation Department Advisory Board, the plan will guide how Parks and Rec approaches updates and additions to its existing courts. But the plan won’t be fully realized for years, according to the news outlet. “There’s no money to do this,” city parks planner Sara Hartzell told the advisory board, which must approve the plan. “From here, we put the master plan in our 10-year facilities plan and start working on funding.”\n\nNevada\n\nReno: The Nevada Humane Society’s Reno facility is suspending its intake of cats and kittens while it handles a deadly panleukopenia outbreak. Over the past three weeks, more than 50 cats or kittens have shown symptoms of panleukopenia, according to Humane Society Chief Operating Officer Rory Adams. Panleukopenia is a highly contagious viral disease. Kittens are most severely affected by the virus, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association. The disease is spread through fecal matter. It is not a threat to humans or dogs but is very contagious between felines; however, felines that have been vaccinated against the virus have a very low chance of contracting it. The shelter usually houses more than 300 cats or kittens, but since the outbreak, it has focused on adopting out healthy felines or placing them in foster care. As of Friday morning, there were 226 cats or kittens at the shelter, plus dozens in foster care. Over the past three weeks, 11 cats have died at the facility from the disease. It’s not uncommon for shelters to see cases of feline panleukopenia, marketing director Nicole Theodoulou said. What’s abnormal this time is the number of cats that have been exposed. The Humane Society experienced a number of panleukopenia cases this year, then noticed a sizable increase in cases in early October. CEO Greg Hall said staff isn’t sure of the cause of the outbreak, but they have tracked some of the cats that came from the same address. The outbreak does not affect the Humane Society’s Carson City facility.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nSomersworth: An ATM was stolen from outside Service Credit Union on Penny Lane early Friday morning, and city police say it wasn’t the only crime committed at that time. Somersworth police Capt. John Sunderland said the credit union’s burglary alarms were triggered around 3:04 a.m. and surveillance footage shows the standalone 24-hour drive-through ATM was removed with a pickup truck. Three minutes earlier, police responded to a vehicle fire at 24 Washington St., about two miles away from Service Credit Union. The Fire Department responded and extinguished the fire, which was then investigated by the Somersworth police and the New Hampshire fire marshal’s office. Sunderland said the fire is considered suspicious and the investigation is ongoing. The stolen ATM and the truck used to remove it were recovered by police. Sunderland would not say if the two incidents were connected, nor would he provide specifics about the vehicle set on fire. He said this is because both are still active investigations and the suspects are still at large. Service Credit Union was closed for a short period of time Friday while police and multiple other local and federal agencies, including the FBI, investigated the incident, according to Sunderland. The 24-hour ATM was not immediately back in place Friday.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWildwood: Authorities have announced more arrests in connection with chaos during a pop-up car rally in southern New Jersey last month. Cape May County prosecutors and Wildwood police said one man was arrested on a riot charge and another in connection with an alleged assault on a police officer in the unsanctioned rally that occurred on the weekend of Sept. 24. Police across multiple communities struggled to control the chaotic situation as Nj.com reported social media videos showing modified vehicles revving engines and speeding off to cheers from crowds. WCAU-TV reported people hanging out of cars as drivers spun in circles, and also showed burnouts, drifting and crashes. Prosecutors earlier said Gerald White, 37, of Pittsburgh was charged with two counts of death by auto, assault by auto and other counts. They allege his car hit another car, killing a passenger in the other vehicle, 34-year-old Timothy Ogden, and then struck two pedestrians, killing Lindsay Weakland, 18, of Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Authorities also announced aggravated assault and assault by auto charges against 31-year-old Eryk Wnek of Linden, alleging that he collided with another vehicle and then struck a low-speed vehicle, critically injuring the driver and also injuring a woman and four juvenile passengers. Participants say the event gives enthusiasts a chance to gather and check out cars, but officials in other areas such as Ocean City, Maryland, have reported problems stemming from the event in previous years.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: State-owned public land continued to be a growing source of energy development as oil and gas production’s revenue share swelled in recent years, but renewable energy appeared poised for further growth. The New Mexico State Land Office announced it made $2.4 billion in revenue for Fiscal Year 2022, running from July 1, 2021, to June 30. This followed gradual growth since 2019 when the office raised $1.11 billion, dipping to $1.05 billion in 2020 – the year COVID-19 struck New Mexico and led to declines in fuel demand and reductions in oil and gas production – but recovered to $1.25 billion in FY 2021. Revenue almost doubled in FY 2022, and Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard attributed that to a renewed diversity of uses for State Trust land, in addition to the booming oil and gas industry. Money generated by the Land Office is used to fund public schools, hospitals and other public services in New Mexico.\n\nNew York\n\nQueens: A 15-year-old boy was fatally shot on a New York subway train Friday after a dispute between two groups of people escalated into violence. It was the eighth killing in New York’s subway system this year, at a time when a gradual increase in ridership after a steep decline during the COVID-19 pandemic has been hampered by riders’ safety concerns. According to police, who didn’t identify the victim, the teenager was in one of the groups that got into an argument on an A train in Queens shortly before 4 p.m. As the train neared the line’s final stop in Far Rockaway, near JFK Airport, someone fired one shot, striking the boy in the chest. A passenger helped him off the train when it reached the station. Police and emergency personnel took him to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Police were reviewing security camera footage from the station and the surrounding area. They didn’t say whether they had identified any suspects or a more specific motivation for the shooting. Despite the deployment of more than 1,000 more police officers in the system since the pandemic began, a survey released last month by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority found 70% of riders felt there were too few officers in the system. Barely more than 50% said they felt safe or very safe on trains or in stations.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: State government has spent roughly $2.5 million on Executive Mansion repairs during Gov. Roy Cooper’s tenure – expenses that a state official said were needed for critical safety, security and other upkeep for the over 130-year-old building. The Department of Administration, which maintains state-owned buildings, confirmed recently to North State Journal the total for expenditures and associated costs on the governor’s official residence since 2017. The Raleigh mansion, which first opened in 1891 and is a state historic site, also functions as office and venue space in addition to providing housing for Cooper’s family on the second floor. The building had water damage in the basement and walls and needed foundation repairs and brick restoration, along with repairs to 50-year-old plumbing, department deputy secretary Mark Edwards said. “For several months, we had to close all the exterior porches because they were unsafe for people to walk on,” Edwards told WRAL-TV. The needed repairs, after years of tight budgets, caused delays for Cooper to reside in the mansion when he took office in early 2017. The department declined to provide a line-item accounting of the expenses, with Edwards citing the special security measures for the building. But he said everything performed was necessary – with no “creature comforts or cosmetic changes” for Cooper’s family – and went through the required procurement process. Appropriations in state budgets have covered the expenditures over the years.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nWilliston: Trial is scheduled for early next year for a man accused of setting up an explosives manufacturing operation in his townhouse garage, where police reported finding a large stockpile of bomb-making materials. Police said they seized nearly 1,500 pounds of explosives upon completing the removal and disposal of the materials Friday evening from the townhouse in Williston, in the state’s northwest oil patch. Ross Petrie, 28, of Williston, is charged with a felony called “release of destructive forces.” An affidavit of probable cause said Petrie’s explosives could have had “catastrophic consequences.” A criminal complaint and the probable cause affidavit did not provide a motive for the explosives stockpile though police said more information would be released on Monday. Trial for Petrie is set for Feb. 13. His attorney, Jeff Nehring, did not return a phone message left Saturday afternoon. Officials say they evacuated more than 10 people from the building in which Petrie’s townhouse was located. Authorities said the building will remain empty until police complete their inspection and deem the units safe for residents to return. The affidavit says law enforcement officers began serving a series of search warrants at Petrie’s residence on Oct. 10 after being told a narcotics lab could possibly be in operation. That’s when they discovered explosive materials including powdered metals, according to the affidavit.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: There is an enormous, 900-plus pound hole in the the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium’s polar building. On Wednesday, Anana, a beloved polar bear and long-time zoo favorite, died by euthanasia. The Columbus Zoo announced Anana’s death on Friday via social media, noting that the 16-year-old polar bear did not previously suffer from any medical conditions, but had been acting “unusual” over the past few months. “Extensive testing did not provide a clear diagnosis, and the possibility of an autoimmune syndrome could not be ruled out, so Anana was aggressively treated,” the Columbus Zoo wrote on Facebook. “Although Anana initially improved, her condition declined dramatically over the last week and the decision was made to humanely euthanize her.” Anana, a mother, sister, aunt and independent bear was best known for crafting cozy napping spots, masterfully hunting trout and acting as a “true princess” when refusing to get on the scale to reveal her actual weight, the Columbus Zoo added in its post. The 16-year-old and her twin sister, Aurora, were born on Nov. 25, 2006, at the Toledo Zoo before moving to the Pittsburgh Zoo in 2008. After their stint in Pennsylvania, the sisters arrived at the Columbus Zoo in February 2010, just in time for the grand opening of the zoo’s Polar Frontier exhibit.\n\nOklahoma\n\nNorman: The University of Oklahoma announced a $2 billion fundraising campaign Friday, having raised $600 million over the past two years for the effort. OU began a “quiet launch” on July 1, 2020, for Lead On: The University of Oklahoma’s Campaign for the Future. On Friday, it revealed the campaign’s goal of raising $2 billion by June 30, 2027. The university pledged to dedicate $500 million to scholarships and student support and $300 million to recruit and retain faculty. All three OU campuses – the flagship Norman site, OU-Tulsa and the OU Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City – would benefit, the university said in a news release Friday. It promises to support affordable education, research and health care services, among other initiatives.OU collected $237.9 million in the campaign’s first year. The 2022 fiscal year has been the most fruitful with $317.4 million raised from more than 80,300 donations. Fifty-four of those donations gave $1 million or more.\n\nOregon\n\nPrineville: Authorities are investigating the cause of a house fire in central Oregon city that killed two children. KTVZ-TV reports that members of the children’s family escaped the home in the blaze, which was reported before 6 a.m. on Saturday in Prineville, about 112 miles east of Eugene. Crook County sheriff’s deputies and firefighters arrived to find the home fully engulfed by flames, sheriff’s Sgt. Javier Sanchez said in a statement. “Most family members safely made it out of the house,” Sanchez said, adding that “even with the quick response from law enforcement, Fire and Rescue and residents on scene, two children were not able to get out and are deceased due to the fire.” The children’s ages weren’t immediately released. A telephone message to the sheriff’s office seeking additional information Sunday wasn’t immediately returned. Sanchez asked anyone with information about the fire to contact the sheriff’s office.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nYork: Prosecutors have dropped plans to seek the death penalty against a man accused of killing a man and wounding a woman when he opened fire inside a movie theater almost three years ago. Anu-Malik Johnson, 23, is charged with first- and third-degree murder, aggravated assault, reckless endangering and related offenses in the December 2019 shooting of 22-year-old Andre White Jr. at Regal Cinemas 13 in West Manchester Township. York County prosecutors told the court they planned to pursue capital punishment if he was convicted of first-degree murder. Two years ago, a judge declined to bar them from doing so, rejecting defense arguments alleging a lack of evidence and citing the defendant’s age. The York Dispatch, however, reports that the district attorney’s office asked last week to withdraw its intent to seek the death penalty, citing a mitigation report submitted by the defense as well as “relevant case law and applicable jury instructions.” Defense attorney Jonathan White hailed the decision, saying he had “hoped and believed” prosecutors would drop plans to seek capital punishment. “I believe they made the right decision,” he said while declining to talk about the contents of the mitigation report. Kyle King, spokesperson for the district attorney’s office, declined comment, saying his office doesn’t comment on “pending matters,” he said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nPawtucket: The Pawtucket Police Department is warning “everyone, parents in particular,” after they seized “numerous” packages of marijuana edibles in small bags that “closely resembled common household snacks.” The police found the bags Wednesday while executing a search warrant on Reservoir Avenue. “Detectives seized a large amount of marijuana and packaging material. Also seized were numerous individual sized packages of marijuana edibles in which the packaging closely resembled common household snacks,” the police said in a news release. The police arrested a man on domestic violence and drug charges. Rhode Island legalized the recreational use of marijuana in May, but people can possess only up to one ounce in public and up to 10 ounces in their home. A license is required for selling. On their Facebook page, the police wrote, “We urge everyone, parents in particular, to pay close attention to the packaging on your food, snacks, and candy, especially as we get closer to Halloween. You will notice while the packaging appears incredibly similar to the normal products, there are slight differences. Some of the differences include the marijuana edible packages saying “medibles,’ having a marijuana leaf symbol, listing THC, and/or having a cannabis alert symbol. Some common cannabis/marijuana alert symbols are included.”\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: Two South Carolina Highway Patrol officers were injured, one critically, when they were hit by a vehicle early Sunday during a traffic stop in Greenville, authorities said. The driver fled but was later taken into custody, according to the Greenville County Sheriff’s Office. The officers were taken to a hospital, and one of them was treated and released. The other officer was critically injured, the sheriff’s office said in on its Facebook page. The sheriff’s office did not update the officer’s condition or identify the suspect.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nSioux Falls: The Class of 2022 in South Dakota fared better than the national average on the ACT this year, despite the nationwide average composite score declining to the lowest it’s been in more than three decades. ACT (American College Testing) is used to gain admission into colleges and universities throughout the country, and for scholarship consideration. South Dakota’s average composite score was 21.5, compared to the nation’s average composite score of 19.8. In South Dakota, 58% of graduates took the test this year, compared to 36% of the nation’s graduates. South Dakota’s statewide average composite score of 21.5 beat those of neighboring states, too: North Dakota (19.2), Minnesota (21), Iowa (21.4), Nebraska (19.4), Wyoming (19.2) and Montana (19.3). State Education Secretary Tiffany Sanderson said South Dakota’s surpassing of the national average composite score on the ACT this year is thanks to the state’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. “That tells me South Dakota’s commitment to maintaining face-to-face instruction during the pandemic was the right one to support continued student learning,” she said in a news release from the South Dakota Department of Education. But South Dakota’s success can’t be pinned on the pandemic alone. The state has scored above the national average since at least 2009, according to DOE data.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Public housing agencies in Tennessee can no longer include provisions in their leases that bar tenants from having guns in their homes, a state appeals panel has ruled. A three-judge panel of the Tennessee Court of Appeals made the unanimous decision Thursday, saying that the prohibitions in public housing violate the 2nd Amendment rights of its residents. In the ruling, the judges cited a prominent U.S. Supreme Court decision from June that expanded gun rights, while striking down a New York law requiring people to demonstrate a particular need for carrying a gun in order to get a license to carry a gun in a concealed way in public. The Tennessee decision could set up an appeal to the state Supreme Court, which has a majority appointed by Republican governors. The case centers on a lawsuit by Kinsley Braden, who signed a lease agreement with Columbia Housing & Redevelopment Corporation in April 2018 that barred him from having a gun on the premises. In November 2020, housing officials sought to evict Braden when they found out he had been keeping a handgun in his residence at the Creekside Acres low-income housing complex. Lower court judges ruled in favor of Columbia Housing in the initial case and an appeal, then Braden sought another review, the ruling states. In the latest decision, Judge Frank Clement wrote that “a total ban on the ability of law-abiding residents – like Mr. Braden – to possess a handgun within their public housing unit for the purpose of self-defense is unconstitutional under the Second Amendment.” The ruling reasoned that public housing is not similar to other types of “sensitive” government buildings where guns can be banned, including statehouses, polling places and courthouses. Clement also acknowledged that it is “largely unsettled whether public housing developments could constitutionally prohibit firearm possession under both the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution and nearly identical provisions of certain state constitutions.” He wrote that states have come to different conclusions on whether such bans are allowed.\n\nTexas\n\nDallas: A small airplane experiencing technical problems made an emergency landing on a road in a Dallas neighborhood Saturday afternoon. Engine problems forced the plane to land on West Kiest Boulevard around 3 p.m., WFAA-TV reported. The unnamed husband and wife who were operating the airplane escaped injuries and there were no injuries on the ground, Dallas Fire-Rescue officials said. The Federal Aviation Administration said the multi-engine DA-622 landed about 2 miles from Dallas Executive Airport. The plane was en route to the airport from Winston Field in Snyder, Texas, about 250 miles west of Dallas, WFAA reported. There was no fire or leaked fuel at the landing site, but some power lines were knocked down and a speed limit sign was struck, Dallas Fire-Rescue said. Electric utility Oncor said only one customer lost service due to the contact with power lines, WFAA reported.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A man and his son, an Illinois resident, have pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Bradley Bokoski, 58, of Eagle Mountain, Utah and Matthew R. Bokoski, 31, of Chicago entered pleas on Thursday, according to documents filed with the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia, to one count each of unlawful parading, demonstrating or picketing at the Capitol. Charges of impeding Congress by illegally entering the Capitol will be dropped as part of a plea agreement in each case, according to the U.S. Justice Department. The misdemeanor charges carry a maximum sentence of six months in prison, five years’ probation and a $5,000 fine. Sentencing was set for Jan. 17. According to court documents, the Bokoskis traveled to Washington to hear President Donald Trump speak at a rally on Jan. 6, then followed the crowd to the Capitol, which they entered through a breached Senate door. After the crowd was met by 10 to 15 police officers, both men turned around and left, the complaint said. They were in the building for about five minutes. A tip to the FBI provide screenshots of Matthew Bokoski’s Facebook page, including one post depicting a group of people inside the Capitol and a caption reading, “I was with my dad and walked right up the capital steps and inside with others,” the complaint said. The riot delayed the certification of Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential election, but Congress reconvened hours later to do so. Both men were arrested in May.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The school board in Vermont’s largest city plans to sue the manufacturer of chemicals that forced the closure of Burlington High School, officials said. Burlington School District officials on Thursday announced plans to sue agro-chemical giant Monsanto after PCBs were found in the existing building and soil during renovations, forcing the closure of the school, which also housed the Burlington Technical Center. In a statement, Bayer, which now owns Monsanto, said Monsanto “voluntarily stopped producing PCBs 45 years ago and its conduct has been appropriate at all times.” “Until the company terminated their production, PCBs were lawfully used in a number of commercial products that were manufactured by other companies,” the statement said. “We will assess and respond to a complaint if one is filed.” School officials now are planning to demolish the existing building and build a new school and technical center in the same area. Burlington voters will cast ballots next month on a proposed $165 million bond, but the city estimates the total cost of the improvements could be $190 million. Burlington Board Chair Clare Wool said the lawsuit could mean long-term financial compensation for the district, but to move forward with the plans for the new school they still need to have the bond approved. “Even though we plan to pursue this course of environmental lawsuit zealously and aggressively, we are viewing this as a long-term strategy and are anticipating that this work could consume a number of years,” Wool said in a statement. The city did not say when it planned to file its lawsuit. Students have been attending classes at a former Macy’s department store.\n\nVirginia\n\nHarrisonburg: Eight people were taken to hospitals after a shooting early Sunday at an outdoor gathering in Virginia, police said. Someone fired into the crowd at an outdoor gathering on Devon Lane in Harrisonburg, city police said in a statement. Eight people ranging in age from 18 to 27 were taken to hospitals with injuries that were not considered life-threatening, police said. No suspects were on the scene when officers arrived and investigators are looking into how many people fired shots, police said. No arrests have been made. The incident was isolated to the gathering and police said they don’t believe there’s any threat to the greater community. The housing complex where the shooting occured is near James Madison University, but city spokesperson Michael Parks said no students were injured, WTOP-FM reported.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: While celebrating 50 years as a ballet company, the Pacific Northwest Ballet is making history. “This is a moment for us,” dancer Jonathan Batista told KUOW while describing how he felt about becoming the first Black principal dancer in the history of the Pacific Northwest Ballet. The newly promoted Batista joined the organization as a soloist last year and says moving to the highest rank as a ballet dancer last month means the world to him and the Black dance community. “Being the first Black dancer in 50 years of Pacific Northwest Ballet, this is a moment for young Black boys, young Black girls, that want to dance, that want to see themselves on that stage,” Batista said. Originally from Rio De Janeiro, Brazil, Batista has performed with companies from the UK to Canada, sometimes as the only Black member of the company. Batista says he’s grateful to make history through his promotion to principal dancer in Seattle. “It is such an honor to be in this position,” he said. “It also is a moment where I think, ‘Wow, it took 50 years for Black man, for Black person, to become a principal dancer.’ ” The Pacific Northwest Ballet has a total of 46 dancers in its company. Batista is one of nine who identify as Black. In addition, Cecilia Iliesiu and James Kirby Rogers were also promoted to principal dancers.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: The state of is receiving around $1.7 million in federal funding over five years for a behavioral health program treating adults with serious mental illness. The money will be used to serve people living with mental illness who are also living with a physical health condition, chronic disease or substance use disorder, according to a West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources news release. The initiative is called “West Virginia Promoting Integration of Primary and Behavioral Health Care Program.” Participants in 16 counties will receive services from Seneca Health Services Inc., Southern Highlands Community Behavioral Health Center and United Summit Center. Residents of Barbour, Braxton, Gilmer, Greenbrier, Harrison, Lewis, Marion, McDowell, Monongalia, Nicholas, Pocahontas, Preston, Taylor, Upshur, Webster and Wyoming counties are eligible. The grant was awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Enrollment in the state’s public school districts is continuing to decline, while other types of schools have picked up more students, according to the state’s annual late September headcount. The picture isn’t complete, as the count excludes homeschooling and students who pay tuition in private schools. And the numbers released by the Department of Public Instruction on Friday are unaudited. According to the preliminary numbers, the decline for public school districts is less dramatic than earlier years of the pandemic but continues a downward trend that creates more budget holes for public schools. The enrollment total for public school districts fell by nearly 7,000 students to a total of about 808,000, almost a 1% drop from last year. At the same time, the number of students using state-funded vouchers to attend private school rose by over 3,000 to a total of about 52,000, a 7% gain for those programs. Independent charter schools, which are not run by school districts, gained about 460 students to total over 11,000, about a 4% gain. These trends predate the pandemic, though some trends were accelerated with the pandemic. The most extreme enrollment change that occurred during the pandemic was a 10% drop in kindergarten and pre-kindergarten enrollment in public school districts in the 2020-21 school year, when many schools had not reopened.\n\nWyoming\n\nCheyenne: Motorists have faced a range of road construction activity in the city, particularly downtown or near the central business district, the Wyoming Tribune Eagle reports. One area has had lane closures and occasionally shuttered portions of a busy street. But work on that project coordinated by the Wyoming Department of Transportation is nearing the finish line. For several months, the construction project has resulted in lane closures, mostly to the south of Lincolnway along Warren Avenue. Weather permitting, the project is on track to be finished in the coming week, according to an interview with WYDOT District 1 public information specialist Andrea Staley. According to various officials and construction workers, paving has been underway along Warren Avenue between 16th and 24th streets. “They are paving today and weather-dependent, it could go into next week, through next week,” WYDOT’s Staley told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle on Thursday. “Our contractors are going to be finishing the pavement.”\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/10/16"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/08/02/wicomico-county-lauds-accomplishments-students-teachers/880736002/", "title": "Wicomico County lauds accomplishments of students, teachers", "text": "SUBMITTED ARTICLE\n\nCongratulations to the outstanding Wicomico County students and staff members recognized at the final Awards & Recognitions Night of the 2017-2018 school year.\n\n“We’re excited to be here tonight because we are all so proud to celebrate what you have achieved,” Superintendent of Schools Donna C.

The Alabama Holocaust Commission is sponsoring an annual gathering of remembrance Tuesday at the Alabama Department of Archives and History in the capital. A child survivor of the Holocaust, Inge Auerbacher, is scheduled to speak, and a state proclamation will be presented. A commemoration will also be held Thursday at Temple Beth-El in Birmingham. The program will feature George Nathan, the son of Alabama Holocaust survivors Henry and Sophie Nathan. The family lived in both Anniston and Birmingham after arriving in the United States. About 6 million people were killed by the Nazis in the early 1940s during World War II. The state Holocaust commission holds events each year to remember the victims.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: Legislators are considering a request by Gov. Mike Dunleavy’s administration that the state take over part of a federal environmental permitting program, though some members of the state Senate’s budget-writing committee have expressed concerns with the potential costs. Administration officials have said the idea behind the proposal is to speed the construction of roads, bridges, mines and drilling projects, the Anchorage Daily News reports. While the state would have to follow federal standards, critics of the proposal say the state has traditionally favored development and underfunded oversight capabilities. Industry groups say the current permitting process is too slow. The House included a $4.9 million increase to the budget of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, which expects to hire 28 new staff members. The funding was part of the House version of the state operating budget, which passed earlier this month; senators currently are working on their version. If the proposed increase is approved, department officials plan a two-year process to take over part of the federal Clean Water Act known as Section 404. Permits issued under that section determine whether a developer can fill wetlands, rivers or other bodies of water during construction.\n\nArizona\n\nPhoenix: Aviation history wasn’t made Sunday night, but disaster was avoided, as cousins Luke Aikins and Andy Farrington were unsuccessful in completing the first-ever “plane swap.” One plane spiraled out of control as the two pilots were thousands of feet in the air. Both pilots were safe with no reported injuries. The Red Bull-sponsored flight, which took place at an undisclosed location in Arizona, began as the two pilots ascended to the skies about 5:45 p.m. local time. Nearly an hour later, the two jumped out at 12,100 feet in the air with the airbrake system engaged on both planes. Aikins was able to successfully get into the other plane, but Farrington was unable to do the same. The plane spiraled out of control as Farrington could be heard saying on-air: “Blue plane is out of control.” Farrington then deployed his parachute and safely landed in a remote area. The uncontrolled plane had a parachute on it that automatically activated when it got to a certain altitude, and it was deployed before touching the ground. The condition and location of the plane weren’t immediately known. The 6-mile-per-hour winds created good conditions for the stunt, the pilots said leading up to the stunt, as the area had faster winds in the days leading up to the event. But Farrington was unsure what happened.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson on Friday said he was refusing most of $146 million in federal pandemic rental assistance the state was to receive, citing the state’s low unemployment rate and economic climate. With Hutchinson’s decision, Arkansas joins Nebraska in turning down the latest round of pandemic rental assistance funds. Hutchinson, a Republican, asked U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that the state be allowed to use 39% of the funds — about $60 million — for “housing stability” programs offered by nonprofit groups that would include job training, education and treatment as well as some rental assistance. Arkansas still has about $20 million from the first round of rental assistance that was given to states. “Our economy has returned, there’s jobs aplenty out there and we have existing programs in place for rental assistance that were pre-pandemic,” Hutchinson told reporters at a news conference at the Capitol.\n\nCalifornia\n\nLos Angeles: Nearly 2,000 homeless people died in Los Angeles County during the first year of the pandemic, an increase of 56% from the previous year, driven mainly by drug overdoses, authorities said. The findings released Friday in a report from the county’s Department of Public Health showed that despite initial fears, the coronavirus itself was not the main culprit in deaths among California’s largest-in-the-nation unhoused population. But it did cut people off from mental health and substance abuse treatment after services were drastically reduced to prevent the spread of the virus. Between April 1, 2020, and March 31, 2021, the county recorded 1,988 deaths of homeless people, up from 1,271 deaths during the same period a year earlier, the report said. During both of those years, drug overdoses were the leading cause of death, but they increased by 78% in the pandemic’s first year. In the pre-pandemic year, the Department of Public Health reported 402 fatal overdoses. In the year after the outbreak, the number nearly doubled to 715, the report said. The report found that 179 homeless people died from COVID-19 during the pandemic’s first year. A San Francisco study released last month showed similar findings: Between March 2020 and March 2021, there were 331 homeless deaths recorded in San Francisco, more than twice the number of any previous year, with the leading cause of death being drug overdose, according to a study conducted by the University of California San Francisco and the city’s Department of Public Health.\n\nColorado\n\nFort Collins: Heading into what experts speculate may be one of the worst summers of wildfire the state has seen, Gov. Jared Polis and state fire officials are preparing for the future. “We are vastly improving our year-round fire response, expanding our arsenal of world-class firefighting tools and continuing to activate every tool we have to help our communities prepare for and respond to the threat of wildfires and climate change,” Polis said in a press release Friday. In the past two years, Colorado has experienced the three largest wildfires in state history – the Cameron Peak Fire, the East Troublesome Fire and the Pine Gulch Fire – and just five months ago it saw the most destructive fire in state history, the Marshall Fire. Just last week brought wildfires in Monte Vista, near Longmont; between Gypsum and Dotsero, in Custer County; and northeast of Las Animas, according to state officials. “Colorado could very well be headed towards the worst wildfire season in the state’s history. We need to take action,” state Senate President Steve Fenberg said. He is supporting legislation that would invest $15 million in first responders and communities to improve the state’s emergency dispatch system and add a second air tanker and two high-quality helicopters. The bill would also create the Office of Climate Preparedness.\n\nConnecticut\n\nNew London: The recent appearance of two cruise ships in the city has raised hopes that Connecticut might stand to benefit from the return of an industry decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The two ships, part of American Queen Voyages, were on a tour of the East Coast and Canada and were the first cruise ships to stop in New London in four years. Both are scheduled to stop in New London on the way back south in the fall. The ships each brought about 90 passengers and 75 crew members and were met with gift bags, discounts in local restaurants and a driving tour of the city. Connecticut also has deep-water ports in New Haven and Bridgeport that can handle large ships, but the state often isn’t seen as a cruise destination. “It’s encouraging that with the industry just really trying to make a comeback, they picked New London,” Mayor Michael Passero told the New Haven Register. Connecticut ports could benefit from Canada’s reopening its own ports to cruises after two years, as well as from industry trends toward more domestic routes and smaller ships that cater to an older clientele, said Chris Gray Faust, managing editor of consumer review site Cruise Critic. “There has been a pivot toward more domestic cruises,” Gray Faust told the newspaper. “Some of these ports are ones that you don’t think of as cruise ports, necessarily.”\n\nDelaware\n\nNew Castle: The Wall That Heals, a traveling replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, is returning to the First State on Tuesday. The Vietnam War memorial will be escorted by Delaware State Police and veterans on motorcycles to New Castle, where it will be met by students and volunteers at Southern Elementary School about 1:45 p.m. Tuesday and at William Penn High school about 2:30 p.m. The Wall That Heals is a mobile exhibit that features a three-quarter scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. The replica, built in 1996, stands 7 feet 6 inches high at its tallest point and 375 feet long. Similar to the original, it is erected in a chevron shape and allows visitors to do name rubbings of individual service members’ names. Visitors can also experience the Wall rising above them as they walk toward the apex, a key feature of the Washington memorial. After arrival at William Penn High School – the first school in the nation to host the wall – the setup will begin Wednesday. The Wall will be open to the public 24 hours a day, starting Friday and ending Sunday at 2 p.m. More than 100 volunteers are needed to guard the wall, help with parking and assist with events in the coming days. An opening ceremony begins at 9 a.m. Thursday with a Prisoner of War keynote speaker. A candlelight vigil will be held at 8 p.m. Saturday to read the names of Hometown Heroes from the exhibit with a procession along the wall and a 21-gun salute.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Jon Stewart, accepting the Kennedy Center’s Mark Twain Prize for American Humor, warned Sunday night that speculation about the future of comedy amid increased audience cultural sensitivity was ignoring a true and enduring threat: authoritarian governments around the world. “Comedy doesn’t change the world, but it’s a bellwether,” Stewart said. “When a society feels under threat, comedians are who gets sent away first.” Stewart pointed in the audience to Egyptian comedian Bassem Youssef, whose Stewart-inspired political comedy show earned him both fame and self-imposed exile. Youssef’s story is “an example of the true threat to comedy,” Stewart said. The intersection of comedy and politics was the main theme as celebrities and comedy royalty gathered to honor Stewart, who set the modern template for mixing the topics during his 16-year run hosting TV’s “The Daily Show.” Stewart, the 23rd recipient of the prize, was honored in testimonials from fellow comedians and previous Mark Twain Prize recipients. And his political influence was apparent Sunday from a guest list that included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and White House press secretary Jen Psaki. This was the first Mark Twain ceremony since Dave Chappelle’s in 2019. The COVID-19 pandemic scuttled the event in 2020 and 2021.\n\nFlorida\n\nFort Lauderdale: The judge overseeing jury selection for a man who murdered 17 people at a high school declared Monday that the process will start over, conceding she should have questioned 11 potential jurors who said they would not follow the law before she dismissed them. In granting the motion filed by Nikolas Cruz’s prosecutors over the strong objection of his attorneys, Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer nullified two weeks of work by prosecution and defense lawyers, forcing them to begin the entire process anew Monday. As a result, almost 250 potential jurors who had said they could sit for a four-month trial will not be called back next month for further questioning. More than 1,200 candidates had been screened. Prosecutor Carolyn McCann made her argument after miscommunication caused 11 jurors who were improperly dismissed by Scherer two weeks ago not to be told to return to court Monday as had been planned for further questioning. Scherer said they would be brought in next week, but McCann argued that more time would be wasted if it turned out the potential jurors had to be struck anyway. She said the prosecution has just as much right to question potential jurors and to an untainted final panel as the defense. “This is not harmless error,” McCann said.\n\nGeorgia\n\nSavannah: Officials have put the brakes on the city’s largest road race. The Rock ’n’ Roll Marathon has brought tens of thousands of runners to Georgia’s picturesque founding city since first adding Savannah to its race roster in 2011. But Mayor Van Johnson said the city won’t be granting marathon organizers a permit or paying the $25,000 contract fee this year. Organizers released a statement saying a comeback in 2023 appears unlikely. They had intended to return to Savannah this fall, and runners had been registering for the race before City Hall announced its decision. Johnson told news outlets Savannah needs a break from the marathon to evaluate whether it’s worth the cost – not just in taxpayer money for sanitation and extra police but also in hassles to residents and businesses affected by street closures. He said the city has recouped “a relatively very small percentage” of what it has spent on the event. Visit Savannah, the city’s tourism bureau, reported the 2019 marathon had an economic impact of $23 million. Michael Owens, president of Savannah’s Tourism Leadership Council, said the race gave the city’s hospitality industry a needed shot in the arm during what’s otherwise a slow period for tourists right before the holidays. “To be honest with you, it’s devastating,” Owens told WTOC-TV. “I’ve gotten more phone calls about this than anything. I’ve gotten more calls about the cancellation of Rock ’n’ Roll than I did in the beginning of the pandemic.”\n\nHawaii\n\nWahiawa: The only skilled nursing and rehabilitation facility in central Oahu expects to close this summer. Wahiawa General Hospital said it plans to close its long-term nursing center July 22, citing insufficient insurance reimbursements and continued financial challenges, Hawaii News Now reports. It’s also been struggling to hire and retain staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Wahiawa General, a small independent hospital, had received millions in taxpayers dollars to keep it afloat in the past, but it is still losing over a million dollars a year. It also doesn’t have the money to improve existing facilities, such as the long-term nursing center, which was built in 1966. Hospital administrators said many of the patients in Wahiawa are covered by the Supplemental Security Income program or Medicaid, which have low reimbursement rates. The long-term care center has 115 beds, according to its website. It currently has 60 patients. John McDermott, the state’s long-term care ombudsman, said Hawaii can’t afford to lose nursing homes, especially when the state’s senior population is increasing so rapidly. The nearest alternatives for skilled nursing and rehabilitation are in Kaneohe and Pearl City. Wahiawa General is giving 90 days’ notice and helping to relocate patients.\n\nIdaho\n\nLewiston: Jurors convicted a 17-year-old boy of first-degree murder after about three hours of deliberation Thursday. Demetri Ewing and his father Clyde Ewing were both charged with first-degree murder in connection with the Jan. 8, 2021, shooting death of Samuel Johns, The Lewiston Tribune reports. Clyde Ewing has pleaded not guilty, and his trial is scheduled to begin May 16. Ewing, who was 16 at the time of the shooting, was charged as an adult and could face up to life in prison when he is sentenced in June. During Demetri Ewing’s nearly two-week trial, Nez Perce County prosecutors said the father and son were in the midst of a family dispute over a missing gun and an Army bag that had belonged to Clyde Ewing’s late father. Prosecutors said the pair believed the bag had been left at Johns’ home, so they left their motel in Clarkston, Washington, and rode bicycles to Johns’ residence in the neighboring town of Lewiston, Idaho. Nez Perce County Prosecutor Justin Coleman said the Ewings used zipper-style cable ties to bind the hands of a woman in the home, and that one of them shot and killed Johns. Under Idaho law, prosecutors are not required to prove which defendant killed someone, only that a person was killed in the process of another planned felony like a burglary.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: A man seen on video wheeling a bulky suitcase out of a woman’s apartment has been acquitted of murder. Cook County Judge Diana Kenworthy noted a lack of evidence against Jimmy Jackson, 75, and said the video was not enough to convict him. Daisy Hayes, 65, disappeared in 2018. Family members were stunned by the verdict Friday. “All I could do is scream and just run out the courtroom – like, what didn’t you see?” daughter Teresa Smith said of the video. Jackson, 75, and Hayes, 65, had an intermittent relationship. “You see him struggling with this suitcase. You see him actually put the suitcase in the dumpster. You actually see him take garbage from other dumpsters to put on top of her so it can be concealed,” Smith said. Jackson was arrested in Tennessee after Daisy disappeared.\n\nIndiana\n\nIndianapolis: Local native and 12-time Grammy-winning singer and producer Babyface will headline the Madam Walker Legacy Center on June 17 as part of a weekend­long Juneteenth celebration at the historic theater. Tours of the newly remodeled center, a family-friendly outdoor block party and other musical performances will be spread throughout Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Babyface, whose given name is Kenneth Edmonds, will also be inducted into the Madam Walker Legacy Center Walk of Fame. His credits include some 250 top-10 R&B and pop hits, working with the likes of Beyoncé, Aretha Franklin and Whitney Houston. He last performed in Indianapolis on the free stage of the Indiana State Fair in August.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: The local school district plans to hold a series of discussions to address school violence following a shooting outside East High School last month. The five public meetings will give the school community a chance to talk about concerns related to violence in schools and communities and how to begin healing from the shooting death of Jose Lopez-Perez, 15. While Des Moines Public Schools is hosting the events, outside community groups will guide the conversations. Lopez-Perez was shot and killed outside the school March 7. Also injured were East High School students Kemery Ortega, 18, and Jessica Lopez, 16. Ten teenagers have been charged with Lopez-Perez’s death and the shooting. The meetings’ topics will be guided using information gleaned from earlier conversations with student following the shooting. East High School students focused their discussion on student health and well-being, school climate, culture, and safety, said Madeline Cano, the East community school coordinator. Students also said they wanted to see the school “bounce back from COVID.” The community school coordinators help support students and families within Des Moines schools and the community.\n\nKansas\n\nKansas City: A Wyandotte County judge struck down a GOP-authored congressional map enacted earlier this year and ordered the Legislature to take steps to address what he considered to be gerrymandered district lines. It is the first time a state-level judge has waded into redistricting for the U.S. House, though the ruling is all but certain to be appealed, setting up a showdown at the Kansas Supreme Court. Wyandotte County District Court Judge Bill Klapper called the maps passed over the veto of Gov. Laura Kelly earlier this year “motivated at least in part by an intent to dilute minority voting strength” and said state courts had the right to take up redistricting cases. Three lawsuits were filed challenging the map, arguing the new district lines illicitly divide the Kansas City area and improperly place Lawrence in the sweeping 1st Congressional District dominated by western Kansas. Supporters say the decision to divide Wyandotte and Johnson counties, as well as splitting Kansas City between the 3rd and 2nd districts, was born out of simple math, with population growing in the region. But critics argue the endeavor amounted to nothing more than racial and political gerrymandering, something cited by Klapper in his 200-plus-page opinion that quoted everything from the French philosopher Montesquieu to folk music.\n\nKentucky\n\nLouisville: An arson unit is investigating after a fire destroyed a synagogue and worship center on the final day of Passover. Rabbi Avrohom Litvin, regional director of Chabad of Kentucky, said the blaze started as a grease fire in a building adjoining Louisville’s Chabad House early Saturday, WDRB-TV reports. Firefighters brought it under control, but it apparently rekindled around noon, and the Chabad House caught fire. Litvin said the Chabad House was quickly engulfed in flames, and the roof collapsed. No one was injured, but the sanctuary and nearly everything in it was destroyed, Litvin said. Only the Torah scrolls were rescued, having been removed that morning for an off-site remembrance service due to electricity being cut off at the synagogue. Litvin said it was a “miracle” the 75 congregants – including 25 children – were not in the synagogue at the time of the larger fire and in harm’s way. “There’s a story of a man who was on his way to a big vacation, and he breaks his leg, and he feels so bad that God let his leg be broken just before his vacation,” he said. “And then he reads that the plane went down, and he says, ‘God saved my life by breaking my leg.’ “So I absolutely see the hand of God here. ... Yes, this leg got broken; the core of the building is gone. But we can rebuild the building.” Litvin said officials told him they have not uncovered any evidence of arson, though their investigation is ongoing, including determining if the second fire was a reignition of the first.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: A small, historically Black university known for its success in getting graduates into medical school announced Thursday that it is now planning its own medical school. The coronavirus pandemic emphasized the need for greater diversity in medicine because representation and trust are part of the reasons for health disparities affecting underrepresented populations, said Reynold Verret, president of Xavier University of Louisiana. “Xavier was founded with the mission of promoting the creation of a just and humane society through education,” he said in a news release announcing plans for a medical school and graduate school of health sciences in New Orleans. “The establishment of graduate education programs dedicated to the preparation of more black healthcare professionals is a natural extension of our foundress’ legacy as we approach our second century of service. It is also where we are called to answer a critical need of our nation.” For decades, the Catholic school founded in 1925 has graduated more African American students and students of color who go on to get medical degrees and health doctorates than any other higher education institution in the U.S., the news release said.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills asked tribal chiefs and legislative leaders in a letter made public Monday to drop their effort to amend a 1980 land settlement deal that gave the state of Maine some governmental power over tribes. Mills said the proposal to expand tribal sovereignty could be a setback in tribal relations with her administration, instead of building on recent successes. “I do not wish to have a confrontation,” she wrote in the letter. “It would serve no constructive purpose and only inflame emotions on all sides of the discussion.” The letter was written Thursday night, the day before the bill failed to advance in the appropriations committee. Maggie Dana, chief of the Passamaquoddy Tribe at Pleasant Point, said previously she hoped the governor would be “on the right side of history” and agree to the long-sought changes. For the tribes, it has been a long, frustrating battle since they traded some rights to the state under the $81.5 million Maine Indian Land Claims Settlement Act of 1980, signed by President Jimmy Carter. Because of the settlement, tribes in Maine have less autonomy than tribes elsewhere across the country, and their reservations are treated like municipalities, subject to state law. Critics of extending tribal sovereignty feared there could be unintended consequences and further litigation if that changed.\n\nMaryland\n\nSalisbury: A potentially lucrative revenue stream for struggling commercial fishermen and women could become a reality as the state begins to research a shrimp fishery in Maryland’s warming waters. The bill, introduced by state Sen. Mary Beth Carozza, R-Worcester, would allow the Maryland Department of Natural Resources to establish a shrimp fishery pilot program for certain commercial licenses. “As a lifelong commercial fisherman, I have seen changes to our environment, our fisheries and our livelihood,” said Sonny Gwin, a fisherman based in Ocean City. “An abundant amount of shrimp has been seen in Maryland waters, both in the Atlantic Ocean and its tributaries. We would like to have the opportunity to participate.” Gwin said the first step in diversifying the industry on the Delmarva Peninsula is understanding the impact it could have. Warming waters in the Atlantic Ocean are among the reasons much of the seafood caught off Maryland’s coast is becoming more diverse. White shrimp, which typically thrive in the Gulf of Mexico and south Atlantic Ocean, used to only venture as far north as North Carolina in any significant numbers. But as water temperatures rise off the coast of Maryland, shrimp have moved farther north.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nNantucket: Scientists at MIT are proposing releasing hordes of genetically altered mice on the posh vacation destination of Nantucket to combat the growing scourge of Lyme disease. Researchers with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab’s Mice Against Ticks project explained their plan to residents of the island off Cape Cod at a recent meeting, The Boston Globe reports. The scientists said hundreds of thousands of native white-footed mice engineered to resist the bacteria that causes Lyme could help slow disease transmission. They say if Lyme were less prevalent among mice, then fewer ticks would contract the disease, leading to less cases among humans. The proposal would require review from regulators, not to mention local support, but Joanna Buchthal, the project’s research director, argues the idea offers a “real, if revolutionary, way” to address the disease. “With so many people suffering from Lyme every single day, which is an awful disease, we need a solution urgently,” she told the newspaper. Nantucket is one of Massachusetts’ hot spots for Lyme disease, which is now the most common infectious disease on the island, the Globe reports. Incidents of Lyme disease have nearly doubled nationwide since 1991, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nMichigan\n\nTaylor: A person taking part in a suburban Detroit police training program suffered a gunshot wound and was hospitalized, Michigan State Police said. The shooting happened Sunday afternoon during the exercise at a Taylor city park for the city’s volunteer auxiliary police program. The civilian was a “role player” in a training scenario when an auxiliary officer in the training fired a shot from his service revolver, hitting the person in the abdomen, state police said. The person was taken to a hospital in stable condition. State police investigators were reviewing the shooting at the request of Taylor police. The volunteers with Taylor’s auxiliary police assist the city police force during emergencies and help with other duties such as home and business checks and anti-crime programs, according to the city website.\n\nMinnesota\n\nCrookston: Volunteers and National Guard members in northwestern Minnesota spent two days sandbagging to fortify the city from an expected record flood along the Red Lake River. Gov. Tim Walz authorized 100 members of the Guard to assist with the flood fight after heavy rains forced the the tributary of the Red River to spill its banks. At least 50 Guard members were on hand over the weekend to aid efforts through Sunday. The National Weather Service has been predicting the Red Lake River to near 29 feet Monday or Tuesday. The record high water mark was 28.4 feet in 1997. No injuries or damages have been reported, and the city has not asked anyone to evacuate, Crookston Police Chief Darin Selzler said. Officials were switching from a sandbagging to monitoring stage late Sunday, the Crookston Times reports. Several counties in the northwestern Minnesota region have declared local emergencies and activated their emergency plans, according to Walz’s office. Many county roads were covered with water or washed out, and officials warned motorists about attempting to drive through flooded areas. The Red Lake River flows into the Red River at East Grand Forks and Grand Forks, North Dakota, where officials from both cities have started to activate permanent flood protection measures.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The state is enacting a new law that says state and local government agencies cannot withhold services or refuse jobs to people who choose not to get vaccinated against COVID-19. The ban applies to state agencies, city and county governments and schools, community colleges and universities. COVID-19 vaccination mandates have not been widespread in Mississippi, but some lawmakers said they were acting against the possibility of government overreach. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday that he had signed House Bill 1509, and it became law immediately. “Government shouldn’t be in the business of forcing Americans to choose between the COVID-19 vaccine & putting food on their tables, sending their kids to school, or visiting a small business,” Reeves said on Twitter. The law specifies that COVID-19 vaccinations cannot be required for children to attend school or day care. It does not change Mississippi’s other childhood vaccination requirements, which are some of most stringent in the nation. The law also says anyone in Mississippi can cite “a sincerely held religious objection” to avoid a public or private employer’s COVID-19 vaccination mandate.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: A bill approved by the state Senate would impose limits on Missouri’s public records law to exclude certain types of documents and communications and no longer classify some meetings of elected officials as “public.” Senate Bill 741 was initially designed to limit personal information of constituents from being public in records requested by members of the public but was amended Thursday by Sen. Andrew Koenig, R-St. Louis, to include a litany of other adjustments to the Missouri Sunshine Law. The law allows for members of the public, press and other organizations to request and acquire government documents. Under the bill, documents and communications “that do not have substantial administrative or operational value” would not be considered public records and could thus be made unobtainable through a request. “A lot of times when you’re working on a bill, you’re going to go through many drafts, and you want to be able to think out loud with your staff a little bit, and it might not even be a good idea,” Koenig said. “When it’s not a working document, I think it’s appropriate for that to not necessarily be public.” The legislation allows the state to close any document kept by lawmakers and staff “that contains information regarding proposed legislation or the legislative process.”\n\nMontana\n\nHelena: A judge has temporarily blocked enforcement of a state law that required transgender people to have undergone a “surgical procedure” before being allowed to change the sex listed on their birth certificates. District Judge Michael Moses of Billings ruled Thursday that the law is unconstitutionally vague because it does not specify what surgical procedure must be performed. The law also required transgender people to obtain a court order indicating they’d had a surgical procedure. Because he could grant the temporary injunction based on the vagueness issue, Moses said he did not further analyze the constitutionality of the law. “We are thrilled that the court recognized the substantial and unnecessary burdens this law places upon transgender individuals in violation of their constitutional rights,” said Akilah Lane, staff attorney at the ACLU of Montana, which challenged the law. The plaintiffs – Amelia Marquez, of Billings, and a transgender man who is not identified in court records – wanted to change the sex on their birth certificates without undergoing costly surgical procedures. Both argue having a birth certificate that does not match their gender identity puts them at risk of embarrassment, discrimination, harassment or violence if they are asked to provide their birth certificate.\n\nNebraska\n\nOmaha: Google says it will invest more than $750 million in the state in 2022, including construction of a data center in Omaha. The Omaha World-Herald reports the investment also includes an expansion of Google’s existing data center in Papillion. Company leaders did not provide specific financial details for that or any of the other projects during an event with elected leaders in Papillion. The new northwest Omaha data center will be the third Google data center to open in the region. Along with the facility in Papillion, Google has one in Council Bluffs. The Nebraska projects are part of Google’s investment of about $9.5 billion in offices and data centers across the U.S. A company official said Google didn’t have any job figures for the Omaha area.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: An electric scooter sharing program years in the making has finally launched. The City Council approved an exclusive three-year franchising deal with Bird, a company that partners with cities to provide e-scooters and e-bikes. On Thursday, city officials and Bird representatives met for a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark the official start of the program, which aims to bolster “micromobility” transport options downtown and in Midtown. Bird’s e-scooter fleet will deploy in phases over the next eight weeks, with the full fleet reaching approximately 1,000 scooters, a schedule released by City Council shows. The program operates at no cost to the city, which will receive a cut of every scooter ride around town. Riders will pay $1 to start the vehicle and 39 cents a minute thereafter, with Reno receiving 25 cents per ride and $20 per scooter in registration fees, though certain riders can get a 50% discount. The Bird deal has been years in the making as the city opted for a cautious approach to reimplementing an electric vehicle sharing program after its first partner, Lime, saw its electric bikes vandalized at the rate of nine per week in 2018.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate has killed a proposed expansion of New Hampshire’s education tax credit program, arguing it would diminish the benefits for current beneficiaries. House Bill 1298 would have raised the upper income limit for the state’s tax credit scholarship program from 300% of the federal poverty level to 500%. Created in 2013, the program provides scholarships for students by allowing businesses to donate to the scholarship fund that administers the program and receive a credit on their business taxes. The scholarships may be used for private school tuition. Advocates for the bill had argued that the expansion would allow the program to boost families in the middle class. Currently, the program can benefit any family of four making up to $83,250 per year; expanding it would allow a family of four making up to $138,750 to access the funds. But a bipartisan group of state senators said the expansion would only mean more students would be competing for the same pool of funds donated by businesses. “The (Senate education) committee heard concerns about the neediest of students receiving less funding from this tax credit program as this bill would open the pool to a larger population of students,” said Sen. Denise Ricciardi, R-Bedford Republican.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nOcean City: The developers of a wind energy farm off the southern New Jersey coast said Monday they have hired two companies to connect the project to the electrical grid on land. Ocean Wind 1 has signed contracts with companies that will build electrical substations on land and run power lines from the offshore wind farm to the onshore connection points. Ocean Wind 1 – a joint venture between Orsted, the Danish wind power company, and Newark-based PSEG – hired JINGOLI Power LLC and Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company Inc. The moves come as New Jersey is working aggressively to become the East Coast hub of the fast-growing offshore wind energy industry. In February, six companies bid a combined $4.37 billion for the right to build wind energy projects on the ocean floor off New Jersey and New York in the U.S. government’s largest such auction in history. Before that happened, New Jersey’s Board of Public Utilities approved three offshore wind energy projects: two by Orsted and one by Atlantic Shores. Those three projects combined aim to provide enough electricity to power more than 1.6 million homes. The Ocean Wind 1 project is among those three and could provide enough power for 500,000 homes.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nCarlsbad: State environmental regulators are reviewing plans submitted by Mosaic Potash to investigate and define the extent of groundwater contamination from discharges associated with potash mining along the Pecos River in southern New Mexico. The state Environment Department announced earlier this month that contamination had been detected in nearby groundwater monitoring wells between the company’s Laguna Grande lake and the river. As a result, the company was required to submit a plan for monitoring and dealing with the pollution. Potash mining is a main economic driver in Eddy County. A salt rich in potassium, potash is used mostly as a plant fertilizer and in animal feed. Carlsbad was the site of potash’s first discovery in North America in 1925 during oil drilling. The discovery led to a boom in development in the former ranching town that predated the area’s prominence in fossil fuels. Mosaic’s mine, about 16 miles east of Carlsbad, produces the ore both through its underground mining and via surface operations. Waste resulting from mining the ore is moved around the facility into multiple disposal areas, potentially leeching into groundwater supplies. Extracting potash from underground generates tailings that are disposed of along with salty brine water.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Several dozen teachers and other school employees in the city who officials said submitted fraudulent proof of COVID-19 vaccination were placed on leave as of Monday. The United Federation of Teachers is challenging the disciplinary action, which it says violates its collective bargaining agreement. The employees in question were placed on leave after investigators determined they had provided false vaccine cards, a spokesperson for the city Department of Education said. “Fraudulent vaccination cards are not only illegal, they also undermine the best line of protection our schools have against COVID-19 – universal adult vaccination,” the spokesperson, Nathaniel Styer, said in a statement. “We immediately moved to put these employees – fewer than 100 – on leave without pay.” A COVID-19 vaccination mandate took effect for New York City school employees last fall and was later expanded to include all city employees. The school vaccination rule was a key component of the city’s policy of opening all classrooms to in-person learning this academic year, rather than offering a remote option as some school districts did. The UFT said in a notice of claim that about 82 members were notified last week they were being placed on unpaid leave because they’d provided false proof of vaccination.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRaleigh: Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr., the key player in an absentee ballot fraud probe that led to a do-over congressional election, has died. His daughter, Andrea Dowless Heverly, wrote that her father “passed away peacefully” Sunday morning, according to a social media post. He had been diagnosed with an advanced form of lung cancer and died at his daughter’s home in Bladen County, his friend Jay DeLancy said. Dowless was in his mid-60s. The political operative was set to go on trial this summer on more than a dozen state criminal counts related to absentee ballot activities for the 2016 general election and the 2018 primary and general elections. A half-dozen others were also charged. Witnesses told state officials that Dowless, with help of his assistants, gathered hundreds of absentee ballots from Bladen County in 2018. Those workers testified they were directed to collect blank or incomplete ballots, forge signatures on them and even fill in votes for local candidates. The 2018 general election results for the 9th Congressional District were ultimately thrown out, and a new vote for the seat was ordered by the State Board of Elections, following an inquiry. Dowless was working in the 2018 congressional race for then-Republican candidate Mark Harris. No charges were filed against Harris.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Secretary of State Al Jaeger has approved the formatting of a petition for a proposed ballot measure to legalize recreational marijuana in the state. The sponsoring committee behind the petition must obtain 15,582 valid signatures by July 11 for the measure to be placed on November’s ballot. That figure amounts to 2% of North Dakota’s population. If supporters miss that deadline but obtain the signatures by April 21, 2023, the measure could be placed on the June 2024 ballot or come to a vote if a special election occurs before then. The proposed measure seeks to allow people age 21 or older to purchase and use marijuana under certain conditions, the Bismarck Tribune reports. It also sets up the framework for the sale of marijuana within North Dakota, a process that would be implemented by the state Department of Health and Human Services or another entity as determined by the Legislature. The department could register up to seven marijuana manufacturing businesses and 18 dispensaries. Similar petition drives have failed twice in recent years to gather enough signatures to place a measure on the ballot.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: State regulation of streams that flow temporarily after rainfall will be restricted under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Mike DeWine. Construction companies, the mining industry and other business groups say removing so-called ephemeral streams from regulation would make Ohio’s practice consistent with federal law. The Ohio Environmental Protection Agency created a permitting system for development projects affecting ephemeral streams after the government removed them from federal oversight in 2020 and left their regulation up to states. The EPA says about 36,500 miles of the state’s 115,200 miles of primary headwater streams are ephemeral streams. DeWine signed the bill last week, saying it strikes a balance between protecting state waterways and providing consistency in state regulations to support economic development. Environmental groups largely opposed the legislation, saying the streams play an important role in maintaining water quality. They also questioned why Ohio would remove the streams from regulation at the same time it’s spending millions to improve water quality under DeWine’s H2Ohio initiative.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: After calling for the disestablishment of a tribal reservation in eastern Oklahoma and criticizing the lingering impacts of the U.S. Supreme Court’s McGirt decision, a candidate for the 2nd Congressional District is receiving pushback from tribal leaders. John Bennett, 47, who is stepping away from his post as chairman of Oklahoma’s Republican Party to seek a seat in Congress, said he believes the court’s ruling continues to be an issue for law enforcement and needs to be reversed. “Congress needs to go back, and they need to de-establish the Muscogee (Creek) Nation reservation. I say once they do that, then they can carry on as they have, you know, all of these years,” Bennett told the Washington Examiner last week. “So when I get to Congress, this will be one of my priorities because it hurts everyone in my district, tribal and nontribal.” The Inter-Tribal Council of the Five Tribes, which includes the Cherokee, Choctaw, Chickasaw, Seminole and Muscogee Nations, said the anti-tribal rhetoric should not be welcome in Washington. In a statement signed by each of the tribes’ leaders, the group condemned Bennett’s comments for ignoring ongoing efforts to expand criminal justice systems alongside state and federal partners. They also said the call for a McGirt reversal is an attack on tribal sovereignty.\n\nOregon\n\nClatskanie: An investigator has determined that Clatskanie High School girls basketball players in northwest Oregon “more likely than not” used racist language against members of the De La Salle team during a December game. As a result, Clastkanie has been placed on probation by the Oregon School Activities Association until mid-February 2023, The Daily News reports. The association said the high school team’s players and coaches must engage with a guest speaker about equity and inclusion before next season, among other measures, and all Clatskanie student athletes and coaches must complete racial equity training and implicit bias training. A press release from Clatskanie High School athletic director and dean of students Ryan Tompkins on Wednesday confirmed the findings of the report more than two months after it was completed. Tompkins said the high school is prepared to meet the probation requirements. De La Salle North High School President Oscar Leong said he believes the drawn-out process of the investigation has resulted in positive change for student-athletes across Oregon. Additionally, the investigation found that Clatskanie school staff and referees assigned by the Lower Columbia Officials Association failed to address concerns about racially charged language after they were brought up during the game.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nDillsburg: A school board has denied a resident’s request form an After School Satan Club at Northern Elementary School. Hundreds from the community filled the auditorium for the Northern York County School District board meeting last week and erupted into applause when the votes were taken on the issue. Only board member Thomas Welch voted in favor of the club. The evening had more than two hours of citizen comments, with the majority opposed to the adoption of the club. Many comments focused on the age of the children the club would target, the cultural and biblical issues, and the content on the Satanic Temple’s website for the program. Many of the residents spent the evening rallying the crowd and quoting Christian scripture, saying regardless of any laws that allow freedom of speech, proposing the club is morally wrong. One said the introduction of the club would contribute to a social decline in school. “So nobody benefits from having an After School Satan Club, whether it be those who are against them or those who are in favor of them, because Satan always does harm all the time. That, philosophically, has been proven,” a resident asserted. There were some voices in support, saying that they understood the concerns but that the formation of the club was a constitutional right.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The U.S. Supreme Court will not take up a conservative advocacy group’s challenge to the state’s campaign finance laws. The Gaspee Project and national conservative legal groups appealed to the high court after two lower federal courts ruled against their 2019 lawsuit arguing Rhode Island’s campaign finance disclosure laws are unconstitutional. The Supreme Court denied Gaspee’s appeal petition Monday, according to Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and the Campaign Legal Center, which defended the state’s campaign finance laws in the case. “To reduce political corruption, we need real transparency about who is spending big money in elections and to that end, voters in Rhode Island have a right to know who is attempting to influence their votes,” Campaign Legal Center Senior Vice President Paul Smith said in a news release. “This denial of review from the Supreme Court of the United States means that vital right will remain in place and continue to enable Rhode Islanders to be well-informed before heading into the voting booth.” The 2019 lawsuit from Gaspee and the Illinois Opportunity Project sought to strike down Rhode Island’s disclosure laws around “independent expenditures,” spending to influence an election that is not coordinated with any campaign.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nYork: A county is suing two cities inside its border, saying they are refusing to keep up with a deal to pay $73 per day to house jail inmates from the cities. York County said it will continue to take inmates from Rock Hill and Tega Cay until the court rules, The Herald of Rock Hill reports. Rock Hill officials said they don’t mind paying a fair fee, but York County has failed to give a detailed assessment of how it came up with a $73-a-day cost per inmate. The county originally wanted to charge $100 but lowered the assessment after Rock Hill asked for details, the city said in a statement. Documents obtained by the newspaper showed the cities were paying about $43 a day per inmate before the fees were increased. York County said other cities in the county like Fort Mill, Clover and the city of York have signed an agreement to pay the $73 fee. York County is asking a judge to decide if the county, which is legally required to have a jail, has to take inmates from cities without a written agreement on fees. Rock Hill officials said their residents and businesses pay York County $7.9 million in property taxes that help run the jail and the sheriff’s office.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Despite an annual $15 million given to the Bridge Improvement Grant program and other additional funding focused on bridges, the state continues to tread water when it comes to how quickly work is done, leaving hundreds of bridges requiring “high priority” corrective repairs and dozens closed. An analysis of data through the Federal Highway Administration’s National Bridge Inspection program focused on the vast amount of data that FHA collects on the nation’s bridges, looking at data from 2015 and the most recent data from 2021. To some, the bridge program, as well as other aspects of the 2015 transportation package, haven’t panned out the way they were supposed to. “I know I’m sounding a little bit negative about it, but I feel like we got duped a little bit,” Brown County Highway Superintendent Dirk Rogers said. The BIG program was created as a collaboration between the state and local governments. To be eligible to participate, counties had to enact local wheel taxes on vehicles so they had a source of local funds in the program. Since 2015, 37 counties have added a wheel tax, according to the South Dakota Department of Revenue, and only six counties in the state don’t have a wheel tax.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: The state will soon add harsh penalties against public schools that allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ sports, under legislation signed into law by Republican Gov. Bill Lee. Lee quietly signed the proposal last Friday without comment. The governor had previously signed a measure last year mandating that student-athletes must prove their sex matches that listed on the student’s “original” birth certificate. If a birth certificate is unavailable, then the parents must provide another form of evidence “indicating the student’s sex at the time of birth.” This year, the GOP-controlled Legislature decided to add penalties to that ban, which is in effect even as a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality makes it way through court. A trial has been tentatively set for March 2023. According to the bill, Tennessee’s Department of Education would withhold a portion of state funds from local school districts that fail to determine a student’s gender for participation in middle or high school sports. The measure does not specify exactly how much money should be withheld by the state. The bill will go into effect July 1. “Telling transgender students that they can’t participate as who they really are amounts to excluding them from sports entirely – depriving them of opportunities available to their peers and sending the message that they are not worthy of a full life,” Henry Seaton, ACLU of Tennessee’s transgender justice advocate, said in a statement.\n\nTexas\n\nEagle Pass: Search crews on Monday recovered the body of a Texas National Guard member who went missing after jumping in the river on the U.S.-Mexico border to help a migrant who was struggling to swim across. The body of Spc. Bishop Evans was found three days after he was reported missing in the Rio Grande near the border city of Eagle Pass. The local sheriff has said Evans jumped into the river without his jacket or radio to help a woman who appeared in distress while trying to swim over from Mexico. “Our National Guard soldiers risk their lives every day to serve and protect others and we are eternally grateful for the way SPC Evans heroically served his state and country,” Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement Monday. The body was found near the boat ramp of a bridge in Eagle Pass, said Democratic state Sen. Roland Gutierrez, whose district includes Eagle Pass. Migrant rescues are common in the river along the Texas border, and the attempted crossings are also sometimes deadly. Maverick County Sheriff Tom Schmerber said the bodies of as many as two migrants a week are sometimes found along his county’s section of the river. Evans was assigned to Abbott’s sprawling border mission known as Operation Lone Star. Gutierrez said Evans is at least the fifth Guard member known to have died during the mission that began last year. He called for an inquest into their deaths.\n\nUtah\n\nCedar City: Four people were killed when a single-engine airplane on a sightseeing tour crashed minutes after takeoff in rural southwestern Utah, authorities said Sunday. Deputies discovered the aircraft after responding to a report of a fire just before 7 p.m. Saturday about 5 miles east of Cedar City, the Iron County Sheriff’s Office said. Pronounced dead at the scene were pilot Steven Eatchel and his wife, Lindsay Eatchel, of Springville, Utah; Thomas Eatchel, of Heber City, Utah; and Danielle Deagostini, of Sandy City, the sheriff’s office said. The National Transportation Safety Board identified the aircraft as a Diamond DA-40 and said it was investigating the crash. No cause was immediately identified. The plane earlier in the day flew from Spanish Fork to Cedar City, where it had a layover of about 21/ 2 hours at the regional airport before taking off and heading east toward some mountains for a sightseeing tour of Zion National Park, the sheriff’s office said. Radar communication with the aircraft was lost about four minutes after it took off. The position of the downed aircraft and damage to foliage at the crash site suggested it was headed west when it crashed, the sheriff’s office said.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: The share of Vermonters living with a disability is growing quickly, yet nobody is sure just how many people fall under this category – an uncertainty that may affect how the state allocates money for support. Vermont’s population of people who have at least one disability rose nearly 10% between 2011 and 2020 to over 14% of people in the state, according to a study by Avacare Medical Blog, which analyzed 2021 U.S. Census Bureau data. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says about 1 in 5 adults in Vermont has at least one disability. Even higher is the figure from the Vermont Department of Health, which says 24% of Vermont adults had at least one disability as of 2019. How people are polled and how disability is defined can make it difficult to understand the true number of those living with a disability in Vermont, said Sarah Launderville, executive director of the Vermont Center for Independent Living. “I think that there’s a bunch of people who might not think that they fit into that category of disability because of the way that we look at disability in society,” Launderville said. To be considered disabled by the Social Security Administration and receive financial support, a person’s disability cannot be “partial” or “short-term,” meaning a medical condition prevents ability to work, according to the agency website. However, not all types of disabilities prevent someone from working or living independently.\n\nVirginia\n\nFalls Church: The Arlington County Board gave unanimous approval Saturday to Amazon’s plans to build a unique, helix-shaped tower as the centerpiece of its emerging second headquarters in northern Virginia. Amazon announced the plans in February 2021 for the eye-catching, 350-foot tower to anchor the second phase of its redevelopment plans. The new office towers will support a second headquarters for Amazon that is expected to welcome more than 25,000 workers when complete. The helix is one of several office towers granted approval, but it stands out. The spiral design features a walkable ramp wrapping around the building with trees and greenery planted to resemble a mountain hike. Amazon has said the building is designed to help people connect to nature, and the outdoor mountain climb will be open to the public on weekends. The plans have gone through the famously thorough review process of Arlington County, including numerous public hearings. Earlier this month, the county planning commission voted 9-0 to support the project. On Saturday, the County Board voted 5-0 to approve the plans. They also include park space and will accommodate a community high school, along with ground-level retail. Amazon has said it hopes to complete the project in 2025.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympic National Park: The Olympic Peninsula has lost 45% of its glacier coverage since 1980, according to a new study by Portland State University professor Andrew Fountain and co-authors from Washington state and British Columbia. The peninsula’s remaining 250 glaciers, which covered about 2 square miles at last estimate, should be gone in another 50 years as humanity’s pollution continues to overheat the planet, the study found. Fountain told KUOW glaciers worldwide are getting a kind of double whammy, with less snow in the winter and more melt in the summer. Beyond the fascination they provide for a small community of researchers, glaciers serve as frozen reservoirs. “These glaciers provide water during the hottest, driest parts of the year,” Fountain said. Salmon and people in glacier-fed watersheds rely on nature’s ice chests to keep rivers flowing and cool each summer. Fountain said a rapid end to fossil fuel burning could delay the glacial melt-off by a few decades. “We have to encourage our lawmakers to start enacting legislation to cut greenhouse gases,” he said. “I think, for the foreseeable future, the fate(s) of the glaciers on the Olympic Peninsula are sealed.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nNorthfork: Several communities in the state’s southern coal fields celebrated the completion of a long-awaited project to bring clean water to local communities last week. The Elkhorn Water Project began in 2015 and included a new 400,000-gallon water storage tank on Elkhorn Mountain. The recently completed second phase brings county water to 112 McDowell County Service District customers in Upland, Kyle and Powhatan; 163 customers in Northfork and Algoma; and 101 in Keystone, the Bluefield Daily Telegraph reports. Many water systems in the area were installed in the early 1900s by coal companies and have been failing for years. Residents of Keystone, for example, were under a boil-water notice for more than a decade. U.S. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., met with local and state officials Thursday to celebrate the completion of the second phase. Capito said clean drinking water is among the basic infrastructure rights, which also include good roads and broadband access.\n\nWisconsin\n\nWaukesha: Five months after an SUV plowed through the crowd and killed six people at a Christmas parade, the city continues to have the tragedy in mind in legislative decisions. Various committees have studied proposals for things such as a permanent parade memorial, safety barricades and public consideration of how to address the 2022 parade. The actions complement an effort by nonprofit organizations to collect and disperse funds to aid the hundreds of victims in the parade tragedy. Waukesha’s Christmas Parade in 2021 will forever stand for the tragedy that it was, and a special commission with the city has begun to try to figure out how to memorialize those who died. The Waukesha Parade Memorial Commission has considered creating three sites: a permanent large memorial, possibly in Grebe Park, and one or two smaller sites along the parade route on Main Street. “It’s about what we can to help avoid this anytime in the future, not just for Waukesha but for any community,” said Jerry Couri, the commission’s chairman, whose business, Couri Insurance Agency, has long been a fixture on Main Street. The commission began with the expectation of having the permanent memorial in place in 14 to 15 months. Couri said members are keeping that time frame in mind as they develop ideas.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Conservation groups are still seeking protections for a rare plant that scuttled plans for a gypsum mine in the Bighorn Basin area, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. The Center for Biological Diversity has joined with two smaller groups in announcing plans to file a lawsuit against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service if federal officials don’t finish a status review on the thick-leaf bladderpod by mid-June, saying the agency is violating its own deadlines, according to the newspaper.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2022/04/26"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2019/10/28/superstorm-art-key-west-fantasy-fest-pine-cone-plan-news-around-states/40450385/", "title": "Superstorm art, Key West Fantasy Fest: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nBirmingham: Work is beginning on a business park that promoters say could mean about 1,200 jobs east of downtown. Officials held a groundbreaking Thursday for Grand River Technology Park, which will be located off Interstate 20 beside Barber Motorsports Park near Leeds. The project is planned as a regional site for research, development and light manufacturing. It’s also being billed for tourism, as the race track is nearby, and the Southern Museum of Flight plans to relocate there. Al.com reports the park is being funded in part by a $6 million grant from an Alabama Labor Department program to use abandoned mine sites. The park will reclaim about 105 acres of undeveloped land surrounding several old coal mining areas in eastern Jefferson County.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has extended its deadline to review numerous comments submitted for a draft environmental review of the proposed Pebble Mine in Alaska’s Bristol Bay region. Assistant Secretary of the Army R.D. James extended Thursday’s deadline to Feb. 28 to consider comments, including those from the Environmental Protection Agency, and to draft a preliminary final environmental impact statement. In a letter to the EPA, James says the Corps, the EPA and others will meet soon to resolve outstanding issues related to the proposed gold and copper mine. The new deadline reflects EPA’s 30-day request to review the draft statements and to consult with the Corps as they develop final versions.\n\nArizona\n\nScottsdale: A woman who teaches third graders from the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community is the first Native American to be named the Arizona Education Foundation’s teacher of the year. Lynette Stant teaches at Salt River Elementary, a Bureau of Indian Education school located in the community near Scottsdale. Stant’s recognition as Arizona’s top teacher was announced Thursday. A member of the Navajo Nation, she’s the first Native American to receive the recognition in the award’s 37-year history. The teacher says she attended a small reservation school in New Mexico during her primary years. Stant has been teaching at the Salt River school for 16 years. It has 19 teachers and about 330 students.\n\nArkansas\n\nYellville: Officials say a hunter died after he was attacked by a deer that he’d shot and believed to be dead. Arkansas Game and Fish Commission spokesman Keith Stephens says 66-year-old Thomas Alexander shot a buck with a muzzleloader while hunting Tuesday near Yellville, an area in the Ozark Mountains about 105 miles north of Little Rock. Stephens tells Springfield, Missouri, television station KY3 the buck attacked Alexander when the hunter approached the animal to see if it was dead. He says Alexander, who suffered multiple puncture wounds, later died at a hospital. Stephens says it’s not clear how long Alexander waited before checking on the deer, but that the agency recommends waiting at least 30 minutes before approaching.\n\nCalifornia\n\nWestminster: The remains of 81 South Vietnamese soldiers shot down over Vietnam in 1965 have been interred at Southern California’s Westminster Memorial Park. Richard Spencer, secretary of the U.S. Navy, joined local officials for a procession and ceremony Saturday just outside Little Saigon in Orange County. The airborne soldiers of the Army of the Republic of South Vietnam were shot down in a remote area along with four American service members. The remains, which were commingled, were recovered in 1974 and eventually shipped to the U.S. The Americans were identified thanks to DNA technology. Efforts to return the other remains to Vietnam failed, so officials decided to give the unknown South Vietnamese soldiers a final resting place in the U.S. Orange County is home to the largest concentration of Vietnamese people outside Vietnam.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: A doctor fired by a Christian hospital company after trying to help a terminally ill man obtain drugs to hasten his death has a new job with a community health center. The Denver Post reports Dr. Barbara Morris, a geriatrician, has accepted a job with Stride Community Health Center in Lakewood. Stride officials say she will start in February. Morris was fired from St. Anthony Hospital in August after she and a patient filed a legal case challenging Centura Health’s policy against physician aid-in-dying. Centura was formed by Catholic and Seventh-day Adventist health care ministries. Colorado voters legalized physician aid-in-dying in 2016. The law forbids limiting a physican’s medical judgment on the issue, but the hospitals argue Colorado law can’t interfere with a religious organization carrying out its mission.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The city is considering turning five residential streets into what it’s calling “bicycle boulevards.” The Hartford Courant reports the city will hold public meetings Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss repurposing the roads for use mostly by bicycle and pedestrian traffic. Vehicle traffic would not be blocked on the streets but would be discouraged through signage. Similar streets have been set up in more than 10 states across the country and are sometimes referred to as “neighborways” or “neighborhood greenways.” The “bike boulevards” would be paid for with a $100,000, private Made to Move grant, an initiative between Degree Deodorant and Blue Zones LLC, founded by author Dan Buettner.\n\nDelaware\n\nWilmington: The City Council violated state law when it barred a man from speaking at one of its public meetings last month, the Delaware Department of Justice announced Friday in an opinion. Dion Wilson was banned from speaking at the Sept. 19 meeting after being accused by City Council President Hanifa Shabazz of disrupting two meetings by yelling after she prevented him from speaking during the public comment portion, noting the use of profanity. Shabazz said she will ensure that City Council meetings comply with all regulations. The Justice Department’s decision did not touch on Wilson’s Oct. 2 arrest, in which he was charged with harassment and disorderly conduct, both misdemeanors.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: President Donald Trump’s company is exploring the sale of its Pennsylvania Avenue hotel, which has been at the center of three years of ethics complaints and lawsuits accusing him of trying to profit off the presidency. The Trump Organization said in a statement Friday that it will consider offers to buy it out of a 60-year lease of the building partly because “people are objecting to us making so much money on the hotel.” The Trump International Hotel has been a magnet for lobbyists and diplomats looking to curry favor with the Trump administration. In Trump’s latest financial disclosure, the opulent hotel built from the Old Post Office building just steps from the White House generated nearly $41 million, up less than half a million from last year.\n\nFlorida\n\nKey West: The often-decadent Fantasy Fest wrapped up over the weekend, bringing flair to this island town. At Wednesday evening’s family friendly Pet Masquerade, entrants included costumed dogs, cats and a tortoise carrying a plush rabbit themed “The Tortoise and the Hare,” drawing inspiration from the fable of the same name. The overall winner was Diana Benton of Titusville, Florida, who dressed her two cats as country artists Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton, subscribing to the festival’s musical theme of “In Tune But ... Off Key.” Other highlights included Friday afternoon’s masquerade march and a parade with floats and flamboyantly costumed marching groups. Saturday night’s parade was expected to draw some 60,000 revelers. The 10-day festival ended Sunday after a children’s carnival and an afternoon dance party.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: Overall grades for the state’s schools fell in the 2018-2019 school year, with two state leaders repeating their call to overhaul grading methods. The typical school statewide scored 75.9 points on a 100-point scale, down from 76.6 points last year. Performance rose in high schools but fell slightly in elementary schools and more broadly in middle schools. Georgia’s system seeks to grade schools on student content mastery, academic progress and readiness, whether underperforming groups are closing gaps, and whether high school students graduate on time. State officials say scores fell because of lower scores on progress and closing gaps. State Superintendent Richard Woods and Gov. Brian Kemp say they want changes, with Woods calling for less reliance on standardized test scores.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: A judge says a 93-year-old Native Hawaiian heiress doesn’t need a guardian to take care of her but is ordering a hearing to determine whether she needs a conservator to manage her $215 million trust. Abigail Kawananakoa’s wealth has been tied up in a legal battle since her 2017 stroke. She’s considered a princess because she’s a descendant of the family that ruled Hawaii before the kingdom’s 1893 overthrow. Board members of her foundation and ex-employees say her wife is manipulating her. Lawyers for the couple dispute that. Native Hawaiians have been watching the case because they’re concerned about the fate of the foundation she set up to benefit Hawaiians. The couple’s lawyers said Friday that Kawananakoa should be able to do what she wants with her money.\n\nIdaho\n\nChallis: Officials say they plan to use a helicopter to capture 365 wild horses in central Idaho in early November to reduce the number of horses to about 185. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management in a news release Friday says the roundup in the Challis Herd Management Area near the town of Challis will begin on or about Nov. 5 and take up to nine days. The agency says balancing herd size with what the 260-square-mile management area can support will help protect habitat for wildlife species such as sage grouse, pronghorn antelope, mule deer and elk. The agency says mares released back into the management area will be treated with fertility control. About 240 horses not released back into the wild will be transported to the Bruneau Wild Horse Off-Range Corral facility southeast of Boise for adoption.\n\nIllinois\n\nSpringfield: The Illinois State Museum has returned 42 culturally significant items to representatives of two Aboriginal communities in Australia. A University of Chicago anthropologist who worked in Australia to record indigenous languages collected the items between 1929 and 1931. They were transferred to the museum in 1942. The State Journal-Register reports that an Australian delegation received the artifacts Wednesday during a ceremony at the Illinois State Museum’s Research and Collections Center in Springfield. Brooke Morgan, the museum’s curator of anthropology, said the items returned include secret, sacred, secular and ceremonial objects. They will be returned to Aranda and Bardi Jawi communities in Australia. Morgan said the items will be used in Australia to “revitalize cultural practices” to teach young generations how to make these traditional artifacts.\n\nIndiana\n\nElkhart: A northern Indiana airport’s parking ramp for aircraft will undergo a half-million-dollar repaving job after two jets sank into the asphalt over the summer. City attorney Lawrence Meteiver says the ramp was installed at the Elkhart Municipal Airport last year by the city at a cost of about $50,000. Indiana Flight Center President Brett Zierle says a 30,000-pound Bombardier Challenger and a 15,500-pound Cessna Citation XLS sank into the asphalt ramp in June on days when the temperature reached only into the 70s. He says the asphalt is soft and not capable of supporting the weight of those aircraft. The Elkhart Truth reports that Meteiver says an asphalt mix recommended by the Federal Aviation Administration will be installed after this winter at a cost of about $565,000.\n\nIowa\n\nKnoxville: A woman has died after an explosion at a gender reveal party created debris that hit her. The Marion County Sheriff’s office says the explosion happened at a home in central Iowa about 4 p.m. Saturday during a party to announce the gender of a baby a couple is expecting. Deputies arrived at the home in Knoxville, about 40 miles southeast of Des Moines, to find a 56-year-old woman dead. Investigators determined an explosion during the gender reveal announcement caused the woman’s death. No other details about the explosion were available.\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: State legislators went too far by criminalizing violent language not backed up by an intent to act, the state’s highest court ruled Friday in striking down part of a law that it says violates free speech rights. The Kansas Supreme Court kept in place portions of the 2010 law banning “true threats” but struck down the provision making it a felony for someone to be “reckless” in using threatening language that makes others afraid, even if the person making the comments doesn’t intend violence. The justices said that part of the law is so broad that it might apply to the speech of political protesters, violating the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The court said the state still can prosecute people who intentionally threaten of violence.\n\nKentucky\n\nBurgin: The Federal Aviation Administration says a mysterious object that seemingly dropped from the sky and damaged a man’s mobile home didn’t come from an airplane. Tommy Woosley says a heavy, nearly footlong canister-type object hit his home in Burgin, about 75 miles southeast of Louisville, two weeks ago. But the FAA and Norfolk Southern Railway say their transportation units have nothing to do with the object that lodged into the siding of his home. The National Guard and nearby Fort Campbell military base have also denied responsibility. Authorities initially believed the canister may have fallen from a plane, but an FAA spokeswoman says their investigation ruled it out. She says the agency is turning the object over to the Mercer County Sheriff’s Office for further investigation.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Former Mayor Mitch Landrieu is tackling the race issue, starting with a report called “Divided by Design.” The report released Friday is based on surveys and interviews with people in in 28 communities in 13 Southern states. It touts efforts to bridge racial gaps. But it also says segregation and inequality remain major barriers to advancement for many. And it notes widespread, conflicting views on racism among African Americans, Latinos and whites. When Landrieu was mayor, he removed four Jim Crow-era monuments from the New Orleans landscape, including statues of three Confederate icons. This report is the first project of the E Pluribus Unum Fund, which Landrieu launched after leaving office in May 2018. It calls for cultivating courageous leaders who can build common ground.\n\nMaine\n\nWest Gardiner: Democratic Gov. Janet Mills says a new, fast-charging station for electric cars and incentives for more of them will help break fossil fuel companies’ “stranglehold” over Mainers’ wallets. Mills on Friday unveiled the new charging station at the Maine Turnpike plaza in West Gardiner, saying it was funded through federal Volkswagen settlement money awarded to the state’s Department of Transportation. Mills also says 23 municipalities will receive incentives to install 47 new charging stations across the state for public use. It’s part of a larger effort to boost the charging infrastructure for electric cars. Mills says charging stations make electric cars a reality for more people, help people save money on fuel and protect the environment. She calls it a “hat-trick for Maine.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBerlin: A 14-year-old girl has adopted all 75 ponies from the Maryland herd of Assateague Island ponies. Zoe Newman this month became the first person ever to foster every horse in the herd. The adoptions, which have cost Zoe and her mother more than $3,000 so far, are symbolic and provide the Assateague Island National Seashore with education and herd management funds. Zoe and her mother, Sam Newman, often get up at 4 a.m. to make the three-hour drive from their Lexington Park home to get to the park by sunrise. They’ve visited about 30 times over the past few years. Zoe first adopted an Assateague pony when she was 10 years old and used her savings on a chestnut pinto named Annie Laurie.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A new study is recommending state officials address gambling addiction in Asian American communities. Researchers with the University of Massachusetts-Boston presented to the state’s Gaming Commission last week the results of a state-funded study in Boston’s Chinatown. The study found Chinatown residents who frequently visited casinos in the region did so to relieve stress from their low-wage jobs or in the hopes of escaping poverty. Researchers also found study participants were drawn to casinos because of gambling coupons, meal deals, bus rides and other casino promotions targeting Asian communities. The researchers recommend the state develop “culturally tailored” public health campaigns and gambling counseling services. They also recommend launching a broader study encompassing Vietnamese, Cambodian and Chinese communities in Quincy, Lowell, Malden and Worcester.\n\nMichigan\n\nLansing: A study has found few of the state’s residents are taking advantage of a legal option that allows people to erase their criminal convictions, even though an expungement can open doors to housing, student loans and employment. A University of Michigan law school study estimates just 6.5% of people who meet the requirements end up having their convictions set aside within five years of becoming eligible. Attorneys and law students volunteered their time last week at a free clinic in Lansing to educate more than 100 people on how to clear their records. The University of Detroit Mercy School of Law is using a $20,000 grant from the Michigan State Bar Foundation to host a series of free clinics around the state.\n\nMinnesota\n\nDuluth: A homeless man who pleaded guilty to starting a fire that destroyed a 117-year-old synagogue has been sentenced to three months in jail and 192 hours of community service. KTTC-TV reports 36-year-old Matthew Amiot was sentenced Friday. He pleaded guilty last month to negligent fire charges. Amiot received credit for the 36 days he has already served in jail. The fire destroyed the Adas Israel Synagogue in Duluth on Sept. 9. Authorities say Amiot used a lighter to ignite combustible materials outside the main building, near a separate religious structure called a sukkah. Amiot told police he tried to spit on the fire to put it out and walked away when that didn’t work. Police don’t believe the fire was a hate crime.\n\nMississippi\n\nTaylor: The site of an elementary school that served black children during segregation is set to become a park. The Oxford Eagle reports the plans for the park at the site of Weems Elementary were approved last week by the Lafayette County Board of Supervisors. The supervisors approved demolition of the school in May 2018 after a fire damaged most of the structure. A $1-per-year lease was approved with the newly formed nonprofit group Taylor Park Recreation, which will raise money for park construction. Throughout the 1960s, Weems taught black students between first and eighth grades. The state’s public schools were officially integrated in 1970, leading many such schools to shutter.\n\nMissouri\n\nSparta: The mayor of this tiny town says its hand-activated tornado warning siren needs to be retired. Mayor Jenni Davis is the only person in the town of 1,900 residents authorized to activate the tornado siren. The problem with the odd and antiquated system became evident early Monday when a twister was approaching town. Davis wanted to get downtown to flip the switch activating the siren, but a tree blocked her path. Fortunately, no one was hurt. Some towns are turning away from tornado warning sirens because cellphone apps and other technology that alert to approaching storms are increasingly common. But some experts say outdoor sirens still serve a purpose. Davis would like to replace the old siren, but the cost of up to $50,000 is more than the city can afford. A congressman’s office is seeking grant money to help.\n\nMontana\n\nWest Glacier: Crews have completed the two-year, nearly $9 million effort of reconstructing the historic Sperry Chalet in Glacier National Park after it was gutted by a wildfire. Project Manager Travis Neil of Dick Anderson Construction tells the Hungry Horse News that the crews will return next year to finish some minor tasks to help the National Park Service to get the chalet opened for next summer. The 105-year-old wood and stone dormitory located in a remote area of the park burned when embers from a wildfire rained down on it Aug. 31, 2017. All that remained was the building’s stone shell. Kevin Warrington of Belton Chalets, which operates the chalet, said Sperry Chalet will take reservations on Jan. 13, 2020, for the summer season.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: A career military man and former superintendent of the U.S. Naval Academy was chosen Friday as the top candidate to become the next president of the University of Nebraska system. The university Board of Regents voted unanimously to nominate Walter “Ted” Carter Jr. as their priority candidate. Carter is a retired Navy vice admiral and served as superintendent of his alma mater, the U.S. Naval Academy, from 2014 until this year. “Ted’s character and integrity are second to none,” said University of Nebraska Regent Jim Pillen, of Columbus, who led the search. “He has a proven focus on the success and well-being of students, faculty and staff. He has a deep appreciation for the role and mission of higher education. And is a public servant in every sense of the word.”\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: Police say a woman who was angered when she was kicked out of an area casino intentionally drove her motorhome into the building, injuring a custodian. North Las Vegas Police spokesman Eric Leavitt says the 50-year-old woman was ejected from the Cannery casino Friday morning and drove her Winnebago into the building. Leavitt says the woman hit a 66-year-old custodial worker outside the building. The Las Vegas Review-Journal reports the worker was critically injured but is expected to survive. Leavitt told KVVU-TV the woman kept hitting the gas, and her vehicle was stuck in the building’s entrance. Employees had to remove the woman to get her to stop. Leavitt says police who were already at the casino arrested the woman. Her identity was not immediately released.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nHampstead: Parents and other visitors to schools in the town are no longer allowed to bring guns onto school property. The Eagle Tribune reports the School Board unanimously approved a policy prohibiting anyone other than law enforcement and school resource officers from bringing guns on campus during school hours and during school-sponsored activities. The district already had rules against students and staff carrying firearms. School board member Karen Yasenka said the policy protects students and staff without infringing on anyone’s rights. The Legislature passed a bill this year that would have banned most guns from school grounds statewide, but Republican Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed it.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nWest Long Branch: The personal stories of people who survived Superstorm Sandy are an integral part of a new art exhibit remembering the deadly storm and the devastation it caused seven years ago. The Monmouth University exhibit also includes an obelisk made from slices from trees that fell during the storm, with each inch representing 2,703 lost housing units. There are hanging posters resembling beach towels that present Sandy-related data in easy-to-grasp visual terms. A “climate shelter,” for which all the trappings of a home that would normally be on the inside are on the outside, symbolizes the huge mounds of sodden possessions that became garbage.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nAlong the Burnt Mesa Trail: Conservationists and forestry experts are scouring the American Southwest, hoping to gather as many ponderosa pine cones as possible to give nature a hand in restoring fire-scarred landscapes. The goal: 1 million seeds. It might sound lofty, but those helping with the project are looking to take advantage of a rare bumper crop this fall that has resulted from back-to-back summer and winter seasons of much-needed rain and snow. It takes time to find the patches of trees that will yield the most seeds. One spot is a mesa in northern New Mexico that overlooks vast expanses of rugged terrain that has seen its share of fire over the last two decades. With drought and the severity of wildfires on the rise, scientists say seed collection and reforestation are becoming more important across the West.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: New Yorkers are flocking to greet a new arrival to the city – Wegmans grocery store. The popular regional chain officially opened its first New York City outpost Sunday, a 74,000-square-foot store at the Brooklyn Navy Yard with more than 500 employees. Despite the rain, crowds turned out Sunday to take a look at a selection the company says includes almost 50,000 items. Aside from groceries, the store offers a range of food options, including sushi, pizza and buffet bars, and has a bar serving alcohol in the cafe. The new Brooklyn outpost is the 101st store for Wegmans, which was founded over a century ago in Rochester, New York, and is still family-owned.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nRodanthe: Researchers say they’re seeing a growing number of great white sharks off the coast of the state’s Outer Banks. The Raleigh News & Observer reports that four sharks with tracking devices have “pinged” in recent days. The sharks are being tracked by researchers with the organization Ocearch, which said on Twitter that a shark named Ironbound was among the sharks that were traveling near the Outer Banks community of Corolla and moving down the coast toward Rodanthe. Ironbound is a 12-foot, 4-inch male great white who weighs about 1,000 pounds. The organization is tracking three other male great white sharks between 10 and 12 feet in length. Great white sharks are known to swim off the southeastern United States coast in the winter.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Democrats in the state Senate have joined the call for a senator to resign his leadership position in the wake of his Facebook posts targeting a Muslim U.S. congresswoman from Minnesota. The Bismarck Tribune reports Democratic senators wrote a letter Thursday to Sen. Oley Larsen, a Minot Republican, asking that he relinquish his position as president pro tempore. Their letter came a day after Larsen sent an email to his fellow senators, asking to “gauge each of your stance” on his leadership role. Last week Larsen posted a long-debunked photo that purports to show Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., holding a weapon at an al-Qaida training camp. The image actually shows a female Somali army recruit at a Mogadishu military training campus in 1978, four years before Omar was born in 1982.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: Thousands of acres in eastern Ohio that the state says it’s buying to promote recreation and conservation may be drilled for oil and natural gas. The Columbus Dispatch reports a draft purchase agreement obtained by the newspaper shows American Electric Power will retain subsurface rights to more than 31,000 acres it’s selling to the Ohio Department of Natural Resources for $47 million. The document states AEP will have the continuing right to drill. AEP spokesman Scott Blake says no active fracking is underway on the land. He says the power company will work with the state to coordinate that activity if the situation changes. Natural Resources Department spokeswoman Sarah Wickham says the state is “reasonably certain” the property includes active wells.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A second police officer has testified that an unarmed man wasn’t a threat when a fellow officer fatally shot him after the victim called 911 threatening suicide. Keith Sweeney is charged with murder in the 2017 killing of 29-year-old Dustin Pigeon, who was apparently trying to set himself on fire with lighter fluid when police arrived. The Oklahoman reports that Officer Troy Nitzky testified Friday that he didn’t see Pigeon as a threat. Sgt. Erik Howell testified Thursday that Pigeon didn’t have a gun or a knife and that he didn’t “observe any threatening acts.” Defense attorney Gary James has said that Sweeney didn’t know Pigeon was unarmed because the other officers didn’t notify him by radio and that Sweeney made the proper decision “based on the information he was given.”\n\nOregon\n\nPortland: The state’s LGBTQ community has updated rights to equal treatment under an executive order signed by Gov. Kate Brown. America’s first openly bisexual governor said a 1987 executive order needed to be updated to reflect current law and understandings about sexual orientation and gender identity. The executive order, signed Friday, prohibits state agencies from discriminating based on sexual orientation and gender identity. It directs state agencies to treat everyone consistent with their gender identity and to modify forms to add a third option – “nonbinary/other” – in addition to “male” and “female.” A state agency must also adopt statewide policies to expand access to appropriate restrooms and to accommodate state employees and the public who are transgender, nonbinary or gender nonconforming.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: An internal review of the state’s parole system spurred by five parolees getting charged in quick succession with homicide is, in theory, acknowledging a long-standing complaint of parole agents. It asks lawmakers to update a 2012 law and add a trigger for an automatic six-month to one-year jail sentence for a parolee who continually ignores parole conditions, such as going to treatment or counseling. The 2012 law already has five such triggers, including threatening behavior or possession of a weapon. Law enforcement groups largely welcomed the acknowledgement from the state Department of Corrections. The county district attorneys association calls it a “significant recognition.” Parole agents, however, were skeptical it’ll change a system they say has stripped them of discretion to pull a potentially dangerous parolee off the street.\n\nRhode Island\n\nExeter: A memorial was dedicated over the weekend for 97 firefighters who have died in the line of duty in the state since the 1800s. North Kingstown Fire Chief Scott Kettelle says firefighters raised more than $300,000 for the memorial dedicated Saturday at the state Fire Training Academy. Construction has taken about a year. The Providence Journal reports firefighters who have died since recordkeeping began in the 1800s are being commemorated for their sacrifice. Kettelle says he and other organizers hope the event can become an annual tradition. The fire department plans to continue adding more names with fundraising through the sale of engraved paving bricks. The memorial is open to the public.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: The state is again requiring all sex offenders to stay inside with their outside lights off and not give out trick-or-treat candy on Halloween. Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services spokesman Pete O’Boyle said the requirement to stay inside runs from 5:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. statewide Oct. 31. O’Boyle says some counties will require all sex offenders to go to a central location to be supervised for several hours on Halloween. O’Boyle said in a statement that agents will be checking on offenders in all 46 South Carolina counties. Last year, agents checked more than 350 homes and made more than 150 phone calls.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: The state Transportation Commission has passed rules for truck platooning. The practice links two or more trucks in a convoy, using connected technology and automated driving support systems. Drivers are still behind the wheel of the trucks, but when synced, the vehicles behind the leader adapt to changes in movement with little or no action from the drivers. KELO-TV reports truck companies need special permits from the Department of Public Safety to platoon. The commission is allowing the practice only on South Dakota’s interstates, except in certain weather conditions and during the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally. The Legislature’s Rules Review Committee will consider the rules Nov. 4. Twenty-nine states now allow truck platooning, including all of South Dakota’s neighbors.\n\nTennessee\n\nErwin: The town is preparing to auction off a herd of brightly painted elephant statues that recall a dark day in local history. The Johnson City Press reports the auction is part of a community initiative called the Erwin Elephant Revival. It honors a circus elephant named Mary who was hanged from a derrick in Erwin’s railyard in 1916 after she killed her trainer. The Elephant Revival lets residents reflect on the past while raising money for the Elephant Sanctuary in Hohenwald. The statues are getting added attention this year after local high school students won a National Public Radio competition for their podcast on the initiative. The silent auction takes place Monday through Friday at Erwin Town Hall. More information is available online.\n\nTexas\n\nCollege Station: A charity that trains service dogs for disabled veterans has commissioned a statue of the late George H.W. Bush’s service dog for the 41st president’s library. America’s VetDogs has commissioned sculptor Susan Bahary to create the bronze statue of Sully for placement in the east wing of the George H.W. Bush Presidential Library and Museum at Texas A&M University. VetDogs President John Miller says the statue will depict Sully sitting with his leash in his mouth, the “retrieve” task VetDogs trains its dogs to perform. It will show Sully wearing his America’s VetDogs vest with the Great Seal of the United States on its back. The yellow Labrador golden retriever assisted the former president for the last six months of his life before Bush’s death last November at age 94.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: A rule that would have allowed ATVs on certain roads in the five national parks in the state has been rescinded by the National Park Service. The agency said in a news release Friday that it changed its mind after further consultation with Interior Department Secretary David Bernhardt, whose agency includes the National Park Service. The agency didn’t provide reasons for the reversal. The rule would have gone into effect Nov. 1 to conform to a state law that allows any “street-legal” vehicle on state and county roads. Instead, a long-standing ban on ATVs in parks will remain. Ashley Korenblat, an advocate for preserving public lands and CEO of Western Spirit Cycling in Moab, Utah, applauded a move she said will ensure ATVs aren’t crammed into already congested national parks.\n\nVermont\n\nNorwich: The town lost almost $250,000 in an email scam. A report released by Norwich details how town Finance Director Donna Flies ignored instructions to stop unauthorized payments from municipal accounts. Town Treasurer Cheryl Lindberg says she confronted Flies, telling her that payments from Norwich accounts require select board approval. Authorities say Flies assumed emails requesting large sums of money were from her boss, Town Manager Herb Durfee. Flies told investigators the only thing she did wrong was to make “stupid mistakes.” Valley News reports the report blames both Flies for failing to detect the scam and town officials for failing to confront her. No one’s been charged with a crime. Officials say $79,765 was returned by Comerica Bank.\n\nVirginia\n\nLynchburg: A poet and civil rights activist from the city will be honored in the U.S. Postal Service’s 2020 Forever stamp series. Anne Spencer, who died in 1975, is included in the recently unveiled “Voices of the Harlem Renaissance” series. In a news release, the USPS says the set of 20 stamps pays homage to “one of the great artistic and literary movements in American history.” The News & Advance reports that Spencer enrolled at what’s now the Virginia University of Lynchburg at 11 years old when she was barely literate and graduated six years later as valedictorian. She went on to become a poet, librarian, and contemporary of African-American artists and political leaders. Spencer also helped found the Lynchburg chapter of the NAACP in 1918.\n\nWashington\n\nSeattle: Sound Transit board members have abandoned ideas for a $450 million tunnel into the city’s historic central Ballard, a $200 million bored tunnel through West Seattle’s Pigeon Point neighborhood, and a fully elevated trackway in Sodo that would have blocked light-rail travel during construction. The Seattle Times reports cheaper options that serve the same number of passengers and will still cost hundreds of millions of dollars will now gain momentum during environmental studies. Politicians on the 18-member board have entertained dozens of alignment concepts since 2016, when voters passed the $54 billion ST3 tax measure to expand regional rail and bus services. The agency promised West Seattle stations in 2030 and stations from south downtown to Seattle Center and Ballard by 2035.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: Inmates in state prisons now have access to specially designed tablet computers. The Register-Herald reports the tablets are provided at no cost to taxpayers by Global Tel Link through its inmate banking services contract with the prison system. The tablets give the prisoners access to email, video visitation, electronic books, music, games and movies. They lack a normal internet browser but do allow access to select websites, including educational and career sites. All apps and websites are approved by the Division of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The devices will soon help inmates submit requests, file grievances and order from the facility commissary. West Virginia’s tablet program began as a pilot at the Saint Mary’s Correctional Center last year. Then-Superintendent Patrick Mirandy said he saw the tablets improve facility safety.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: University of Wisconsin System President Ray Cross is retiring. The 71-year-old Cross said Friday that he plans to retire once a new president is selected. Cross has served as UW’s president since February 2014. He previously served three years as chancellor of UW Colleges and UW-Extension and has spent more than four decades in higher education, previously working in Minnesota and Michigan. He served three years in the U.S. Army in Vietnam. Cross says serving as UW president has been the most rewarding work of his life. UW Board of Regents President Andrew Petersen says in a statement that Cross has been tireless in leading the system with vision and integrity. He says Cross stabilized the system at a time of legislative skepticism and financial challenges.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: The Jackson Hole Wildlife Foundation reports 28 moose were killed on roads in Teton County from May 2018 through April 2019. It’s the highest moose toll since 33 were killed from May 2010 through April 2011. Eight were killed along Moose-Wilson Road. The foundation’s executive director, Jon Mobeck, told the Jackson Hole News & Guide on Friday that the overall wildlife toll of 267 animals reported hit was the fifth-highest since the foundation started keeping tabs in 1990. Elk collisions totaled 34 in the most recent report, down from the 40s in the previous two years. The foundation’s report does not include animals found dead and reported hit in Grand Teton National Park, where elk and moose collisions increased from 2017 to 2018.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2019/10/28"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/20/pigeon-hats-cushion-cash-chaka-khan-news-around-states/41032359/", "title": "More pigeon hats, cushion cash: News from around our 50 states", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: The nation’s first memorial to lynching victims is expanding. The Equal Justice Initiative on Saturday opened a new welcome center and exhibition space that will add to the existing lynching memorial and museum that documents the history of racial inequality in America. The downtown pavilion will serve as a hub for visitors to the two previously opened sites: EJI’s National Memorial for Peace and Justice, which documents the era of racial terror lynchings between 1877 and 1950, and the Legacy Museum. The Legacy Pavilion will include a monument to women, men and children who were victims of racial terror lynchings in the Civil War’s aftermath. It will also honor civil rights figures including Martin Luther King Jr., Claudette Colvin, John Lewis, Rosa Parks, Jonathan Daniels, Jo Ann Robinson, and E.D. Nixon and describe Montgomery’s role in fueling a civil rights movement. It’ll also include a gift shop, soul food restaurant, and a shuttle service to the memorial and museum.\n\nAlaska\n\nJuneau: The University of Alaska Southeast and other schools in the state university system have proposed increasing tuition starting in the fall to combat a decrease in state funding. The 5% increase was brought about after significant cuts to the state’s funding of the University of Alaska system, the Juneau Empire reports. The increase would generate up to $500,000 for the system and apply to resident undergraduate students, university chancellor Rick Caulfield said. Students taking 15 credit hours of courses a semester would pay about $400 more each year, university officials said. Only three students participated in a meeting scheduled for them to address university officials about the proposal, Caulfield said. Teacher education, marine biology and science programs, and mining and maritime-oriented vocational training are some of the university’s most successful programs, university officials said.\n\nArizona\n\nHeber-Overgaard: U.S. Forest Service officials confirm that seven more wild horses have been found dead in eastern Arizona after eight others were found earlier this month and say that at least some were shot. “Several horses died due to bullet wounds,” but other carcasses were too badly decomposed to determine the cause of death, Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests officials said in a statement Friday. The statement said the 15 carcasses were found in a ranger district headquartered in Heber-Overgaard, a rural community 109 miles northeast of Phoenix. According to the statement, evidence was limited because some of the carcasses “had been exposed to extreme weather conditions over extended periods of time.” Forest officials said law enforcement officials had taken steps to more quickly deploy equine experts and veterinarians to incident scenes to help collect evidence.\n\nArkansas\n\nLittle Rock: A state commission has approved nearly $9 million in funding to repair levees damaged by record flooding last year. The Arkansas Natural Resources Commission approved the $8.8 million in grant funding Thursday for 14 groups overseeing levees along the Arkansas River that were damaged last year, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. The largest grants were for $1.6 million for the Riverdale area in Little Rock and $1.5 million for a levee district in Dardanelle. Last year, Gov. Asa Hutchinson created a task force to study how to improve the state’s aging levee system. The group presented its final report earlier this month and recommended increased oversight, consolidation of some levee districts, and state grants to fund improvements. Last year’s springtime flooding along the Arkansas River occurred because of heavy rainfall in Kansas and Oklahoma.\n\nCalifornia\n\nSacramento: The state increased its efforts Friday to keep the federal government from allowing oil and gas drilling on more than 1 million acres of public land, suing to block the Trump administration from issuing new permits in the central part of the state. The federal lawsuit against the U.S. Bureau of Land Management follows a new state law also intended to counter Trump administration plans to increase oil and gas production on protected public land. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra sued on behalf of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration, saying the permits would allow the controversial extraction method called hydraulic fracturing, commonly called fracking. Newsom in October signed a law barring any California leasing authority from allowing pipelines or other oil and gas infrastructure to be built on state property. Federally protected areas are adjacent to state-owned land.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: After former Gov. John Hickenlooper came under fire for how he spent money from a little-known account in his office, similar accounts have been noted throughout state government that hold millions of taxpayer dollars, KCNC-TV reports. The money in the accounts comes from sources like federal dollars and legal settlements, and departments don’t have to disclose it to the Legislature. Democratic Sen. Dominick Moreno plans to change that with a bill he says the powerful Joint Budget Committee is drafting this year. As vice chair of the committee, Moreno has in-depth knowledge of state finances. But he says even he didn’t know about all the money state departments take in that isn’t reported and over which the Legislature has no control. The Colorado Sun reports the Hickenlooper account is paying ongoing legal bills related to an ethics complaint against the current U.S. Senate candidate.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: The Democratic speaker of the state House says lawmakers should consider whether to ban Native American athletic nicknames and symbols at public high schools after one school restored its Redmen mascot just months after dropping it. “I’d like to see a bill introduced to have a public hearing and have the discussion,” Joe Aresimowicz told the Hartford Courant. The school board in Killingly voted in June to drop the high school’s Redmen nickname and then replaced it with Red Hawks in October. The board, with an infusion of new Republican members, restored Redmen last month. Aresimowicz called the mascot “highly offensive.” Across the state, 19 public high schools use Native American-themed nicknames or imagery. Opponents of such names say they are racist and perpetuate stereotypes. The defenders of Native mascots and symbols say they are signs of respect.\n\nDelaware\n\nHockessin: A local temple is now home to a statue of a Hindu god said to be the tallest in the country. Hundreds of people celebrated the arrival of the 25-foot granite statue of the Hindu god Hanuman on Saturday morning at a temple in Hockessin. A welcome ceremony was held after a truck delivered the 60,000-pound statue. “Across India, Lord Hanuman is often enshrined and worshipped in the form of a towering statue, and we are proud to bring that tradition to Delaware,” says Patibanda Sarma, president of the Hindu Temple Association. Organizers of the effort to bring the statue to Delaware had said it would be the tallest statue of a Hindu god carved out of a single piece of stone in the United States. Sculptors in India spent about a year carving it.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Thousands gathered on Freedom Plaza on Saturday as part of the nationwide Women’s March rallies focused on issues such as climate change, pay equity, reproductive rights and immigration, though crowds were noticeably smaller than in previous years. The 2017 march drew close to 1 million people. Last year about 100,000 held a rally east of the White House. This year’s protesters planned to march around the White House, but President Donald Trump wasn’t there, as he was spending the weekend at his resort in Florida. Organizers faced criticism from some local African American activists for failing to focus on local issues and damaging the ability of local activists to organize. “Local D.C. is a domestic colony and the actions of national organizers have to recognize that,” Black Lives Matter D.C. wrote in a letter last week to Women’s March organizers. “Here in D.C., these unstrategic mass mobilizations distract from local organizing, often overlook the black people who actually live here and even result in tougher laws against demonstration being passed locally.”\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: The Legislature set a lot of lofty goals for its annual 60-day session: passing a budget expected to top $90 billion; lowering the cost of health care; preventing blue-green algae; and boosting teacher pay. But also on the agenda entering the second week of session are measures banning iguana breeding, protecting nude sunbathers, making shelter animals the official state pet, banning sunscreen bans, and giving hunters a sales tax break on guns and ammo. The full Senate will take up a bill that would ban local governments from banning sunscreens, while a House committee takes up its version of the bill, in reaction to Key West banning the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate, which some researchers say can harm coral reefs.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: The state is on track to have its new election system ready for the presidential primaries in March, lawyers for the state assured a judge Friday, but critics pushed for a more concrete backup plan in case things don’t go as planned. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg tried throughout a conference call to strike a balance between the interests of the two sides while making it clear that she does not consider herself a “guarantor” for the state’s election system rollout. Totenberg is presiding over a lawsuit filed in 2017 by election integrity advocates and individual voters who alleged that the state’s outdated touch-screen voting machines and election management system, in use since 2002, were not secure and were vulnerable to hacking. Critics argue that the new system has many of the same security vulnerabilities as the old system and that voters can’t be sure the barcode read by the scanner accurately reflects their selections.\n\nHawaii\n\nHonolulu: The U.S. Navy is honoring a World War II hero in naming a new aircraft carrier for Mess Attendant 2nd Class Doris Miller. The announcement is expected to be made at Pearl Harbor on Monday, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Miller was the first African American to receive the Navy Cross for valor. He was recognized for manning a machine gun on the USS West Virginia and returning fire against Japanese planes during the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. USS Miller, a destroyer escort, was previously named in his honor. An African American was not allowed to man a gun in the Navy in 1941, said Doreen Ravenscroft, a team leader for the Doris Miller Memorial. “Without him really knowing, he actually was a part of the civil rights movement because he changed the thinking in the Navy,” Ravenscroft said. Two of Miller’s nieces are expected to be at Pearl Harbor for the announcement.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state has the nation’s sixth-highest growth rate for spending on corrections in the past 25 years, and with the governor proposing a 12.1% budget increase for the Department of Correction, the department’s director says the state is at a “critical juncture,” the Idaho Press reports. Idaho increased spending on corrections by 207% between 1992 and 2018, according to a report by the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy in Boise. Idaho’s expenditures outpace its spending during the same time period on education, which increased by 94% for public schools and 39% for higher education. At least some of that spending is the result of policy decisions the Legislature made in the past 40 years, according to the report. Idaho is one of only three states in the country where inmates are required by law to serve 100% of their fixed terms, the result of truth-in-sentencing legislation passed in the 1980s, according to the report.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: The city will test updated bus routes on the West Side under a pilot program recently approved by the Chicago Transit Board. City officials tout the change as part of Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s promise to invest in neighborhoods outside the downtown core. The pilot program is designed to provide streamlined service along the city’s grid system and improve connections to city trains, according to city officials. For example, riders will have more access to jobs, services and schools near the University of Illinois at Chicago, where there are also several hospitals. The changes take effect in April and will last one year. Chicago Transit Authority staff will determine whether to make the changes permanent. The changes will cost about $550,000 and be funded with CTA operating funds, according to officials.\n\nIndiana\n\nBloomington: Portions of two parks are getting a special designation because of a rare tree species. Areas in Brown County State Park and Yellowwood State Forest will be considered high conservation value forest areas in an effort to preserve the yellowwood tree population. The Forest Stewardship Council’s certification is a way to ensure that 591 acres where the trees are growing are managed so they remain part of the landscape, says Mike Spalding, resource specialist with Monroe-Monroe and Yellowwood state forests. Civilian Conservation Corps workers in Brown County State Park first discovered the trees in 1933. Forester T.E. Shaw and Charles Deam, Indiana’s first state forester, verified and documented the discovery. One theory was that the yellowwood trees were brought north by Kentucky settlers, but that was proven false when the trees were analyzed. The results showed the trees were genetically distinct and had been in the area for thousands of years.\n\nIowa\n\nWaterloo: Organizers of an emergency warming shelter say they will have to close because the space doesn’t meet fire code regulations. The Waterloo Warming Center opened Jan. 6 at Jubilee United Methodist Church’s Freedom resource center. But after an inspection, officials noted the space didn’t have a sprinkler system and ordered that the center close by Tuesday. Organizers began searching for a new location and implored city officials not to force them out of the current site until a replacement can be found. Temperatures are supposed to remain below freezing until later this week. “We understand and appreciate the need for fire safety regulations, but we cannot close this location down until a new appropriate location has been secured,” Black Hawk County Supervisor Chris Schwartz told the Waterloo-Cedar Falls Courier. “The alternative is leaving folks out to freeze to death on our streets.”\n\nKansas\n\nTopeka: Former governor and plastic surgeon Jeff Colyer is about to add Chaka Khan backup singer to his resume. Colyer is part of a student and faculty choir that will join the “Queen of Funk” on stage for a Martin Luther King Day event hosted by Georgetown University at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, The Kansas City Star reports. “I get to be a backup singer for Chaka Khan. That’s pretty cool,” said Colyer, who was was a fellow at Georgetown’s Institute of Politics and Public Service during the fall semester. The performance will include a piece composed by Khan, who achieved success in the 1970s as a vocalist in the funk band Rufus and as a solo artist in the 1980s with her hit single “I Feel For You.” Colyer, of Overland Park, was lieutenant governor in 2018 and rose to the top job after fellow Republican Sam Brownback resigned to take an ambassadorship.\n\nKentucky\n\nFrankfort: Inmate populations and deteriorating prisons are sapping the state of money needed for priorities like education and health care, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear says. Stepping up his push for criminal justice reform as the “fiscally responsible thing to do,” Beshear said Friday that the state needs to reduce incarceration rates, which in turn would create opportunities to consolidate prisons. “Criminal-justice reform isn’t just the right thing to do – and I believe it is – it’s the moral thing to do,” he told reporters at the Capitol. “It is absolutely necessary to do for this budget and most especially for every budget” after that. Beshear, who previously served as the state’s attorney general, stressed that he wants to revamp the criminal-justice system in a way that doesn’t compromise public safety.\n\nLouisiana\n\nNew Orleans: Plans are on again to implode a hotel building that partially collapsed last fall, killing three workers, city officials said Friday. Mayor LaToya Cantrell and Fire Superintendent Tim McConnell said at a news conference that the implosion is expected to take place in mid-March. Implosion had been considered and then rejected in the weeks after the Oct. 12 collapse at the planned Hard Rock Hotel on Canal Street, at the edge of the French Quarter. But on Friday, officials said the implosion plan was back on. It was deemed safer than having workers dismantle the structure. “Putting more people at risk, I cannot live with that and will not support that,” Cantrell said. And it will mean commerce and traffic can return to the area around the unstable building more quickly. Implosion will also bring the building down ahead of hurricane season, which begins June 1.\n\nMaine\n\nWestbrook: What goes around comes around. An ice disk appears to be forming in the same river where an unusually large one formed last winter and quickly gained international fame. The City of Westbrook tweeted an aerial view of the disk in the Presumpscot River with the message: “ICE BREAKING NEWS: Ice Disk 2020 is making a run for it…It’s not a perfect circle yet, but it is rotating counter-clockwise again & the seagulls are along for the ride.” The ice formation comes just about a year after a disk measuring about 100 yards in diameter was spotted in the Presumpscot River. It eventually had a devoted webcam; social media users compared it to an alien spacecraft and the moon; and ducks used it as a raft. A video of the disk shows a nascent ice blob that is thinner and less circular than the famous disk of 2019.\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: The city will formally name a courthouse after the late U.S. Rep. Elijah Cummings in the first half of 2020. Mayor Bernard C. “Jack” Young on Friday unveiled the renderings of the bronze plaques that will be affixed to the building’s exterior. One includes an image and biography of the congressman, and the other reads “Elijah E. Cummings Courthouse.” The powerful Democratic congressman and civil rights champion died Oct. 17 at age 68 of complications from long-standing health issues. He had represented Maryland’s 7th Congressional District, which encompasses a large portion of Baltimore, since 1996. Cummings graduated from the University of Maryland School of Law and practiced in Baltimore. “Elijah was a son of Baltimore. He was proud of Baltimore,” his widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings, said during the unveiling ceremony. “His career as a legal professional started in this courthouse.”\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: A push to expand school breakfast programs is making its way through the Legislature. The state Senate last week unanimously approved legislation aimed at increasing participation rates in the programs. The bill would require public schools with 60% or more of students currently eligible for free or reduced-price meals under the federal National School Lunch Program to offer breakfast after the school bell rings. Massachusetts currently requires all high-poverty schools to provide breakfast to every eligible student. Because breakfast is typically offered before the bell, participation levels are less than 40%, compared to up to 90% participation for free and reduced lunch. Supporters of the bill say moving breakfast to after the bell will boost participation and ensure all students have the nutrition they need.\n\nMichigan\n\nOwosso: A whopping $43,170 in forgotten cash was discovered inside a footstool donated to a resale shop. Howard Kirby bought the piece and other furniture for $70 after Christmas. He was stunned Sunday when his daughter-in-law unzipped the cushion and shouted. After the shock wore off, he began the extraordinary step of returning the money to the former owners. “I do what I can to be as much like Christ as I can, and this is the moral thing to do,” said Kirby, 54. “This is going to help them. I’m so happy for them.” The footstool was part of a living room set donated to a Habitat For Humanity store by Kim Fauth-Newberry and her husband. The furniture had belonged to her grandfather, Phillip Fauth, who died in July. Fauth-Newberry said Fauth was a frugal man who always paid in cash, even $9,000 for a new roof. The newly discovered money was separated with paper clips and topped with handwritten notes.\n\nMinnesota\n\nMinneapolis: The state’s voters on Friday became some of the first in the country to cast ballots in the presidential primaries as early voting began for the Super Tuesday contest. Eligible Minnesota voters can now vote at county courthouses across the state and early voting stations in some cities, and they can also request absentee ballots for the March 3 primary. But the votes won’t be counted until primary night. Fifteen candidates are on the Democratic ballot, even though some already have dropped out of the race. The GOP ballot lists only President Donald Trump, though write-in votes are allowed. It’s Minnesota’s first presidential primary since 1992 after years of using precinct caucuses to kick off the process of selecting national convention delegates. Voters must request either a Democratic or Republican ballot, and their names will be shared with the state’s major parties.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: The Board of Education is keeping the state’s U.S. history exam, despite months of pressure from teachers and others to cut testing. The board voted unanimously Thursday to keep the test, one of four public school students must take in high school. A testing task force in August had recommended the state do away with what’s the only state test not required by federal law. “It was extremely disheartening that board members placed so much confidence in a staff recommendation over the recommendations of the task force, commission, and multiple surveys of practitioners throughout the state that favored elimination of the assessment,” Mississippi Professional Educators, the state’s largest teachers group, wrote in a message to members.\n\nMissouri\n\nSt. Louis: The president of a predominantly black police union says the city prosecutor’s lawsuit is correct in pointing out racial concerns in St. Louis, including biases within the police department itself. Ethical Society of Police President Heather Taylor stopped short of endorsing Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner’s federal lawsuit accusing “entrenched interests” of impeding her efforts to reform racist practices, but Taylor questioned how anyone could ignore the department’s “long history of racial discrimination.” She said in a statement that denying racial bias within the department is “a slap in the face to minority and non-minority officers with whom we are proud to serve.” She said the union has often cited racial disparities in discipline, promotions and job placement.\n\nMontana\n\nChoteau: An ice jam that has caused flooding along a creek in central Montana had nearly submerged a town park and was rising into residents’ basements and crawl spaces, leading the city to declare a state of emergency Friday. The ice jam came after subzero temperatures and was exacerbated by high ground water. It is likely to remain until warmer temperatures thaw the blocked culverts and stream beds. Water up to 6 inches deep was reported on some streets after ice traveling down Spring Creek was backed up, weather officials said. The ice jam came after temperatures dropped to 20 degrees below zero, officials said. Residents were encouraged to take shorter showers and reduce the amount of times toilets are flushed to avoid overwhelming the sewer system. Sewer main lines were completely filled, and crews sandbagged manholes in the area to avoid further surface water infiltration, city officials said.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Want to try your hand at waterfowl or turkey hunting, but leery of the expense of buying blinds and decoys? The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has a solution. UNL’s Outdoor Adventure Center is now offering that equipment for rent to the public. The rentals had previously been offered for about a year only to the university’s students. Officials recently decided to expand the policy to allow the public to rent the equipment, too. Micaela Rahe with the National Wild Turkey Federation and the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission said it’s the first program of its kind in the state. Hunting gear currently available for rent includes a pop-up blind, layout blind, duck decoy set of 14 birds and a jake/hen turkey decoy combination. Each is individually available to the public for $6 per day, $12 for three days or $16 for a full week.\n\nNevada\n\nReno: A pigeon wearing a tiny sombrero was discovered following sightings of its cowboy hat-wearing cousins in Las Vegas, a city manager says. Reno City Manager Sabra Newby tweeted about the bird Wednesday, saying it’s quirky and fun but still inhumane, KOLO-TV reports. It is the first known sighting of hat-wearing birds in the region, Washoe County Regional Animal Services officials say. The sighting comes after a pigeon in Las Vegas with a miniature cowboy hat glued to its head died last week, animal officials say. People who see the bird are encouraged to call animal service dispatch officers, officials say. It is unclear who put the hat on the bird. “Reno cares about our animals,” Newby says. “They need protection and don’t need to become a punchline.”\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: A group that organized a big memorial bike ride following the deaths of seven motorcyclists in a collision with a pickup truck is presenting the state agencies that helped out with a custom-made, wooden U.S. flag. The flag is etched with the victims’ names from the June crash in Randolph. A presentation by the Ride for Fallen 7 Foundation is scheduled for 9 a.m. Thursday at the state Incident Planning and Operations Center, where the flag will be displayed. The building houses agencies from the safety and transportation departments. An estimated 3,000 motorcycles, with 4,500 riders from around the country, took part in the Ride for the Fallen 7 in July. They rode 90 miles from Laconia to the crash site in Randolph, where a memorial service was held. Those killed were members of the Jarheads Motorcycle Club.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Barring health insurance that excludes coverage for preexisting conditions and letting children stay on their parents’ plans until 26 would be preserved under a slate of new laws the state enacted last week, even if the Affordable Care Act is struck down in court. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy signed the nine bills Thursday. They’re aimed at shoring up key provisions of the federal Affordable Care Act, which is opposed by Republicans in Congress and the White House. Democratic and Republican attorneys general are fighting in court over the law, sometimes referred to as “Obamacare.” New Jersey has about 800,000 people benefiting from the law, with about half a million people getting covered through Medicaid expansion under the law and 300,000 on the individual marketplace.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nJemez Springs: A national preserve in northern New Mexico that is sometimes referred to as the “Yellowstone of the Southwest” has added another piece of property to its land holdings that contains sulfuric acid hot springs, volcanic fumaroles and steaming mud pots. The National Park Service announced last week that it recently completed the purchase of a 40-acre parcel known as Sulphur Springs within the Valles Caldera National Preserve. Many of the geothermal features on the property are found nowhere else in New Mexico, and similar sites are very rare in the Western United States, officials said. The acidic pools and streams in the area also are home to a range of “extremophile” algae and bacteria. Acquiring Sulphur Springs was critical to protecting the breadth of geothermal features within the preserve, officials said. The $500,000 purchase was made through the Land and Water Conservation Fund and nonprofit groups.\n\nNew York\n\nNew York: Federal authorities are turning to a new tactic in the escalating conflict over the city’s so-called sanctuary policies, issuing four “immigration subpoenas” for information about inmates wanted for deportation. “This is not a request – it’s a demand,” Henry Lucero, said a senior U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement official. “This is a last resort for us. Dangerous criminals are being released every single day in New York.” Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration said Saturday that the city would review the subpoenas. “New York City will not change the policies that have made us the safest big city in America,” spokeswoman Freddi Goldstein said in an email. The development came days after ICE sent similar subpoenas to Denver, a move that reflected the agency’s mounting frustration with jurisdictions that do not honor deportation “detainers” or provide any details about defendants going in and out of local custody.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nWilson: Wilson County plans to add four new historical markers this year to commemorate African American heroes, including a 1946 effort to organize tobacco workers. Called Operation Dixie, the unionization effort was led by black women demanding better working conditions in the tobacco industry. The state unveiled a historical marker in Rocky Mount in 2011. The local chapter of the Tobacco Workers International Union formed in Wilson in 1946. Other markers to be unveiled in Wilson this year will honor the Wilson Normal and Industrial Institute, Dr. Frank S. Hargrave, and Charles H. Darden, the Wilson Times reports. The marker for Hargrave describes him as the founder of Mercy Hospital, which treated African Americans in an era when even hospitals were segregated by race. In 1914, he was elected president of the National Medical Association, which was the African American equivalent of the American Medical Association.\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: Gov. Doug Burgum announced Friday that he has pardoned 16 people convicted of low-level marijuana crimes, the first wave in what may be thousands under a new policy the first-term Republican said gives former offenders a second chance. The policy adopted last year allows people with low-level marijuana convictions to petition to have their records wiped clean if they avoid unlawful behavior for five years. The pardons erase the convictions as if they never occurred, and records are shielded from public view. Burgum and Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem both supported the change, which brings North Dakota in line with some other states and cities. Past convictions can be problematic for people trying to find jobs and housing. Burgum has said the policy change could help address North Dakota’s workforce shortage and grow its economy, while removing the stigma for what are minor cases from years ago.\n\nOhio\n\nCincinnati: A woman who was among the “Freedom Riders” who challenged racial segregation in the 1960s will be the keynote speaker at a breakfast honoring civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. The National Underground Railroad Freedom Center says Betty Daniels Rosemond will speak Monday at the King Legacy Awards Breakfast recognizing participants in a youth leadership program. Three students will be given awards for their work. Rosemond grew up in New Orleans and joined the Congress of Racial Equality, a leading civil rights organization. She was among bus riders, black and white, who braved possible violence to advocate for racial equality in the segregated South. The center invites guests to join in the 45th annual MLK Coalition March in downtown Cincinnati after the breakfast that will include an interfaith prayer service at Fountain Square.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: A state panel that includes appointees of Gov. Kevin Stitt has approved more taxpayer subsidies for the Jenks-based company the governor founded and ran until after his election in 2018. The three-member Quality Jobs Program Incentive Approval Committee on Thursday voted unanimously to approve an application from Gateway First Bank. The contract was first reported by the online publication The Frontier. Two of the members who approved the application, Department of Commerce Director Brent Kisling and Oklahoma Tax Commission Chairman Charles Prater, were appointed by Stitt. Under the program, companies that create up to $2.5 million in new annual payrolls within three years can qualify for quarterly cash payments of up to 5% of new payroll costs. The company already has received more than $876,000 in taxpayer subsidies under an existing contract under the program, state records show.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: The state’s changing climate and ocean conditions are already harming its native fish and wildlife, officials from the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife say. That’s making it difficult for ODFW to meet its statutory mandate to manage the resources in its care. In response, the department is developing a Climate and Ocean Change Policy that will help shape where its limited resources are spent. On Friday, the public and the Oregon Fish and Wildlife Commission had their first chance to hear about the proposal. “Our climate and ocean are changing in ways that are not favorable for fish and wildlife,” said Shaun Clements, ODFW senior policy analyst. “We’ve been working on trying to address these impacts.” For example, Oregon may have to abandon spending in some areas where species are unlikely to survive, in order to focus on those where they will, said Davia Palmeri, the department’s conservation policy coordinator.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: Gov. Tom Wolf says he will follow through on his plan to close another state prison, announced originally in August as a cost-cutting step amid a declining inmate population and rising prison costs. Wolf’s administration carried out the required hearings on its plan, which was criticized by the corrections’ officers union and state lawmakers whose districts surround Retreat state prison in northeastern Pennsylvania. Retreat, about 10 miles west of Wilkes-Barre, has about 400 employees and about 940 inmates. Closing could occur in four months at an annual savings of $40 million, the administration said. Employees will be offered jobs at another state prison within 65 miles of Retreat, it said. Retreat was particularly vulnerable to closing: Its original buildings date back to the 19th century, and it has the fewest beds of any of Pennsylvania’s 25 state prisons.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: Political, community and religious leaders are celebrating the life of Martin Luther King Jr. at the state’s annual commemoration of the civil rights leader. The public is invited to the event, beginning at 4 p.m. Monday at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Providence. Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo, U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse, and other elected leaders plan to attend. The Martin Luther King Jr. State Holiday Commission organizes the annual celebration. State Rep. Raymond Hull, a Providence Democrat, leads the commission and will serve as the master of ceremonies. Hull said Friday that with the turmoil in the nation today, it’s important to look back and reflect on what King stood for and how he brought people together to cure injustices. The commemoration includes speeches, awards and performances by the Ebenezer Baptist Church Choir and RPM Voices of Rhode Island.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nGreenville: A feature that has helped Furman University receive past honors as one of the most beautiful campuses in America has been taken away. Forty of the decades-old oak trees that lined Furman’s Mall have been cut down. They’ll be replaced with new species of oaks with life spans from 250 to more than 400 years: overcup, Nuttall’s, scarlet and swamp white, the university says. The nearly 70-year-old trees were starting to die, and limbs were starting to fall and become hazardous, according to Clinton Colmenares, spokesman for the university. Their removal is the latest phase in a multiyear project to replace original trees with better species that live longer and are just as big, Colmenares says. Furman broke ground on its current campus in 1953. The trees along the mall were planted between 1956 and 1958, the university says.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Gov. Kristi Noem was the sixth-most-unpopular governor in the country in the final months of 2019, according to the Morning Consult’s latest polling. Forty-five percent of South Dakotans surveyed disapproved of the job Noem was doing as governor, and 43% approved, while 12% said they didn’t know, according to the 2019 fourth-quarter governors poll released Thursday by Morning Consult, a research services company. The poll had a 3% margin of error. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Thune was among the top 10 most popular senators in the Morning Consult’s 2019 fourth-quarter poll. Thune had an approval rating of 52%, and U.S. Sen. Mike Rounds had an approval rating of 50%, with a 3% margin of error, according to Morning Consult. Both of their Morning Consult approval ratings have remained in the low- to mid-50s range throughout 2019.\n\nTennessee\n\nNashville: Gov. Bill Lee will introduce legislation this year that would amend a law requiring the state to honor Confederate General Nathan Bedford Forrest, an early leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Lee’s office confirmed Friday that the Republican, who has previously expressed his displeasure over the honor, was working on the bill. The office did not provide further details. According to the law in question, Tennessee governors must sign six proclamations throughout the year designating as days of special observance Robert E. Lee Day (Jan. 19), Abraham Lincoln Day (Feb. 12), Andrew Jackson Day (March 15), Confederate Decoration Day (June 3), Nathan Bedford Forrest Day (July 13) and Veterans Day (Nov. 11). Lee received national backlash in July when signed the Nathan Bedford Forrest proclamation and declined to answer questions about whether he thought the law should change. Lee later clarified that he didn’t like signing the proclamation and would prefer to see the law changed.\n\nTexas\n\nCorpus Christi: Demolition of the last of the city’s three Columbus ship replicas began Thursday morning despite efforts to raise funds for repairs. The demolition of the La Nina comes after the Columbus Sailing Association was unable to raise enough money to support the reconstruction of a new bottom and main deck. The ship is one of three Columbus ship replicas that first sailed to Corpus Christi in 1992 as part of Spain’s 500th anniversary of the “Voyage to the New World” celebration. La Pinta and La Santa Maria were too costly to repair. The association created a GoFundMe campaign in 2017 to raise $100,000 to fix the damaged La Nina. The fundraiser has raised $4,335.\n\nUtah\n\nSalt Lake City: About a third of the state’s registered voters are at risk of not being able to participate in March’s Super Tuesday presidential primary if they don’t request ballots. State and county election officials have been sending letters and trying to get the message out before it’s too late. This will be the first time Utah takes part in Super Tuesday, when 14 states vote, after lawmakers moved up the primary to make the state more relevant in the process. The state’s nearly 510,000 independent voters can request a ballot for the Republican or Democratic primary, but the process is slightly different. The Republican primary is closed, so voters who want to cast a ballot must return the form to become GOP registered voters by Feb. 3. The Democratic primary is open, so independent voters can get a ballot without registering with the party. They have until Feb. 25 to request the ballot if they intend to remain unaffiliated but need to send it in by Feb. 3 if they want to become a registered Democrat.\n\nVermont\n\nBurlington: State transportation officials said they are hopeful upgrades to the rail line between Rutland and Burlington can be ready sometime next year, which will make it possible to resume Amtrak rail service between the cities. Officials have been working for years to upgrade the 75 miles of rail and complete a number of other projects, such as station improvements and rail crossings. One of the major projects on the route, a new rail tunnel through downtown Middlebury, is slated for completion next year. Rutland Mayor David Allaire, who serves on the Governor’s Rail Advisory Council, said he was hopeful the line will be done by the end of next year, the Rutland Herald reports. Once the improvements are completed, officials plan to have Amtrak’s Ethan Allen Express, which now travels between New York City and Rutland, continue to Burlington.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: State officials and U.S. hate-monitoring groups are warning about the potential for violence ahead of a gun-rights rally expected to draw a mix of militias, firearms advocates and white supremacists to the city. Citing credible threats of violence, Gov. Ralph Northam declared a temporary state of emergency days ahead of Monday’s rally, banning all weapons, including guns, from Capitol Square. Virginia’s solicitor general last week said law enforcement had identified “credible evidence” that armed out-of-state groups planned to come to Virginia with the possible intention of participating in a “violent insurrection.” Online, threats of violence have been “rampant” among anti-government and far-right groups, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks white supremacists and other extremists. Conspiracy theories and other misinformation have also proliferated.\n\nWashington\n\nNewhalem: The National Park Service is investigating the desecration of an archaeological site in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex, and the Upper Skagit Indian Tribe is hoping to bring those responsible to justice. The Skagit Valley Herald reports evidence of digging was found over the summer at the Newhalem Rock Shelter camp used by the ancestors of the Upper Skagit tribe. “We were shocked and dismayed that someone would do something like this at a cultural site,” the tribe’s Natural Resources Director Scott Schuyler said. “Some of these places are thousands of years old, and the fact that someone would want to come in and purposely destroy, damage or steal, it’s just unbelievable.” The tribe is working with the Park Service on the investigation and offering a $5,000 reward for information that leads to those responsible.\n\nWest Virginia\n\nRipley: Health officials are hoping a new initiative will help Jackson County residents quickly inform first responders about their medical conditions. WCHS-TV reports the Jackson County Health Department is offering free seat belt covers that will display personal and medical information that first responders can use during a car crash or other emergency situations. Known as “Medical Seat Belt Safety Days,” the county will provide the free covers March 26-27. People interested should bring their medical insurance information and a list of medications they currently take. Car seat safety checks also will be provided during that time at no charge.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMilwaukee: Much of the west side of downtown and some areas east of the Milwaukee River will be inside a security zone during next summer’s Democratic National Convention, officials announced Friday. Police Chief Alfonso Morales said every resident and business in the zone will have access to their property. The main inconvenience for residents will be travel times, officials said. It’s still not known which part of downtown will be behind barriers or fences. Officials said they have outlined a broad security footprint, and the small, more restricted area should be announced later. The main convention venues include Fiserv Forum, UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena, Miller High Life Theatre and the Wisconsin Center.\n\nWyoming\n\nJackson: State wildlife managers are criticizing plans by Grand Teton National Park to shoot nonnative mountain goats by helicopter. Inclement weather has so far prevented the aerial gunning, though park officials recently closed off a wide area of the Teton Range where shooting is to occur. “Having government personnel kill mountain goats from helicopters and leaving them to rot and be wasted is unacceptable,” Wyoming Game and Fish Commission President David Rael wrote to acting park Superintendent Gopaul Noojibail in a recent letter. The commission last week approved a resolution opposing the plans, favoring the use of volunteers to hunt the goats on the ground. The governor-appointed commission sets official policies and procedures for wildlife management, including hunting seasons and quotas, across Wyoming.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/20"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/50-states/2020/01/31/mammoth-cave-sharks-waterfall-chasing-valentines-divorce-news-around-states/41114873/", "title": "Mammoth Cave sharks, waterfall chasing: News from around our 50 ...", "text": "From USA TODAY Network and wire reports\n\nAlabama\n\nMontgomery: Gov. Kay Ivey fractured her shoulder after being tripped by the state’s “first dog,” her office said Wednesday. Ivey spokeswoman Gina Maiola said the governor is in an arm sling after being tripped by her mixed-breed dog named Missy. The rescue pooch unintentionally tripped the governor at home Tuesday night, Ivey’s office said. The 75-year-old Republican governor issued a statement about the injury, saying, “You’ll see me in a sling, but this won’t slow me down one bit.” “I’ll keep you posted on the recovery, but most importantly, Missy is also doing just fine.” Ivey is scheduled to deliver Alabama’s annual State of the State address Tuesday night to mark the opening of the legislative session. Last year, the governor announced she had been diagnosed with early-stage lung cancer and was being treated with radiation. Her office said in January that medical scans showed a good response to treatment and that her doctor considered her cured.\n\nAlaska\n\nAnchorage: State officials have forecast poor returns for Kenai River king salmon in the upcoming spring and summer fishing season. The Alaska Department of Fish and Game released the estimates Monday. This year’s forecast of salmon during the early run through June 30 is just 4,794 large fish, which would rank as the eighth-lowest return in the past 35 years but higher than last year’s run of 4,216 fish, state biologists said. The department classifies large fish as those greater than 34 inches in length. The average return over the past 35 years is more than 9,100 king salmon in the early run. The department predicts a similar result – 22,707 large king salmon – during the late run that lasts through August. The return would be about 60% larger than last year’s escapement of just 12,780 fish, which failed to meet the department’s sustainable escapement goal of 13,500 to 27,000 fish.\n\nArizona\n\nSupai: Reservations to hike to the idyllic green waters of Havasupai Falls don’t come easy. Those who hope to reserve a 2020 hiking permit and campground reservation when they go on sale at 8 a.m. Saturday can take some steps in advance to improve their odds of getting one of the 350 spots available each day. Hopeful hikers can make an account at havasupaireservations.com and pre-enter credit card information to save time when the permits go on sale. Phone reservations are not accepted. Available trip dates start March 1, and it’s best to have a first choice and a few backup dates in mind before sales begin. Last year, the reservations were mostly gone within five hours of going on sale. New this year, reservation-holders can list potential alternative trip leaders beforehand to make it possible to transfer a reservation to someone on that list free of charge.\n\nArkansas\n\nWest Memphis: A casino has debuted sports betting in its soft opening this week, officials said. Southland Casino Racing began accepting wagers Tuesday for the upcoming Super Bowl, as well as on NBA games, college basketball, NASCAR racing, PGA tournaments and more, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reports. Approved by voters in November 2018, Amendment 100 to the state Constitution authorized Southland Casino Racing to expand into a full-fledged casino. It is the third Arkansas casino to win the commission’s approval to begin sports wagering. “We have been working toward this for a while,” said Jeff Strang, Southland’s senior marketing director. International Game Technology announced Tuesday that it signed a multistate sports betting agreement with Southland’s parent company – Delaware North Cos. Gaming and Entertainment – to power retail sports betting in Arkansas and West Virginia.\n\nCalifornia\n\nCalexico: Strong winds gusting across Southern California blew down several panels of a new barrier being installed along the U.S.-Mexico border, a newspaper reports. The U.S. Border Patrol said the panels fell into Mexican territory Wednesday about 100 miles east of San Diego where the border runs between the U.S. city of Calexico and the Mexican city of Mexicali, the San Diego Union-Tribune reports. The 30-foot-tall panels had just been anchored in concrete that had not yet cured when the gusts hit, the newspaper says. The panels fell onto a road. “Luckily, Mexican authorities responded quickly and were able to divert traffic from the nearby street,” U.S. Border Patrol Agent Carlos Pitones said. U.S. Customs and Border Protection was working to retrieve the panels from Mexico, the Union-Tribune reports.\n\nColorado\n\nDenver: The state has launched two pilot programs focused on reducing carbon emissions and improving energy efficiency at cannabis cultivating businesses, officials said. The programs started Wednesday and support Democratic Gov. Jared Polis’ mission to cut greenhouse gases 50% by 2030, The Denver Post reports. The Carbon Dioxide Reuse Project partners Denver Beer Co. with the Clinic cannabis dispensary to recycle carbon emissions. Denver Beer Co. plans to use a a carbon-capturing machine to provide carbon dioxide produced during the brewing process to the clinic, which will use the gas to stimulate plant growth. The brewery expects to recycle more than 150,000 pounds of carbon dioxide – enough to meet all the clinic’s needs, Earthly Labs CEO Amy George says. The Colorado Cultivators Energy Management pilot will enable cannabis businesses to enlist the help of local electric cooperatives and utility companies to examine their energy use and ways to become more efficient.\n\nConnecticut\n\nHartford: A Rembrandt portrait that hasn’t been exhibited in the U.S. in more than half a century is coming to a local museum starting this weekend. “Titus in a Monk’s Habit” will be on exhibit at Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford from Saturday through April 30, the museum said in a statement. The portrait depicts the Dutch artist’s teenage son in 1660. It’s on loan from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam. Rembrandt van Rijn created the artwork “at a crucial moment in his late career when he was revamping his business as a painter and recovering from bankruptcy,” the museum said. “It opens questions about the artist’s career, his use of traditional subjects and the bold technique that has won him enduring fame,” Oliver Tostmann, curator of European art, said in a statement. “With his son in the role of a poor monk, it is a heart-wrenching interpretation of the human condition and an echo of the family’s humbled economic state.”\n\nDelaware\n\nNewark: A University of Delaware program that starts this fall will allow high school students to get an early start on their college studies. The Early College Credit Program will be free and open to juniors and seniors in all 74 public, charter and private high schools throughout the state, the Delaware State News reports. The introductory courses – which will be in subjects such as astronomy, philosophy, art history and more – will be transmitted via video from UD’s Newark campus and streamed to the students’ high schools. The high school students will be enrolled alongside college students. “One of the things we are excited about with this new program is that high school students have the opportunity to interact with regular undergraduates on campus, virtually,” says Lynn Okagki, deputy provost for academic affairs at the university. Participation will allow students to earn both high school and college credits.\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\nWashington: Attorney General William Barr on Thursday nominated Timothy Shea, one of his closest advisers, to be the next top prosecutor in the nation’s capital. Shea will lead the largest United States attorney’s office in the country, one that has been historically responsible for some of the most significant and politically sensitive cases the Justice Department brings in the U.S. He is a senior counselor to the attorney general and was Barr’s right-hand man helping institute reforms at the federal Bureau of Prisons after Jeffrey Epstein’s death at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City. As the U.S. attorney in the District of Columbia, Shea would oversee some of the lingering cases from special counsel Robert Mueller’s Russia investigation, along with a number of politically charged investigations.\n\nFlorida\n\nTallahassee: Cities and counties wouldn’t be able to ban sunscreens containing ingredients that some researchers say harm coral reefs, under a bill passed by the state Senate on Wednesday. The Senate voted 25-14 in favor of the bill after no discussion or debate. If it becomes law, a Key West ordinance to ban the sale of sunscreens containing oxybenzone or octinoxate would be nullified. The Key West ban is set to go into effect next year. Research has shown the chemicals can cause coral bleaching, and the reefs around Key West attract divers, snorkelers and fishing enthusiasts. But Republican Sen. Rob Bradley has said previously that he sponsored the bill because protecting people is more important, and the research hasn’t proven the chemicals actually harm reefs. An identical House bill has been making its way through committees.\n\nGeorgia\n\nAtlanta: After trying last year to place restrictions on electric scooters all across Georgia, a state Senate committee now wants the state to keep its hands off. The Senate Transportation Committee on Tuesday unanimously approved a new version of Senate Bill 159, which would define electric scooters in state law. But it would do nothing else, leaving other regulations up to local governments. State Sen. Steve Gooch, a Dahlonega Republican, told committee members Tuesday that’s how the scooter companies and local governments both want it. “Local governments should be doing backflips and cartwheels,” Gooch said. “They’re getting everything they asked for.” The cities of Atlanta, Brookhaven and Decatur have authorized scooters, as has Georgia Southern University. But a Senate study committee report filed last year found 12 other cities had banned or placed temporary moratoriums on scooters.\n\nHawaii\n\nHilo: Thurston Lava Tube in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park could reopen within a month if a final repair project is successful, an official said. A park spokeswoman said the tube will be reopened to the public after a nearby restroom facility is restored to working order, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Thurston Lava Tube was one of several attractions at the park that were closed indefinitely after the Kilauea volcanic eruption, which began in May 2018 and destroyed more than 700 homes on the Big Island. Also called Nahuku, the lava tube remained closed after Hawaii Volcanoes National Park reopened in September 2018. Scientists and engineers wanted to confirm the tube was structurally sound after thousands of earthquakes rattled the park during the eruption. The park must repair and bury an electrical line, which could take two to four weeks, spokeswoman Jessica Ferracane said.\n\nIdaho\n\nBoise: The state’s prisons are overcrowded and dilapidated, the inmate population is rapidly growing, and taxpayers could save millions by building a prison, state auditors told a panel of lawmakers this week. The findings came from the Office of Performance Evaluations’ report on managing the state’s correctional capacity, which took a close look at staffing levels, inmate populations, the condition of the actual prison buildings themselves and how those factors will likely affect Idaho in years to come. “Idaho is at a critical juncture in planning how it will house inmates,” an office evaluator, Lance McCleve, told members of the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee. “Just since 2016, we’ve seen about an 18% increase of inmates incarcerated in prisons.” That dramatically outpaces the state’s population growth of about 6% in the same period, McCleve said.\n\nIllinois\n\nChicago: Elections officials disclosed fresh problems Wednesday with the state’s automatic voter registration program, including at least one eligible voter who said she registered to vote but ended up on an opt-out list. The program is already under fire for mistakenly registering more than 500 people who indicated they weren’t U.S. citizens, of whom 15 people voted in 2018 and 2019 elections. Election officials said at least eight of the people have long voting histories and were likely U.S. citizens, leaving seven voters in question. The individuals involved were applying for standard driver’s licenses at secretary of state’s offices. Details were scarce on the new issues, disclosed at a State Board of Elections meeting. Brenda Glahn, an attorney with the secretary of state, said registrations of eligible voters who appeared to decline to be registered were still sent to election officials.\n\nIndiana\n\nMuncie: Hundreds of Ball State University students gathered for a rally to demand the early retirement of a white professor who called police on a black student who refused to change seats last week during a class. A crowd of 200 to 300 students, some carrying protest signs, converged Tuesday outside the Whitinger Business Building. It’s where Sultan “Mufasa” Benson, a senior business-administration major, left marketing professor Shaheen Borna’s class after the tenured faculty member called police on him. Benson, who is from Chicago, recounted how he felt when Borna asked him to move to the front row from the back of the class. “Why am I being moved?” Benson said he asked the Iranian-born professor. “No answer. ‘You can move or we can call the police.’ ” Though Benson said he feels like “another statistic” that Ball State is using to advertise its black student enrollment, he thanked school President Geoffrey S. Mearns for attending the rally and listening to them.\n\nIowa\n\nDes Moines: A bill proposed by a group of Republican lawmakers that would have amended the Iowa Civil Rights Act by removing protections against discrimination for transgender people is dead, a powerful committee chairman said. Nine Republican House members sponsoring the bill introduced it Wednesday morning, but by evening Republican Rep. Steven Holt, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee to which the bill was assigned, said he wouldn’t allow it to move forward to a subcommittee hearing. “It’s dead,” Holt said. “It just would have had a lot of unintended consequences.” Iowa law currently prohibits discrimination based on gender identity, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, religion, ancestry and disability. Gender identity was added in 2007 when Democrats regained control of the Legislature and held the governor’s office with the election of Gov. Chet Culver.\n\nKansas\n\nWichita: The Kansas Highway Patrol has a practice of unlawfully targeting motorists based on their out-of-state license plates or Colorado travel plans, due to that state’s legalization of marijuana, according to a federal court filing Thursday. Among the allegations contained in the new filing are statistics showing that drivers with out-of-state plates made up 93% of all the agency’s traffic stops in 2017. The case began as a hand-scrawled complaint filed last December by two irate drivers themselves in federal court. It got some significant legal firepower when the American Civil Liberties Union and Kansas City, Missouri, attorney Sam Diederich filed an amended complaint on their behalf. The revised complaint references a serious imbalance in people of color in targeted vehicles. It also challenges a law enforcement practice known as “the Kansas Two Step,” a maneuver used to detain drivers for canine drug searches after a traffic stop.\n\nKentucky\n\nMammoth Cave National Park: Paleontologists have found remarkably intact fossils from ancient sharks in Mammoth Cave. The discovery hundreds of millions of years in the making began when Mammoth Cave specialists Rick Olson and Rick Toomey came across fossils as they explored and mapped the cave system and sent photos to Vincent Santucci, senior paleontologist for the National Park Service in Washington, D.C., for help identifying them. Santucci then sent John-Paul Hodnett, a paleontologist and program coordinator at Dinosaur Park in Maryland, to help with what became the Mammoth Cave National Park Fossil Shark Research Project. The fossils were parts of a head that belonged to a Saivodus striatus shark, about the size of a great white. Thanks to the slow erosion of the limestone in the cave, the shark’s teeth are mostly intact and extremely detailed. More than 100 individual specimens have been discovered so far during the project.\n\nLouisiana\n\nBaton Rouge: The state’s new legislative leaders quickly signed off Thursday on plans to borrow up to $350 million to replenish the account that pays for state-financed construction work, the first major financial decision for the latest House and Senate term. The Bond Commission, a panel of state officials that oversees publicly financed construction spending, agreed to the March general obligation bond sale without objection. The proposal provoked no discussion from the House’s and Senate’s new budget and tax committee chairmen, sitting on the panel for the first time in their new roles. The borrowing will keep cash flowing to a long list of projects, including coastal restoration work, state park improvements, road and bridge projects, college building repairs and local projects favored by lawmakers.\n\nMaine\n\nAugusta: Maine lobsters need to arrive alive at their destinations, and a proposal before the Legislature is aimed at making it more certain that happens. Democratic Sen. Eloise Vitelli of Arrowsic has introduced a bill that would exempt truck drivers transporting live lobsters from some hours-of-service restrictions. Vitelli said the proposal would extend an exemption already granted to transporters of potatoes, broccoli and livestock. “Getting lobsters quickly to market in Boston is essential for Maine lobster dealers to maintain and grow this iconic industry,” Vitelli said. Vitelli introduced the bill Tuesday, and it will face votes in committee before moving on to the full state Senate and House of Representatives. Virginia Olsen, a lobster fisherman from Stonington and board member of the Maine Lobstering Union, said members of the industry are at “an economic disadvantage when trying to bring our live product to market under the current time restraints.”\n\nMaryland\n\nBaltimore: A rarely open U.S. House seat has drawn a crowded field of 24 Democrats and eight Republicans in a special primary for the office held by the late Rep. Elijah Cummings. Candidates in the majority-black district’s Tuesday primary include Cummings’ widow, Maya Rockeymoore Cummings; and Kweisi Mfume, a former NAACP head and one of three men who’ve held the seat in the past 49 years. Republicans on the ballot include Kimberly Klacik, an activist whose social media video of trash and run-down buildings in Baltimore caught President Donald Trump’s attention before he described the district in a tweet as a “rodent-infested mess.” Mfume, who stepped down in 1996 to lead the NAACP after serving five terms as a congressman, is telling voters in the heavily Democratic district his experience separates him from the crowd.\n\nMassachusetts\n\nBoston: The state is pushing ahead with efforts to amend the U.S. Constitution to restore limits on political spending by corporations. A commission charged with weighing potential constitutional amendments aimed at countering the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision released an interim report Wednesday updating its progress. Members of the Massachusetts Citizens Commission said the goal of the amendment would be to give Congress and states the power “to regulate contributions and expenditures in our federal, state, and local elections to secure the free speech and representation rights of all Americans, combat corruption and protect the integrity of elections.” A ballot question approved by Massachusetts voters in 2018 created the commission. The report pointed to a sharp rise in spending in elections, most concentrated in the hands of a small slice of the electorate, the commission said.\n\nMichigan\n\nDetroit: Marie Woo, who’s earned a reputation as “the potter’s potter” and as an educator, researcher and curator who’s played a major role in spreading awareness of Chinese folk pottery, was announced Thursday as the 2020 Kresge Eminent Artist. The lifetime achievement award, which comes with a $50,000 prize, is given annually to a metro Detroiter for distinguished contributions to the arts and the community. Known both for her mastery of clay and her continuing commitment to experimentation and innovation, Woo, 91, joins 11 other past winners. It’s a collection of Detroit luminaries that includes the late jazz trumpeter Marcus Belgrave, photographer and activist Leni Sinclair, painter and sculptor Charles McGee, and the late Michigan Opera Theatre’s artistic director David DiChiera. Woo is the first Kresge Eminent Artist to represent the art of ceramics.\n\nMinnesota\n\nLonsdale: A local Roman Catholic priest apologized Wednesday for saying in a sermon that Islam was “the greatest threat in the world” to the United States and Christianity. The Rev. Nick VanDenBroeke apologized in a statement issued by the St. Paul-Minnesota Catholic archdiocese. He had made the comments in a Jan. 5 sermon at the Lonsdale church where he serves as pastor. The Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a civil rights group, had called on the state’s Roman Catholic church leaders to repudiate the sermon after the newspaper City Pages published an article about the sermon. In the statement from the archdiocese, Archbishop Bernard Hebda said the church’s teaching is clear, and he quoted Pope Benedict XVI as saying the church looks with esteem to Muslims, who worship God through prayer, fasting and the giving of alms.\n\nMississippi\n\nJackson: A proposal to give most teachers at least a $1,000 pay raise is starting to move forward at the state Capitol. The plan won approval Thursday in the Senate Education Committee. It will go to the Senate Appropriations Committee another day, and it must pass there before it can go to the full Senate. Senate Bill 2001 would give $1,000 across-the-board raises to most teachers and teachers’ assistants. Teachers in the first two years of their careers would receive slightly larger raises of $1,100. That’s an effort to boost the beginning salaries. Mississippi has long had some of the lowest teacher salaries in the nation. Republican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and several other officials said during the 2019 campaign that increasing teacher pay would be a priority this year.\n\nMissouri\n\nJefferson City: Republican state senators put forth a new plan Wednesday that would scrap “partisan fairness” and “competitiveness” from the criteria used to draw state House and Senate districts – reversing a key part of a ballot initiative approved by voters just two years ago. Senators began debating the newly proposed constitutional amendment Wednesday. If approved by the Legislature, it would go to a public vote later this year. In addition to changing the redistricting criteria, it also would abolish a voter-approved state demographer position to draw districts and return the task to a bipartisan commission used in the past. Like the successful “Clean Missouri” initiative on the 2018 ballot, the new GOP proposal would package the redistricting changes with other potentially popular ethics reforms. “If you like Clean Missouri, you’re going to love Cleaner Missouri,” said Sen. Denny Hoskins, a Republican from Warrensburg.\n\nMontana\n\nGreat Falls: Little Shell Tribe of Chippewa Indians Chairman Gerald Gray will be Sen. Jon Tester’s guest of honor at the State of the Union address Tuesday. “I’ve worked with many leaders in the Little Shell Tribe over the past 20 years, and Chairman Gray is right up there at the top,” Tester, D-Mont., said Thursday in a news release. “He is a relentless advocate for his people who built strong coalitions but wasn’t shy about putting the screws to me and the rest of the delegation when he needed to.” Gray said that he was “grateful” to be invited and that Tester “was so instrumental in the restoration of my tribe’s federal recognition.” Each senator is allowed one guest. After more than 100 years of efforts by the tribe, federal recognition was signed into law Dec. 20 as a part of the National Defense Authorization Act. The Little Shell Tribe is based in Great Falls and has nearly 5,400 members.\n\nNebraska\n\nLincoln: Families in the state who want access to high-quality child care may be out of luck depending on where they live or how much they make, according to a report released Thursday. The Nebraska Early Childhood Workforce Commission’s report found access to child care varies widely, with 11 of the state’s 93 counties having no licensed child care facilities. The report also found a high turnover rate among early childhood care providers, driven in part by low pay. The median wage for early childhood professionals teaching in community-based child care centers was $18,706 in 2016, according to the report. That’s nearly $1,400 below the federal poverty line for a family of three. The commission is a part of the Buffett Early Childhood Institute at the University of Nebraska.\n\nNevada\n\nLas Vegas: McCarran International Airport says a jump in the number of travelers in December pushed it to a record 51.5 million passengers in 2019. An airport year-end report made public Wednesday came more than a month after officials held a ceremony marking the arrival of a record 50 millionth passenger in one year. The previous 12-month record was 49.7 million in 2018. The Clark County Department of Aviation counted nearly 4.25 million arriving and departing passengers in December, up 9% from the same month in 2018. Airport chief Rosemary Vassiliadis said domestic passenger volume grew 3.9% for the year, with big increases by low-cost carriers Sun Country, Frontier and Spirit airlines. Southwest Airlines is by far the busiest airline, accounting for more than 17 million passengers last year. But the airline was down 3.7% from its total of more than 18 million in 2018.\n\nNew Hampshire\n\nConcord: The state Senate on Thursday gave preliminary approval to a bill to establish and then gradually increase the minimum wage. The state currently defaults to the federal minimum wage of $7.25. Lawmakers last year approved the creation of a state minimum wage, but Republican Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed it. The vote Thursday in the Democrat-led Senate was 14-10 to raise the state minimum wage to $10 an hour in 2021 and $12 an hour in 2023. Supporters noted that New Hampshire continues to fall behind its New England neighbors. On Jan. 1, Vermont, Maine, and Massachusetts all raised their minimum wages. Opponents said the bill would push small businesses to reduce hours and increase automation of jobs.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nTrenton: Nine hospitals in areas with some of the state’s highest rates of shootings will share $20million in an intervention program designed to reduce violence, particularly related to guns. The distribution of federal money is a nationally unique approach to “disrupt the cycle of violence,” Attorney General Gurbir Grewal said. New Jersey is now making the biggest investment of federal Victims of Crime Act funding for such a program, he said. “This is not a garden variety, ‘Every state’s doing this,’ ” Gov. Phil Murphy said. “We’re the only state doing this.” The money will help establish “hospital-based violence intervention programs” to support victims but also try to prevent future incidents. The idea is to intervene at a crucial moment in an individual’s life – after being shot, for example – and provide services such as counseling, case management or even removing a tattoo that could be used to identify them for retaliation.\n\nNew Mexico\n\nSanta Fe: Legislators could receive state salaries for the first time as the result of a newly proposed constitutional amendment. A panel of legislators led by state Democratic Sen. Linda Lopez of Albuquerque endorsed the proposed constitutional amendment Wednesday that would give the recently founded State Ethics Commission authority to set salaries for lawmakers and other elected official including the governor. New Mexico runs the only unsalaried legislature in the nation, though members receive a $162 daily stipend during sessions and reimbursement for some travel expenses. Amendment sponsor Sen. Daniel Ivey-Soto, an Albuquerque Democrat, said that handing over salary decisions to the ethics commission would depoliticize the matter and avoid the taboo against lawmakers approving their own pay.\n\nNew York\n\nAlbany: The state has set some of the nation’s most ambitious goals on fighting climate change, but some activists say it isn’t moving fast enough. Lawmakers holding budget hearings this week faced protests from environmental and left-leaning groups who criticized the lack of new solar and wind projects breaking ground in the state. Protesters filled rows at a hearing to call for the state to do more to boost electric vehicles and energy efficiency and block construction of infrastructure for natural gas, which contributes to global warming. “Six months ago, Gov. Cuomo signed the nation’s most aggressive climate legislation, promising that New York would ‘lead the way forward’ and ‘set a new standard,’ ” said Conor Bambrick, director of climate policy for the environmental group Clean Water for Environmental Advocates of New York. But New York needs to do much more to match the “urgency of the climate crisis,” he said.\n\nNorth Carolina\n\nCharlotte: A car dealer is opening up his sales lot to homeless people whose cars are their only means of shelter. James Charles made the move after a member of his sales team went to repossess a woman’s car, WBTV reports. “The gentleman who was repossessing the car said, ‘We can’t take the car, there’s somebody living in the car,’ ” said Charles, manager at Kiplin Automotive Group in west Charlotte. Charles said he looked for a shelter for the woman, but all of them were full. So he put her up in a hotel for a few nights, until she had a more permanent solution. That, Charles said, was the sign he needed to launch his plan. His dealership now offers space for other families, with security cameras, bright lights and an open invitation. “You can come here,” Charles said. “We will allow you to stay on our property, and of course, we’re going to help you find a place if we can.”\n\nNorth Dakota\n\nBismarck: The state should reinvest half of the earnings from its voter-approved oil tax savings account to grow the fund’s principal by billions more dollars over the next decade, Gov. Doug Burgum said Wednesday in his State of the State speech. The state is “strong, growing and full of boundless opportunity,” but “there’s a lot more we can do,” the first-term Republican said during his nearly two-hour speech at the University of North Dakota in Grand Forks. Burgum’s speech was somewhat unscripted and largely fell short on policy specifics, including his plan to spend earnings from the state’s Legacy Fund, which voters enacted in 2010. How and when earnings from the fund should be spent has long been point of contention even among Republicans in the GOP-led Legislature.\n\nOhio\n\nColumbus: The nation’s oldest civil rights organization has endorsed a ballot initiative aimed at streamlining the state’s voting process. The NAACP’s Ohio Conference announced its backing for the Ohioans for Secure and Fair Elections measure Wednesday. In a statement, conference president Tom Roberts said the NAACP sees the campaign as “a necessary step” to modernizing Ohio elections. If voters approve the proposal, Ohioans would be automatically registered to vote when conducting business at state Bureau of Motor Vehicles offices, and early voting locations would have to be open on the two weekends prior to Election Day. That would allow eligible voters to register and vote on the same day. The requirement that voters be registered during BMV trips unless they opt out is also part of pending House and Senate legislation.\n\nOklahoma\n\nOklahoma City: The body of a woman found in central Oklahoma nearly 40 years ago and known only as “Lime Lady” has been identified as a missing Las Vegas woman, authorities said Thursday. DNA testing with the help of the DNA Doe Project identified Tamara Lee Tigard as the woman whose body was found April 18, 1980, on the banks of the North Canadian River in Jones on the outskirts of Oklahoma City. Tigard, who was shot to death, was found on what would have been her 21st birthday, Oklahoma County Sheriff’s Capt. Bob Green said. Tigard was known for decades only as “Lime Lady” because her body had been covered in lime in a possible attempt to destroy it, but instead the lime helped preserve her remains. It is not known how long she was in Oklahoma, according to Sheriff P.D. Taylor. Investigators have also determined she was in the U.S. military, serving in the Army, Green said.\n\nOregon\n\nSalem: Democrats in the Statehouse are seeking to have voters change its quorum rules so that walkouts by lawmakers can no longer stymie legislation. The joint resolution, filed this week before the Legislature starts its short 2020 session Monday, would ask voters to change quorum rules, allowing the Statehouse to convene with only a simple majority of lawmakers present instead of the current two-thirds requirement. Senate Democrats say all but three other states require a simple majority for a quorum. Senate Majority Leader Ginny Burdick, a Democrat from Portland, had been expected to introduce the proposed constitutional amendment. “Stopping the work of the people by denying a quorum is unconscionable and undemocratic,” Burdick said last year. If the Legislature approves the resolution, voters would then decide on the proposed change in the 2020 election.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nHarrisburg: A $45 million project to upgrade the state’s emergency radio communications system is on time and within the budget, but the purchasing process has encountered some glitches, the state auditor general said Thursday. A report released by Democratic Auditor General Eugene DePasquale identified errors in the bidding process but concluded they would not have changed the 2016 contract award. It also said there was inadequate documentation about the qualifications of people involved in awarding the contract. The statewide radio project, known as PA STARNet, began with a $179 million expenditure in 1996 that developed into a massive boondoggle, eventually costing the state more than $850 million. It produced a system that was badly flawed, with poor reception, software problems, short battery life and reliability shortcomings.\n\nRhode Island\n\nProvidence: The state Department of Correction is failing to comply with a court order limiting the time an inmate can be held in solitary confinement to 30 days, a federal judge ruled. U.S. District Court Chief Judge John McConnell faulted the department for not seeking court approval after an inmate serving life was held in disciplinary segregation for 60 days in 2014, the Providence Journal reports. McConnell ruled the department “unilaterally and substantively” changed the so-called Morris Rules in 2005, when it instituted a policy that prisoners could be held in disciplinary segregation for 31 days to a year on a single offense. The judge’s ruling received praise from the American Civil Liberties Union in Rhode Island, which agreed to represent the inmate and others who find themselves in similar situations in the future.\n\nSouth Carolina\n\nColumbia: A bill that would bar anyone using a cellphone while driving from holding the phone in their hands appears to be dead for the year. The Senate Transportation Committee decided Wednesday not to vote on the bill. It could still come up later in the session, but often that action sends a bill into a limbo from which it does not return. The bill would require anyone making a cellphone call to use a Bluetooth device or have the phone in a dock and use the speaker. It does not prohibit one swipe to get the function to work. Text by voice would also be legal if the phone isn’t held. Opponents of the bill said the state already has a distracted driving law. Supporters said that usually only kicks in after a crash, and the bill would prevent wrecks. The House has passed a similar bill, and sponsor Rep. Bill Taylor said he thinks if the Senate ever gets on board, it can become law.\n\nSouth Dakota\n\nPierre: Proponents of creating schools focused on Native American language and culture have two weeks to rework their proposal after Gov. Kristi Noem opposed the initiative. A state Senate committee on Thursday deferred a bill that would create Oceti Sakowin schools that teach Lakota, Dakota and Nakota language and culture. Several teachers are trying to open schools in Native American communities that would attempt to address educational achievement gaps among Native American students. “I see a system that isn’t working, and we’re looking for something that is working,” said Sage Fast Dog, an educator who is planning to open a school on the Rosebud Indian Reservation. Parents testified about how children had struggled with their identity after facing teachers and schoolmates who were insensitive to the culture of the Oceti Sakowin, which is commonly known as Sioux.\n\nTennessee\n\nMurfreesboro: An attorney is giving away free divorce representation to one client for Valentine’s Day. W. Scott Kimberly said in a news release that for many people Valentine’s Day is “another reminder that they remain trapped in a relationship that they cannot leave because of financial problems, because of a spouse who refuses to agree to a divorce, or for some other reason.” This is the third year the Murfreesboro divorce attorney will give away his services. Last year, Kimberly selected two winners, saying he had a hard time narrowing down the entries. Applicants are asked to share the story of why they want a divorce. Applications are accepted through Valentine’s Day, with a winner selected on Feb. 17. Although Kimberly won’t charge for his services, the winner will be responsible for court costs and filing fees. “This giveaway is a chance to help someone move on with their life,” Kimberly said.\n\nTexas\n\nAustin: A state historical review panel delayed a vote this week on whether to move the Alamo Cenotaph, a memorial to the 200 Alamo defenders killed by the Mexican army in an 1836 assault during the war for Texas independence. The Texas Historical Commission put off its vote for at least two months, saying commissioners want more information on where the monument might be moved and what restoration work it may need. It’s a key piece in a major renovation of the Alamo. The 58-foot-tall marble slab has been a focal feature of Alamo Plaza in downtown San Antonio since 1939. Planners of a $450 million Alamo renovation project have proposed moving the monument to a place about 500 feet to the south of its longtime home, a proposal that has drawn fierce opposition from descendants of the Alamo’s 1836 defenders.\n\nUtah\n\nSpringdale: Against the towering, red cliffs of Zion National Park, Provo native band The National Parks will be holding their first music festival April25. The indie-pop band says the Superbloom Music Festival will be held at the O.C. Tanner Amphitheater in Springdale. The National Parks will headline, and other local Utah and West-based bands will perform as well – Joshua James, The Strike, Tow’rs, The Federal Empire, Ellee Duke and Brother. The National Parks lead vocalist and guitarist Brady Parks said many of the bands and artists performing at the festival are people he’s been friends with and fans of for a long time. “Zion holds a special place in our heart,” Parks said. The festival will be an all-day “destination” event, he said. Local vendors and food trucks will be at the festival, and a VIP campfire concert will be held nearby the night before. Tickets are on sale now.\n\nVermont\n\nMontpelier: State legislators are reviewing a bill that would ensure rights for the homeless. The House bill would seek to establish “a homeless bill of rights and prohibiting discrimination against people without homes,” the Times Argus reports. Rep. Tom Stevens, a Democrat, has twice submitted the bill since 2017 to the House General, Housing and Military Affairs Committee, without it being approved. The bill’s intent is to ensure that no person would be subject to civil or criminal sanctions “for soliciting, sharing, accepting or offering food, water, money or other donations in public places.” Under the bill’s provisions, an aggrieved person would also have the right to petition in civil court for appropriate relief against damages suffered and costs incurred as a result of violations of their rights. The resolution notes that a count of the state’s homeless population last January found 1,089 lack secure housing, 23% of whom are children.\n\nVirginia\n\nRichmond: Democrats in the state House are advancing a package of gun-control measures they say are needed to improve public safety. The new Democratic majority in the House voted Wednesday to advance a package of gun measures over vocal opposition from Republicans, who said the measures infringe on law-abiding gun owners’ rights. The bills include limiting handgun purchases to once a month; universal background checks on gun purchases; allowing localities to ban guns in certain areas; and a red flag bill that would allow authorities to temporarily take guns away from anyone deemed to be dangerous to themselves or others. A final vote is expected Thursday to pass the measures and then send them to the Senate, which has already passed its own versions gun-control bills. So far neither chamber has approved a proposed assault weapon ban, a top priority for Gov. Ralph Northam and one that’s drawn fierce resistance from gun-rights advocates.\n\nWashington\n\nOlympia: Republican state legislators have introduced a bill – which includes a pilot hatchery project in Bellingham – that they believe will help increase the salmon population and help the orca whales. The Bellingham Herald reports the Salmon Repopulation Act, Senate Bill 6509 and House Bill 2741 were recently introduced and referred to committees. The bills would attempt to bring a public-partnership in state-approved hatcheries and potentially build a new hatchery on Bellingham’s waterfront. In a news conference in Olympia on Tuesday, several GOP legislators talked about the need for this public-private model to get more fish in local waters. “This is about acting now for the orca,” said Sen. Ann Rivers, R-La Center. “What the orca need more than anything else is food to eat, and we can’t wait on this.”\n\nWest Virginia\n\nCharleston: State officials are trying to find someone interested in preserving a historic bridge connecting West Virginia and Ohio. The Aetnaville Bridge, also known as the Georgia Street Bridge, was built in 1891. It lies over the back channel of the Ohio River from Wheeling Island, West Virginia, to Martins Ferry, Ohio. The bridge was originally part of the streetcar system in Wheeling and later converted to a toll road for automobile traffic. It became toll-free in 1953 and was part of U.S. 252 until it was closed in 1988 due to deterioration. Anyone interested in the bridge must submit a preservation and financial plan as well as information about the intended use of the bridge, the Division of Highways said in a news release. If no one is interested, the bridge will be demolished, the agency said. Requests to assume ownership of the bridge must be submitted by April 15.\n\nWisconsin\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers signed an executive order Wednesday creating a task force on student debt, fulfilling a pledge he made during his State of the State address last week. The task force will consist of a number of state officials or their designee, including the governor, the state schools superintendent, and the presidents of the University of Wisconsin System and the Wisconsin Technical College System, according to the order. Two state senators and two state representatives from each party will also serve on the the panel. State Department of Financial Institutions Secretary Kathy Blumenfeld will serve as chairwoman. The order directs the task force to study student loan debt and its causes, evaluate current policies, and provide recommendations on how the state can best address the problem and improve families and students’ financial situations.\n\nWyoming\n\nCasper: Preliminary numbers show a sharp increase in traffic deaths in the state in 2019. The 147 people killed on roads in 2019 was up by 36 compared with 2018 and the most since 2015. The reason for the increase isn’t clear. The Wyoming Department of Transportation hasn’t yet analyzed its numbers for 2019. One reason could be more deaths per wreck, department spokesman Jeff Goetz told the Casper Star-Tribune. Generally most crashes are attributable to driver distraction, alcohol or drug use, or driving too fast for conditions, Goetz said. Wyoming road deaths have largely declined since the early 2000s, when close to 200 people died on Wyoming roads annually.\n\nFrom USA TODAY Network and wire reports", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2020/01/31"}]}

But still a busy commercial district, the street is now poised to see several new restaurants and businesses set up shop.\n\nMost the new development is planned for the area between the Des Moines International Airport and the Wakonda Club.\n\nPanera Bread Co. is considering building a store at 4519 Fleur Drive, the site where Mezzodi’s restaurant was recently demolished. Developer Michael Coppola said he is still working to finalize a tenant for the site.\n\nsaid he is still working to finalize a tenant for the site. A hotel, possibly Courtyard by Marriott, is in the works on the east side of Fleur Drive, directly behind the Starbucks. Coppola said he has an agreement with a national hotel developer for the site and the specific hotel brand is still in the works.\n\nQuik Trip plans to build one of its new mega-stores on the southeast corner of Fleur and Watrous Avenue. The new 5,800-square-foot store would sit across the street from an existing Quik Trip, which the company likely would close.\n\nA Burger King is in the works at 4600 Fleur Drive. A fast food franchise firm called EYM Group recently demolished the beat up Star gas station at the site. A company official confirmed a Burger King will replace it.\n\nFareway Stores has announced plans to build a 30,000-square-foot grocery store in the Wakonda Shopping Center, next to Firestone Complete Autocare. The company said the store is expected to open by fall 2017.\n\nB-Bop’s recently opened a restaurant at 4500 Fleur Drive, replacing an old Long John Silver’s that had occupied the spot.\n\nJimmy John's opened a store at Fleur and Watrous last year.\n\nThe revitalization of Fleur hasn’t happened over night. It has taken years to convince national retailers to set up shop along the corridor, said Coppola, whose firm Raccoon River Investments developed the Hy-Vee, Walgreens, Starbucks and other properties in the area.\n\nNow, more are starting to see the potential thanks to Fleur’s high-traffic volumes and location near the airport.\n\n“It’s been a helluva a lot of work,” Coppola said.\n\nMore than a decade ago, the city invested in a $2 million project to add flower beds and planters to the median of Fleur Drive.\n\nBut other than the beautification project, the recent commercial growth along the corridor has happened naturally, without much prodding from the city, said assistant city Manager Matt Anderson.\n\n“The organic growth is awesome,” he said.\n\nAnderson praised Coppola’s work to bring commercial tenants to the corridor. The recent development “is the culmination of the investment made down there years ago when they built the Hy-Vee and brought in Starbucks,” he said.\n\nWhile the fast food spots and coffee shops have been applauded, they bring a markedly different flavor to corridor.\n\nLong-time Des Moines residents will remember Fleur Drive as the city’s posh dining destination. Before the suburbs boomed and before downtown’s recent resurgence, Fleur was the place to go for a nice meal.\n\n\"It used to be the hot area,\" Anderson said.\n\nJohnny & Kay’s was known for its steak de burgo. The Crystal Tree, a restaurant in the Holiday Inn Airport, was where high-schoolers took their prom dates. There was Riccelli’s Mainliner, Crimmins Cattle Co. and The Pier.\n\nToday, they're all closed.\n\nCoppola said he is still working to bring new tenants to the area.\n\n“I think you’ll see at least one higher-end restaurant in this corridor in the next couple years,” he said.\n\nAirport raises concerns about hotel\n\nWhile plans are moving forward for a new hotel along Fleur Drive, airport officials aren't thrilled about the idea.\n\nDes Moines airport executive director Kevin Foley said he opposes the project because it's near the flight path of a primary runway.\n\nThe hotel site is far enough from the runway that it can be built without the airport's approval, but the city of Des Moines has asked the airport for its opinion.\n\nCoppola said the site is already zoned for a hotel and he has no worries about noise or safety at the site. He lives on the south side and said the air traffic is no problem.\n\n\"Frankly, it's not a concern,\" he said.\n\nThe airport's protest of building within the flight path has, however, killed one other project. Two years ago, local apartment mogul Jim Conlin proposed building a $30 million senior housing complex on the site of the closed McKinley Elementary School directly behind the Fleur Drive Hy-Vee.\n\nThe airport had more leverage to stop that project because it owned an easement the property.\n\nBret Mills, president of Conlin Properties, said the senior housing proposal is dead and the company is considering other options for the site.\n\nBirthdays", "authors": [], "publish_date": "2016/07/21"}, {"url": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnists/dave-bangert/2018/07/08/bangert-tales-chauncey-hill-mall-hangout-blocks-purdue/759706002/", "title": "Bangert: Tales from Chauncey Hill Mall, a hangout for generations", "text": "WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. – Chauncey Hill Mall, with its first stores opened in December 1979 a few blocks from Purdue University, might never have been much to look at.\n\nIn recent years, one part-owner confessed to a crowd at a public hearing about West Lafayette and Purdue’s $120 million remake of State Street that she was a little embarrassed to crest the hill with friends and tell them that, “Yeah, I do own 50 percent of that.”\n\nAnd Chauncey Hill Mall, now approaching 40, is not exactly what city officials, ready to welcome a more urban downtown setting near campus and along a rebuilt State Street, have in mind, anymore. (“I am sure the mall had its heyday, but the amount of asphalt on that location is just unbearable,” said Nick DeBoer, a West Lafayette City Council member whose district takes in the three-acre strip mall.)\n\nThis week, a development team assembled by Trinitas Ventures – a Lafayette-based firm that has rights to the property – will hold five days of public sessions to help decide what will come next. Among the options already hinted by Trinitas: a hotel, housing, reconfigured retail and something that would be in line with the 10-plus-stories projects going up all around the property. Potential construction plans haven’t been announced, and 16 remaining businesses are still open.\n\nBangert:Race on to put hotel rooms along State Street near Purdue\n\nMore:What do you want to see at Chauncey Hill Mall, a near-Purdue landmark?\n\nBangert:Under high-rise pressure, WL landmarks stand firm\n\nBut post a simple question on social media – OK, so who hung out at Chauncey Hill Mall when hanging at Chauncey Hill Mall was a thing? – and you’re going to get a nostalgic feed that lasts until at least tomorrow.\n\nAbout a place filled with fast food and local icons – Arby’s and Taco Bell right down the way for years from the family-owned Parthenon, which moved to another part of town earlier this decade, and Utopia Diner, which had a 10-year run starting in the mid-‘90s. About bars that were favorites before Breakfast Club on football Saturday was a thing – Wabash Yacht Club, gone for nearly a decade after a 22-year run, and Quincey’s and the Stacks before it – and those are still drawing big crowds today. (Good morning, Jake’s Roadhouse. Hello, Where Else? Bar.) About the odd mix of clothing stores (Pants Explosion, Five Points Shoes), gift shops, hair stylists, sporting goods, cookie bakers (Toogie's Cookies for 18 years), arcades and one place built on a menu of fried rabbit – no really, fried rabbit. (RIP Hop Scotch, after six months and one state indictment for franchising violations.)\n\nAnd about a place that, no matter how it looked, served as a home base for certain generations of Purdue students coming to Discount Den for inexpensive sodas known as Den Pops and Greater Lafayette high school kids who crowded the tiny patio and tables outside whatever pizza place – Garcia’s Pizza in a Pan, Browny’s Pizza King, Roxy’s, Hot Box – was at the corner near State Street and considered themselves part of a “Chauncey rats” tradition.\n\nThese are some of their tales of Chauncey Hill Mall.\n\n► Chris Foresman graduated from Lafayette Jefferson High School in 1994 and is a software engineer and father of two in Chicago: “The place was like at the nexus of ley lines, attracting the disaffected youth as young as 13, as old as perhaps 21. There's a lot of my personal history mixed up with the Village and the ‘scene.’ The Venn diagram there is pretty intertwined. The benches and tables outside, were a meeting pace for punks, skaters, anarchists, philosophers, ne'er-do-wells, et al. … Skaters would meet up after school, so you would just go there about 4 o'clock, and kids from other schools would meet up before deciding where to skate.”\n\n► Nicole Finkler graduated from high school in 1996 and is a clinical informatics analyst at an academic medical center in Chicago: “I spent more time at Chauncey as a teenager than I did at home. Even worked at Garcia’s. Lived off 50-cent Den Pops and dollar rice from Eggroll Express. We would go to Utopia and order a cup of coffee and proceed to hang out for six hours. … ‘See you at Chauncey’ was uttered more times than I can count.”\n\n► Lauren Bruce, a Harrison High School graduate working at Purdue, lives in West Lafayette: “I hung out during the Utopia and Garcia’s days (in the late-‘90s), and later when Roxy’s was there for a minute. I told my teenager that pre-internet, pre-cell phones, we hung around at the mall drinking Discount Den sodas and eating dollar rice from Eggroll Express, waiting for friends to stop by to hang, and he said if you did that today you’d be a weirdo. Joke’s on him, we were weirdos then, too. … If you were lucky, you could call the pay phone outside of Garcia’s and actually reach someone.”\n\n► Benjamin Madrid grew up in Lafayette and works with the Helen Wells Agency in Indianapolis: “My parents called it 'Weird Harold Corner' which I believe is a (Bill) Cosby reference. Please quote me – or them – on that.”\n\n► Dave Mason owns ISPhotographic in downtown Lafayette: “The Village was the home of The Scene. If you can’t lay claim to a show, a fight, an arrest or an escapade with the opposite – or same – sex in The Village, then you can’t claim to be Lafayette Old School. Garcia’s, Amused, the Blue Café, the gum wall ... landmarks of our misspent youth. I had a spray-painted Buick Skylark known as The Road Warrior – maybe because that was emblazoned across the green trunk in red paint – at the time in the late-‘80s. I’d leave it in the Chauncey Hill Mall parking lot with the keys in the ignition. If an acquaintance were to spot it, the game was to hop in and drive a lap around the Village and return it back to the lot but in a different spot. So many good times.”\n\n► Tom Trent, a Lafayette native, lives in Bloomington: “When I was a senior at Jeff High School in 1981, the cool thing to do was drive over to the arcade, Pin Pan Alley. That was the heyday of quarter-a-game video games: Donkey Kong, Centipede, Asteroids, Defender, Frogger. It seems like you could find anyone you were looking for at that place. And then there was Garcia's Pizza. … There used to be a series of stairways and balconies in there, almost like an Escher print, with a few video games on the top level. When we were starving college students at Purdue, we might, on a dare, finish the pizza left by other patrons. … It seems like every kind of business gave it a try at Chauncey Hill, including a fast food restaurant that specialized in rabbit.”\n\n► Brice McCarty, a manager in the ‘90s at Jimmy John’s in the Chauncey Annex across State Street, is a paramedic for Tippecanoe Emergency Ambulance Service: “I used to ride my motorcycle on campus a lot. At the height of it, our group regularly had 50 to 100 motorcycles at night sitting on the lower lot of Chauncey Hill Mall. With that many people, you might expect that security would be an issue. Not the case at all. Purdue and West Lafayette police used to come over and admire the motorcycles and chat. And on a few occasions, we were even able to assist in the apprehension of a suspect by giving a good description, giving a detailed (sober) recollection of events, or physically detaining someone who was running from the police.”\n\n► Traci Schriever attended Purdue through the mid-‘90s and now lives in North Carolina: “Two of my closest friends and my boyfriend – now husband – had motorcycles. We’d meet up at Chauncey with all the other cool bike dudes and hang out in the parking lot until someone said, ‘Let’s do a lap.’ Then back to Chauncey until the next, ‘Let’s do a lap.’”\n\n► Tyrone Taylor lives in Dayton, where he is on the town council and is an Area Plan Commission member and will get a vote on any Chauncey Hill Mall property rezoning plan: “It was the ultimate hangout as young teenager. It was the meet-up spot for all the skateboarders around then for a few reasons. Around 1993 Purdue had banned skateboarding on campus and would issue you a $15 ticket and take your board. Chauncey wasn't considered Purdue campus, so the Purdue police could not ticket you there. It was almost like base. So everyone would meet up and about every few hours do what is called a campus run – where you pretty much tried to skate as many spots on campus until police were after you – then you would try to sneak back from campus without getting caught. Chauncey Hill Mall is where I met a lot of lifelong friends. It was a very cool scene in West Lafayette back then. … To this day, it is still the meet-up spot. Being on APC and seeing the future of the Village is bittersweet. We live in a different world now than in the ’90s, and it will never be the same, so I think it's great to build something new where future generations can build memories.”\n\n► Rebecca Gibson, a Realtor in Lafayette, graduated from Harrison High School in 2002 and from Purdue in 2011: “Back alley of Von’s (behind Chauncey Hill Mall) is where I came on to my husband and forced him to make out with me on the back of my car. A cop flashed his lights, and we walked to his apartment on Chauncey. The rest is history. Now we are married and have two kids. Memories.”\n\n► Jodi Taylor worked at Utopia Diner – she has the original sign – and is now operations manager for the Lafayette Symphony Orchestra: “I lived the Utopian lifestyle, first as a customer then several years behind the apron. Spent too much time sitting on the couch in Von's Comics getting a teenage intro to camp and schlock vids. From the endless hours in a booth at Utopia, I was guided to read ‘Big Sur,’ ‘Naked Lunch’ and ‘The Dancing Wu Li Masters.’ I learned how to doodle. I learned how to sit with my teenage angst. Developed a terrible coffee habit that lasts to this day. Smoked too many vanilla-flavored Sweetwaters. I met punks, goths, skaters, hippies, ravers – and even though I didn't fit into one of those categories, it was still my tribe. I wrote an ode to egg fried rice for my ska band. I made and lost friends and danced on the tables. I still hate making milkshakes.”\n\n► LaRonika Thomas, part of West Lafayette High School’s class of 1995, is a Ph.D. candidate in theater history and performance studies at University of Maryland and a visiting assistant professor in fine arts at Loyola University Maryland: “My parents were not thrilled that I hung out there – mostly at Utopia Diner or outside Garcia’s – or with some of my friends at the time, but for about 1992-95 it was just about the center of my world. Utopia was a whole world within Chauncey. My friend, Maya, and I hung out quite a bit at Utopia and would share a plate of fries down to the last one – which we would split and split in half until one of us caved and ate the last crumb. … You could go and get just a cup of coffee or some fries – or both – and occupy a booth for a very long time, which I know annoyed the owner and wait staff. It was warm in the winter and cool in the summer. The jukebox was pretty good. … There weren't many options for a kid like me in West Lafayette then. I had a curfew and didn't go to football games, and I didn't go to raves, and where else were we supposed to go in a college town with lots of bars and little to do for the underage set? I wasn't a bad kid and didn't have a bad life or home situation. I was just unsatisfied with where I was. … But in between the teenage fears and melodramas – as well as some more serious issues that kids should never have to deal with – there was a little spark of that bohemian life.”\n\n► Jamie Derringer, who worked at Garcia’s Pizza from 1997 to 2001, is a stay-at-home mom in Lafayette: “I worked at Garcia’s for a few years right up until they closed the doors. I still have my Garcia’s hat. Complete with “Phase” stains. (Phase was the scary yet delicious garlic butter that we served with the breadsticks.) Some of the weirdest and best people I’ve ever known used to hang out there.”\n\n► Michael Hicks is a lecture capture technician at Purdue and a music educator: “I got the Muzak tapes – Steely Dan, Tom Petty, current and classic rock mostly – from the general manager of Garcia’s Pizza when it closed (in 2001) and made a four-CD set of the song list we used to hang out and listen to all day, every day, there.”\n\n► Gwyne Bahler, a Harrison and Purdue grad, is an artist living in Indianapolis: “All the cool kids hung out at Chauncey in high school. Not that I was. As a kid who grew up in white, rural indiana, it was kind of my first introduction to any semblance of culture. What made it cool was that there were all of these ethnic restaurants and, around the corner, Von’s Books and global groceries and stuff that wasn't just white people stuff. … I used to go to the old Parthenon with one of my best friends, Liz, when we were in high school. Her family was Greek, and they approved of it thoroughly. It was \"our place.\" The owner would always give us extra spinach rice, because we loved it so much. It always had a kind of grungy vibe – never dirty, but it really felt like a family restaurant. … I went to the new one once after it moved to another part of town, but never went back. It felt too sterile and lost its character it had at Chauncey Hill. It's sad, because I feel that's going to happen to pretty much everything on campus. They might as well just open an Au Bon Pain and get it over with.”\n\n► Jay McDowell, a West Lafayette native who played standup bass in Nashville’s BR5-49, is multimedia curator at the Musicians Hall of Fame & Museum in Nashville: “From 1988-1992, I lived on South Salisbury and spent a whole lot of time at Chauncey Hill. My friends spent more time and money on video games at Pizza Keg and Pin Pan Alley. I spent my hard-earned cash on records from Von’s and Discount Den. The jukebox at Garcia’s got a lot of my coin, as well. I didn’t really skateboard, but my friends did. I have a lot of good memories of them skating on that little patch of concrete just outside of Garcia’s. The concerts that Von’s put on in their parking lots were a blast. East of Eden, Twopenny Hangover, Slaughterhouse Five, Rattail Grenadier, Gadfly, The Shindigs, The Young Lords, Meet John Doe, Wiggly Worm, The Icemakers of the Revolution. Now that I’m thinking back to that time, it’s the people I remember. There were so many characters that regularly frequented those restaurants and shops. That was the center of my musical universe. We’d find out the address of the house party that was gonna happen that night. It was quite a time.”\n\n► Mass Giorgini, owner of Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette, was bass player in punk bands Rattail Grenadier and Squirtgun, which he figures played more than 50 shows in and around the Village in the ‘80s and ‘90s: “From my very first visits to punk shows on campus, the after-show ritual for concertgoers was to migrate to the Chauncey Hill strip mall area in general, and Garcia’s Pizza in specific. It didn’t matter whether the shows were during the ‘83-and-earlier Stewart Center 3rd Floor-era, the infinitely cooler ‘84-85 period of the Freakshow Bungalow – a converted garage a block south of the Village on Chauncey – or the much more regularly scheduled, national-level punk times of Spud Zero from ‘87-’88. In all of these generations of the Lafayette alternative music scene, Chauncey Hill was the before- and after-show mecca for area scenesters. There was no internet, so to find out when and where shows were happening, you had to go to Chauncey Hill to look at the fliers on bulletin boards, telephone poles or kiosks.”\n\n► Evan Finch, who lives in Indianapolis, attended Purdue University from 1983 to 1987 and graduated with a degree in communications, which he parlayed into an advertising career: “My memories of Chauncey Hill Mall center around my two main interests: stuffing my face and buying records. At one end stood Garcia's Pizza, home of the aptly-named Gutbuster and buckets of cheap beer. The other end was anchored by The Parthenon, where my college friend Gayle Argoudelis introduced me to Greek food, patiently helping me learn my pastitsio from my mousaka. Midway between, inside the lonely corner ‘mini-mall,’ crouched P.J.'s Woofers – an oddly-named and clearly doomed hot dog stand that struggled along gamely for a few months in 1985. And of course, there was the perennial Discount Den: a surprisingly hip record shop disguised as a convenience store. Even after 33 years, I'm still kicking myself for not buying their cassette of The Replacements' ‘When the Sh-- Hits the Fans.’”\n\n► Noah Mattern, a Harrison graduate, owns Maximumedia in Lafayette: “On weekends (in the early-‘90s), my high school friends and I would camp out at each others houses and play music, skate and wreak havoc around the hood before heading up the hill to Chauncey. There was a period in the late-‘80s when there was a show every weekend – behind Von's, Morton Center, the Wesley Foundation and numerous house parties in the campus area. We would spend the time before and after shows skating and hanging with the crew, shopping Von's Books and Records. Being young and impressionable, we were completely infatuated with the groups that would pop up to play: TFH, Rattail Grenadier, Life Sentence, Scourgin’ Zombies, Young Lords and Gadfly among them. These were our heroes growing up. … Chauncey functioned as a hub to the local groups and gangs as a source of intel and amusement: to find out where the parties were at, to people watch, to chill. The place played host to plenty of memorable stories, some of which I can even share.”\n\n► Nathan Sheets teaches science and coaches football and girls basketball at Lafayette Jeff: “I got a cigar on my 18th birthday one summer because I could. Walked Chauncey Hill Mall that night with it trying to look boss. Girls weren't buying it. Didn't like smoking. Started Purdue that fall. Got a Coke at Discount Den after morning classes every day. Found that actually was cooler.”\n\n► Tim Brouk came to Lafayette straight out of college in Missouri for a job at the Journal & Courier as an arts reporter in early 2000: “Flash forward about a year and along came Dance Party Revolution, the brainchild of Travis Beaver and his then-wife, Kara, along with a couple of others. It was a guerrilla dance party that would occur at the Chauncey Hill Mall in 2001 until about 2003. With a boombox and extension cord, they would blare modern and old-school dance music. Most were either not 21 yet or straight edge, but a few would pop into Jake's for a drink or two. But it was a response to how little there was to do in early 2000s West Lafayette. Travis and company took it upon themselves to create their own party, open to any and all. … It was a daring and fun thing to do outside on a weekend night. Without DPR, who knows if I'd still be in Indiana. It was the first thing that hooked me, and I saw how brilliant and creative folks can be in West Lafayette. Tons of great memories from those dance parties.”\n\n► Chandra DiRosario graduated from Lafayette Jeff in 2002 and lives in Lafayette, a franchise operations consultant with Burger King and teaches group fitness classes at the YMCA: “Being born and raised in Lafayette, Chauncey Hill had a certain reverence as ‘the place to be,’ especially once we were old enough to drive – circa 1999. The cups of coffee at Utopia never seemed to run empty, morning or night, and plates of ranch fries were best eaten with good company. Dance Party Revolution became the highlight of each weekend, growing from a handful of dancin’ fools with a boom box on the sidewalk to an almost cult-like phenomenon. And even though we felt like we were entrenched in the middle of the action, the longer we lingered the more we realized we’d only experienced a small piece of a decades-long legacy. Hanging out at Chauncey Hill as a townie was, in many ways, a rite of passage.”\n\nFOR MORE: Want to read more Tales from Chauncey Hill Mall? Want to share yours?

Coincidentally, the tournament also is celebrating its 40th anniversary season.\n\nThe mid-1970s — when these ambitious ventures were launched — proved to be a pivotal time in the world of professional tennis. It was during these barnstorming years when pioneers like King worked fiercely and tirelessly to create a solid foundation for the game — the colorful, powerful, fast-paced variety we enjoy today.\n\nThe anniversary event, held in the gorgeously-appointed hospitality tent located near Stadium 1, drew a large crowd of former and current WTT players.\n\nHuge photo banners of players through the years hung on the walls of the venue. Old WTT uniforms, some created by world famous designer Ted Tinling, were on display near a beautiful white sheet cake emblazoned with the Mylan World TeamTennis logo.\n\nIn October 2012, Mylan, a generics and specialty pharmaceutical company, signed a three-year agreement with World TeamTennis to serve as title sponsor of WTT.\n\nWorld TeamTennis, a groundbreaking co-ed professional league launched in 1974, featured quirky, multicolored tennis courts that added some pop to a sport that could sometimes be considered staid — think all-white tennis outfits — back in the day.\n\nLooking back, WTT was a trendsetter, as you now see blue surfaces. used for major tournaments. The BNP Paribas Open takes it a step further with purple courts.\n\nWTT Commissioner Ilana Kloss kicked off Monday's program with a video of WTT highlights throughout the years.\n\nTennis commentator Mary Carillo — witty, insightful and always quick with a playful, verbal jab — moderated a panel discussion between King and former professional and WTT players Chris Evert, Roy Emerson, Lindsay Davenport and Andy Roddick.\n\nIn an intimate setting — panelists lounging comfortably on orange suede coaches — the group talked about the history of the league and how the experience of playing on competitive co-ed professional teams made an impact on their careers.\n\nThe group sat in front of a backdrop featuring the Mylan WTT logo and the league's motto: Game Changers and Ground Breakers.\n\n\"I played a couple of seasons of World TeamTennis before I ever played Davis Cup matches,\" Roddick said. \"It was a great experience for me as far as learning how to work inside the framework of a team.\"\n\nLarry King, Billie Jean King's former husband who helped launch World TeamTennis, talked to The Desert Sun about the sport's early popularity.\n\n\"When World TeamTennis started in the 1974 season, the first five seasons we had five million spectators,\" he said. \"It was the biggest exhibition of tennis in the United States, with our 20 teams playing. In ' 74, '75 and '76, World TeamTennis players won all of the Wimbledon and Forest Hills (U.S. Open) events.\n\n\"They say it's a development tool because it sharpened the players' tools for the tournaments. But it was a great event for the spectators, too.\"\n\nBillie Jean King, Evert, Emerson, Rosie Casals and Jimmy Connors were among the first players to compete in the inaugural year.\n\nKing played for the Philadelphia Freedoms in 1974, and she was the inspiration behind Elton John's \"Philadelphia Freedom,\" which became the team's theme song. She also was named the league's first MVP.\n\nAs the coach of the Philadelphia Freedoms, Billie Jean King became the first female coach of a sports team featuring male athletes.\n\nSwitching teams, in 1975, King led the New York Sets to the first of her league championships in 1976, the year Martina Navratilova made her debut in WTT, joining the Cleveland Nets.\n\nEvert became the first WTT player to win back-to-back MVP awards, taking home the honors in 1977 and '78.\n\nAfter a short hiatus, the league retooled itself for a comeback in 1981.\n\nIn 1982, I got my first real taste of World TeamTennis when I attended a Los Angeles Strings match at the Forum.\n\nIt's also where I first met the tennis legend herself.\n\nDuring a break in the action, I joined small a crowd courtside where King was kind enough to autograph her book, \"Billie Jean,\" for this wide-eyed tennis fan.\n\nKing has been a dynamic force in tennis since the early 1960s. She's won 39 Grand Slam titles, but her contributions to the game — and to society — extend far beyond the court.\n\nWithin a two-year span alone, from 1973 to 1974, King beat Bobby Riggs in the Battle of the Sexes — a monumental moment that forever changed the landscape of women's sports and empowered female athletes — and founded the Women's Tennis Association, Women's Sports Foundation and Women's Sports Magazine.\n\nShe was recently included in CNN's list of seven women \"who changed the world,\" along with the likes of Harriet Beecher Stowe (author and anti-slavery campaigner), Jewish schoolgirl Anne Frank (whose diary recalled her life under German occupation) and Emmeline Pankhurst (led women's right to vote movement).\n\nThe champion of women's sports and equality for all enthusiastically shared her appreciation for Monday's celebration.\n\n\"I'm so excited because we're bringing so many people together from different generations — we're not only bringing players, but we're bringing owners, staff, people who worked through the years,\" King said.\n\n\"I'm very thankful and blessed that we're 40 years old and that these people are showing up tonight to celebrate.\"\n\nDenise Goolsby is The Desert Sun's columnist for history and profiles.

The Class of 2023’s enshrinement increases the number of inductees to 157 along with seven teams. A plaque on the wall outside the first-base side of the pressbox at Frawley Stadium lists all the inductees.\n\nThe seven 2023 inductees:\n\nMatt Brainard\n\nBrainard starred in football, wrestling and baseball at William Penn, where he set a school stolen base mark and sparked the Colonials to the 1989 state title game. Brainard was then a four-year starter and three-time NAIA All-American at Wilmington University, which reached the 1992 NAIA World Series and won three conference and regional titles. Brainard played two minor-league seasons in the Phillies organization before becoming a coach. He became Wilmington coach at age 23 and guided the Wildcats for 10 seasons through 2004, winning 350 games, seven conference or section titles, three regional championships and making the 1995 NAIA World Series. He was seven-time conference and three-time regional Coach of the Year. Brainard then moved to West Chester for two years, steering the Golden Rams to two Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference East titles and the 2006 NCAA East Region championship, resulting in West Chester’s first Division II World Series berth.\n\nBill Brakeley\n\nThe hard-throwing lefty from Connecticut was first-team All-State his final two years at St. Andrew’s School in 1985 and 1986 while setting school records for career wins (20), career strikeouts (287) and strikeouts in a game (18, twice). He started and won two games, including the championship, for Delaware in the inaugural Carpenter Cup at Veterans Stadium. Brakeley then starred at the University of Delaware in 1988 and 1989, setting a school record with 12.8 strikeouts per nine innings. He was a fourth-round draft choice of the Milwaukee Brewers and played three minor-league seasons.\n\nRob Bryson\n\nBryson was a first-team All-State pitcher his junior and senior years, 2005 and 2006, at William Penn. A four-year starter who also played shortstop, Bryson batted .322 and went 22-8 with a 1.27 earned run average and 269 strikeouts in 198 innings in his career. He was a Collegiate Baseball/Louisville Slugger first-team All-American as a senior when he batted .390 and went 9-2 with a 1.01 ERA and 117 strikeouts in 69 innings. Bryson attended Seminole State Community College in Florida before pitching nine professional seasons in which he struck out 525 in 434 innings and reached as high as Triple-A in the Cleveland system.\n\nBrian Lesher\n\nLesher starred in basketball and baseball at Newark, where he was the first-team All-State first baseman as a senior in 1989, before going to the University of Delaware. Lesher was a two-time first-team all-conference pick with the Blue Hens as an outfielder/first baseman and a three-year starter from 1990-92, including the 1992 NCAA Tournament qualifiers. He batted .381, .380 and .376 those three seasons. Lesher was a 25th-round pick in the 1992 draft by Oakland and batted .283 in 12 minor-league seasons. He also had 288 big-league plate appearances in 108 games with Oakland, Seattle and Toronto (2002) and smacked nine homers.\n\nJohnny Morris\n\nMorris starred in football, basketball and baseball at the old Lewes High from 1958-60 The lefty’s baseball exploits included 20 wins, 351 strikeouts and three no-hitters. He also batted .588 with six home runs as a senior and was signed by the Phillies. Morris reached the big leagues in 1966 with Philadelphia and ended up pitching in 132 games over eight seasons and going 11-7 with a 3.95 ERA for the Phillies, Orioles, Seattle Pilots, Brewers and Giants.\n\nMark Romanczuk\n\nOne of Delaware’s most dominant high school pitchers, Romanczuk was second-team All-State as a St. Mark’s sophomore in 2000 and a first-team choice the next two years. He twice struck out 18 in a game, set school records for strikeouts in a season (146) and career (315) and had a career ERA of 0.77. His four no-hitters included a perfect game in which he whiffed 17. Romanczuk was drafted in the fifth round pick by Tampa Bay but elected to attend Stanford. He was Collegiate Baseball Freshman of the Year in 2003 after going 12-2 with a 4.01 ERA and 80 strikeouts in 112 innings as Stanford reached the College World Series title game. Romanczuk was a third-team All-American going 11-3 with a 4.31 ERA and 94 strikeouts in 109 innings as a sophomore. He was drafted in the fourth round by Arizona in 2005 and pitched four pro seasons.\n\nMark Rubini\n\nRubini was a speedy, hard-hitting outfielder who starred at William Penn and the University of Delaware. He was first-team All-State as a Colonials senior in 1983, when he batted .455, drove in 15 runs and stole nine bases. His career batting average was .451. Rubini was equally troublesome for opposing pitchers at Delaware from 1984-87, when he was a three-time All-East Coast Conference pick. He graduated first on the UD career chart in stolen bases (88), sixth in home runs (35), 10th in runs scored (196) and 15th with a .370 batting average. He batted a team-leading .423 as a sophomore and .421 as a junior. Rubini was a 35th-round draft pick after his junior year by Milwaukee but never played professionally.\n\nHave an idea for a compelling local sports story or is there an issue that needs public scrutiny?

He played in 729 games over eight seasons with the Rangers, Brewers, Blue Jays and Nationals, batting .268 with 89 home runs. In 2006 with the Rangers, Mench set a major-league record for right-handed batters by homering in seven straight games.\n\nEaton was a baseball standout at Dickinson while playing youth hockey. He then starred at Notre Dame. A defenseman, he reached the NHL with the Flyers in 1999-2000. He played his next five seasons with Nashville, then four with Pittsburgh and two with the New York Islanders before closing his career back with the Penguins. Eaton scored four playoff goals in the Penguins’ 2009 Stanley Cup run. He had 24 goals in 650 career NHL regular-season games.\n\nSimpson coached Newark to 284 victories, second in Delaware history, over 39 seasons through 2015. That included nine Division I state titles.\n\nBehr guided Tower Hill boys track teams to a 160-28-2 dual-meet record from 1962-81, highlighted by the 1964 New Castle County team championship and 1965, 1968 and 1974 state Division II titles. His athletes set eight state records, including the only still-standing mark – John Carroll’s 6-11¼ in the high jump from 1981. Behr was also instrumental in initiating female competition as coach of the Delaware Track and Field Club, which won seven Mid-Atlantic titles.\n\nMills Caldwell, who is now girls basketball coach at Caravel, was Delaware’s first schoolgirl to surpass 2,000 career points, finishing with 2,131. She then played at the University of Delaware. Caldwell also pitched for Caravel’s baseball team and later for the U.S. national squad in three Women’s Baseball World Cups.\n\nCoveleski coached Caesar Rodney’s lacrosse, football and baseball teams. His lacrosse teams went 186-45 and won three state championships.

Cape Henlopen High grad Diaz Nardo, Delaware’s starting third baseman, had one of those hits.\n\nWilmington Charter grad Kyle Baker joined Scott and Nardo in the starting lineup in the second game of the twinbill, though Baker later left with an injury in the Hens’ 11-1 win. Scott extended his hitting streak to 17 games and raised his average to .351 with three more hits.\n\nDelaware (27-20, 12-8) clinched a CAA Tournament berth with the sweep and will close the series against Towson (19-31, 5-15) with a single-game Sunday.\n\n“I just loved coming in knowing I played against this guy, and now we get to play together,” Spadafino said of his in-state comrades. “They did well against me and it’s nice to have them on my side.”\n\nSpadafino was recruited by the likes of South Florida and Western Carolina.\n\n“One thing that was big for me was my family getting to see me play,” said Spadafino, referring to mom Janice, a UD grad, and dad Joe, a former Eastern Kentucky football standout who is Newark’s parks and recreation director.\n\n“I know this program is trying to take that next step to be one of the top-tier teams in the CAA. You can just look at this beautiful stadium [with its all-turf field] and see the money they’ve put into it . . . The guys from Delaware who were here when I was being recruited told me they loved playing close to home and that’s what sold me and I’ve loved every minute.”\n\nOne of those players was Chad Kuhl, the Middletown High grad now in the Pittsburgh Pirates rotation. Kuhl is among many ex-Blue Hen standouts with First State roots, such as former Phillies pitcher and manager Dallas Green (Conrad) and Kevin Mench (St. Mark’s), the eight-year major-leaguer who’ll be inducted to the Delaware Sports Hall of Fame on Tuesday. Other Hens from Delaware high schools who reached the big leagues were Wilmington High’s Al Neiger, William Penn’s Cliff Brumbaugh and Newark’s Brian Lesher, while numerous others had minor-league success.\n\nDelaware coach Jim Sherman, a standout third baseman with the Blue Hens from 1979-82 who reached Triple-A in the Houston Astros’ system, is a William Penn grad. Bob Hannah, Blue Hen coach from 1965-2000, said while watching Friday’s games that recruiting Delaware players became a necessity because of economics – Delaware didn’t offer scholarships and expenses were considerably lower for in-state students – and the state had some talent.\n\n“We want every Delaware kid,” Sherman said, “that, one, has the talent level to play at this level and, two, which is most difficult, can get into Delaware academically . . . I take pride in it, being a Delaware kid myself. We can find some really good kids here in Delaware and because we’re a small state we can maybe see them more.”\n\nSpadafino is 5-3 with a 5.02 ERA on the season. He moved into the No. 1 starting spot after Brandon Walter, the sophomore out of Hodgson Vo-Tech, came up with elbow trouble that has ended his season. It’s not known yet if surgery will be needed. Ron Marinaccio, last year’s No. 1 starter who had gone into the bullpen this season, has returned to the starting rotation and won the second game Friday, allowing two hits in seven innings.\n\n“It’s obviously a big loss when you lose an arm like that, especially him being a Friday guy,” Spadafino said of Walter. “I just tried to keep the same mindset. You’re going against the same team whether it’s Friday or Saturday. But the pressure does pick up a little bit because you kind of want to get off to a good start for the weekend, especially knowing you only have to win one more to win the series.”\n\nRelying on a two-seam sinker, slider and change-up, Spadafino depends on control rather than knee-buckling velocity.\n\n“That’s how he’s gotta throw,” said Sherman, who liked how Spadafino “gutted it out” on Friday.\n\nLast season, Spadafino had gone 5-3 with a 7.01 ERA while being used in every possible role, as a starter, closer and long reliever. Coaches told him he’d be given a shot to start this year, and pitching last summer in the Coastal Plains Summer League for the Petersburg Generals provided adequate preparation.\n\n“I think that experience last season really helped me,” Spadafino said. “Coach Sherm told me when you go to summer ball, just work on what you’re gonna do to start. That allowed me to work getting in the strike zone more, developing my changeup and my slider. It really gave me the confidence they were gonna believe in me.”\n\nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com.
